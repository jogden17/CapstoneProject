Nearly half of dementia cases could be avoided or delayed by tackling 14 risk factors.,"

A recent report by the 2024 Lancet Commission has identified vision loss and high cholesterol as new risk factors for dementia, adding to 12 previously known risk factors. The report estimates that global health and social costs related to dementia are expected to triple by 2050, rising from 57 million in 2019 to 153 million. In some high-income countries, including the USA and UK, the proportion of older people with dementia has fallen, particularly in socio-economically advantaged areas.

The report provides 13 recommendations targeting both individuals and governments to mitigate the risk of dementia. These include managing hearing and vision loss, maintaining cognitive and social activity, and managing vascular risks like cholesterol and diabetes. Research suggests that implementing these measures could save billions of dollars by addressing risk factors such as excessive alcohol consumption, brain injuries, air pollution, smoking, obesity, and hypertension. According to the study, nearly half of dementias could be prevented by eliminating 14 risk factors, including high blood pressure, smoking, and social isolation.","['https://www.everydayhealth.com/dementia/vision-loss-high-cholesterol-join-list-of-preventable-dementia-risk-factors/', 'https://www.wxow.com/news/health/nearly-half-of-dementia-cases-could-be-avoided-or-delayed-by-tackling-14-risk-factors/article_ac527c7e-6e9d-5bd2-a3cc-1b2ed3d645f7.html', 'https://www.msn.com/en-ie/health/other/the-14-factors-that-may-delay-or-prevent-nearly-half-of-dementia-cases/ar-BB1qYMwL?ocid', 'https://scitechdaily.com/new-strategies-to-combat-dementia-14-risk-factors-you-can-control/', 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com/many-dementia-cases-could-prevented-021812192.html', 'https://finchannel.com/uk-bolsters-support-to-british-nationals-in-lebanon-as-foreign-secretary-says-leave-now/122067/world-2/2024/08/', 'https://www.gilmorehealth.com/study-reveals-how-both-lack-of-sleep-and-oversleeping-can-increase-your-risk-of-cardiovascular-diseases/']"
F.D.A. Approves Blood Test for Colon Cancer Detection.,"The FDA has approved a new blood test for primary colorectal cancer screening, Guardant Health's Shield blood test. The test is as accurate as the commonly used stool-based test, FIT, but less accurate than colonoscopy or Cologuard. Doctors believe this test can reduce the number of colonoscopies and increase screening rates, potentially preventing over 90 percent of colon cancer-related deaths. Currently, only around 60 percent of eligible people attend recommended colon cancer screenings.

A recent study found that aspirin can lower the risk of colon cancer for adults with unhealthy lifestyles. The study followed participants for over three decades and found the greatest benefits for heavy smokers and people with a BMI of 25 or greater. Meanwhile, the American Red Cross is experiencing an emergency blood shortage and is offering a $20 Amazon gift card to anyone who donates blood by August 31. According to the Red Cross, only 3% of age-eligible people donate blood every year.","['https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/new-colorectal-cancer-blood-test-approved-by-fda-what-to-know', 'https://fcfreepresspa.com/fda-approves-first-blood-test-for-colon-cancer-screening/', 'https://www.news9.com/story/66aaf85c19d3db6628b61dd7/fda-approves-first-blood-test-for-colon-cancer-detection', 'https://www.progress.org.uk/fda-approves-cell-free-dna-test-for-colon-cancer/', 'https://www.telegraphherald.com/news/features/article_68985406-e3a8-5d1b-9dbf-58b67d4fae70.html', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/other/fda-approves-first-blood-test-screening-for-colon-cancer/ar-BB1qZpHF?ocid', 'https://www.progress.org.uk/natural-insemination-sperm-donor-named-parent-on-birth-certificate/', 'https://www.wglt.org/local-news/2024-08-05/bloomington-doctor-colon-cancer-blood-test-will-be-a-paradigm-shift', 'https://www.healthline.com/health-news/aspirin-use-may-lower-colon-cancer-risk', 'https://www.foxnews.com/health/17-cancer-types-more-common-gen-x-millennials-study-finds-alarming-trend', 'http://www.msn.com/en-us/health/other/new-blood-test-available-for-colon-cancer-screening/ar-BB1qYVTs?ocid', 'https://www.enidlive.com/health/red-cross-declares-emergency-blood-shortage-after-national-inventory-falls-by-25-in-july']"
World Health Organization reveals 30 pathogens most likely to trigger next pandemic.,"

A list of priority pathogens with the potential to cause a global health emergency has been released by the UN Health Agency. The list, compiled by 200 scientists from over 50 countries, includes diseases such as H5N1 bird flu, Hantavirus, West Nile Virus, flu, and Covid. Also included are five new bacterial strains responsible for diseases like cholera, plague, dysentery, diarrhea, and pneumonia. The list was updated due to factors such as climate change, deforestation, and increased international travel, which have created more opportunities for diseases to spread from animals to humans and between different parts of the world.

The list highlights diseases that have no vaccines or treatments available, and those that are carried by ticks, bats, mosquitoes, rodents, or humans. The UN Health Agency has expressed concerns that climate change could fuel an outbreak by allowing diseases to spread into new areas. The list aims to raise awareness and promote preparedness for potential global health emergencies.","['https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-13710267/who-updates-pandemic-causing-viruses-bacteria-pathogens-list.html', 'https://www.msn.com/en-au/health/other/world-health-organization-updates-its-pandemic-risk-list/ar-AA1ogZqo', 'https://newsinamerica.com/en/sport/2024/djokovic-beats-alcaraz-paris-olympics-2024-tennis-final-as-it-happened/', 'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/who-updates-list-of-pathogens-that-could-start-another-pandemic/articleshow/112278210.cms', 'https://newsinamerica.com/en/sport/2024/guatemala-wins-first-olympic-gold-in-trap-shooting/', 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13710117/kamala-harris-running-mate-vp-pick-cryptic-message.html']"
