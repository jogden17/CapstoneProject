Fossil discovery in Greenland ice sheet reveals increased risk of sea level rise.,"Scientists have found evidence that the Greenland ice sheet has melted before, and as the climate warms, it is likely to melt again. A new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences examined sediment from an ice core extracted from the center of the ice sheet nearly 30 years ago. The researchers found fossils of an insect eye, an Arctic poppy seed, and other plant material under the ice, which they say provide ""direct confirmation"" that 90% of the Greenland ice sheet was once gone.

The study's findings suggest that the Greenland ice sheet is fragile and that its melting could have significant consequences. According to scientist Paul Bierman, the melting of the Greenland ice mass is currently the number one driver of sea level rise. If the entire ice sheet were to melt, hundreds of millions of people could lose their homes and businesses. Bierman notes that the consequences of such an event would be dire, with many coastal areas being lost to rising sea levels.","['https://www.cbsnews.com/news/greenland-ice-sheet-fossils-sea-level-rise/', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/weather/topstories/fossil-found-in-greenland-ice-sheet-reveals-increased-risk-of-sea-level-rise/ar-AA1ohCiN', 'https://www.mcduffieprogress.com/news/national/greenland-fossils-reveal-greater-sea-level-threat-from-climate-change/article_d1b3b5ae-5323-5e0a-a26f-2f88749a438e.html', 'https://www.khq.com/national/greenland-fossils-reveal-greater-sea-level-threat-from-climate-change/article_1ab1cc21-0279-5548-a66d-47dd56297461.html', 'https://www.eurekalert.org/multimedia/1036621']"
Perseid meteor shower 2024 peaks this weekend.,"The Perseid meteor shower is expected to reach its peak during the overnight hours of late Sunday night into early Monday morning, August 11-12. With a nearly new moon, the late-night sky will be dark, ideal for viewing shooting stars. The shower's radiant point is located between the Perseus constellation and the 'W' of Cassiopeia, and meteors can be seen flashing across all parts of the sky at a rate of about one every minute or two.

The best time to observe the Perseids will be after 1 am local time on Monday, August 12, when the most shooting stars are expected to be seen. During the peak, observers can typically see 50 to 75 meteors every hour, or roughly one meteor per minute. The Perseid meteor shower runs from July 14 to September 1, with its peak hitting on the weekend of August 11-12.","['https://www.space.com/perseid-meteor-shower-2024-peak', 'https://www.livescience.com/space/meteoroids/the-perseid-meteor-shower-is-about-to-peak-heres-when-to-see-the-most-shooting-stars', 'https://www.lonestarlive.com/news/2024/08/perseid-meteor-shower-2024-peak-when-is-it-and-how-to-get-the-best-view.html', 'https://www.space.com/venus-earthshine-perseid-meteor-shower-peak-night-sky-this-week', 'https://www.independent.co.uk/space/meteor-shower-uk-2024-perseid-full-moon-b2591147.html', 'https://1440wrok.com/illinois-sees-the-perseid-meteor-showers-this-weekend/', 'https://kawarthanow.com/2024/08/05/this-years-perseid-meteor-shower-peaks-on-august-11-and-12/', 'https://avltoday.6amcity.com/culture/perseid-meteor-shower-peak-2024', 'https://www.mlive.com/life/2024/08/join-fellow-stargazers-for-meteors-and-smores-at-free-beachside-astronomy-event.html', 'https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/aug/05/starwatch-perseids-to-peak-in-dazzling-shower-mid-month', 'https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/us/meteor-shower-know-when-and-how-to-see-the-perseids-at-their-best/articleshow/112296598.cms', 'https://www.lehighvalleylive.com/outdoors/2024/08/perseid-meteor-shower-of-2024-to-light-up-the-night-sky-when-to-see-it.html?outputType', 'https://denvergazette.com/outtherecolorado/news/up-to-100-meteors-an-hour-to-fly-above-colorado-as-best-show-of-year/article_7d949dac-5346-11ef-bcab-6b84b9ddb98f.html', 'https://www.inkl.com/news/want-to-watch-the-perseids-meteor-shower-this-week-these-are-the-most-spectacular-dark-sky-places-to-view-it-from', 'https://www.sanmarcosrecord.com/features/annual-perseid-meteor-shower-takes-skies-august-10-12', 'https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/other/meteor-shower-know-when-and-how-to-see-the-perseids-at-their-best/ar-AA1ogXEX?ocid']"
Scientists want to safeguard Earthâ€™s species by cryogenically preserving them on the planet.,"Scientists at the Smithsonian have proposed a plan to create a cryogenic biorepository on the moon to safeguard Earth's species. The plan utilizes craters that are permanently in shadow, providing a naturally cold environment that would allow for cryogenic preservation of biological material without the need for electricity or liquid nitrogen. This concept is inspired by the Global Seed Vault in Svalbard, Norway, which stores over a million seed varieties.

The proposal aims to provide a parallel approach to conserving Earth's biodiversity, with researchers acknowledging that further study is needed to understand the effects of radiation exposure and microgravity on cryopreserved samples. While some experts, like Sally Keith, a senior lecturer in Marine Biology at Lancaster University, question the practicality of the plan in addressing urgent biodiversity loss, others see it as an innovative idea that could lead to new technological developments.","['https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/05/science/cryogenic-repository-moon-scli-intl/index.html', 'https://fremonttribune.com/news/nation-world/science/these-scientists-want-to-safeguard-earth-s-species-by-cryogenically-preserving-them-on-the-moon/image_4eef3a0f-4c35-562d-8118-2fc7690c26ec.html', 'https://mtstandard.com/these-scientists-want-to-safeguard-earth-s-species-by-cryogenically-preserving-them-on-the-moon/image_b74abc97-a906-5d50-82e9-9b2278842f18.html', 'https://wcfcourier.com/these-scientists-want-to-safeguard-earth-s-species-by-cryogenically-preserving-them-on-the-moon/image_e69bd5bf-cdd9-59b8-ae04-cea60e522cad.html', 'https://herald-review.com/news/nation-world/science/these-scientists-want-to-safeguard-earth-s-species-by-cryogenically-preserving-them-on-the-moon/image_7758e398-6e66-5fb1-ad6c-7d43167e412b.html', 'https://mtstandard.com/these-scientists-want-to-safeguard-earth-s-species-by-cryogenically-preserving-them-on-the-moon/image_70f7f55e-6c7b-52c2-916d-25321ce01157.html', 'https://herald-review.com/news/nation-world/science/these-scientists-want-to-safeguard-earth-s-species-by-cryogenically-preserving-them-on-the-moon/image_1d9e964e-8407-5e21-8696-248d19b1de28.html']"
NASA made a World-Shaking Discovery: Compelling Evidence of Past Life on Mars.,"NASA's Perseverance rover has made a significant discovery on Mars, uncovering potential signs of ancient life on the planet. The rover's exploration has led to the detection of organic compounds, which are the building blocks of life as we know it. The discovery has sparked renewed interest in the planet's history and has provided critical clues about past life forms and climatic conditions.

The geological chemistry of a rock formation known as Cheyava Falls is of particular interest, featuring vertical veins of calcium sulfate that likely formed from past water. The rock also contains red bands with ""leopard spots"" that indicate chemical reactions that could have supplied energy to ancient microbial life. The discovery was made quickly, with the lead author, Paul Bierman, stating that ""we saw the fossils within the first hour, maybe half hour, of working on it"".","['https://www.yahoo.com/news/nasa-made-world-shaking-discovery-120000819.html', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/elon-musk-s-platform-x-halts-white-dudes-for-harris-fundraising-account-after-it-raises-4-million/ss-AA1ofGeA', 'https://evrimagaci.org/tpg/nasa-discovers-potential-signs-of-life-on-mars-6296', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nfl/ranking-the-top-10-wide-receivers-for-the-2024-nfl-season/ss-AA1ogS8E', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/movies/other/oscar-winning-drama-with-near-perfect-rotten-tomatoes-score-joins-netflix/ss-AA1ofMjJ', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/see-inside-the-first-private-jet-version-of-the-boeing-737-max-the-extravagant-plane-is-worth-over-100-million-and-has-a-bar-two-bedrooms-and-huge-showers/ss-AA1ocUbY', 'https://www.aol.com/efron-happy-healthy-swimming-incident-084442699.html', 'https://ca.news.yahoo.com/leopard-spotted-rock-may-sign-201138455.html', 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com/greenland-fossils-reveal-greater-sea-192719005.html', 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com/biggest-meteor-shower-2024-peak-133745484.html', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/scientists-discover-huge-crystal-filled-dinosaur-eggs-belonging-to-a-new-species/ss-AA1oehZn', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/future-of-work-remote-hybrid-or-back-to-the-office/ss-AA1ofWhV?ocid', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/realestate/the-best-small-town-for-retirees-in-your-state-plus-see-the-top-pick-for-all-50-states/ss-AA1ocQSt', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/news/20-real-reasons-why-millions-of-americans-still-refuse-to-buy-electric-cars/ss-AA1ocS4W']"
