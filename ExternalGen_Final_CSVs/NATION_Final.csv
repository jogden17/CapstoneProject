"Tropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia.","A 19-year-old man was killed on Monday afternoon when a large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie, Georgia. In a separate incident, the driver of a tractor trailer was found 40 feet below the surface of a canal in Tampa, Florida, after the vehicle broke off and dropped into the water.

Tropical Storm Debby, which made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane on Monday, continues to bring heavy rain and strong winds to the southeastern United States. The storm has left nearly 200,000 customers without power in Florida and Georgia, down from a peak of over 350,000 earlier in the day. Forecasters predict that the storm will bring torrential rains to coastal Georgia and South Carolina, with up to 30 inches of rainfall expected in some areas. The National Hurricane Center has issued a rare high-risk warning for flooding rainfall in the region, with the storm expected to affect South Carolina on Wednesday through Friday.","['https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-debby-flooding-storm-surge-high-winds-eb9fc50d578826784824f35ba943a6da', 'https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-08-05/hurricane-debby-makes-landfall-in-florida-and-threatens-catastrophic-flooding', 'https://www.newscentermaine.com/video/weather/severe-weather/tropical-storm-debby-hits-florida-with-floods-threat-of-record-rain-in-georgia/97-c74574a8-2e3d-4e1f-bfd0-03a5fd60fd6b', 'https://www.wataugademocrat.com/ap/national/tropical-storm-debby-hits-florida-with-floods-threat-of-record-rain-in-georgia-and-the/article_7a0ad6a8-c127-538f-9751-f49ae4b37d22.html', 'https://www.times-news.com/news/tropical-storm-debby-hits-florida-with-floods-threat-of-record-rain-in-georgia-and-the/article_8f54eccb-b700-5fee-91d6-125003ee5170.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/hurricane-debby-storm-08-05-24/index.html', 'https://fredericksburg.com/news/nation-world/tropical-storm-debby-hits-florida-with-floods-threat-of-record-rain-in-georgia-and-the/article_5d65c795-c510-57a3-ac46-ed25e0746214.html', 'https://www.bgdailynews.com/news/national/tropical-storm-debby-hits-florida-with-floods-threat-of-record-rain-in-georgia-and-the/article_17b5a408-fbc2-5f0a-8cdb-2b393dd133d8.html', 'https://journalnow.com/news/state/tropical-storm-debby-hits-florida-with-floods-threat-of-record-rain-in-georgia-and-the/article_98f6e29c-863d-565e-9d2f-4f87c64b6ce2.html', 'https://www.mynbc5.com/article/tracking-debby-august-5/61789701', 'https://www.mankatofreepress.com/news/state_national_news/the-latest-debby-blamed-for-at-least-4-deaths-in-florida-as-it-bears-down/article_e6b66103-d9b7-50f7-824c-415594db46c2.html', 'https://www.wmur.com/article/tropical-storm-debby-moves-through-gulf-toward-florida-hurricane-warnings/61784807', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/08/05/hurricane-debby-florida-storms-flooding-rain/', 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/florida-storm-live-state-put-182357696.html', 'https://www.mankatofreepress.com/news/state_national_news/the-latest-debby-blamed-for-4-deaths-in-florida-as-it-bears-down-on-georgia/article_e6b66103-d9b7-50f7-824c-415594db46c2.html', 'https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/5/hurricane-debby-hits-florida-coast-evacuations-ordered', 'https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/hurricane-debby-hits-florida-as-category-1-storm-catastrophic-flooding-possible', 'https://thetandd.com/ap/national/tropical-storm-debby-could-prove-just-as-dangerous-as-a-major-hurricane/article_e4dde067-a70a-5f29-bad8-e2caad1724ca.html', 'https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/08/hurricane-debby-hits-florida-and-thats-just-the-beginning/', 'https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/08/05/heavy-rainfall-flooding-among-potential-hurricane-debby-impacts-in-hampton-roads/', 'https://www.wokv.com/weather/tracking-debby-storm-downgrades-tropical-storm-status/6SEFO277ZJGPNNBRCJKS5UEQXY/', 'https://www.irishexaminer.com/world/arid-41450881.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/04/weather/florida-tropical-storm-debby-hurricane-sunday/index.html', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/08/04/debby-hurricane-florida-southeast-flood-forecast/', 'https://nz.news.yahoo.com/florida-storm-live-state-put-182357599.html']"
Pro-Israel interests pour millions into defeating a second ‘Squad’ member.,"Outside groups have spent over $15 million in Missouri's 1st Congressional District, with more than 80 percent of that money going toward ads opposing Rep. Cori Bush and supporting her opponent. According to Open Secrets, this makes it one of the most expensive congressional races in the country. Bush has missed 187 votes between January 2023 and June 2024, making her fifth among lawmakers with the most missed votes. 

The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) has spent around $15 million on behalf of Bush's opponent in the primary cycle. AIPAC has also been involved in other high-profile congressional races, including one in which it helped defeat a member of the congressional group known as the Squad. Bush has been a vocal critic of Israel's response to the Gaza attack, and has been endorsed by some progressive groups. Her opponent, Bell, has been backed by AIPAC and has taken a different stance on the issue, saying that Bush is ""wrong"" in her call for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas.","['https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/05/israel-house-election-cori-bush-aipac/', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/08/05/2024-election-campaign-updates-harris-trump/', 'https://ca.news.yahoo.com/rep-jamaal-bowman-faces-tough-043936010.html', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/us/politics/missouri-cori-bush-bell-aipac-israel-democrats.html', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/05/donalds-trump-harris-race/', 'https://ca.news.yahoo.com/pro-israel-super-pac-helped-172601663.html', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/08/05/harris-vice-president-visit-map/', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/05/republican-trump-get-out-the-vote-turning-point/', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/05/trump-ye-rapper-adin-ross-interview/', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/05/harris-democratic-presidential-nomination/f4734df8-5349-11ef-9a60-5b6e8b4da7c0_story.html', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/05/presidential-race-shifts-modestly-so-far-toward-harris/', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/05/why-st-louis-voters-might-ditch-cori-bush/', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/04/harris-trump-electoral-map-votes/', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/03/trump-putin-prisoner-swap-gershkovich/']"
"Bishop Richard Henning named new Archbishop of Boston, replacing Cardinal Sean O'Malley.","

Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Cardinal Seán O'Malley as Archbishop of Boston, a position he has held for over 20 years. O'Malley, 80, is five years beyond the normal retirement age for bishops. He will be succeeded by Bishop Richard G. Henning, 59, who has been leading the Diocese of Providence in Rhode Island since May 2023. Henning will be formally installed as Archbishop of Boston on October 31 at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross.

The Archdiocese of Boston is the fourth largest in the US, serving over 1.8 million Catholics with 250 parishes, 115 Catholic schools, 900 priests, and a budget of over $350 million. Henning has expressed his commitment to listening to the concerns of lapsed Catholics who lost faith in the Church due to the sex abuse scandal. O'Malley, who was a key ally of Pope Francis and leader of the Vatican's office on sexual abuse, is expected to stay on at the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors at the Pope's request.","['https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/archbishop-of-boston-cardinal-sean-omalley-bishop-richard-henning/', 'https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/pope-francis-close-ally-cardinal-sean-malley-retires-112571719', 'https://www.wcvb.com/article/cardinal-sean-omalley-retires-bishop-henning-appointed-archdiocese-boston/61789606', 'https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/pope-francis-names-richard-henningnew-archbishop-of-boston/3449844/', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/us/pope-francis-boston-archdiocese-archbishop-henning.html', 'https://www.providencejournal.com/story/news/local/2024/08/05/bishop-henning-of-diocese-of-providence-named-archbishop-of-boston/74670200007/', 'https://www.pillarcatholic.com/p/the-long-road-to-replacing-cardinal', 'https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/08/05/archdiocese-of-boston-announces-bishop-richard-henning-as-new-leader/', 'https://cruxnow.com/church-in-the-americas/2024/08/omalley-steps-down-in-boston-henning-of-providence-to-take-over/', 'https://wbznewsradio.iheart.com/content/henning-replacing-omalley-as-archbishop-of-boston/', 'https://patch.com/massachusetts/boston/pope-francis-names-bishop-richard-henning-new-archbishop-boston-replacing', 'https://www.newscentermaine.com/video/news/regional/new-england/cardinal-sean-omalley-80-retires-as-archbishop-of-boston/97-e6f49af6-d066-4531-9536-a66caf1b4d86', 'https://catholicvote.org/newly-appointed-boston-archbishop-looks-ahead-at-new-role/', 'https://www.newspressnow.com/news/national_news/pope-francis-main-adviser-on-clergy-abuse-cardinal-se-n-omalley-retires-as-archbishop-of/article_02fa4dd1-8335-5056-9b56-90a7f2eeeaab.html', 'https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/08/04/metro/archbishop-boston-omalley-henning/', 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/pope-francis-names-archbishop-boston-103213098.html', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/pope-francis-main-adviser-on-clergy-abuse-cardinal-se%C3%A1n-o-malley-retires-as-archbishop-of-boston/ar-AA1ofRdA', 'https://www.masslive.com/news/2024/08/boston-archdiocese-leader-cardinal-sean-omalley-retiring-vatican-announces.html', 'https://www.boston25news.com/news/local/pope-francis-names-new-archbishop-boston-replacing-cardinal-sean-omalley/2CE2LWKIMFFU7GNVMQLSEDCRC4/', 'https://www.wcvb.com/article/archbishop-sean-omalley-will-retire-sources-tell-wcvb/61785864', 'https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/providence-bishop-to-be-named-successor-to-bostons-cardinal-omalley/3449453/', 'https://www.irishstar.com/news/boston-news/pope-francis-name-new-archbishop-33398667', 'https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/08/05/metro/new-archbishop-boston-henning/', 'https://poststar.com/news/state-and-regional/pope-francis-main-adviser-on-clergy-abuse-cardinal-se-n-omalley-retires-as-archbishop-of/article_eee10edc-0829-5b7e-a72f-3ee5db12db42.html', 'https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2024/08/04/boston-omalley-replaced-by-providence-bishop/']"

At least two Katyusha rockets were fired towards the base, which houses US-led forces. The incident comes as tensions in the Middle East escalate amid the Israel-Hamas conflict.

The attack occurred amid rising concerns of an imminent attack by Iran and its allies on Israel in retaliation for the killing of top Hamas and Hezbollah figures in recent strikes. US defense officials have confirmed the rocket attack, which injured several personnel.

RFK Jr. says he left a dead bear in Central Park as a joke.,"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. revealed in a social media video on Sunday that he had left a dead bear cub in Central Park in 2014. According to Kennedy, he was driving to meet friends in upstate New York for a falconing trip when he witnessed a motorist strike the bear with her vehicle. He pulled over, retrieved the animal, and loaded it into his vehicle. Kennedy then came up with a plan to make the bear's death appear to be an accident involving a cyclist, and left the carcass in Central Park next to an old bicycle.

The incident was investigated by a state agency, but the statute of limitations for the offense has since expired. Kennedy shared the story in an effort to get ahead of a New Yorker article that he expected to be damaging. The article, which was published on Monday, includes a photo of Kennedy with his fingers in the bear's bloodied mouth. Kennedy acknowledged that he did not expect the media attention the stunt would attract, and the incident has been criticized by some as an example of poor judgment.","['https://apnews.com/article/robert-kennedy-rfk-bear-cub-central-park-f7e6cba9aa19dc2066a8d9c543974a97', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/08/05/rfk-jr-dead-bear-central-park-new-yorker/', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/04/us/politics/robert-f-kennedy-jr-bear-central-park.html', 'https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/05/rfk-jr-kennedy-bear-story-central-park-new-york', 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2j3353vvdvo', 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-admits-dead-bear-cub-old-bicycle-central-park-10-years-ago/', 'https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/05/politics/rfk-jr-new-yorker-bear-cub/index.html', 'https://www.npr.org/2024/08/05/nx-s1-5063939/rfk-jr-central-park-bear-bicycle', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/robert-f-kennedy-jr-posts-video-saying-put-young-dead-bear-central-par-rcna165095', 'https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/rfk-jr-dead-bear-cub-central-park-b2591254.html', 'https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/08/05/robert-f-kennedy-jr-says-he-left-a-dead-bear-in-central-park-as-a-prank/', 'https://www.scrippsnews.com/us-news/rfk-jr-says-he-dumped-a-dead-bear-in-new-yorks-central-park-a-decade-ago', 'https://www.aol.com/rfk-jr-could-faced-fine-233427930.html', 'https://www.lohud.com/story/news/2024/08/05/rfk-jr-dead-bear-central-park-ny/74671311007/', 'https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/robert-kennedy-jr-left-dead-bear-central-park-112566475', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/rfk-jr-says-he-dumped-dead-bear-in-central-park/2024/08/05/ba801f7f-327c-4ccf-b0c5-0aedeb91a8b6_video.html', 'https://deadline.com/2024/08/robert-kennedy-jr-bear-central-park-1236031258/', 'https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/rfk-jr-admits-planting-dead-bear-in-central-park.html', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/nyregion/rfk-jr-bear-dumping-ny-ballot.html', 'https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/robert-kennedy-rfk-dead-bear-roseanne-barr-b2591695.html', 'https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr-dead-bear-central-park-video-roseanne-barr-1235965936/', 'https://www.unionleader.com/news/back_page/rfk-jr-says-he-once-dumped-a-dead-bear-in-central-park/article_64cdf6a6-5355-11ef-bdec-47bfb8a251ff.html', 'https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/rfk-jr-says-he-staged-bear-cub-murder-scene-in-central-park', 'https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/04/politics/rfk-jr-bear-central-park/index.html', 'https://forward.com/culture/640764/rfk-jr-bear-central-park-larry-david/']"
13-year-old boy killed when a tree falls on home during Hurricane Debby.,"Hurricane Debby made landfall Monday at 7 a.m. near Steinhatchee, Florida, with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph. The storm's powerful winds have already caused widespread power outages, with over 250,000 homes and businesses across northern Florida without electricity. Forecasters anticipate the storm's winds to spawn tornadoes, while storm surges could reach up to 10 feet in some areas.

Supreme Court rejects Missouri's long-shot bid to block Trump's gag order.,"

The US Supreme Court on Monday declined to intervene in a lawsuit brought by Missouri, which sought to block legal proceedings in former President Donald Trump's hush money case in New York. The court rejected Missouri's bid to sue the state of New York, meaning the justices will not lift the gag order or delay sentencing in the case. New York Attorney General Letitia James had argued that there was no basis for the Supreme Court to get involved, stating that Missouri was ""seeking to further the individual interests of former President Trump"".

The justices rejected Missouri's long-shot bid, although Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito indicated that they would have allowed the state to file its complaint against New York. Missouri had argued that the rights of its voters to hear from presidential candidates were being violated by the New York criminal proceeding. The ruling ensures that Trump's sentencing will proceed as scheduled, with a new date set for September after being postponed from its original July 11 date.","['https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-rejects-missouris-long-shot-bid-block-trumps-gag-order-h-rcna163629', 'https://www.scotusblog.com/2024/08/supreme-court-rejects-missouris-request-to-block-trumps-new-york-gag-order-sentencing/', 'https://www.npr.org/2024/08/05/nx-s1-5064424/supreme-court-trump', 'https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/missouri-trump-gag-order-supreme-court-rcna165238', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-presidential-election', 'https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/us/supreme-court-shuts-down-missouri-s-long-shot-push-to-lift-trump-s-gag-order-in-hush-money-case/ar-AA1ohzuy?ocid', 'https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/world/supreme-court-shuts-down-missouri-s-long-shot-push-to-lift-trump-s-gag-order-in-hush-money-case/ar-AA1ohBvy', 'https://emeatribune.com/families-whose-loved-ones-were-left-rotting-in-funeral-home-owed-950-million-judge-rules/', 'https://emeatribune.com/oil-prices-rise-over-1-on-mounting-concerns-over-middle-east-supply/']"

Louisiana governor tells parents against the Ten Commandments in classrooms: 'Tell your child not to do so.'',"A coalition of parents from various faith backgrounds, including Jewish, Christian, Unitarian Universalist, and nonreligious, have filed a lawsuit against the state of Louisiana over a new law requiring the display of the Ten Commandments in all public school classrooms. The plaintiffs argue that the legislation infringes upon their First Amendment right to raise their children according to their own religious doctrine. The law, which goes into effect January 1, 2025, mandates that all public schools and colleges display the Ten Commandments.

Louisiana is the only state with such a requirement, and the ACLU has joined the lawsuit, arguing that the law violates the establishment clause of the US Constitution. The state's attorney general, Liz Murrill, plans to file a brief to dismiss the case, citing that no one has been harmed since the law is not yet in effect. The state intends to rely on outside donations to fund the display of the Ten Commandments, although the source of these donations has not been specified. Questions remain about how the requirement will be enforced and what will happen if there are insufficient donations to fund the mandate.","['https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/louisiana-governor-tells-parents-ten-commandments-classrooms-tell-chil-rcna165147', 'https://www.wwltv.com/article/news/local/dont-look-at-them-gov-jeff-landry-on-people-who-are-against-10-commandments-in-classrooms/289-679dfb9c-7711-4064-84b2-88ecb1076aa5', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/louisiana-governor-tells-parents-against-ten-commandments-in-classrooms-tell-your-child-not-to-look/ar-AA1oh33J', 'https://ca.news.yahoo.com/ten-commandments-wont-louisiana-classrooms-184458612.html', 'https://www.tampafp.com/louisiana-gov-jeff-landry-defends-new-law-hanging-ten-commandments-in-classroom/', 'https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/louisiana-ag-asks-court-dismiss-lawsuit-new-ten-112589299', 'https://www.wwno.org/education/2024-08-05/louisiana-ag-requests-dismissal-of-lawsuit-challenging-ten-commandments-in-schools', 'https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/05/us/louisiana-ten-commandments-schools/index.html', 'https://www.aol.com/louisiana-ag-asks-court-dismiss-191650150.html']"
Special prosecutors plan to file criminal charges against the police chief who led the Marion raid.,"Prosecutors plan to charge former Marion Police Chief Gideon Cody with a low-level felony related to a raid on the Marion County Record and the homes of the newspaper publisher and councilwoman last year. The investigation, led by the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, found that Cody's actions were not justified, but that police did not commit any crimes during the raid. The report also cleared Marion County Record reporter Phyllis Zorn and editor Eric Meyer of wrongdoing.

The expected charge against Cody stems from text messages sent before the raid. If convicted, Cody faces between seven and 23 months in prison. The raid sparked a national debate about press freedom. A KBI agent described Cody's behavior as that of a ""rabid squirrel in a cage"" who was acting on his own. Cody resigned in October after it was reported that he had instructed an officer to delete text messages between them. The prosecutors' report concluded that there was no evidence of intentional wrongdoing by law enforcement agents, but that Cody's actions were unjustified.","['https://kansasreflector.com/2024/08/05/special-prosecutors-plan-to-file-criminal-charge-against-police-chief-who-led-marion-raid/', 'https://www.voanews.com/a/police-chief-who-led-raid-on-kansas-newspaper-to-be-charged-prosecutors-say/7731035.html', 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/prosecutors-plan-charge-former-kansas-163229577.html', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2024/08/05/kansas-newspaper-raid-criminal-charge/65bcb92e-5348-11ef-9a60-5b6e8b4da7c0_story.html?isMobile', 'https://www.caledonianrecord.com/news/national/prosecutors-plan-to-charge-former-kansas-police-chief-over-his-conduct-following-newspaper-raid/article_b488a8c9-c2a1-53f3-b6bd-84a4dbeacb00.html', 'https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bc-us-kansas-newspaper-raid_n_66b0fed5e4b0781f9246ecde', 'https://www.kmbc.com/article/obstruction-of-justice-marion-kansas-police-chief/61794182', 'https://www.aol.com/police-chief-led-raid-marion-151208238.html', 'https://www.inkl.com/news/former-kansas-police-chief-faces-obstruction-of-justice-charge']"
