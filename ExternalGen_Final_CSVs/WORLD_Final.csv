Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her.,"Thousands of demonstrators stormed the official residence of Bangladesh's prime minister and other buildings associated with her party and family, leading to her resignation and departure from the country. The violence surrounding her resignation resulted in at least 41 deaths and around 200 injuries. The country has been experiencing unrest for weeks, with at least 11,000 people arrested and nearly 300 people killed since mid-July. The military, which holds significant political influence in Bangladesh, will face a challenge in restoring calm and satisfying various factions.

The unrest has had a significant impact on the country, with schools and universities closed and a shoot-on-sight curfew imposed at one point. The military's role in the country's politics is particularly significant, given Bangladesh's history of more than 20 coups or coup attempts since gaining independence in 1971. The U.N. special rapporteur on freedom of expression and opinion, Irene Khan, has noted that the military has a ""very tough job ahead"" in addressing the situation.","['https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-hasina-student-protest-quota-violence-fdc7f2632c3d8fcbd913e6c0a1903fd4', 'https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/5/world-reacts-to-bangladesh-pm-sheikh-hasinas-removal-from-power', 'https://www.loudountimes.com/0local-or-not/4world/bangladeshi-pm-sheikh-hasina-resigns-as-widening-unrest-sees-protesters-storm-her-official-residence/article_8063a9bb-7967-5c8c-ab8a-c3f46a78d9b7.html', 'https://www.kentuckytoday.com/news/national/ap-news-summary-at-3-59-p-m-edt/article_fc83e085-8f98-52bc-94a9-b865c52bf372.html', 'https://m.economictimes.com/news/newsblogs/latest-news-live-updates-august-5-india-news-weather-monsoon-rainfall-himachal-cloudburst-sc-rahul-gandhi-pm-modi-wayanad-landslide-mumbai-rains-imd-bjp-j-k-article-370-abrogation-anniversary/liveblog/112274525.cms', 'https://www.mankatofreepress.com/news/state_national_news/the-latest-harris-closes-in-on-running-mate-pick/article_5f8030a8-554c-504f-a3a1-2f1bffc561bc.html', 'https://www.mankatofreepress.com/news/state_national_news/prosecutors-plan-to-charge-former-kansas-police-chief-regarding-newspaper-raid/article_69c6bd6a-5359-11ef-aece-dfa04fc8a28c.html', 'https://www.mankatofreepress.com/news/state_national_news/tropical-storm-debby-hits-florida-with-floods-threat-of-record-rain-in-georgia-and-the/article_6add4f33-22eb-5538-84d3-12fa078cadba.html', 'https://www.mankatofreepress.com/news/business/dow-drops-1-000-and-japanese-stocks-suffer-worst-crash-since-1987-as-markets-quake/article_99ddd00a-26a8-5869-beb8-b142b8d0fb93.html', 'https://www.wdrb.com/news/national/ap-news-summary-at-1-27-p-m-edt/article_f16721e9-4ff4-5926-a045-e7e3b53d85a6.html', 'https://www.wdrb.com/news/national/ap-news-summary-at-10-22-a-m-edt/article_f16721e9-4ff4-5926-a045-e7e3b53d85a6.html', 'https://www.mankatofreepress.com/ap/sports/f1-arcade-launching-locations-where-race-simulators-are-only-part-of-the-experience/article_a830dac3-b927-501d-a1ce-021c8c42c9e9.html', 'https://www.mankatofreepress.com/ap/sports/chop-chop-american-entries-cut-in-half-in-paris-olympic-beach-volleyball-tournament/article_8c100285-f350-5fdc-a5e6-2d22b88241c1.html', 'https://www.mankatofreepress.com/news/state_national_news/israel-hamas-war-latest-hezbollah-says-it-launched-a-drone-attack-on-northern-israel/article_9c0476cc-ddae-521f-8b54-418424c8a7bd.html', 'https://www.mankatofreepress.com/ap/sports/chinas-quan-hongchan-chen-yuxi-lead-the-way-in-olympic-10-meter-diving/article_862488ed-276b-54fe-9861-815ee22e626e.html', 'https://www.mankatofreepress.com/news/business/stocks-open-sharply-lower-on-wall-street-as-investors-fear-a-us-economic-slowdown-dow/article_e57db06c-aba4-5c47-ba15-8090d95c9494.html', 'https://www.mankatofreepress.com/ap/sports/noah-lyles-back-on-track-at-olympics-for-a-no-drama-run-through-first-round/article_73944259-ac3f-5f31-808a-dabb5b50ce52.html', 'https://www.mankatofreepress.com/ap/sports/photo-collection-paris-olympics-nail-art/article_38c35e4c-22b7-530c-8c5a-4f9895f0840b.html', 'https://www.mankatofreepress.com/ap/sports/italy-wins-the-first-olympic-mixed-team-skeet-gold-medal-vincent-hancock-settles-for-a/article_e81459a7-c3d2-51f0-b03d-aed4f11fd8fa.html', 'https://www.mankatofreepress.com/ap/sports/a-rebuilt-bronze-jackie-robinson-statue-will-be-unveiled-6-months-after-the-original-was/article_4bc73e20-d051-597e-805e-950132d11e65.html', 'https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/world-news/ex-trump-attorney-jenna-ellis-to-cooperate-in-arizona-fake-electors-case-charges-to-be-dropped-9312511']"
Several U.S. personnel were injured in a suspected rocket attack at Al Asad air base.,"Several US personnel were injured in a suspected rocket attack on Monday at Al-Asad Airbase in Iraq. Two Katyusha rockets were fired at the base, with one falling inside the base. No critical injuries or fatalities were reported. The attack comes amid growing tensions in the Middle East, following the recent assassinations of a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon and Hamas' top political leader in Iran.

The US has moved aircraft and ships to the region to help defend against an expected Iranian attack. The Pentagon and Israeli defense establishment are on edge over anticipated retaliation by Iran and its proxies against Israel. The White House confirmed that the president and vice president were briefed on the attack. The US has been working to persuade Iran's leaders not to retaliate against Israel, with President Joe Biden speaking with Jordan's King Abdullah on Monday in an effort to de-escalate the situation.","['https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/05/politics/personnel-injured-iraq-al-asad-airbase/index.html', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/08/05/us-troops-attacked-asad-iraq/', 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5dd33egeqo', 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-personnel-injured-al-asad-air-base-suspected-rocket-attack-iraq/', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/americans-injured-attack-us-base-iraq-rcna165281', 'https://www.foxnews.com/world/several-u-s-personnel-injured-suspected-rocket-attack-al-asad-air-base-officials', 'https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/al-asad-air-base-attack-us-injuries', 'https://www.stripes.com/theaters/middle_east/2024-08-05/rocket-attack-iraq-troops-injured-14754644.html', 'https://www.airandspaceforces.com/us-troops-injured-attack-iraq/', 'https://www.kcci.com/article/rocket-attack-iraqi-military-base-injures-us-personnel/61796131', 'https://www.airforcetimes.com/breaking-news/2024/08/05/several-us-troops-injured-in-rocket-attack-in-iraq-officials-say/', 'https://www.nationalreview.com/news/u-s-personnel-injured-by-suspected-rocket-attack-on-iraq-air-base/', 'https://nypost.com/2024/08/05/world-news/us-personnel-injured-in-rocket-attack-against-iraqi-airbase-report/', 'https://washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/08/05/us-troops-attacked-asad-iraq/?tid', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/05/iraq-mideast-us-forces-attack/14d6527e-5373-11ef-9a60-5b6e8b4da7c0_story.html?isMobile', 'https://taskandpurpose.com/news/us-military-iraq-rocket-attack/', 'https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/several-us-personnel-injured-rocket-attack-iraq-base', 'https://www.wxyz.com/world/middle-east/a-rocket-attack-at-an-iraqi-military-base-injures-us-personnel-officials-say', 'https://kvia.com/news/us-world/2024/08/05/several-us-personnel-injured-in-rocket-attack-on-iraq-base-2/', 'https://www.cbs.com/shows/video/vVL9jJjIT5LZzM7RH63ApmI7mW7qDElf/', 'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/several-us-personnel-injured-in-rocket-attack-at-iraqi-military-base-officials/articleshow/112299472.cms', 'https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/exclusive-us-personnel-wounded-in-attack-against-base-in-iraq%2C-officials-say/86145979', 'https://www.nbc-2.com/article/rocket-attack-iraqi-military-base-injures-us-personnel/61796131', 'https://www.kaaltv.com/news/us-world-news/a-rocket-attack-at-an-iraqi-military-base-injures-us-personnel-officials-tell-ap/', 'https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/08/05/personnel-reported-injured-iraqi-base/3021722899479/']"
Nine UNRWA staff will be fired for potential role in the 7 October attacks on Israel.,"The United Nations has fired nine staff members from its agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, after an internal investigation found they may have been involved in the Hamas-led attack against Israel on October 7. The investigation was launched after Israel accused several UNRWA personnel of taking part in the attack, which resulted in the deaths of 1,200 people and the taking of 251 others as hostages. The UN did not provide details on the specific actions of the employees, but stated that they would be fired from their roles.

The decision comes after a review by the UN's internal watchdog, the Office of Oversight Services (OIOS), which was unable to independently authenticate some of the information used by Israel to support its allegations. The agency had previously fired 12 staff members and placed seven others on administrative leave without pay over the claims. The UN has stated that it had ""sufficient information"" to make its decision, despite some evidence being in Israeli custody and unable to be independently verified.","['https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/08/1152841', 'https://apnews.com/article/un-unrwa-staffers-fired-oct-7-cc33d0ab25dc4bacc0af1db10705e0d6', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/08/05/unrwa-october-7-israel-hamas-gaza/', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/world/middleeast/unrwa-oct-7-attack.html', 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/un-fires-9-unrwa-staffers-gaza-investigation-october-7-attacks/', 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnvyyz8461yo', 'https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/unrwa-staffers-fired-oct-7-1.7285735', 'https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-08-05/ty-article/.premium/israel-at-war-day-304-nine-unrwa-workers-fired-for-possible-involvement-in-october-7/00000191-234a-dcd6-abf7-774f440f0001', 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com/nine-unrwa-staff-members-may-200038268.html', 'https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-08-05/ty-article/un-fires-9-staffers-after-probe-finds-possible-involvement-in-oct-7-attack-on-israel/00000191-23c1-dcd6-abf7-77c727160000', 'https://www.inkl.com/news/un-agency-fires-nine-staff-members-over-possible-links-to-october-7-attack', 'https://www.1news.co.nz/2024/08/06/un-fires-more-staff-over-possible-october-7-attack-involvement/', 'https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.7285735', 'https://dailycaller.com/2024/08/05/un-agency-staffers-likely-participated-oct7-terrorist-attacks-against-israel/']"
"Iran has decided to attack Israel, Foreign Minister Katz says.","US CENTCOM Commander Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla met with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and IDF Chief of Staff Lt-Gen Herzi Halevi on Monday. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Qatari Prime Minister Al Thani and Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty about the situation. US President Joe Biden was expected to meet with his national security team to discuss the matter.

Tensions in the region remain high, with Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian stating that Tehran aims to expand relations with Russia. The US has warned that an Iranian attack could occur within the next 48 hours. Earlier, Secretary Blinken cautioned his G7 counterparts that an attack by Iran and Hezbollah against Israel could start as early as Monday. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for a drone attack on northern Israel, which wounded two Israeli troops.

UK prime minister talks of a ‘standing army’ of police to deal with riots.,"UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced plans to increase the capacity of the justice system to handle the large number of arrests made in connection with the recent unrest. Over 375 people have been arrested so far, with more expected, according to police. The violence has resulted in dozens of police officers being hospitalized for injuries sustained during clashes with rioters.

The unrest has been described as the worst England has seen since 2011, with widespread rioting and violence reported in several areas. The police have made a significant number of arrests, with some individuals already appearing in court. The Prime Minister has unveiled a new ""standing army"" of specialist public duty officers to tackle the riots, and has pledged to take action against those responsible for the violence. The situation has also prompted several countries, including Australia, Nigeria, Malaysia, and Indonesia, to issue travel alerts to their nationals visiting the UK.","['https://apnews.com/article/britain-riots-asylum-seekers-violence-a391b4513c41fe4de3806b28ee0c1740', 'https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/5/british-pm-says-standing-army-of-police-ready-to-deal-with-rioters', 'https://www.loudountimes.com/0local-or-not/4world/uk-prime-minister-talks-of-standing-army-of-police-to-deal-with-rioting-across-britain/article_e1557810-2540-54e6-96b4-b7bbe7f951be.html', 'https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/08/05/uk-pm-starmer-vows-specialist-police-standing-army-to-battle-far-right-unrest-gripping-bri', 'https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cw5yyynpwnzt', 'https://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/3273307/uks-starmer-talks-standing-army-police-vows-swift-criminal-sanctions-rioters', 'https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2024/08/05/wfmq-a05.html', 'https://www.cbc.ca/news/britain-standing-army-police-riot-1.7285610', 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/southport-stabbing-latest-multiple-casualties-125827013.html', 'https://www.foxnews.com/world/uk-riots-plunge-country-into-worst-unrest-in-years-prime-minister-vows-to-apply-full-force-of-law', 'https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/starmer-standing-army-specialist-police-riots-b2591415.html', 'https://news.sky.com/story/what-is-sir-keir-starmers-standing-army-and-will-it-work-13191485', 'https://www.wral.com/story/uk-police-warn-far-right-fueled-street-violence-affects-resources-needed-to-investigate-other-crimes/21559338/', 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com/starmer-says-standing-army-police-123325892.html', 'https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/us/uk-prime-minister-talks-of-standing-army-of-police-to-deal-with-rioting-across-britain/ar-AA1ofzOs', 'https://news.sky.com/story/keir-starmer-pmqs-conservative-leadership-contest-latest-live-12593360', 'https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/08/05/southport-attack-latest-news-rioters-not-patriots/', 'https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/uk-riots-today-protest-rotherham-tamworth-liverpool-bolton-news-b2591141.html?page', 'https://www.sinardaily.my/article/220195/focus/world/uk-pm-promises-quotstanding-armyquot-of-officers-to-tackle-riots', 'https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/aug/05/cobra-emergency-meeting-keir-starmer-far-right-riots-uk-politics-live-latest', 'https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/keir-starmers-new-standing-army-of-specialist-police-to-tackle-riots/', 'https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/riots-cobra-meeting-keir-starmer-rotherham-tamworth-southport-far-right-b1174721.html', 'https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/world/uk-prime-minister-convenes-emergency-panel-to-end-days-of-far-right-violence-across-britain/ar-AA1ofyf8', 'https://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2024/Aug/05/as-far-right-thuggery-escalates-on-uk-streets-pm-starmer-proposes-standing-army-of-police-to-quell-riots', 'https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/video-news/a-standing-army-of-specialist-police-to-be-set-up-deal-with-riots-says-starmer/a168452893.html']"
Venezuela’s top prosecutor announces a criminal probe of opposition leaders.,"Venezuela's Attorney General Tarek William Saab has announced a criminal investigation against opposition presidential candidate Edmundo González and leader Maria Corina Machado. The investigation is in response to their call on the country's armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro. Saab claims that the duo incited police and military officials to disobey the laws. Both González and Machado have gone into hiding, citing fears of arrest or harm.

The opposition claims to have collected records from over 80% of the country's 30,000 polling booths, showing they won the election. However, authorities have yet to produce voting tallies to prove Maduro's victory. The post-electoral uprising has resulted in at least 11 deaths, according to human rights group Foro Penal.

Ukraine’s Zelenskyy displays newly arrived F-16 fighter jets.,"Ukraine has destroyed a Russian Su-34 fighter-bomber aircraft and an ammunition depot at the Morozovsk airfield in Russia's Rostov region, approximately 165 miles from the frontline of the war. The attack, which occurred on Saturday, is also believed to have damaged two other Su-34 warplanes. This development comes as Ukraine has received its first Western-supplied F-16 warplanes, with President Volodymyr Zelensky requesting NATO allies to provide protection for the aircraft.

Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway have committed to delivering over 60 F-16s to Ukraine in the coming months to bolster its air defenses. The F-16 is equipped with a 20mm cannon and can carry various munitions. Ukraine is also seeking assistance from neighboring countries to defend against Russian missiles.

The United States has withdrawn its military presence from Niger, a move that undermines its strategy to address rising Islamist militancy in the region. The withdrawal comes after the Nigerien Prime Minister Ali Mahaman Lamine Zeine blamed the US for a breakdown in relations. The US had a significant presence in Niger, with Air Base 201, a $100 million facility, serving as a key hub for its operations in the Sahel region. The base was established in 2010 and was part of the US efforts to combat Islamist violence in the region.

In other news, tensions remain high in the Middle East, with Israel and Hezbollah exchanging fire overnight. The Israeli military reported that approximately 30 projectiles were fired from Lebanon towards Israeli territory. Meanwhile, in the West Bank, a new crop of Palestinian fighters has emerged, with the Jenin Battalion, led by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, patrolling entrances to the camp. The battalion has been involved in clashes with Israeli forces, including a recent raid that killed six militants.","['https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/08/05/niger-agadez-sahel-military-bases/', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/08/05/niger-agadez-us-military-timeline/', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/08/05/nigeria-protests-economy-president/4e7bb33c-5343-11ef-9a60-5b6e8b4da7c0_story.html', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/08/04/israeli-raids-west-bank-cities-help-fuel-militant-violence/', 'https://njtoday.news/2024/08/05/niger-evicted-american-forces-from-key-african-base/', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/08/05/ukraine-mali-wagner-mercenaries-russia/', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/08/05/czech-antisemitism-rise-2023-gaza-war/acd5ab64-532e-11ef-9a60-5b6e8b4da7c0_story.html', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/08/05/pakistan-protest-against-india-kashmir/ff42eca6-5309-11ef-9a60-5b6e8b4da7c0_story.html', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/08/05/cambodia-china-vietnam-canal-environment-mekong/c6744df2-52f0-11ef-9a60-5b6e8b4da7c0_story.html', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/08/04/israel-gaza-strikes-holon-stabbing-war/']"
Mali severs diplomatic relations with Ukraine for providing intelligence to rebels for the Wagner ambush.,"Mali has severed diplomatic ties with Ukraine, effective immediately, following allegations that Ukrainian intelligence assisted Malian rebels in a deadly ambush against Wagner Group forces in July. The attack, claimed by a Tuareg rebels group and the al Qaeda affiliate JNIM, resulted in significant casualties, including the reported deaths of 50 Russians and several Malian soldiers.

The decision to terminate diplomatic relations comes after Ukraine's alleged involvement in the ambush was cited by the transitional government of Mali. Ukraine has responded by requesting evidence of its involvement in the attack. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry described Mali's decision as ""short-sighted and hasty"". The incident has also drawn a response from Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who reaffirmed support for Mali in a recent call with Malian Foreign Minister Abdoulaye Diop.","['https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/04/africa/mali-ukraine-wagner-intelligence-intl-latam/index.html', 'https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-polytics/3892088-mali-severs-diplomatic-relations-with-ukraine.html', 'https://www.agenzianova.com/en/news/Mali-ambush-on-Wagner-mercenaries-government-severs-diplomatic-relations-with-Ukraine/', 'https://uatv.ua/en/due-to-losses-the-occupiers-in-a-number-of-areas-cannot-even-complete-tactical-level-tasks-details-from-an-analyst/', 'https://businessday.ng/africa/article/mali-sever-diplomatic-ties-with-ukraine-over-wagner-ambush-betrayal/?amp', 'https://www.inkl.com/news/mali-severs-diplomatic-ties-with-ukraine-over-rebel-ambush', 'https://naija247news.com/2024/08/05/mali-severs-diplomatic-relations-with-ukraine-for-providing-intelligence-to-rebels-for-wagner-ambush/', 'https://naija247news.com/2024/08/05/senegal-summons-ukrainian-ambassador-over-video-supporting-attacks-on-malian-army/']"
