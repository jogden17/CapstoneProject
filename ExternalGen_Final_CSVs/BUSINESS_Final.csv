Global stocks tumble on fears of U.S. recession and tech pullback.,"

Global stock markets experienced a significant downturn on Monday, with the S&P 500 Index closing 106 points, or 3%, lower. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 3.43%, while the Dow Jones plummeted more than 1,000 points, losing 2.6%. Apple had its worst day since September 2022, shedding 4.82%. The sell-off began on Friday after the publication of the latest US employment data, which showed fewer jobs were created in July than expected.

The market decline was not limited to the US, with main European stocks hitting their lowest in over six months. Energy and utility stocks led the way in a broad-based market slide. Australia's share market suffered its worst day since the onset of the pandemic, with more than $100 billion in value erased from local stocks. In contrast, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index soared nearly 11% early Tuesday, a day after it set markets tumbling in Europe and on Wall Street.","['https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/business/global-stocks.html', 'https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/08/05/stock-market-dow-jones-nasdaq-live-updates/74671156007/', 'https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/global-stock-markets-plunge/index.html', 'https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-global-stocks-tumble-on-fears-of-us-recession-tech-pullback/', 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stock-market-today-dow-jones-s-p-500-down/', 'https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/04/stock-market-today-live-updates.html', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/live-blog/us-stocks-lower-asia-europe-decline-impact-rcna165129', 'https://www.registerguard.com/story/money/2024/08/05/stock-market-dow-jones-nasdaq-live-updates/74671156007/', 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stocks-routed-markets-fret-us-economy-jobs-report/', 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/05/business/stocks-market-crash-economy', 'https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/05/wall-street-reacts-to-global-market-sell-off.html', 'https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/stocks-dollar-swing-rate-bets-030758538.html', 'https://www.msn.com/en-ca/money/other/dow-jones-nasdaq-s-p-500-weekly-preview-recession-fears-cloud-equities-outlook/ar-AA1ogdgr', 'https://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/us-recession-rumblings-to-roil-asx-20240803-p5jz3u', 'https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-nikkei-economy-c6240977e9482bf7207abc53b2a11e58', 'https://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-s-p-500-nasdaq-futures-dive-as-buffett-dumps-apple-yen-soars', 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/japanese-stocks-tumble-leading-equities-002002329.html', 'https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-05/japanese-stocks-tumble-leading-equities-selloff-markets-wrap', 'https://www.ig.com/en/news-and-trade-ideas/wall-street--us-stocks-plummet--woeful-jobs-report-and-tech-earn-240805', 'https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/aug/05/global-market-selloff-volatility-us-growth-worries-japan-nikkei-ftse-wall-street-nasdaq-business-live?page', 'https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/aug/05/global-market-selloff-volatility-us-growth-worries-japan-nikkei-ftse-wall-street-nasdaq-business-live?page', 'https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/aug/05/global-market-selloff-volatility-us-growth-worries-japan-nikkei-ftse-wall-street-nasdaq-business-live?page', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/stocks-routed-in-asia-tumble-in-europe-over-u-s-recession-fears/ar-AA1ofamd', 'https://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/asx-set-for-more-heavy-losses-as-jobs-data-rocks-wall-street-20240805-p5jzfn.html']"
"Google's antitrust loss could put billions at risk for Apple, Yahoo Finance says.","A federal judge has ruled in favor of the Department of Justice in its antitrust suit against Google, potentially forcing the tech giant to make significant changes to its business. The ruling could also impact Google's long-term revenue-sharing agreement with Apple, which has been in place since 2002 and generated an estimated $20 billion in revenue for Apple in 2022.

Major technology stocks experienced a significant decline on Monday morning, with Tesla opening down 10.9%, Apple falling 9.6%, and Amazon dropping 8.2%. Microsoft saw the least volatility, falling 4.8% at market open.

X is closing San Francisco HQ and relocating staffers to San Jose and 'shared space'.,"

X, the social media company owned by Elon Musk, plans to close its San Francisco office over the next few weeks, according to an internal email obtained by The New York Times. The company's chief executive, Linda Yaccarino, informed employees that they would be relocated to existing offices in San Jose, Calif. Additionally, X will open an engineering-focused office in Palo Alto, Calif., which it will share with xAI, the artificial intelligence outfit also owned by Mr. Musk.

The office closure is part of a larger shift for the company, which will see its Bay Area employees relocated to Silicon Valley. This move comes after Mr. Musk announced plans to relocate the headquarters for X and SpaceX to Texas. The San Francisco office closure marks a significant departure for the city, which has seen a decline in tech firms in its downtown area.","['https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/technology/x-twitter-san-francisco-office.html', 'https://fortune.com/2024/08/05/x-closing-san-francisco-hq-relocating-staffers-san-jose-palo-alto-shared-space-with-x-ai-linda-yaccarino-leaked-email/', 'https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-x-twitter-leaving-san-francisco-office/', 'https://nypost.com/2024/08/05/business/elon-musks-x-to-reportedly-shutter-san-francisco-office/', 'https://www.inkl.com/news/x-to-shut-down-flagship-san-francisco-office-report', 'https://www.kqed.org/news/11998860/x-reportedly-closing-san-francisco-office-amid-elon-musks-anti-california-turn', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/x-will-close-its-headquarters-after-elon-musk-trashed-san-francisco-but-he-s-not-done-with-california-yet/ar-AA1ohEzL']"
"Dow plunges more than 1,000 points amid fears of U.S.","

The US stock market experienced a significant decline on Monday, with the S&P 500 index falling 160 points, or 3%, to 5,186. This marked the index's biggest one-day drop in nearly two years. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also sank 3.4%, as investors sold off some of the big tech stocks that had previously driven the market higher. The Dow Jones fell 1,033.99 points, or 2.6%, to 38,703.27.

The market downturn was not limited to the US, as Asian and European markets also declined. Japan's benchmark stock index, the Nikkei 225, plummeted 12.4% on Monday, before rebounding nearly 11% on Tuesday. The yen reached a 7-month high against the dollar, as investors weighed the prospects of Federal Reserve rate cuts against higher rates in Japan. The decline in US stocks was attributed to a combination of factors, including recession fears and a surprise interest rate hike from the Bank of Japan last week.","['https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stock-market-today-dow-jones-s-p-500-down/', 'https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-nikkei-economy-c6240977e9482bf7207abc53b2a11e58', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/08/05/japan-stock-market-crash/', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/live-blog/us-stocks-lower-asia-europe-decline-impact-rcna165129', 'https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/08/05/stock-market-dow-jones-nasdaq-live-updates/74671156007/', 'https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/04/stock-market-today-live-updates.html', 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-news-today-global-stock-rout-deepens-as-dow-plunges-over-1100-points-sp-500-nasdaq-sink-3-200046148.html', 'https://nypost.com/2024/08/05/business/bloodbath-on-wall-street-as-dow-nasdaq-futures-plunge-amid-recession-fears/', 'https://www.independent.co.uk/business/stock-market-down-dow-jones-recession-b2591482.html', 'https://www.voanews.com/a/wall-street-headed-sharply-lower-again-after-japan-s-nikkei-index-tumbles-to-worst-loss-since-1987/7730241.html', 'https://www.dailywire.com/news/dow-drops-more-than-1000-points-as-global-markets-plunge-amid-recession-fears', 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-news-today-dow-plummets-700-points-nasdaq-and-sp-500-sink-as-global-sell-off-intensifies-160159048.html', 'https://www.kshb.com/politics/economy/dow-falls-1-000-points-amid-recession-fears', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/dow-falls-1-000-points-heightening-recession-fears-as-many-brokerages-report-errors/ar-AA1ohjcP', 'https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-crash-picks-up-recession-fears-carry-trade-unwind-2024-8', 'https://wzmq19.com/news/336567/stocks-plunge-amid-fears-of-economic-slowdown-experts-advise-long-term-investors-to-be-patient/', 'https://www.msn.com/en-in/money/markets/dow-plunges-more-than-1-000-points-as-global-stock-rout-deepens-on-recession-fear/ar-AA1ogItM?ocid']"

CrowdStrike says it isn't to blame for Delta's flight cancellations after July.,"

Delta Air Lines has rejected on-site help from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike following a massive outage last month that caused thousands of flight cancellations. The outage, which was caused by a botched software update, resulted in the cancellation of over 5,000 flights between July 19 and July 25, with estimated losses of around $500 million. Delta CEO Ed Bastian stated that the company had ""no choice"" but to seek damages from CrowdStrike and Microsoft, and has hired the law firm of David Boies to evaluate claims.

CrowdStrike has claimed that it offered Delta assistance several times, but was rebuffed. The company describes Delta's IT system as ""complex,"" which prompted manual recovery efforts. Delta has filed a lawsuit against CrowdStrike, which the cybersecurity firm has described as ""meritless."" CrowdStrike has expressed a desire to work cooperatively with Delta to find a resolution. The incident has also led to an investigation by the US Department of Transportation's Office of Aviation Consumer Protection.","['https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/05/crowdstrike-says-it-isnt-to-blame-for-deltas-flight-cancellations-after-outage.html', 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/crowdstrike-calls-out-delta-air-lines-for-misleading-narrative-on-outage/', 'https://www.aol.com/news/crowdstrike-says-isnt-blame-deltas-170312739.html', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/crowdstrike-says-delta-only-has-itself-to-blame/ar-AA1ohy0y?ocid', 'https://www.engadget.com/transportation/crowdstrike-says-deltas-woes-arent-its-fault-after-massive-it-outage-181803828.html', 'https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/crowdstrike-lashes-out-at-delta', 'https://viewfromthewing.com/deltas-lawsuit-against-crowdstrike-could-backfire-revealing-it-failures-and-damaging-premium-image/', 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com/ryanair-cancels-650-flights-boss-094415040.html', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/crowdstrike-is-denying-deltas-claims-it-was-to-blame-for-thousands-of-flight-disruptions/ar-AA1ofIXp', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/travel/news/crowdstrike-rejects-delta-s-claim-it-acted-inappropriately-after-it-outage/ar-AA1ofk2U?ocid', 'https://nonstop-news.com/world/crowdstrike-denies-responsibility-for-deltas-july-flight-cancellations/']"

"Buca di Beppo files for bankruptcy, plans to keep remaining 44 locations open.","Buca di Beppo, an Italian American restaurant chain, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company plans to use the bankruptcy process to restructure its operations and keep 44 locations open.

The company cited a significant drop in sales, rising food and labor costs, staffing challenges, and changes in consumer preferences as the reasons for the move.
