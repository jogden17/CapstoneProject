"Covid fell to the 10th leading cause of death last year, down from 4th in 2014.",https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death,"In 2021, the top 10 causes of death accounted for 39 million deaths, or 57% of the total 68 million deaths worldwide.



The top global causes of death, in order of total number of lives lost, are associated with two broad topics: cardiovascular (ischaemic heart disease, stroke) and respiratory (COVID-19, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower respiratory infections), with COVID-19 emerging as the second leading causes of death globally.



Causes of death can be grouped into three categories: communicable (infectious and parasitic diseases and maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions), noncommunicable (chronic) and injuries.



Leading causes of death globally



At a global level, 7 of the 10 leading causes of deaths in 2021 were noncommunicable diseases, accounting for 38% of all deaths, or 68% of the top 10 causes.

Leading causes of death in 2021 globally

The world’s biggest killer is ischaemic heart disease, responsible for 13% of the world’s total deaths. Since 2000, the largest increase in deaths has been for this disease, rising by 2.7 million to 9.1 million deaths in 2021. As a newly emerged cause of deaths, COVID-19 was directly responsible for 8.8 million deaths in 2021, and consequently, largely pushed down other leading causes of death by one place. Instead of being the second and third leading causes of death as in 2019, stroke and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease became the third and fourth in 2021, responsible for approximately 10% and 5% of total deaths, respectively.



Lower respiratory infections remained the world’s most deadly communicable disease other than COVID-19, ranked as the fifth leading cause of death. However, the number of deaths has gone down substantially: in 2021 it claimed 2.5 million lives, 370 000 fewer than in 2000.



Deaths from other noncommunicable diseases were also on the rise. Trachea, bronchus and lung cancers deaths have risen from 1.2 million in 2000 to 1.9 million in 2021 and are now ranked sixth among leading causes of death.



In 2021, Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia ranked as the seventh leading cause of death, killing 1.8 million lives. Women are disproportionately affected. Globally, 68% of deaths from Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia are women.



Diabetes was also among the top 10 causes of death, following a significant percentage increase of 95% since 2000.



Other diseases which were among the top 10 causes of death in 2000 are no longer on the list. HIV and AIDS are among them. Deaths from HIV and AIDS have fallen by 61%, moving from the world’s seventh leading cause of death in 2000 to the twenty-first in 2021. Similarly, deaths due to diarrhoeal diseases have dropped by 45%, from sixth leading cause of death in 2000 to thirteenth in 2021.



In contrast, kidney diseases have risen from the world’s nineteenth leading cause of death to the ninth, with number of deaths increasing by 95% between 2000 and 2021.



Leading causes of death by income group

The World Bank classifies the world's economies into four income groups (1) based on gross national income: low, lower-middle, upper-middle and high.

Leading causes of death in 2021 in low-income countries





People living in a low-income country are far more likely to die of a communicable disease than a noncommunicable disease. Despite the global decline, 8 of the top 10 causes of death in 2021 in low-income countries were communicable diseases.



Malaria, tuberculosis and HIV and AIDS all remain in the top 10. However, they all fell significantly. The biggest decrease among the top 10 deaths in this group has been for HIV and AIDS, with 63% fewer deaths in 2021 than in 2000.



Diarrhoeal diseases are also a significant cause of death in low-income countries: they ranked seventh leading causes of death for this income category in 2021. Nonetheless, diarrhoeal diseases are decreasing, representing the third biggest decrease in fatalities among the top 10 (in low-income countries, falling 38% in 2000 and 2021).



Deaths due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are particularly infrequent in low-income countries compared to other income groups. It does not appear in the top 10 for low-income countries yet ranks in the top 10 for all other income groups.



While the top killer in low-income countries was lower respiratory infections in 2021, COVID-19 ranked only the sixth, the lowest ranking of the diseases among all income groupings, killing a total of 258 000 people.

Leading causes of death in 2021 in lower-middle-income countries

Lower-middle-income countries have the most balanced top 10 causes of death: 5 noncommunicable, and 5 communicable, with the new cause COVID-19 topping the list and costing over 4 million lives in 2021. Diabetes is a rising cause of death in this income group: it has moved from the fourteenth to eighth leading cause of death and the number of deaths from this disease has more than doubled since 2000.



As a top 10 cause of death in this income group, tuberculosis and diarrhoeal diseases remain a significant challenge. However, these categories of disease saw substantial decreases in absolute deaths, both falling by about 47% between 2000 and 2021. The biggest increase in absolute deaths is from ischaemic heart disease, rising by more than 1.4 million since 2000 to 3.2 million in 2021. HIV and AIDS have seen the biggest decrease in rank among the previous top 10 causes of death in 2000, moving from seventh to nineteenth.

Leading causes of death in 2021 in upper-middle-income countries





In upper-middle-income countries, there has been a notable rise in deaths from lung cancer, which have increased by 442 000; more than 2.5 times the increase in deaths of all three other income groups combined. In addition, stomach cancer features highly in upper-middle-income countries compared to the other income groups, remaining the only group with this disease in the top 10 causes of death.



Deaths from ischaemic heart disease have increased by more than 1.4 million, the second largest rise in any income group in terms of absolute number of deaths from this cause, just 40 000 lower than the increase in lower-middle-income countries. In 2021, ischaemic heart disease ranked second, closely tracking stroke in total absolute number of deaths and one place ahead of COVID-19.



Other than COVID-19, there is only one communicable disease (lower respiratory infections) in the top 10 causes of death for upper-middle-income countries. It ranked eighth in 2021, down by 3 places since 2000.

Leading causes of death in 2021 in high-income countries

In high-income countries, deaths are increasing for the majority of the top 10 diseases in 2000, primarily due to population ageing. Exceptionally, schaemic heart disease, stroke and stomach cancer are among the causes of death in the top 10 for which the total numbers have gone down between 2000 and 2021 – by 15%, 18% and 19%, respectively. High-income is the only category of income group in which there have been decreasing numbers of deaths from these three diseases. Nonetheless ischaemic heart disease and stroke have remained in the top three causes of death for this income category, with a combined total of over 2.6 million fatalities in 2021. In addition, deaths from hypertensive heart disease are rising. Reflecting a global trend, this disease has more than doubled and risen from the sixteenth leading cause of death in 2000 to the tenth in 2021.



Deaths due to Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias have also increased dramatically, nearly four-fold since 2000. This became the fourth leading cause of death in high-income countries and is on track to overtake stroke as one of the top three.



COVID-19 claimed 1.2 million lives and ranked second in 2021 in high-income countries. As with upper-middle-income countries, only one other communicable disease – lower respiratory infections – appears in the top 10 causes of death.



Why do we need to know the reasons people die?



It is important to know why people die to improve how people live. Measuring how many people die each year helps to assess the effectiveness of our health systems and direct resources to where they are needed most. For example, mortality data can help focus activities and resource allocation in the health sector, as well as in other sectors such as transportation, food and agriculture, and the environment.



COVID-19 has highlighted the importance for countries investing in civil registration and vital statistics systems to allow daily counting of deaths and direct prevention and treatment efforts. It has also revealed inherent fragmentation in data collection systems in most low-income countries, where policy-makers still do not know with confidence how many people die and of what causes.



The World Health Organization develops standards and best practices for data collection, processing and synthesis through the consolidated and improved International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). This digital platform facilitates reporting of timely and accurate data for causes of death for countries to routinely generate and use health information that conforms to international standards.



The routine collection and analysis of high-quality data on deaths and causes of death, as well as data on disability– disaggregated by age, sex and geographic location – is essential for improving health and reducing deaths and disability across the world.

Editor’s note



WHO’s Global Health Estimates, from which the information in this fact sheet is extracted, present comprehensive and comparable health-related data, including life expectancy, healthy life expectancy, mortality and morbidity, and burden of diseases at global, regional and country levels disaggregated by age, sex and cause. The estimates released in 2024 report on trends for more than 160 diseases and injuries annually from 2000 to 2021.

EMBARGOED FOR 1 PM ET

U.S. death rates fell last year for all age groups compared with 2022, federal health officials said Thursday.

Here's what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data showed:

— COVID-19 fell to the 10th leading cause of death. Early in the pandemic, the coronavirus was the nation’s third leading cause of death. It dropped to fourth in 2022.

— The leading causes of death were heart disease, cancer and a category of injuries that includes gun deaths and drug overdoses.

— There were nearly 3.1 million deaths last year in the U.S., down from 3.3 million in 2022. For many years before the pandemic, deaths usually rose year-to-year, in part because the nation’s population grows. COVID-19 accelerated that trend, making 2021 the deadliest in U.S. history at 3.4 million deaths. But the number dropped in 2022 as the pandemic ebbed.

— Death rates by race and ethnicity were down for all groups, though disparities remain. Because certain populations are younger or older than others, scientists use age-adjusted death rates to compare groups. These age-adjusted death rates were lowest among multiracial people and Asian Americans, and highest among Black people.

The CDC provisional data is based on death certificate information collected so far. Final data is expected later this year.

Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for Disney

This article originally appeared on Healthline

Actor Daisy Ridley spoke in an interview about her Graves’ disease diagnosis.

Graves’ disease is an autoimmune condition that causes excess thyroid hormone.

Symptoms can include rapid heartbeat, weight loss, and protruding eyes.

It might be caused by a genetic predisposition combined with environmental triggers.

Treatment can involve medications, surgery, and lifestyle changes.

“Star Wars” star Daisy Ridley revealed in the August 6, 2024, issue of Women’s Health that she was diagnosed with Graves’ disease in September of 2023.

According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), Graves’ disease is an autoimmune disorder affecting the thyroid, a small gland in the front of the neck often described as being shaped like a butterfly.

Graves’ disease occurs when the immune system begins to attack the thyroid as if it is an outside invader, causing the gland to become overactive. NIDDK explains that this can cause the body’s functions to speed up.

Ridley told the magazine that she first realized that something was not right when she began to experience hot flashes and fatigue after the completion of her movie Magpie, in which she plays a woman involved in a troubled relationship.

“I thought, Well, I’ve just played a really stressful role; presumably that’s why I feel poorly,” she told Women’s Health.

Upon learning of her symptoms — which also included hand tremors, a racing heart, and weight loss — her primary care doctor referred her to an endocrinologist, who diagnosed her as having the autoimmune condition.

Ridley additionally described to the publication how it felt to finally understand why she had felt so bad: “It was funny, I was like, ‘Oh, I just thought I was annoyed at the world,’ but turns out everything is functioning so quickly, you can’t chill out.”

Ridley has also previously spoken about her diagnoses of endometriosis and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), which research suggests are linked with a higher risk for Graves’ disease.

What are the symptoms of Graves’ disease?

Micheal O. McKinney, MD, a physician with Healthy Outlook, said that Graves’ disease results in the excessive production of thyroid hormone, a condition known as “hyperthyroidism.”

When this occurs, it can have various metabolic and systemic complications, he explained.

Some of the symptoms you might experience, per McKinney, include:

Unusual or very fast heartbeats

Weight loss, even if you eat more than you need

Anxiety and being easily annoyed

Trembling hands or fingers

Inability to tolerate heat accompanied by perspiration for no reason

Protruding eyes (Graves’ ophthalmopathy)

Fatigue and muscle weakness

Enlarged thyroid gland, also known as “goiter”

“It’s worth mentioning that these symptoms develop gradually over time, so they may resemble other illnesses,” he added, “thus demanding specific testing for accurate diagnosis.”

How to reduce your risk of Graves’ disease

John Lowe, MD, a physician at Restore Care, explained that the exact causes of Graves’ disease are unknown.

However, certain factors such as genetic predisposition and environmental triggers may contribute to its occurrence, he said.

To minimize your risk, Lowe said, “Relax through practicing yoga, meditation, and physical exercises effectively.”

“Avoid smoking since it increases the risk and severity of Graves’ ophthalmopathy,” he added. Graves’ ophthalmology is a condition in which swelling around the eyes makes them bulge out.

Additionally, you’ll want to be consistent about getting medical checkups of your thyroid health, especially if you have a family history of thyroid conditions, said Lowe.

Treatments for Graves’ disease

Lowe described several medical treatments for Graves’ disease. Among these are:

Antithyroid Medications. “These drugs reduce the production of thyroid hormones and may then bring their levels back to normal,” he said.

Radioactive Iodine Therapy . This treatment involves taking radioactive iodine by mouth in order to destroy the overactive cells, per Lowe.

Beta-Blockers. “ Such medications are useful in managing symptoms like fast heartbeats and tremors,” he said, “but they do not address the underlying cause of hyperthyroidism which is associated with them.”

Surgery . Lowe said that sometimes, if other treatments haven’t worked or are not appropriate for the patient, it may be necessary to perform a thyroidectomy to remove all or part of the gland.

Lifestyle Adjustments: “Eating healthy foods, regular exercise, and stress management techniques can help to promote overall well-being as well as alleviate some of the symptoms,” he said.

Lowe concluded by noting that Graves’ disease is treatable through both medical intervention and lifestyle changes.

“It is important to diagnose and treat it early enough since any delay may lead to complications as well as affect one’s quality of life significantly,” he said.

Takeaway

“Star Wars” actress Daisy Ridley revealed in a Women’s Health interview that she had been diagnosed with Graves’ disease, an autoimmune thyroid condition that causes an overproduction of thyroid hormone.

It can lead to symptoms of thyroid hormone excess, such as weight loss, rapid heartbeat, and protruding eyes.

The causes of Graves’ disease are unknown, although it may be due to a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental triggers.

However, it can be treated with medications, surgery, and lifestyle adjustments.

What Are Liège Waffles?

For starters, you may be wondering how a Liège waffle differs from a Belgian waffle, which Trader Joe’s also sells. According to the TJ’s website, this recipe hails from a city in Belgium called Liège, and it’s different from your average waffle in a few key ways.



On top of your typical dough, flour, yeast, water, and salt, a Liège waffle is made with cultured butter and egg, and has crumbly pearls of sugar thrown in, giving it its signature soft yet crunchy texture. Given this ingredient list, it’s no surprise that Liège waffles are wonderfully dense with a buttery, brioche-like flavor. Liège waffles are also smaller yet thicker than standard waffles, and these can be enjoyed straight out of the package—no cooking required.



As one enthusiastic Reddit user put it: “[These are] delicious. Grabbed a pair at the checkout line yesterday. Should have added at least 4 more. [I] threw them in the microwave for 20 seconds. So good.”



The Trader Joe’s Brioche Style Liège Waffles retail for $3.99, and inside you’ll find six individually wrapped waffles. These crunchy circles of buttery goodness make the perfect breakfast, afternoon snack, or dessert. Need proof? TJ’s shoppers, being the creative, amazing people that they are, have already come up with a ton of different ways to enjoy these treats.

How to Eat Liège Waffles

Before experimenting with these waffles, we recommend trying ‘em straight up with a cup of coffee or tea, ideally toasted or tossed in the air fryer for a few minutes, so you can enjoy them in their purest form and get an idea for how you might want to jazz them up. Here are a few ways to eat Liège waffles:

Waffles à la Mode

Did you know “à la mode” translates to “in style” in french? When it comes to pie (or in this case, waffles) it means plopping a generous scoop of your favorite ice cream on top. For the best results, make sure the waffle is warmed through first. A dollop of fresh whipped cream or a drizzle of chocolate syrup wouldn’t hurt either.

Liège Waffle Breakfast Sandwich

Liège waffles are inherently sweet, but that doesn’t mean they can’t work in savory dishes. In fact, for many fans, this is where they really shine. As TikTok user @hollywooddivanjl demonstrated, using TJ’s Liège waffles as the bread for a breakfast sandwich that includes fluffy eggs, savory cheese, and crispy bacon is a fantastic way to start your day. “This right here is amazing,” she declared.

Waffles with Fruit

Not an à la mode fan? Try à la fruit! It’s summer, so there’s plenty of fresh, ripe fruit to be had, and you might as well put it to good use. Raspberries, peaches, and plums would be great additions to this waffle. Bonus points if you sauté the fruit with some butter and sugar, then add a bit of whipped cream for a decadent touch.

Waffles au Mascarpone

According to a Reddit user who goes by @Nervouspie, mascarpone and some pantry staples are the way to go. “Get mascarpone cheese, vanilla bean paste, and honey, mix it all together, and top with strawberries” the user gushed. “[It’s] absolutely heaven.”

Waffles with Cookie Butter

When it comes to Liège waffles, it’s all about the toppings. Take a page from TikTok user @traderjoestreasurehunt’s book and top your waffle with fresh banana slices and another TJ’s staple—Speculoos Cookie Butter. To get that more runny consistency that’s ideal for drizzling, simply microwave your cookie butter for about 10 seconds. Delish!

"Artificial sweetener erythritol could elevate heart disease risk, preliminary research suggests.",https://www.aol.com/grandson-says-carter-coming-end-192453072.html,"Jimmy Carter’s grandson said Tuesday that the former president is “coming to the end” in a brief update about the 39th president’s health.

“(My grandfather) is doing OK,” Jason Carter said at a mental health forum named in honor of his grandmother, the late former first lady Rosalynn Carter, at the Carter Center. “He has been in hospice, as you know, for almost a year and a half now, and he really is, I think, coming to the end that, as I’ve said before, there’s a part of this faith journey that is so important to him, and there’s a part of that faith journey that you only can live at the very end and I think he has been there in that space.”

Jimmy Carter, now 99, became the oldest living president in history after George H.W. Bush died in 2018 at the age of 94. He has survived metastatic brain cancer, liver cancer and a number of health scares, including brain surgery after a fall in 2019. He entered hospice care in February 2023 after a series of hospital stays and made a rare public appearance to attend his wife’s memorial service back in November.

“My grandmother’s passing was a difficult moment for all of us, including my grandfather,” Jason Carter said Tuesday. But, he added, “The outpouring of love and support that we, as a family, received from people in this room and from the rest of the world was so remarkable and meaningful to us. And it really turned that whole process into a celebration.”

Rosalynn Carter made mental health advocacy one of her key areas of focus as Georgia and America’s first lady. In 1977, Carter made it her signature cause, notably through the creation of the President’s Commission on Mental Health. Her efforts resulted in increased research funding, broader treatment access and innovative approaches to mental health care.

Jason Carter said that moments with his grandfather over the past year reminded him of the mental illness aspects related to caregiving, another cause his grandmother championed.

During the speech, he recounted one conservation with the former president as they watched an Atlanta Braves game together.

“I said, ‘Pa Pa … people ask me how you’re doing and I say I don’t know.’ And he said, ‘Well, I don’t know myself.’ And so, he’s still there,” Jason Carter said, laughing.

The former president’s health has been the subject of widespread attention in recent years, especially since he entered hospice. Speaking with CBS in February, Jason Carter said his grandfather’s spirit was “as strong as ever.”

The former president is widely revered for his championing of human rights. His brokering of the Camp David Accords in 1978 with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin remains central to his legacy.

A peanut farmer and US Navy lieutenant before going into politics, Carter, a Democrat, served one term as governor of Georgia before serving as president of the United States from 1977 to 1981.

IF YOU FREQUENT bodybuilding TikTok, you're probably familiar with the substance shilajit.

“Shilajit has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for centuries, but it’s been making the rounds on TikTok lately thanks to claims that it promotes muscle growth, increases male fertility, and enhances sexual health,"" says Kim Yawitz , R.D. ""In fact, many people refer to it as ‘natural Viagra.’”

Sounds too good to be true—because it might be. Ahead, what dietitians want you to know about this trendy supplement.

What is shilajit?

The black tar-like substance has been used for centuries for anti-aging and medicinal properties among Ayurvedic practitioners.

Christiane Matey, R.D.N., founder of MINT Nutrition says it roots in Ayurvedic medicine, which has been practiced in Eastern cultures for thousands of years. Every once in a while, a trend creeps its way into Western culture. “Herbs like ashwagandha, ginseng, and curcumin bring many health benefits and are now commonly used in America. Shilajit, a nutraceutical known for its medicinal properties, seems to be the latest trend.”

Shilajit, sometimes called mumijo or mumie, is available as a supplement in powder, and liquid form. In its natural form, it's a resin-like substance that’s found in the Himalayans and other mountain ranges in Asia and Russia.

“Its origins are a bit of a mystery . Some researchers believe it’s a byproduct of plant decomposition, while others have theorized that it comes from animal excrement or the rocks themselves,” she says. Shilajit contains dozens of minerals and other nutrients—most notably an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compound called fulvic acid.

Its composition differs based on its origins, so there are several variations of shilajit, Matey says. Generally, it contains an abundance of humic acid, potassium, magnesium, zinc, selenium, calcium, protein, fatty acids, and bioactive compounds.

Does shilajit have health benefits?

Unclear.

Overall, very few studies have been conducted on shilajit, says Yawtiz. Most of them have been small and short-term. “We’d need quite a few more high-quality studies to know for sure if there’s any benefit to taking shilajit,” she says.



With that in mind, there are a few small studies that suggest that taking shilajit may boost testosterone levels, improve exercise performance , and protect against cognitive decline —part of the reason it's gaining traction online.

In one 2016 study , men taking 250 milligrams of shilajit daily had significant increases in testosterone and DHEA (both necessary for muscle growth and sexual performance) after 90 days, says Yawitz. A 2021 study on adults with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease showed significant improvements in their mental state after taking a combination of shilajit and B-vitamins for 24 weeks.

While preliminary results are promising, research is too limited to be considered scientifically significant.

Does taking shilajit have risks?

Shilajit has generally been well-tolerated in those small clinical trials—but that doesn’t necessarily mean that all supplements are safe. “Researchers in one study analyzed samples of shilajit and found potentially toxic amounts of heavy metals —including mercury, lead, and chromium—in some of them,” Yawitz says.

As always, before adding any supplement to your routine, it’s important to talk with your doctor or dietitian. If your trusted healthcare professional has given you the green light for shilajit, Matey recommends choosing a product that is medical grade, lab-tested, purified and screened for toxic components.

Because shilajit hasn’t been studied much and isn’t regulated by the FDA, there’s no accepted recommended dose. “Based on a small handful of clinical trials, low doses (250 to 500 milligrams daily) appear to be safe and well-tolerated ,” but—you guessed it—there haven’t been enough studies to know if it’s safe in higher doses or when taken long-term, says Yawitz.

Side effects can include toxicity from impure supplements, allergic reactions, blood sugar dysregulation, gastrointestinal issues, nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps and diarrhea, Matey says. Talk to your doctor about any contraindications with current medications you might be taking. “Individuals with hemochromatosis, thalassemia, or sickle cell anemia should avoid taking shilajit,” Matey says.

Should you take a shilajit supplement?

The short answer: Probably not.

At this point, Yawitz concludes there are not enough scientific evidence to support taking shilajit supplements. “Sure, there are studies suggesting that taking it could bring about certain health benefits. However, most of these studies have very small sample sizes, making it difficult to draw any conclusions for the general population.”

Be aware of fake shilajit products on the market, too. Shilajit is very difficult to harvest , and the FDA doesn’t regulate dietary supplements, so it's easy for producers to put out fake, and dangerous, products. “Unless you can find a product that’s been tested by a reputable third party (like NSF or Informed Choice), there’s really no guarantee you’re buying pure shilajit,” she says.

"New study shows a single experimental shot reduces HIV levels 1,000-fold.",https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-experimental-shot-hiv.html,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

A study in nonhuman primates found a dramatic decrease in levels of the monkey form of HIV after one shot of Therapeutic Interfering Particles, or TIPs. The study’s results suggest that one TIP shot could prevent a person living with HIV from passing the virus onto anyone else. Results from this research will be used to inform a planned clinical trial in people. Credit: OHSU/Christine Torres Hicks

A single shot of an experimental injection dramatically reduces levels of the monkey form of HIV in nonhuman primates for at least 30 weeks, according to a study published today in Science. The new research suggests that the lab-made shot has the potential to offer a simple and durable alternative to the current standard treatment for people living with HIV, which is effective but demanding.

The collaborative study between Oregon Health & Science University and the University of California San Francisco found Therapeutic Interfering Particles, or TIPs, reduced HIV levels in nonhuman primates by at least 1,000-fold in five of six treated subjects. The primate form of HIV was so low in one treated animal that the virus became undetectable.

TIPs are small, lab-engineered segments of the HIV virus that do not cause disease. TIPs reproduce so rapidly that they compete with HIV and are designed to suppress HIV in an infected person. The study's corresponding author, University of California San Francisco virologist Leor Weinberger, Ph.D., first came up with the idea for TIPs in the early 2000s through computational research. He then refined the concept with laboratory research and mouse models.

""There's really nothing that can change the course of disease like this,"" said co-author Nancy Haigwood, Ph.D., a professor at OHSU's Oregon National Primate Research Center. ""If TIPs can reduce HIV in people like it has in our nonhuman primate study, this technology could open the door to alternative approaches to HIV care and mean people won't have to take medications for the rest of their lives. That is incredibly exciting.""

Four years ago, Weinberger proposed a joint study with Haigwood, who has focused her four-decade research career on testing HIV and AIDS vaccines and treatments in nonhuman primate models. For this study, teams of UCSF and OHSU researchers evaluated TIPs in nonhuman primates for the first time. Results from this research will be used to inform a planned clinical trial in people.

""This 20-year-long research journey opens the door to a future where people living with HIV may no longer have to adhere to continual drug regimens,"" Weinberger said. ""These primate studies show the promise of a single-dose TIP intervention and are a strong indicator of efficacy in human trials.

""The real test, of course, will be the upcoming human clinical trials,"" he continued. ""But, if TIPs prove effective, we could be on the brink of a new era in HIV treatment that could bring hope to millions of people—particularly in areas where access to antiviral drugs remains a challenge.""

The current standard HIV treatment involves taking a personalized combination of antiretroviral medications on a daily basis. Antiretroviral therapy enables people to live long, full lives and can enable most people to achieve undetectable HIV levels. However, the medications are potent and can cause numerous side effects, including diarrhea, fatigue, mood changes and high cholesterol. And missing scheduled antiretroviral therapy doses can lead HIV to become resistant to that combination of drugs, leaving a patient with fewer treatment options.

Another treatment option is lab-made antibodies, but the infusions must be given regularly throughout a person's lifetime. Having the option of a single, long-lasting injection could reduce both the burden and the expense of HIV treatment.

For this study, the research team—including Ann J. Hessell, Ph.D., a professor at OHSU's Oregon National Primate Research Center, and professor Jacob Estes, Ph.D., director of OHSU's Vaccine & Gene Therapy Institute—injected nonhuman primates with TIPs and then exposed them to the primate form of HIV 24 hours later. An additional four nonhuman primates were infected, but not treated, and served as controls for the study.

Scientists observed all 10 of the nonhuman primates for 30 weeks, regularly analyzing samples of blood and tissue from the lymph nodes, where reservoirs of HIV are concentrated in people living with HIV. Repeated, quantitative analyses showed all but one of the treated animals consistently had substantially lower levels of both HIV DNA and RNA than the controls.

The 1,000-fold reduction in HIV levels that the team observed is three times more than what can delay people with HIV from developing AIDS.

Using data from this study, the researchers conducted mathematical modeling to determine that a single TIP injection has the potential to permanently reduce viral levels below the World Health Organization's threshold for HIV transmission. This means that while the findings need to be confirmed with human studies, the study's results suggest that one TIP shot could prevent a person living with HIV from passing the virus onto anyone else.

The research team also did not observe recombination, or when two different viral strains infect a single cell at the same time and the strains exchange genetic material to create a hybrid with portions of both strains. Recombination is a major cause of HIV variation, which partly makes the virus so challenging to treat. The absence of recombination indicates that TIPs won't make managing HIV more difficult down the road.

Weinberger, Haigwood and colleagues are conducting a follow-up nonhuman primate study to assess how a single TIPs injection could work after infection is already established and controlled with antiretroviral therapy, to control virus when the therapy is halted.

Mpox outbreak puts Africa on the brink of an official public health emergency. CDC likely to declare an emergency.,https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/08/mpox-outbreak-puts-africa-on-brink-of-official-public-health-emergency,"The head of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said the agency is likely to declare a continental public health emergency over the growing mpox outbreak.

The Africa CDC’s director general, Dr Jean Kaseya, said on Thursday that because of the increase in mpox cases and its continued spread across borders, he had resolved to start “active engagement” with African Union member states to prevent the outbreak from becoming “another pandemic”.

“We are committed to mobilising resources and providing technical assistance to affected countries to control the outbreak,” said Kaseya.

A total of 887 new confirmed and suspected cases of mpox have been reported on the continent this past week, pushing the year’s total to 15,132, according to data presented at the briefing. The cases have increased by 160% compared with the same time period last year.

Sixteen countries have reported cases of the disease so far, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has more than 90% of them, and 461 people have died from it this year.

Some countries – Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda – have reported it for the first time ever, Kaseya said. “This new incident demonstrates the need for a collective and collaborative approach in curbing the spread of the disease,” he added.

Kaseya’s announcement came a day after the World Health Organization director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he would convene an emergency committee to determine whether the spread of mpox on the continent should be declared a global emergency.

The process of declaring a continental public health emergency entails technical and strategic consultation between the Africa CDC, which is an agency of the 55-member African Union, and affected member states. An extraordinary summit for heads of state follows to discuss a response.

Mpox is a viral disease that causes painful rashes and flu-like symptoms such as fever, headaches and body aches. The virus that causes it comes from the same family as that of smallpox. It spreads from person to person and from animals to people through direct contact.

In May, scientists reported a new strain of the virus in the DRC that they said was more virulent and might spread more easily. First recorded in a human in 1970 in what is now the DRC, mpox was declared a global emergency in 2022 when it spread to more than 70 countries.

While countries in the west have controlled the spread of the disease through vaccines, Kaseya cited their shortage in Africa as a major challenge in controlling its spread on the continent, saying there were only 200,000 doses available compared with a demand of at least 10m. He said Africa CDC was working with international partners to secure more vaccines.

Last week, the AU made an emergency approval of $10.4m (£8.2m) to Africa CDC to support efforts to combat the mpox outbreak."

Mpox outbreak puts Africa on the brink of an official public health emergency. CDC likely to declare an emergency.,https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/08/what-do-we-know-mpox-outbreak-africa,"Many countries in Africa are experiencing more cases of mpox. The deadly virus is crossing national borders and there are fears it could cause a significant global outbreak. As world health leaders consider labelling this a public health emergency, here is what we know so far.

What is mpox? Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is an infectious disease caused by a virus. Flu-like symptoms including fever, chills and muscle aches are typically followed by a rash that starts as raised spots, which turn into blisters filled with fluid. These eventually form scabs. There are broadly two different types, known as “clades”. Clade I was once known as the Congo Basin clade, and clade II as the West African clade. Both can be fatal, although clade I historically has a higher death rate.

Where are infections happening? Thirty-four countries in Africa are either reporting infections or considered “at high risk”, an Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) briefing was told. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is experiencing a severe outbreak with more than 14,000 reported cases and 511 deaths since the start of 2024. Outbreaks in the DRC are not unusual but this year’s figure already matches the total for the whole of 2023, and includes cases in previously unaffected provinces. Infections are also being reported in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, neighbouring countries to the DRC where cases had previously not occurred.

Why are cases rising now? A new offshoot of clade I, clade Ib, has been detected in the east of the DRC and has been confirmed in Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda. Scientists believe this variant is playing a role in the spread. Clade I has, in the past, typically spread by people eating infected bushmeat. Clade Ib is spreading person to person, often via sexual contact, but also through other physical and face-to-face contact, or via contaminated bedding or towels. Dr Rosamund Lewis, the World Health Organization (WHO) lead for mpox, said: “We don’t know that it’s more transmissible, but it is transmitting through an efficient mode.” Other forms of the virus remain in circulation. The DRC is also recording cases of clade Ia, as is the Central African Republic. Clade II has been reported in Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Nigeria and South Africa, according to the WHO. The increase comes amid high levels of insecurity in the region, and the climate crisis is bringing humans into closer contact with nature, which are also factors according to Dr Jean Kaseya, the head of Africa CDC.

How worried should people be? The situation is “alarming”, according to Kaseya. He plans to declare the outbreak a “public health emergency of continental security” next week – the first time Africa CDC has made such a declaration. This will allow greater coordination between countries as they respond, and require more information sharing between member states. The WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, is gathering experts to decide whether the mpox outbreak represents a “public health emergency of international concern” – a definition that covered the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2022 mpox outbreak first detected in Europe.

How is it spreading and who is infected? The virus is crossing borders with infected people on the move. Kenyan authorities diagnosed mpox in a long-distance lorry driver who had also been in Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. Mpox is also spreading through sexual networks. Sex workers originally made up a high proportion of those infected. In the DRC, more than 70% of cases are in under-18s. Experts say this may reflect differences in their immune system, with high rates of malnourishment leaving children vulnerable to infections. While older people in the region may have had a smallpox vaccination, which offers some protection, this is not the case for younger generations.

Do we have vaccines? There are vaccines but issues with access. Africa CDC says it needs 10m doses, but only 200,000 are available. A lack of treatments and diagnostics is hampering the response. Plans for vaccination programmes remain under review but are likely to involve tracing and vaccinating contacts of cases and targeting groups such as people living with HIV, who appear to be at higher risk of severe disease. The WHO has triggered an emergency use listing for two vaccines, which allows organisations such as Gavi and Unicef to procure them for distribution."
Mpox outbreak puts Africa on the brink of an official public health emergency. CDC likely to declare an emergency.,https://www.arabnews.com/node/2565086/amp,"NAIROBI: The African Union’s health watchdog said on Thursday it was “likely” to declare a public health emergency next week over the growing mpox outbreak on the continent.

The decision will unlock funding to combat the outbreak, including the procurement of much-needed vaccines, and trigger a coordinated continental response to the virus.

Jean Kaseya, head of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), said during an online media briefing that the declaration of the health emergency was “likely” next week.

At least 16 countries of the continent’s 55 nations have been affected with mpox, according to the Africa CDC.

Some 38,465 cases and 1,456 deaths have been reported in Africa since January 2022.

Of these, 887 cases and five deaths were reported last week, according to data from Africa CDC.

“We are moving from two outbreaks per week to three new outbreaks per week,” Kaseya said, adding that there was a shortage of vaccines on the continent.

Formerly known as monkeypox, mpox is an infectious disease caused by a virus transmitted to humans by infected animals but can also be passed from human to human through close physical contact.

The disease causes fever, muscular aches and large boil-like skin lesions.

The World Health Organization announced Wednesday it was urgently convening an expert committee to advise on whether the growing mpox outbreak in Africa should be declared an international emergency.

“The committee will meet as soon as possible and will be made up of independent experts from a range of relevant disciplines from around the world,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press conference.

The committee will advise him on whether the outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) — the highest alarm the WHO can sound.

Only Tedros, as the WHO director-general, can declare a PHEIC, based on the expert committee’s advice. A declaration then triggers emergency responses in countries worldwide under the legally binding International Health Regulations.

Mpox was first discovered in humans in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

There are two subtypes of the virus: the more virulent and deadlier Clade I, endemic in the Congo Basin in central Africa; and Clade II, endemic in West Africa.

In May 2022, mpox infections surged worldwide, mostly affecting gay and bisexual men, due to the Clade IIb subclade.

Deadlier and more transmissible than previous forms, the mpox strain surging in the DRC since September, known as the Clade Ib subclade, is spread person-to-person.

The Clade Ib strain causes skin rashes across the whole body, unlike other strains where lesions and rashes are usually limited to the mouth, face and genitals."

The World Health Organisation (WHO) will convene an expert group to determine if the increasing spread of the mpox virus in Africa warrants being declared a global emergency. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press briefing in Geneva that, given the increasing spread of mpox cases beyond Congo, he has decided to ask independent experts to advise WHO ""as soon as possible"".

Last week the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) reported that mpox, also known as monkeypox, has been detected in 10 African countries this year including Congo, which has more than 96 per cent of all cases and deaths. Compared with the same period last year, the agency said cases are up 160 per cent and deaths have jumped by 19 per cent.

Officials at the Africa CDC said nearly 70 per cent of cases in Congo are in children younger than 15, who also accounted for 85 per cent of deaths. Mpox was reported last week in Burundi and Rwanda for the first time while other countries including Kenya and the Central African Republic also identified cases.

The director-general said the WHO has released one million dollars (£788,000) from its emergency fund to support the response. Earlier this year, scientists reported the emergence of a new form of the deadlier version of mpox, which can kill up 10 per cent of people, in a Congolese mining town that they feared might spread more easily among people.

Mpox spreads via close contact with infected people, including via sex. In 2022, WHO declared mpox to be a global emergency after it spread to more than 70 countries, mostly affecting gay and bisexual men.

Before that outbreak, the disease had mostly been seen in sporadic epidemics in central and West Africa when people came into contact with infected animals. Western countries mostly shut down the spread of mpox with the help of vaccines and treatments, but very few of those have been available in Africa.

Maria Van Kerkhove, who leads WHO's outbreak department, said there were numerous concerning issues in Africa's mpox epidemic and called for a more urgent response. ""We do not want the world to sit and watch and wait,"" she said. ""The time (to act) is now."""

"What is cortisol? How to lower levels amid concerns over ""cortisol face""?",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-to-lower-cortisol-levels-cortisol-face-concerns/,"TikTok ""cortisol face"" may not actually be caused by stress, study finds TikTok ""cortisol face"" may not actually be caused by stress, study finds 01:12

""Cortisol face"" is a trending topic on TikTok — but what is cortisol, exactly? And can it really impact your face shape?

Cortisol is a hormone that mainly helps regulate your body's response to stress.

TikTok users have recently garnered attention with videos blaming increased stress, which can stimulate the release of cortisol, for facial puffiness and swelling, which they refer to as ""cortisol face.""

Experts say that while the hormone can impact your face in some ways, it's not like some of the posts suggest.

Cortisol can affect your skin by increasing oil gland production, which can result in clogged pores and worsening acne.

""When you are stressed, your body releases stress hormones that have a tremendous impact on your entire body, including your skin,"" dermatologist Dr. Samer Jaber, of Washington Square Dermatology in New York, recently told CBS News.

But everyday stress does not raise cortisol levels high enough or long enough to cause significant facial swelling and bloating, CBS Boston's Dr. Mallika Marshall explained. If you are feeling a little more puffy than usual, Marshall said to limit your salt intake, drink more water and get adequate sleep.

People with Cushing syndrome, who have chronically high levels of cortisol, and people who take steroids for long periods of time, can develop what's known as ""moon facies,"" or a ""moon face."" This refers to the buildup of fat on either side of the face, which gives it a rounder or puffier appearance.

Earlier this year, Amy Schumer revealed her Cushing syndrome diagnosis after receiving comments about her appearance following several TV interviews. The actress and comedian said her condition was caused by getting steroid injections in high doses, which are sometimes prescribed to treat endometriosis, although Schumer did not specify why she received them.

Symptoms of high cortisol levels

It's normal to have natural fluctuations of cortisol throughout the day, Dr. Natalie Gentile previously told CBS Pittsburgh.

Blood, urine or saliva tests can be used to measure cortisol levels, but there are also signs that can point to someone with too much cortisol (like someone with Cushing syndrome) or too little cortisol, which is known as adrenal insufficiency.

Common signs and symptoms of higher-than-normal cortisol levels, according to the Cleveland Clinic, include:

Weight gain, especially in your face and abdomen

Fatty deposits between your shoulder blades

Wide, purple stretch marks on your belly

Muscle weakness in your upper arms and thighs

High blood sugar

High blood pressure

Excessive hair growth on the face, chest and back

Weak bones and fractures

Symptoms can vary depending on how elevated cortisol levels are. If you notice persistent swelling of your face, abdomen or legs, see a health care professional to rule out any serious medical conditions, Marshall said.

How to lower cortisol

Keeping cortisol levels at an optimal ranges goes back to ""lifestyle basics,"" Gentile said, which includes getting quality sleep and moving regularly.

""Sleeping is huge for cortisol,"" she said. ""So getting proper, quality sleep — and if you're not, figuring out why.""

Other things to keep in mind include hydration, nutrition and mental health, Gentile said.

""If we can get in more colorful fruits, vegetables, our whole grains, our legumes... that can be very helpful,"" she said.

For Cushing syndrome or adrenal insufficiency, medical treatment is typically needed to regulate levels, so it's important to talk to a health care professional."
"After a social media outcry, CDC tells doctors to better manage IUD pain.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/08/08/iud-pain-cdc/,"Amid a nationwide outcry from women who say they experienced severe pain when getting an intrauterine device, new federal health guidelines published Thursday are urging health-care providers to address the problem. The recommendations, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), advise clinicians to counsel patients about the potential for pain during IUD placement and give them options to help manage it before undergoing the procedure.

“I think it’s excellent guidance,” said Eve Espey, chair of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists’ Contraceptive Equity Expert Work Group and the OB/GYN department at the University of New Mexico. “It’s helping ensure we listen to our patients’ needs and preferences for outpatient procedures that may be painful.”

The issue has gained prominence in recent years as IUDs have become an increasingly popular contraceptive option for younger women and teens, who have taken their concerns about the sometimes painful procedure to social media. (Because younger patients typically have not given birth, IUD placement can be more painful for this age group.)

Earlier this year, The Washington Post reported that numerous women were using their smartphones to document their screams, tears and distress during the IUD insertion process. In social media posts, patients who have experienced IUD pain have described the procedure in graphic terms, including as an “explosion of cramps,” a sensation of “pulling, pushing and slicing” or being “cut or ripped open inside.”

Many of these patients said they were not warned of the potential for pain or given adequate options to manage it.

Local anesthetics, sedation and other options are available for IUD placement, but many clinicians do not readily offer them. Research also shows that physicians and other providers underestimate pain during IUD insertions. In a study of 200 women, most of whom had given birth, the women reported an average maximum pain score of nearly 65 on a scale of 0 to 100. The providers, however, rated the women’s pain at about 35.

Physicians have said that determining the best pain control can be difficult because patient’s preferences and experiences vary, and there are not enough effective options or guidelines on when to use them.

Often, over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications such as Ibuprofen are the only options recommended to help manage IUD pain, despite the fact that research shows they are largely ineffective.

The CDC said health-care providers can use the recommendations, which were updated after a review of available scientific evidence in January 2023, “to support person-centered contraceptive counseling and remove unnecessary medical barriers to accessing and using contraception.”

In its previous recommendations in 2016, the CDC outlined medications “to ease IUD insertion,” suggesting the advice was aimed, at least in part, at helping the provider complete the procedure. The updated version uses more patient-centered language.

Advertisement

The new guidance states that before placing an IUD, “all patients should be counseled on potential pain during placement as well as the risks, benefits and alternatives of different options for pain management. A person-centered plan for IUD placement and pain management should be made based on patient preference.”

The advice also broadens pain control options to include topical lidocaine, which may include a numbing gel or spray. The previous guidance mentioned only lidocaine injections given in the cervix called a paracervical block. Some studies show paracervical blocks can help with pain, while others have shown they do not. Although the CDC said lidocaine “might be useful for reducing patient pain,” the agency did not specifically advise clinicians to use it.

The new guidance also states that misoprostol, a medication that helps soften the cervix, is not recommended for routine IUD insertions but may be useful in certain circumstances such as in cases in which previous insertions have been unsuccessful.

Advertisement

Physicians say the new guidance emphasizes that there is no one-sized-fits-all approach to pain control.

“Shared decision-making is necessary to arrive at an individualized plan reflecting each patient’s unique context, values and preferences,” Monica Dragoman, system director of the complex family planning division at Mount Sinai Health System, said in an email."

"Heavy cannabis use may increase the risk of certain cancers, new study finds.",https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/heavy-cannabis-use-may-increase-risk-certain-cancers-new-study-finds-rcna165651,"Regular heavy marijuana use may increase a person’s risk of developing some head and neck cancers, a study published Thursday in JAMA Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery found.

The study found that heavy cannabis users were between 3.5 and 5 times more likely to develop head and neck cancers than those who didn’t use the drug regularly.

Head and neck cancers are cancers of the mouth, throat and nasal cavity and are twice as common in men than in women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The research adds to a somewhat muddy body of evidence that’s just beginning to explore the impact cannabis may have on cancer risk.

“The cannabinoids themselves could be carcinogenic, and it could also be that the smoke itself has potential for carcinogenesis,” said lead study author Dr. Niels Kokot, a head and neck surgeon at Keck Medicine of the University of Southern California.

Kokot and his team used 20 years of data from a global database called TriNetX, which included patient information from 64 health centers throughout the United States. Of the more than 4 million people included, about 116,000 had been diagnosed with cannabis use disorder between April 2004 and April 2024. The diagnoses were based on self-reported use of the drug — in other words, the patient had to tell a health care provider how often they used cannabis and how it affected them.

The researchers compared people with cannabis use disorder to those of a similar age and sex in the study without cannabis use disorder. The majority of the people with cannabis use disorder in the study were white. None had a history of head and neck cancer before the study began.

The cannabis users in the study were more likely to develop all types of head and neck cancer except hypopharyngeal cancer, a type of lower throat cancer, compared with nonusers. The most common types of head and neck cancer in both groups were oral cancers and cancer of the larynx.

The study authors noted there were several limitations that could skew the study’s findings. The first is that it’s very difficult to measure how many people regularly use cannabis when relying on self-reported data.

To be in this group, people would have had to tell a health care provider during a visit that they used cannabis very frequently — the equivalent of smoking about a joint per day, said Dr. Joseph Califano, director of the Gleiberman Head and Neck Cancer Center at the Moores Cancer Center at the University of California, San Diego, who was not involved with the research.

The same is true for alcohol and tobacco use.

“The tough thing about this study and almost every study that looks at cannabis use is that we just don’t have the data,” said Califano, who wrote an editorial that was published alongside the new study.

The study also looked at head and neck cancer diagnoses at two points in time: within the first year of being diagnosed with cannabis use disorder and five years or beyond the diagnosis. It excluded, however, cancers found between one and four years after a cannabis use disorder diagnosis. This secondary analysis was used to determine how strong the association was: If it remained after five years, it’s more likely the association was strong.

They found that after five or more years, the cannabis use disorder group still had higher overall rates of head and neck cancer, but there was no longer a significantly increased risk for some specific types, including oral, laryngeal and oropharyngeal cancer.

“You would expect that over time, there would be an accumulative effect,” said Dr. Glenn Hanna, a medical oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute’s Center for Head and Neck Oncology.

It’s still unclear what role dose, frequency and how a person ingests cannabis may affect their cancer risk. Califano noted that the new research links the increased risk to self-reported heavy users of cannabis, not occasional users.

Past studies that have investigated whether cannabis use increases a person’s risk for head and neck cancer have yielded mixed results. The new study highlights the need for continued research on the subject, especially as daily marijuana use grows in popularity, Hanna said.

Despite the study’s limitations, “it still suggests there could be some association,” he said.

Cannabis and cancer risk

The cannabis plant contains more than 100 cannabinoids, including THC and CBD, and hundreds of non-cannabinoid chemicals. Scientists are just beginning to understand the effect these compounds have on the human body, both good and bad.

“Cannabinoids are powerful drugs that exert their effects at concentrations found with recreational use. We know that because you get high,” Califano said, noting that it’s almost unheard of to find a truly pure form of a single cannabinoid, such as CBD.

Hanna said that smoking anything, including cannabis, activates inflammatory pathways that could be involved in cancer formation. Cannabinoids could also become carcinogenic in the body.

“There are biological reasons why someone would hypothesize that cannabis smoke could be harmful, but we’re not sure what the degree of increased risk is, if there is one, with head and neck cancer,” he said, noting that it’s difficult to tease out other risk factors, such as alcohol and tobacco use. About 20% of the people in the study with cannabis use disorder reported frequent tobacco and alcohol use, compared with about 2% in the group without cannabis use disorder.

Keeping this in mind, edible cannabis may be safer than smoking the plant, Hanna said, acknowledging some of his patients use medical marijuana for health conditions.

But Califano said there’s reason to suspect some cannabinoids themselves — rather than the smoke — might be behind the increased cancer risk, if future research establishes a clear connection.

“Cannabinoids have a lot of effects that drive immune response and all these other things that are involved with either how cancer develops or how our bodies fight cancer,” he said. “So it’s not unreasonable to think about the cancer-associated effects of cannabis use to be independent of whether or not you ingest smoke or vape or bake them into your brownies.”

Hanna and Califano acknowledge that cannabis likely has both positive and negative effects on health. As research uncovers more about the impact cannabis has on the body, it’s likely that different cannabinoids will be found to have different effects on cancer risk.

“Some of them may be associated with cancer development, some may actually inhibit cancer development,” Califano said."
"Heavy cannabis use may increase the risk of certain cancers, new study finds.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/08/health/marijuana-head-and-neck-cancer-wellness/index.html,"CNN —

Using marijuana daily for years may raise the overall risk of head and neck cancers by 3.5% to 5%, according to a new study that analyzed millions of medical records.

“Our research shows that people who use cannabis, particularly those with a cannabis use disorder, are significantly more likely to develop head and neck cancers compared to those who do not use cannabis,” said senior study author Dr. Niels Kokot, a professor of clinical otolaryngology-head and neck surgery at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.

Cannabis use disorder is diagnosed when a person has two or more of such symptoms as craving weed, becoming tolerant to its effects, using more than intended, using marijuana even though it causes problems in life, using it in high-risk situations, experiencing withdrawal and being unable to quit, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“While our study did not differentiate between methods of cannabis consumption, cannabis is most commonly consumed by smoking,” Kokot said in an email. “The association we found likely pertains mainly to smoked cannabis.”

Some 69% of people with a diagnosis of oral or throat cancer will survive five years or longer after their diagnosis, according to the National Cancer Institute. If the cancer metabolizes, however, that rate drops to 14%. About 61% of people diagnosed with cancer of the larynx will be alive five years later — a rate that drops to 16% if the cancer spreads.

The study used insurance data to look at the association of cannabis use disorder with head and neck cancers, said Dr. Joseph Califano, the Iris and Matthew Strauss Chancellor’s Endowed Chair in Head and Neck Surgery at the University of California, San Diego. He was not involved in the study.

“The researchers used a huge, huge dataset, which is really extraordinary, and there is enormous power in looking at numbers this large when we typically only see small studies,” said Califano, who is also the director of UC San Diego’s Hanna and Mark Gleiberman Head and Neck Cancer Center.

“On average, people with cannabis use disorder smoke about a joint today and do so for at least a couple years, if not longer,” said Califano, who coauthored an editorial published Thursday in JAMA Otolaryngology–Head & Neck Surgery in conjunction with the new study.

However, he added, the study does not find an association between “the occasional recreational use of marijuana and head and neck cancer.”

Causes of head and neck cancers

In the United States, head and neck cancers make up 4% of all cancers, with more than 71,000 new cases and more than 16,000 deaths expected in 2024, according to the National Foundation for Cancer Research.

Tobacco use, which includes smoking cigarettes, cigars, pipes and smokeless tobacco, and the use of alcohol are the two most common causes of head and neck cancers, experts say. Other risk factors include poor oral hygiene; gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD; a weakened immune system; and a diet low in fruits and vegetables. Occupational risk factors include exposure to asbestos and wood dust.

A growing number of head and neck cancers are due to infection with the human papillomavirus or HPV, or the Epstein-Barr virus, or EBV, which are DNA viruses that affect genes, making them susceptible to malignancies.

Epstein-Barr virus is linked to infectious mononucleosis, also called the “kissing disease,” as well as various cancers. Researchers estimate that 90% of the world’s population is infected with EBV. A vaccine is available for HPV, which is linked to a high risk of developing cervical cancer and some non-Hodgkin lymphomas.

It’s possible to be infected with both viruses at once, and that combination is responsible for 38% of all virus-associated cancers, according to research.

How might cannabis cause cancers?

The study, published Thursday in JAMA Otolaryngology–Head & Neck Surgery, analyzed a database of 4 million electronic health records and found more than 116,000 diagnoses of cannabis use disorder among people with head and neck cancers. Those men and women, whose average age was 46, were then matched with people who also had head and neck cancers but were not diagnosed with cannabis use disorder.

The analysis showed that people with cannabis use disorder were about 2.5 times more likely to develop an oral cancer; nearly five times more likely to develop oropharyngeal cancer, which is cancer of the soft palate, tonsils and back of the throat; and over eight times more likely to develop cancer of the larynx. The findings held true for all age groups, according to the study.

Smoke is one key reason for the association between smoking weed and head and neck cancers, experts say. Smoking tobacco doubles the risk of developing head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, which makes up 90% of all head and neck cancers. Heavier tobacco use leads to even higher risk, and when alcohol is added, the risk is even greater.

Due to the way marijuana is smoked — unfiltered and breathed in deeply and held in the lungs and throat for a few seconds — the risk from cannabis smoke could be even greater, experts say.

Another key to the puzzle of how cannabis causes cancer: Research has found a link between various cannabinoids and tumor growth. There are more than 100 cannabinoids — biological compounds in the cannabis plant that bind to cannabinoid receptors in the human body, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. All told, there are about 540 chemicals in each marijuana plant.

Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is the substance that makes one euphoric, while cannabidiol, or CBD, has been shown to have medicinal uses for childhood seizures and epilepsy.

“Part of the research we have already published shows that THC or THC-like compounds can certainly accelerate tumor growth,” Califano said. “We also have some data to show that cannabinoids enhance the growth of HPV-related throat cancers.”

With the use of marijuana rising, there is concern that diagnoses of head and neck cancers could increase in coming years, Kokot said.

“Especially as (marijuana) becomes more widely legalized and socially accepted, we may see a corresponding rise in head and neck cancer cases if the association is confirmed,” he said.

“This underscores the importance to inform people about the potential risks and conduct further research to understand the long-term impacts of cannabis use on cancer development.”"
"Heavy cannabis use may increase the risk of certain cancers, new study finds.",https://nypost.com/2024/08/08/lifestyle/marijuana-use-tied-to-higher-risk-of-head-neck-cancers-study/,"Here’s some sobering news for stoners.

Frequent, heavy pot smoking may raise the risk for head and neck cancers, a new University of Southern California study finds.

Marijuana users are between 3.5 and 5 times more likely to develop those cancers, known as HNCs, than those who pass on joints, according to research published Thursday in JAMA Otolaryngology – Head & Neck Surgery.

“This is one of the first studies — and the largest that we know of to date — to associate head and neck cancer with cannabis use,” said Dr. Niels Kokot, a head and neck surgeon at Keck Medicine of USC and senior author of the study. “The detection of this risk factor is important because head and neck cancer may be preventable once people know which behaviors increase their risk.”

HNCs, which include cancers of the oral and nasal cavities, pharynx, larynx, salivary glands and thyroid, account for nearly 3% of cancer diagnoses and more than 1.5% of cancer deaths in the US.

Meanwhile, marijuana is “the most commonly used illicit substance worldwide,” per the study, with usage steadily increasing over the past decade.

HNCs have previously been linked to excess alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking, and people who do both are at greater risk of developing these cancers than those who only drink or only smoke.

The USC researchers noted that studies that have explored the association between cannabis and HNC risk have produced inconsistent results.

For their research, they compared the medical data of 116,000 people, divided among marijuana users who had reported to a health professional that they were dependent on pot and non-users with similar health characteristics. The USC researchers analyzed 20 years of this medical data.

They found that pot may prove more hazardous than cigarettes in terms of HRCs, even though cannabis smoke contains carcinogens similar to those found in tobacco products.

“Compared with smoking tobacco, smoking cannabis may be even more pro-inflammatory. Cannabis smoking is typically unfiltered and consumed through deeper breaths than tobacco,” the study authors wrote. “Additionally, cannabis burns at a higher temperature than tobacco, increasing the risk of inflammatory injury.”

While the evidence suggests a relationship between HNCs and cannabis, researchers admit their study has limitations. Among these is a lack of information regarding dosage, frequency and method of marijuana use.

4 The study does not take into account methods of consumption. ststoev – stock.adobe.com

Northwell Health’s Dr. Michael Blasco, the director of head and neck oncology and reconstruction at Staten Island University Hospital, said he has questions about the study.

“Is there a difference in patients that, for example, use edibles or gummies or brownies versus people who smoke it? And if they do smoke it, how are they smoking it? Or are they vaping?” wondered Blasco, who was not involved in the research.

“I would say, in general, we know that there’s a link between head and neck cancer now in cannabis, and we don’t know what the safe threshold is or if there even is one,” he added. “And we don’t know if there’s a safe method of using it.”

The USC researchers say future studies that explore this association should include “more thorough data on cannabis use.”"
"Heavy cannabis use may increase the risk of certain cancers, new study finds.",https://www.health.com/pesticides-cancer-risk-smoking-study-8687856,"Pesticide exposure—especially near farming communities—may be contributing to cancer rates comparable to those caused by smoking, a new report has found.

Pesticides were most strongly associated with leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and bladder cancer.

The report emphasizes the need for stricter regulations on pesticide use and better ways to use pesticides without exposing so many people, experts said.

Pesticides may lead to as many cancers as cigarettes, a well-known carcinogen, according to new research.

The authors of the new report, published in the journal Frontiers in Cancer Control and Society, explored how pesticide use in agricultural hotspots contributes to cancer rates in the communities around those settings.

Pesticides were most strongly associated with leukemia, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and bladder cancer.

“We were not focusing on specific compounds, but [instead] looking at the big picture,” Isain Zapata, PhD, researcher at Rocky Vista University and author of the new paper, told Health.

The study highlighted the fact that pesticides are inescapable for many Americans, and experts said it should be a reminder of how our farming practices affect our health and well-being.

“Pediatric cancer rates, cancer rates in younger adults, and cancer rates in certain ethnic/racial groups are increasing,” Lauren Petrick, PhD, professor in the Department of Environmental Medicine and Public Health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, who was not involved with the new study, told Health. “While we don’t know if these increased rates are due to environmental factors alone or in combination with genetic differences, we do know that where you live matters. For example, studies repeatedly show that living close to pesticide use is linked to increased risk of pediatric and adult leukemia.”

Though the study suggests the risk of cancers related to pesticide use may be highest in or around farming communities, it also emphasizes the widespread use of pesticides and the reality that they affect the health and well-being of everyone in the United States—regardless of their socioeconomic status.

Despite the fact that pesticide use has been linked to cancers as well as problems with the nervous system, skin, eyes, and endocrine system, it’s an essential tool for producing enough food to feed the world’s population. “There is no alternative,” Zapata said. “If we’re going to continue having the produce that we need, we need to use [pesticides].”

While the authors ultimately concluded that pesticides may contribute to as many cancers as smoking, it’s important to make the distinction between the function of smoking and that of pesticides in terms of public health, Zapata said. “Smoking was not benefiting anything [in our society], but agriculture feeds us,” he explained.

How Pesticides Influence Cancer Rates

Zapata and his team decided to conduct the research to learn more about the ways in which pesticides affect not just agricultural workers, but the population more broadly. They conducted what is known as an ecological study, or a study in which scientists ask a question regarding a whole population.

For the report, the researchers looked at data on pesticide use and cancer rates across the US. The team looked at how a variety of different pesticides are used. Zapata said looking at data this way can be more helpful than thinking about pesticide use in terms of one particular product that has been linked to negative health effects, since pesticides are used in conjunction with other pesticides. “We’re not really thinking about what is the most noxious compound,” he explained. All told, his team reviewed the usage of 69 different pesticides. Data on pesticide use came from the United States Geological Survey.

The researchers found that pesticide use is associated with increased rates of leukemia, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, as well as cancers of the bladder, lung, colon, and pancreas. The team was able to contextualize just how widespread the impact of pesticide use is by comparing it to a carcinogen most people are aware of: “Pesticides have a significant effect on increasing cancer risk for all the cancer types evaluated…in a way that is only matched by smoking prevalence,” the authors wrote. The data on cancer incidence rates came from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) State Cancer Profiles database.

The study authors found that the region most affected by pesticide use—in terms of cancer rates—was the Midwest, which is responsible for much of the country’s agricultural output.

Before this research, experts already knew that pesticides could be dangerous: Glyphosate, sold as Roundup, was classified as a probable carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, and other agents, including parathion, diazinon, tetrachlorvinphos, and malathion, had shown “some evidence of carcinogenicity,” the study authors wrote.

One of the strengths of the study was that the authors looked at confounding variables—such as smoking rates, socioeconomic disadvantages, and more—when they assessed cancer rates to try to explain what the true burden of cancers related to pesticide use might be.

But the study was also limited: The team did not have uniform data sets from all U.S. counties. It’s also crucial to understand that the research did not prove a causal relationship: The study authors did not conclude that pesticide use definitely causes cancer rates similar to those caused by smoking.

What Future Research Needs to Explore to Determine the Relationship Between Pesticides and Cancer

Though it’s easy to understand the ways in which agricultural workers are exposed to pesticides, it may be harder to conceptualize the ways in which people who do not work in agriculture—or who live and work miles away from agricultural settings—are exposed at levels that may affect cancer risk.

Weather can influence exposure, and some levels of pesticides can remain on food that gets sold at the supermarket, Zapata said. Though organic food may be, on the whole, healthier, there is still some risk involved in eating organic food: “We think organic food is ‘clean,’ but it’s not necessarily ‘clean,’” Zapata said.

Though the news is alarming, it’s important to put it into perspective: A wide variety of things contribute to cancer risk—such as age, alcohol use, diet, chronic inflammation, diet, obesity, sunlight, and more. Experts said the takeaway from this research is that we need more research.

Since we can’t grow the amount of food needed to feed the population without pesticides, the answer to reducing this problem could be to invest in the development of application techniques that give agricultural workers more control when using pesticides so as not to expose so many people to them, Zapata said. “We need more efficient ways of using these chemicals, but before that, we need to understand how much we are using and enhance our monitoring of [pesticide use],” he explained.

We also need continued research on the effects of pesticides. “Studies in human populations are now emerging, strengthening the evidence linking pesticides to cancers, and supporting the need for regulation to reduce human exposure to pesticides,” Petrick said.

"Heavy cannabis use may increase the risk of certain cancers, new study finds.",https://www.healthday.com/health-news/cancer/heavy-marijuana-use-more-than-triples-odds-for-head-neck-cancers,"THURSDAY, Aug. 8, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- People who use marijuana at high levels are putting themselves at more than three times the risk for head and neck cancers, new research warns.

The study is perhaps the most rigorous ever conducted on the issue, tracking the medical records of over 4 million U.S. adults for 20 years.

Given the surging popularity of marijuana, cases of head and neck cancers ""attributable to cannabis will continue to increase, and perhaps dramatically,"" wrote a team of oncology experts led by Dr. Joseph Califano of the University of California, San Diego.

Their commentary accompanied the new findings, which were published Aug. 8 in the journal JAMA Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery.

The study was co-led by Dr. Niels Kokot, a professor of clinical otolaryngology-head & neck surgery at the University of Southern California (USC), in Los Angeles.

Head and neck cancers include tumors of the mouth, throat, windpipe and salivary glands. According to the American Cancer Society, these cancers affect more than 58,000 Americans each year, with a death toll of more than 12,000.

Kokot's team noted that cannabis, especially when smoked, is far from harmless to human cells.

Tobacco smoke has long been a big risk factor for head and neck cancers, and Kokot's team noted that ""the smoke content of cannabis contains carcinogens similar to those found in tobacco.""

There's also evidence that the cannabinoid compounds found in weed could have ""tumor-promoting activities,"" although the jury is out on any definite links to cancer.

The new study focused on patient information from a major database of U.S. medical records.

Kokot's team first looked at over 116,000 records for people diagnosed with problematic ""cannabis-related disorder,"" meaning they used the drug daily.

They compared rates of head and neck cancers in that group to those of another 4 million patients without cannabis use disorder.

""We found that the relative risk of developing head and neck cancer for those with cannabis-related disorders ranged from 3.5 to 5 times that of those without cannabis-related disorders,"" the researchers reported.

The study couldn't confirm cause-and effect, but the authors noted that risks tended to rise as years spent with a cannabis use disorder increased.

Risks for specific cancers could rise dramatically.

For example, chronic marijuana users had nearly five times the risk or oropharyngeal (tongue, palate, upper throat and tonsils) tumors, and more than eight times the odds for cancers of the larynx (the area of the throat around the voice box).

Smoked marijuana is probably the most carcinogenic means of ingesting the drug, the USC team said, and it might be even more harmful than cigarette smoking.

""Cannabis smoking is typically unfiltered and consumed through deeper breaths than tobacco,"" they noted.

The findings were enough to convince one head and neck cancer specialist of the dangers.

""Now we know that there is a link between cannabis use and head and neck cancer -- I would say that we've proven that link,"" said Dr. Michael Blasco. He directs head and neck oncology and reconstruction at Northwell Health in Staten Island, N.Y.

""We don't necessarily know what the threshold is that seems to greatly increase the risk, but we know that heavy users have higher rates, so I would 100 percent tell patients that there's a link between head and neck cancer and cannabis use,"" he said.

The new study supports the notion that marijuana is far from harmless, Blasco added.

""This is a part of a growing body of literature that's showing that there are measurable negative health effects from cannabis use,"" he said. ""Whether that's effects on the lungs, whether that's effects on the mood and addiction. And then this is part of a growing body of literature that suggests association with cancers. So, we're learning more and more about the long-term health effects of cannabis.""

A study from the USC Head and Neck Center, part of Keck Medicine of USC and the USC Caruso Department of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery, suggests that cannabis, the most commonly used illicit substance worldwide, is associated with an increased occurrence of head and neck cancer.

A large, multicenter study published in JAMA Otolaryngology—Head & Neck Surgery revealed that adults with cannabis dependence, known as cannabis use disorder, are 3.5 to 5 times more likely to develop head and neck cancer than those who do not use the substance.

""This is one of the first studies—and the largest that we know of to date—to associate head and neck cancer with cannabis use,"" said Niels Kokot, MD, a head and neck surgeon with the USC Head and Neck Center and senior author of the study. ""The detection of this risk factor is important because head and neck cancer may be preventable once people know which behaviors increase their risk.""

Kokot is also a professor of otolaryngology—head and neck surgery at the Keck School of Medicine of USC.

Head and neck cancer, the sixth most common cancer in the world, includes several cancers, including cancer of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, oropharynx (tongue and tonsils and back wall of the throat) and adjacent salivary glands.

The researchers, including lead study author Tyler Gallagher, an MD/MPH candidate at the Keck School, discovered that those with cannabis use disorder had higher rates of all types of head and neck cancers. They also found that the prevalence of head and neck cancer among those with cannabis use disorder was independent of other factors, such as age, gender and ethnicity. Alcohol and tobacco use, which have been associated with head and neck cancer, also did not play a role in the findings.

Kokot and his fellow researchers hypothesize that the primary reason cannabis raises the risk of head and neck cancer is because of the damaging effect of the smoke. Cannabis is primarily consumed through inhalation (even though the study did not distinguish between methods of consumption).

Additionally, research has shown that tobacco smoke contains numerous chemicals that cause DNA damage and inflammation to the area, which, if unchecked, can lead to cancer, and they speculate that cannabis smoke may cause similar harm.

In fact, there is some evidence, Kokot theorizes, that the smoke from cannabis may even be worse than tobacco smoke.

""Cannabis smoking is typically unfiltered and involves deeper inhalation compared to tobacco,"" he said. ""Additionally, cannabis burns at a higher temperature than tobacco, increasing the risk of cancer-causing inflammation.""

Kokot would like to see further research examining the link between cannabis and head and neck cancer. In the meantime, he hopes this study will help people make more informed choices and raise awareness about the link between head and neck cancer and cannabis use.

To reach their conclusions, the researchers compiled 20 years of data through a health research network of 64 health care organizations that accounted for more than 90 million individuals. They tracked cancer cases from one to five years of cannabis use."
"Heavy cannabis use may increase the risk of certain cancers, new study finds.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-13724219/smoking-cannabis-increase-head-neck-cancer.html?ns_mchannel,"Heavy marijuana use may raise the risk of multiple types of head and neck cancers, a study warns.

Researchers found a link between smoking cannabis daily and an up to nine-fold increase in various cancers of the mouth, throat and nose.

The study only looked at the heaviest users - those so addicted to weed that it was impacting their lives.

But experts are concerned about the implications for recreational users.

Writing in the study, the team said it 'has substantial public health implications given that cannabis use is rising among young adults with trends toward legalization.'

A study published this week found that heavy marijuana users could be up to nine times more likely to develop head and neck cancer

Federal research has shown that cannabis use is growing, particularly in Americans under the age of 30

The academics believe cannabis smoke may irritate the upper airways and cause DNA damage that leads to the formation of cancer.

The findings come just weeks after the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) downgraded marijuana's legal classification.

It was moved from Schedule 1, which has the highest potential for abuse, to Schedule 3, alongside the likes of ketamine and some anabolic steroids.

Schedule 3 drugs are still controlled substances and subject to rules and regulations, and people who traffic in them without permission could still face federal criminal prosecution.

This rescheduling, however, will not automatically legalize marijuana for the whole US. Recreational marijuana is currently legal in 24 states, and 13 allow for limited medicinal use.

As the substance becomes legal in more states, use and addiction has also become more prevalent. An NIH-funded study, for example, found that marijuana use among young adults reached an all-time high of one in 12 in 2021.

Rates surged the most in states like California, which legalized recreational cannabis in 2018.

A slew of recent studies have linked heavy marijuana use to health issues like heart attacks, strokes, and some forms of cancer, including head and neck cancers.

Head and neck cancers, which include tongue, tonsil, and gum cancer, are also on the rise, with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) estimating a one percent increase year over year since 2012.

Experts believe this could be due to increasing cases of human papillomavirus (HPV) and an increase in alcohol use, which can stimulate the production of cancer cells.

Recreational marijuana is legal in 24 states, though others have legalized it only for medicinal purposes

In the new study, published Thursday in JAMA Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, researchers analyzed data from more than 230,000 adults, half of whom were diagnosed with cannabis use disorder at some point between April 2004 and April 2024.

Those who used marijuana heavily were about 42 years old on average, while the average age of those who did not use marijuana was 60.

Heavy marijuana users were anywhere from six to nine times more likely to develop different forms of head and neck cancer than those who did not use the substance.

Overall, cannabis users were three times more likely to develop any form of head and neck cancer.

With a nine-fold increase, the highest risk was seen in cancer of the larynx, or voice box. This form of the disease, which affects 13,000 Americans and kills about 3,500 per year, is typically caused by excessive tobacco and alcohol use.

The team believes that cannabis aggravates cells in the airways, leaving them more vulnerable to damage and less able to fend off cancer cells. However, they stated that more research is needed.

The study had several limitations, namely focusing only on heavy marijuana users instead of more casual users. It's also unclear exactly how much cannabis the users consumed and how often they engaged in the habit."

11:50 AM – Thursday, August 8, 2024

A new study has claimed that smokers who partake in heavy marijuana use are “significantly more likely to develop head and neck cancers.”

“Our research shows that people who use cannabis, particularly those with a cannabis use disorder, are significantly more likely to develop head and neck cancers compared to those who do not use cannabis,” said Dr. Niels Kokot, a professor of clinical otolaryngology-head and neck surgery at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.

Head and neck cancers include cancers of the throat, the trachea, salivary glands, as well as tumors in the mouth.

Kokot’s team explained “the smoke content of cannabis contains carcinogens similar to those found in tobacco.”

Kokot’s study focused on those diagnosed with problematic “cannabis-related disorders,” which is diagnosed when a person has two or more of the following symptoms: frequently craving cannabis, becoming tolerant to its effects (having a high tolerance), using more than intended, using even if it causes problems in daily life, using in high-risk situations, those experiencing mental withdrawal, and generally being unable to quit, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

The study was conducted by looking at over 116,000 records of people who were diagnosed with a problematic cannabis-related disorder. The rate of head and neck cancers were examined in that group in comparison to a group of head and neck cancer patients who do not have a cannabis use disorder.

“We found that the relative risk of developing head and neck cancer for those with cannabis-related disorders ranged from 3.5 to 5 times that of those without cannabis-related disorders,” Kokot’s research team wrote.

The study mainly focuses on cannabis usage by way of smoking, as it is “most commonly consumed by smoking,” Kokot wrote. “The association we found likely pertains mainly to smoked cannabis.”

Additionally, Dr. Michael Blasco, the director of the head and neck oncology and reconstruction at Northwell Health in Staten Island, weighed in on the research findings.

“Now we know that there is a link between cannabis use and head and neck cancer – I would say that we’ve proven that link,” Blasco stated. “We don’t necessarily know what the threshold is that seems to greatly increase the risk, but we know that heavy users have higher rates, so I would 100 percent tell patients that there’s a link between head and neck cancer and cannabis use.”

“This is a part of a growing body of literature that’s showing that there are measurable negative health effects from cannabis use,” he continued. “Whether that’s effects on the lungs, whether that’s effects on the mood and addiction. And then this is part of a growing body of literature that suggests association with cancers. So, we’re learning more and more about the long-term health effects of cannabis.”

Covid-19 is on the up as a summer surge hits 40 Olympic athletes, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned.

A top official said the number of people testing positive for Covid across 84 countries has been rising, with the virus circulating at unusual levels for the summer months.

Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, technical consultant for the WHO, told journalists in Geneva on Monday: “Data from our sentinel-based surveillance system across 84 countries reports that the per cent of positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 has been rising over several weeks.

“Overall, test positivity is above 10 per cent, but this fluctuates per region. In Europe, per cent positivity is above 20 per cent.”

New waves of infection have been registered in the Americas, Europe and the western Pacific.

The latest data on Covid-19 cases in UK show a 4.5% increase in infections ( UKHSA )

“In recent months, regardless of the season, many countries have experienced surges of Covid-19, including at the Olympics where at least 40 athletes have tested positive,” Dr Van Kerkhove said.

The WHO’s warning comes amid a summer surge of Covid in the USA, while rates of people testing positive for Covid in the UK were up by 8 per cent in the week of 24 July.

US-based expert and physician Eric Topol warned of a new variant set to become dominant in the US, KP.3.1.1.

He said on the social media platform X: “Buckle up; this wave isn’t over yet.”

The WHO has urged eligible people to take up their vaccines.

“I am concerned...With such low coverage and with such large circulation, if we were to have a variant that would be more severe, then the susceptibility of the at-risk populations to develop severe disease is huge,” Dr Van Kerkhove said.

Last week the UK government’s Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisations said those eligible for autumn jabs will include adults aged 65 years and over, residents in a care home for older adults and individuals aged six months to 64 years in clinical risk groups."

The latest COVID-19 variant has infections surging worldwide, including at the Olympics where 40 athletes from various countries have tested positive. And they are unlikely to decline anytime soon, WHO warned during a United Nations press conference on Tuesday.

“In recent months, regardless of the season, many countries have experienced surges of COVID-19, including at the Olympics where at least 40 athletes have tested positive,” said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, director of epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention at the World Health Organization, on Tuesday.

Globally, the test positivity rate is about 10%, but it's 20% in Europe, Van Kerkhove said. In the United States, there was a dip in reported positive COVID-19 tests, but that has changed in the last several months. The Centers for Disease Control reported around a 2% increase in positive tests as of the week of July 27 with a 16.3% positive test rate.

Here's everything to know about the latest variant and how Tennessee is being affected.

What is the dominant COVID-19 variant?

The latest dominant COVID-19 variant is KP.3.1.1, according to the latest projections from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

""The KP.3.1.1 variant is very similar to other circulating variants in the United States. All current lineages are descendants of JN.1, which emerged in late 2023,"" Rosa Norman, a spokesperson at the CDC, previously told USA TODAY.

CDC's Nowcast data tracker, which displays COVID-19 estimates and projections for two-week periods, projects the KP.3.1.1 variant accounting for 27.8% of positive infections, followed by KP.3 at 20.1% in the two-week stretch starting July 21 and ending Aug. 3.

COVID-19 in Tennessee

As of July 30, COVID-19 infections were growing in 35 states or territories, including Tennessee and much of the South, according to the CDC.

Tennessee's latest COVID-19 statistics from the last 180 days finishing on Aug. 3, has seen more than 63,000 positive COVID-19 cases reported, of that 602 people have been hospitalized and 399 deaths related to COVID-19 have been reported to the state.

Since July 1, the number of daily cases reported has nearly doubled from 341 cases on July 1 to 747 cases on July 29.

Should I get a COVID-19 vaccine booster shot?

It may be time to get an updated COVID-19 vaccine for 2023-2024. Here's what the CDC recommends if you are wondering if you need to get an updated vaccine:

Everyone aged 5 years and older should get one dose of an updated COVID-19 vaccine to protect against serious illness from COVID-19.

Children aged 6 months to 4 years may need multiple doses of COVID-19 vaccines to be current, including at least 1 dose of updated COVID-19 vaccine.

People who are moderately or severely immunocompromised may get additional doses of the updated COVID-19 vaccine.

People aged 65 years and older who received one dose of any updated 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna or Novavax) should receive an additional dose of an updated COVID-19 vaccine at least four months after the previous updated dose.

New Covid variant surges as Brits told to 'buckle up' as officials warn of summer wave

Brits have been told to ""buckle up"" as a new covid variant has been found just as families get ready for a summer break.

The new variant has been given the code KP 3.1.1 and has been rapidly spreading across the UK. The strain is now believed to be the cause of around 50 per cent of cases in the US, with officials now warning of a ""summer wave"" of infections.

Earlier this month, molecular medicine professor Eric Topol said the strain could present a challenge to people's immune responses. The Scripps Research professor added: ""The KP.3.1.1 variant is on the move to become dominant, more of a challenge to our immune response than KP.3 and prior variants (especially without new KP.2 booster when we need it for high-risk individuals).""

He added: ""Buckle up; this wave isn't over yet [due to] KP.3.1.1's emergence."" The number of daily infections increased to 900,000 in the US, a sharp rise of 59 per cent than the 12-month average for the country.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and prevention, Covid-related Emergency department visits have increased by 12.1 per cent from July 27 to August 5.

The Office for National Statistics said there were 199 Covid-linked deaths in the week ending July 26. The number has steadily risen from July 12 where the total was 197.

Doctor Nili Kaplan-Myrth MD said in an August 2 post on X/Twitter: ""So many patients of all ages sick right and none of them aware that Covid19 is surging globally.

""#YallMasking and #SaltingtheVibes are cute, but we need leaders to get the message out to the public. And to be honest that we're imperfect."""
COVID-19 variant KP.3.1.1 becomes dominant in the US.,https://www.inkl.com/news/baby-dies-from-whooping-cough-as-england-s-death-toll-reaches-10,"Another baby has died from whooping cough, bringing the number to 10 in just seven months.

Officials at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) have urged pregnant women to get vaccinated after cases of whooping cough hit 10,493 in June.

Between December and June, 10 babies under three months died after having contracted the pertussis virus.

Since 2013, there have been 30 infant deaths. Of those, 24 mothers had not been vaccinated in pregnancy, according to the UKHSA.

The latest data shows whooping cough peaked in May but has continued at high levels with 2,427 cases reported in June.

Women can usually get vaccinations for whooping cough midway through their pregnancy, at 20 weeks. It provides 92 per cent protection from infant death.

Babies should then be vaccinated with infant doses at eight, 12 and 16 weeks after birth.

However, vaccine uptake in pregnant women, babies and young children fell from 74.7 per cent in December 2017 to 58.9 per cent in March 2024.

According to the UKHSA, whooping cough goes through waves of community infection every three to five years. The last peak in the UK occurred in 2016, following an earlier one in 2012.

While most cases were in those aged 15 years or older, more than 300 have been reported in babies under three months old, who are at the greatest risk from the infection.

Confirmed cases in the second quarter, from April to June, exceeded those in any quarter of the last major whooping cough outbreak in 2012.

Dr Mary Ramsay, director of immunisation at the UKHSA, said: “Vaccination is the best defence against whooping cough and it is vital that pregnant women and young infants receive their vaccines at the right time.

“Pregnant women are offered a whooping cough vaccine in every pregnancy, ideally between 20 and 32 weeks. This passes protection to their baby in the womb so that they are protected from birth in the first months of their life when they are most vulnerable and before they can receive their own vaccines.

“With cases continuing to rise and, sadly, 10 infant deaths since the outbreak began last November, ensuring women are vaccinated in pregnancy has never been more important.”

When children are three years and four months old, they will be offered the four-in-one pre-school booster, which protects against pertussis."

These projections, known as spike proteins, are also used as targets by our immune systems and vaccinations. Symptoms and signs listed by the NHS include a fever or chills as well as a cough, shortness of breath, fatigue and muscle or body aches.

Headaches, a loss of taste or smell and sore throat are also listed as well as a runny nose, nausea or vomiting and even diarrhea. Lawrence Young, a virus expert and professor of molecular oncology at the U.K.'s University of Warwick, previously told Newsweek, ""We need to keep monitoring the spread of this variant.""

COVID-19 variant KP.3.1.1 becomes dominant in the US.,https://legalinsurrection.com/2024/08/media-touts-another-covid-variant-in-quest-for-more-pandemic-mania/,"Clearly, the media’s quest for the latest pandemic to cover is not going well.

Bird flu isn’t spreading among humans, and when someone does catch it, it simply results in “pink eye.” The super-monkeypox seems to be confined to Africa currently.

So, it’s back to stories about covid. To begin with, there is a new “FLiRT” variant that has the “experts” excited.

A new coronavirus variant named KP.3.1.1 has risen to dominance in the U.S., almost doubling in prevalence in just two weeks, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports. Experts are warning that the new variant—which, as of August 3, accounts for more than 1 in 4 U.S. COVID-19 cases—is “more of a challenge” to our immune systems compared to previous variants. The new variant is a sub-lineage of the previously dominant KP.3, which rose to prominence at the end of May. …Both KP.3.1.1 and KP.3 belong to a new class of variants nicknamed the “FLiRT” variants. They are named after the mutations in the projections on the virus’ surface that allow them to enter our cells. These projections, known as spike proteins, are also used as targets by our immune systems and vaccinations. According to early analysis (that has not been peer-reviewed), KP.3.1.1 is significantly more infectious than previous variants, including KP.3. It may also be better at evading our immune systems and immunity conveyed by existing vaccines.

Covid is now endemic and it is ubiquitous. People have stopped COVID testing altogether, so public health officials now have to resort to wastewater sample testing to estimate how many people have the virus in all its variants.

For example, in Michigan.

In fact, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) reports that COVID-19 disease indicators are rising – those indicators include wastewater and emergency department visits, but they’re increasing from a low level. “What they’re following right now is wastewater samples because that’s the only predictive thing that we have right now. People aren’t getting tested as often,” Sims said. “If they’re doing home tests, we don’t know what the results of those are, and a lot of states aren’t collecting the data or reporting the data anymore.”

Despite all the super-strict precautions and pandemic rules that were enforced over the span of 2-3 years in some places, California wastewater is filled with the pathogen.

California has “very high” coronavirus levels in its wastewater — one of 21 states in that category, up from seven the prior week, according to estimates published Friday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That means about 155 million people — nearly half of America’s population — live in areas with “very high” coronavirus levels in sewage. Besides California, the other states with “very high” levels are Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia and Wyoming. Washington, D.C., is also in that category. …Most Americans probably know a family member, friend, co-worker or acquaintance who has come down with COVID-19 recently, perhaps being infected while traveling or at a social gathering. “If you call — I don’t know — 20 or 30 friends, you’re very, very likely to find a bunch of them actually have COVID, or have had COVID recently, or are starting to be symptomatic,” said Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, a COVID expert and chief of research and development at the Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System in Missouri.

Americans are so over COVID. Clearly, they are treating it as they would any mild respiratory virus and getting on with their lives.

There is a lesson in that for our press and some of the “experts” who still advocate masking.

“Given the increased transmission of new strains of COVID-19, residents should continue taking common-sense precautions to avoid transmitting or becoming ill with COVID-19,” the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health said in a statement Thursday. “This includes washing their hands often or using hand sanitizer, especially before eating, after sneezing or coughing, or when in public places, and considering mask use when in crowded indoor spaces,” the department said.

The Number 1 Thing A Cardiologist Recommends You Avoid Eating For A Healthy Heart is eating healthy.,https://uk.style.yahoo.com/number-1-thing-cardiologist-recommends-133929084.html,"andresr via Getty Images

Everyone seems to have an opinion about how to get — and keep — our hearts healthy. General Mills wants us to eat Cheerios. TikTok says we should go raw vegan. And our trainer wants us to do 10 more burpees.

The reality is it takes a host of behaviors and practices to protect our hearts from harm — and our genetics and family history play a huge role in how our tickers function, too.

But Big Cereal is onto something because diet is definitely an important factor in maintaining sound cardiac health. Eating lots of vegetables and fruits, whole grains, healthy lean protein and unsaturated fats can reduce your chances of accumulating plaque in your coronary arteries.

And, yes, plaque in your heart is as unsavory as it sounds — and dangerous.

So, if a diverse diet full of nutrient-rich foods is what we’re aiming for, what should we stay away from?

This is what we, Noah Michelson and Raj Punjabi, hosts of HuffPost’s “Am I Doing It Wrong?” podcast, asked Dr. Guilly Rebagay, a cardiologist and assistant professor of medicine at New York University Langone.

Press play to hear the full episode:

Dr. Rebagay said the number one thing he’d advise his patients to avoid is anything with trans fats, adding that foods high in “very saturated fats, very oily things ― you know, like foods prepared with duck fat ― or [heavily processed] things you see on grocery store shelves” can spell trouble for our hearts.

That’s because these types of foods can contribute to the production of LDL (“bad”) cholesterol, which in turn creates that artery-clogging plaque and causes trouble-making inflammation.

“Sometimes in the supermarket next to the oils, you see big cans of fat,” he noted. “They’re rendered for very delicious meals ― but I can just see the plaque growing in my heart when I see those.”

Rebagay acknowledged that most of us will occasionally treat ourselves to something with trans or saturated fats, but he advised us to follow a Mediterranean diet as often as we can.

“It’s filled with polyunsaturated fats, healthy, lean protein, predominantly from plant resources, but things like salmon and fatty fishes like that are very important,” he explained. “But the overall message is vegetables, vegetables, vegetables, and lots and lots of dietary fiber, and then supplementing that also with nuts, legumes and healthy grains. Those are the kinds of things that can help lower the LDL cholesterol.”

He also suggested trying a plant-based vegan diet.

“That has also really been shown to really help lower your sticky bad cholesterol,” he said.

Of course, changing your diet probably won’t happen overnight. That’s why the doctor recommended taking “baby steps.”

“I think it’s something that we just have to experiment with,” he said. “The joy of food is that we can experiment with things that we like, and with these diets, there’s so many options that we can have to fill our diets with. So I always try to engage my patients to find things that they like, and if you don’t like broccoli, try sweet potato. There’s so many things out there that can really help sustain us in a healthy way.”

We also chatted with Rebagay about how much we should exercise, which demographics are facing high risk for cardiac disease and the secret to longevity — according to his 85-year-old patients with incredibly healthy hearts. Listen to the full episode here or wherever you get your podcasts.

Eating a couple more apples (and broccoli florets, cucumbers, bananas or green beans) may really help keep the doctor away — especially for people with high blood pressure at risk for heart and kidney disease, according to new research.Video above: Doctor on getting children to eat healthier""Patients with high blood pressure, the two big problems that they get is heart disease and kidney disease,"" said lead study investigator Dr. Donald Wesson, professor in the department of internal medicine at Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin.""The study tested whether or not reducing the amount of acid in our diet reduces the kidney disease- and heart disease-related complications of high blood pressure,"" he said.Animal products — notably meat — tend to produce acid, while fruits and vegetables are base-producing when consumed, Wesson said.To explore how plants could help, researchers conducted a randomized control trial of 153 people with hypertension and a high risk of worsening chronic kidney disease.The participants were divided into three groups: one that added 2 to 4 cups of fruits and vegetables to their diet, one that added two daily doses (of four or five 650-milligram tablets) of baking soda, and one that continued with standard medical care. Baking soda reduces acid, the study said.After five years of study, researchers found that both the diet higher in plants, and the baking soda, promoted kidney health, but only the fruits and vegetables improved heart health as well, Wesson said.""Our conclusion was that diets high in fruits and vegetables should be a foundational part of our management of patients who have high blood pressure or hypertension,"" he said.The study is just the latest in a growing body of literature regarding the health benefits of diets heavy in plants, said Dr. Marion Nestle, the Paulette Goddard Professor Emerita of Nutrition, Food Studies and Public Health at New York University. She was not involved in the research.""We've known this for a long time but it's good to have less kidney disease added to the benefits,"" she said.Basic and acidicWhy should you avoid acid? The focus of Wesson's laboratory studies is the way in which the kidney removes acid from blood and discards it through urine.Years ago, his lab team showed that a diet that produced acid was harmful to animal kidneys and that a base-producing diet was healthy for kidneys, he said. Later investigations found similar results in humans.The problem is, most Americans eat much more meat and animal products — which produce acid — than they do basic fruits and vegetables, Wesson said.""The real question going forward is not whether fruits and vegetables work in patients who have high blood pressure,"" he said. ""The question is, how do we make it so that most patients who have high blood pressure can get and stay on such diets.""How to get all your fruits and veggiesEven if you don't have high blood pressure, the more fruits and vegetables you can eat, the better, Wesson said.The American Heart Association recommends four to five servings of fruits and vegetables a day, and a serving looks like five to eight florets of broccoli, one banana, 1 cup of raw leafy greens, or four large strawberries.Particularly helpful to heart health is the DASH diet, which stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension.The DASH meal plan includes four to six servings of vegetables and another four to six servings of fruit; three servings of whole-grain products; two to four servings of fat-free or low-fat dairy products; and several servings each of lean meats and nuts, seeds and legumes each day.While nutritional changes can be very helpful to health outcomes, they are infrequently prioritized, Wesson said.""In our society, where there's limited availability or limited attractiveness to fruits and vegetables in our diet, it's been historically very hard for patients to follow such diets,"" he said.To address the limited attractiveness, cardiologist Dr. Andrew Freeman recommends experimenting with how you eat. He was not involved in the research.When fruits are in season, they can be incredibly sweet and delicious. And adding seasonings and sauces — particularly those that connect to your heritage — can be a fun way to add flavor you enjoy to vegetables, said Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver.""There is a growing (movement) in the culinary world with chefs and cooks placing more emphasis on making vegetables 'unapologetically delicious' (check out the Edgy Veggie Toolkit website at Stanford),"" said Dr. Christopher Gardner, a research professor of medicine at the Stanford Prevention Research Center in California, in an email.

Since water makes up nearly 60% of the human body’s weight , it's no surprise that the amount we drink could significantly affect an impressive number of bodily functions, including body temperature regulation, digestion, and even heart health. But, does drinking water lower blood pressure?

Meet the experts: Ian Del-Conde, M.D. , cardiologist and vascular medicine specialist at the Miami Cardiac & Vascular Institute, part of Baptist Health South Florida; and Christopher Davis, M.D., F.A.C.C., Chief Cardiologist at humann

Whether you drink multiple 40-oz Stanley tumblers of water a day or perhaps a little less, it’s important to learn how staying hydrated can influence your cardiovascular health. Ahead, find everything you need to know about how (and if) water lowers blood pressure.

Dehydration and blood pressure

Dehydration is a condition that occurs when the body loses more fluids than it takes in. And being dehydrated can have a surprising effect on blood pressure. “When you become dehydrated, your blood volume decreases, which can initially lead to a drop in blood pressure,” explains Ian Del-Conde, M.D. , cardiologist and vascular medicine specialist at the Miami Cardiac & Vascular Institute, part of Baptist Health South Florida. “However, as the body tries to compensate, it releases certain hormones that can constrict blood vessels and cause blood pressure to rise. This means dehydration can paradoxically result in both low and high blood pressure.”

Observational studies have linked habitual low water intake with blood pressure regulation challenges, but more data is needed to confirm this. One study published in Cureus in 2022 suggested that people with hypertension tended to have lower total body water percentage, suggesting a relationship between hydration status and high blood pressure. Another study published in Frontiers in Public Health showed that, among over 3,000 Chinese adults, there was a decreasing trend of hypertension risk as plain water intake increased.

How much water should I drink in a day?

The amount of water you should drink a day varies based on many factors, including health status, activity level, and sex. The U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine suggests an adequate daily fluid intake is about 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) of fluids a day for those assigned male at birth and around 11.5 cups (2.7 liters) of fluids a day for those assigned female at birth. This recommendation includes not only water, but also moisture from food and other beverages, including fruits, vegetables, soups, and other drinks.

This aims to support essential bodily functions, including temperature regulation, nutrient transportation, and waste elimination. However, individual needs may vary, and it is crucial to adjust water intake based on personal activity levels and environmental circumstances (say, if you’re spending time outside during a heat wave).

Can other beverages lower blood pressure?

While water is one of the most effective means of staying hydrated, potentially helping support healthy blood pressure, certain other beverages may also support healthy blood pressure.

Ways to lower blood pressure naturally

Hydration status is just one factor that may impact blood pressure. Along with maintaining a healthy hydration status, Dr. Del-Conde advises that the following habits may positively impact healthy blood pressure as well.

Maintaining a healthy weight

Participating in regular exercise

Reducing sodium intake

Limiting alcohol consumption

Managing stress

Incorporating foods rich in potassium, magnesium, and fiber.

For specific dietary habits, The DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) is designed to combat high blood pressure and may be a viable solution for those trying to keep their heart health in check. This diet promotes eating nutrients known to help regulate blood pressure by emphasizing fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy products, as well as other foods rich in potassium, calcium, and magnesium, which are essential for blood pressure management. Additionally, this diet recommends reducing intake of sodium, sweets, and red meats, all of which have been linked to higher blood pressure levels.

When to see a doctor

It is crucial to know when to see a doctor regarding blood pressure, as maintaining healthy levels is essential for overall well-being. “Unfortunately, high blood pressure is probably one of the most commonly underdiagnosed conditions in medicine,” says Christopher Davis, M.D., F.A.C.C., Chief Cardiologist at humann , who explained that “the main reason is most people can go for years with significantly elevated blood pressure without any symptoms.”

Davis shared that the key to addressing the blood pressure problem early is routine monitoring. “Many automated blood pressure monitoring devices are quite accurate and will allow you to detect blood pressure issues before symptoms arise. Some of these symptoms may include blurred vision, headaches, dizziness, chest pain, or shortness of breath.” He explains that if you have blood pressure that is consistently elevated or experience any of the aforementioned symptoms then you should consult your physician for further evaluation.

Schedule an appointment if you consistently get readings of 130/80 mm Hg or higher, which is considered elevated blood pressure, or 140/90 mm Hg or higher , which indicates hypertension. Early intervention and regular monitoring can prevent serious complications, such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney damage .

Over the past while, we have been learning more about how crucial good gut health is to our overall health.

We now know that gut health is linked to stress, fatigue and reductions in productivity.

When it comes to food, a varied diet is absolutely essential. However, it turns out that when we eat this varied diet is just as important and GP Dr Zoe Williams has advised that your daily routine plays a big part in your gut health.

When is the best time to eat to protect gut health?

Dr Williams said that protecting gut health starts right at the beginning of your day. She said: “When you first wake up, say at 7:00am on a weekday, get into the habit of drinking a large glass of water, maybe leave the glass next to your toothbrush so you remember.”

This is because good hydration helps your gut function well and aids digestion by helping to break down food so that your body can absorb the nutrients. Basically, by having water first thing, you’re starting the day on a good footing!

As for breakfast, Dr Williams recommends a fermented yoghurt. She said: ”[Yoghurts] are a great choice for breakfast. It contains calcium which contributes to supporting a healthy gut.”

Yoghurt is an easy food to eat first thing, especially if you tend to have busy mornings or are not enough of a morning person to care that much about breakfast.

As for lunch, Dr Williams recommends that this time is used to eat fibre and foods such as whole grains and legumes, as these are light and good for protecting gut health for the rest of the day.

Dr Williams added: “Eating regular meals helps provide us with energy and nutrients to sustain a busy lifestyle. Evidence suggests a good sleeping pattern can support gut health too, so try to get to bed at a time which allows you to get your full 7-8 hours sleep.”

She added that eating 2-3 hours before bed allows the body enough time to properly process the food.

Basically: being in a healthy routine with a balanced diet will help your gut to stay regulated.

Dr Zoe Williams is working with Activia, the gut health* yoghurt brand, to coach consumers about the role of the gut as part of our overall wellbeing.

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India on Wednesday raised the government-mandated price for summer-sown crops such as rice, soybean and cotton as Prime Minister Narendra Modi looks to woo millions of farmers ahead of key state elections later this year.

The country announces support prices for more than a dozen crops each year to set a benchmark. But analysts say the hike could hit government finances and also lift food inflation.

India has raised the price at which it will buy new-season common rice paddy from farmers by 5.4% to 2,300 rupees ($27.57) per 100 kg, the information minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Wednesday after a cabinet meeting chaired by Modi.

Higher prices will encourage farmers to boost output in the world's second-biggest rice producer, and bountiful harvests could encourage the government to relax a ban on some exports. India is the world's biggest exporter of rice.

The paddy buying price has been raised to reflect the rising cost of production, which will encourage farmers to boost production, said B.V. Krishna Rao, president of the Rice Exporters Association of India.

""However, this will also make Indian rice more expensive for overseas buyers. To mitigate this, the government should reduce the export duty from 20% to 15%,"" Rao said.

India has imposed a 20% duty on exports of parboiled rice after banning shipments of white rice last year.

Every year authorities raise the support prices of staples such as rice and wheat to build stockpiles to run the world's biggest food welfare programme, which entitles poor people to free grains.

Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failed to secure a majority on its own in the recently held general elections, losing more than six dozen seats in rural areas.

The BJP faces provincial elections later this year in two key agricultural states, Haryana and Maharashtra, which have strong farm lobbies.

CNN —

Eating a couple more apples (and broccoli florets, cucumbers, bananas or green beans) may really help keep the doctor away — especially for people with high blood pressure at risk for heart and kidney disease, according to new research.

“Patients with high blood pressure, the two big problems that they get is heart disease and kidney disease,” said lead study investigator Dr. Donald Wesson, professor in the department of internal medicine at Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin.

“The study tested whether or not reducing the amount of acid in our diet reduces the kidney disease- and heart disease-related complications of high blood pressure,” he said.

Animal products — notably meat — tend to produce acid, while fruits and vegetables are base-producing when consumed, Wesson said.

To explore how plants could help, researchers conducted a randomized control trial of 153 people with hypertension and a high risk of worsening chronic kidney disease, according to the study published Tuesday in the American Journal of Medicine.

The participants were divided into three groups: one that added 2 to 4 cups of fruits and vegetables to their diet, one that added two daily doses (of four or five 650-milligram tablets) of baking soda, and one that continued with standard medical care. Baking soda reduces acid, the study said.

After five years of study, researchers found that both the diet higher in plants, and the baking soda, promoted kidney health, but only the fruits and vegetables improved heart health as well, Wesson said.

“Our conclusion was that diets high in fruits and vegetables should be a foundational part of our management of patients who have high blood pressure or hypertension,” he said.

The study is just the latest in a growing body of literature regarding the health benefits of diets heavy in plants, said Dr. Marion Nestle, the Paulette Goddard Professor Emerita of Nutrition, Food Studies and Public Health at New York University. She was not involved in the research.

“We’ve known this for a long time but it’s good to have less kidney disease added to the benefits,” she said.

Basic and acidic

Why should you avoid acid? The focus of Wesson’s laboratory studies is the way in which the kidney removes acid from blood and discards it through urine.

Years ago, his lab team showed that a diet that produced acid was harmful to animal kidneys and that a base-producing diet was healthy for kidneys, he said. Later investigations found similar results in humans.

The problem is, most Americans eat much more meat and animal products — which produce acid — than they do basic fruits and vegetables, Wesson said.

“The real question going forward is not whether fruits and vegetables work in patients who have high blood pressure,” he said. “The question is, how do we make it so that most patients who have high blood pressure can get and stay on such diets.”

How to get all your fruits and veggies

Even if you don’t have high blood pressure, the more fruits and vegetables you can eat, the better, Wesson said.

The American Heart Association recommends four to five servings of fruits and vegetables a day, and a serving looks like five to eight florets of broccoli, one banana, 1 cup of raw leafy greens, or four large strawberries.

Particularly helpful to heart health is the DASH diet, which stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension.

The DASH meal plan includes four to six servings of vegetables and another four to six servings of fruit; three servings of whole-grain products; two to four servings of fat-free or low-fat dairy products; and several servings each of lean meats and nuts, seeds and legumes each day.

While nutritional changes can be very helpful to health outcomes, they are infrequently prioritized, Wesson said.

“In our society, where there’s limited availablility or limited attractiveness to fruits and vegetables in our diet, it’s been historically very hard for patients to follow such diets,” he said.

To address the limited attractiveness, cardiologist Dr. Andrew Freeman recommends experimenting with how you eat. He was not involved in the research.

When fruits are in season, they can be incredibly sweet and delicious. And adding seasonings and sauces — particularly those that connect to your heritage — can be a fun way to add flavor you enjoy to vegetables, said Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver.

Sometimes communities have limited access to fresh produce, however, Wesson added.

Medication intervention is still an important part of managing blood pressure, kidney disease and heart disease, Wesson said. This study shows that health systems should double down on making nutrition part of managing these conditions.

“A largely, but not necessarily exclusively, plant-based diet is demonstrably associated with overall good health, reduced chronic disease prevalence — kidney disease too — and premature mortality,” Nestle said."
The Number 1 Thing A Cardiologist Recommends You Avoid Eating For A Healthy Heart is eating healthy.,https://www.eatingwell.com/herbal-teas-to-avoid-high-blood-pressure-8691951,"Almost half of American adults—that’s nearly 120 million people—have high blood pressure. High blood pressure increases one’s risk for heart disease and stroke, two of the leading causes of death in the United States. Unfortunately, only 1 in 4 of adults who have high blood pressure have their blood pressure under control, meaning there is a lot of room for improvement to help these individuals better manage their condition.

While it may seem like the trend to use herbal teas to help manage high blood pressure, this isn’t necessarily recommended. In fact, these five herbal teas may actually do more harm than good for hypertension. In this article, we’ll share just what teas you should avoid, offering lifestyle and nutrition management tips instead from two leading registered dietitians.

5 Herbal Teas to Avoid If You Have High Blood Pressure

Supported by other more recent research, a 2013 study flagged all five of the herbal teas listed as potential contributors to hypertension. While the reasoning behind avoiding each tea may be slightly different, it’s best to steer clear of these herbal teas if you have high blood pressure.

1. Ginseng Herbal Tea

Ginseng is a popular herb that’s commonly used in Chinese medicine. While it shows some promise for increasing energy levels and promoting well-being, the available science is limited. In fact, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, the evidence for the long-term safety of using this herb is insufficient. Studies have found that it may either decrease or increase blood pressure, so more research is needed to help clarify the relationship.

Award-winning nutrition expert Toby Amidor, M.S., RD, CDN, author of Up Your Veggies: Flexitarian Recipes for the Whole Family, recommends to “avoid this herbal tea until more conclusive research has been conducted.”

2. Ginkgo Biloba Herbal Tea

You may be considering the herbal tea ginkgo biloba for a memory boost, but it’s important to know how it might affect the medications you’re on. For instance, research shows that ginkgo biloba may interact with a type of medications known as blood thinners, a class of pharmaceuticals designed to thin your blood to prevent blood clots. While not every individual with hypertension will be on this type of medication, it’s more common for those who are prone to blood clots. If you’re taking a blood thinner, it’s highly likely that ginkgo biloba tea could interact with it and alter its effectiveness.

Plus, depending on the type of tea and processing of the tea leaves, this herbal remedy can be toxic. Error on the side of caution, and always talk to your healthcare team before trying something new.

3. Licorice Herbal Tea

Unfortunately for licorice fans, this tea may not be the best choice if you have high blood pressure. According to Sylvia Klinger, D.B.A., M.S., RDN, award-winning author, entrepreneur and founder of Hispanic & Multicultural Nutrition Communications, “Licorice contains a compound called glycyrrhizic acid which may raise blood pressure and cause other serious side effects, potentially resulting in headaches, fatigue and even heart attacks.”

A recent 2024 study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition confirmed previous findings, noting that even just 100 grams of licorice may have a significant effect on blood pressure. Amidor shares, “Glycyrrhizic acid found in licorice may cause the body to retain water and sodium, affecting blood pressure. Because glycyrrhizic acid affects an enzyme in the kidney, the body's fluid balance is impacted.”

Since the level of this compound in licorice tea can vary, it’s not possible to give a recommendation of a safe amount to consume. Instead, if you have high blood pressure, it’s best to avoid this tea and look for one prepared with anise seeds instead, which yield a similar flavor without the contraindications.

4. St. John’s Wort Herbal Tea

Know for its yellow flowers, St. John’s Wort is an herb that has been used in European medicine for centuries to help treat wounds and conditions like depression. However, it has been flagged stateside for its interactions with common medications, specifically statins, which are often prescribed to those with high blood pressure. Klinger advises patients to avoid this herb in tea form, too, as it may cause heart problems.

5. Yohimbe Bark Herbal Tea

Native to Africa, Yohimbe is a type of evergreen tree. The bark of this tree has been used as an aphrodisiac and to aid sexual performance. While there are prescription medications sold in the United States called yohimbine hydrochloride, they are different from the supplement form prepared from the bark of the tree. Data on this tea is extremely limited and suggests that it may be linked to heart attacks and seizures. It’s best to avoid this tea—even if you don’t have high blood pressure—until more data is available.

Other Ways to Lower High Blood Pressure

There are a variety of accessible, convenient and cost-effective ways to manage high blood pressure through diet and lifestyle habits. Below are a few recommendations shared by both Klinger and Amidor to help lower high blood pressure:

Eat a balanced diet, leaning into the DASH diet principles. The DASH Diet, also known as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, incorporates eating a variety of fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy, healthy fats and whole grains. It suggests limiting the intake of saturated fats, sodium and added sugars, and has shown to help improve blood pressure. To help implement this daily, Klinger suggests thinking of what DASH diet foods you can add to your diet, starting with a serving of fruit or vegetable at every meal.

To help implement this daily, Klinger suggests thinking of what DASH diet foods you can add to your diet, starting with a serving of fruit or vegetable at every meal. Consider an omega-3 fatty acids supplement. The omega-3 fatty acids DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) have been found to have beneficial effects on cardiovascular health. If you’re not eating seafood sources high in these fatty acids (like salmon, tuna and sardines) at least twice per week, it could be helpful to consider supplementing. Speak to your healthcare team about the best option for you.

Speak to your healthcare team about the best option for you. Limit alcohol consumption. Consuming alcohol can raise blood pressure. But, if you do drink, the recommendations don’t suggest cutting it out all together. The DASH diet aligns with the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommendation of no more than 1 drink per day for females and no more than 2 drinks per day for males.

Incorporate movement into your routine. Not only can finding movement you enjoy help lower your blood pressure, but it also may help manage stress which is a win-win for those managing hypertension. Find a form of movement that you look forward to, whether it’s walking, yoga, dancing or something else, and aim for about 30 minutes a day.

Find a form of movement that you look forward to, whether it’s walking, yoga, dancing or something else, and aim for about 30 minutes a day. Manage stress. Stress is a known contributor to high blood pressure. If you are experiencing stress in your life and are unable to cope with it on your own, consider speaking with a trained professional to help you find ways to feel your best.

If you are experiencing stress in your life and are unable to cope with it on your own, consider speaking with a trained professional to help you find ways to feel your best. Sip on other teas. Yes, some other popular tea may actually help your blood pressure. For instance, a 2019 study published in the Journal of Advanced Pharmaceutical Technology & Research found that consuming two cups of hibiscus tea may offer blood pressure-lowering benefits, alongside a healthy diet and lifestyle routine. However, only one specific variety of hibiscus was tested, and the other may not have that same effect. So, as Amidor reminds us, always check with your healthcare provider before adding an herbal tea or supplement to your routine.

The Bottom Line

Managing high blood pressure doesn’t mean you have to spend your money on expensive supplements and herbal teas. In fact, specific herbal teas, like ginseng, ginkgo biloba, licorice, St. John’s Wort and yohimbe herbal teas may actually make hypertension worse. Instead, consider lifestyle habits that can help improve your blood pressure, like following the DASH diet, regularly being active, limiting alcohol consumption and managing stress."
The Number 1 Thing A Cardiologist Recommends You Avoid Eating For A Healthy Heart is eating healthy.,https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/heart-healthy-style-eating-emphasizes-025239800.html,"A new study is shedding light on the health benefits of the Atlantic diet. Like the Mediterranean diet, this style of eating is based on the dietary patterns of people living in a specific region of Europe, but this one hones in on northwest Spain and northern Portugal. These populations have some of the lowest incidences of heart disease.

The most recent study in JAMA Network found that those who followed the Atlantic diet for a six-month period had a lower risk of developing metabolic syndrome, a group of conditions that increase risk of heart disease and diabetes.

While this research is promising, the Atlantic diet is not that well-known. But with its emphasis on eating tasty foods like bread and bringing people together for communal eating, don't be surprised if the Atlantic diet picks up steam soon.

What is the Atlantic diet?

The Atlantic diet is the traditional diet of people from northern Portugal and Galicia in northwestern Spain. It’s full of local, fresh and whole foods — including fruit, vegetables, bread, pulses, nuts, fish and milk products.

The most common food group within the Atlantic diet is starch, such as bread, pasta, rice, cereals and other whole grains, with people consuming these six to eight times per day. The diet also includes some meat, mainly beef and pork, as well as eggs. Olive oil is a common condiment, and wine is consumed at mealtimes.

The Atlantic diet isn’t only about the types of food consumed, but it also emphasizes the style of cooking and eating. “The Atlantic diet promotes health through nutrient-rich foods and communal eating habits, utilizing traditional cooking methods like stewing to enhance nutrient absorption,” says Michelle Routhenstein, preventive cardiology dietitian at EntirelyNourished.com.

Atlantic diet foods

The Atlantic diet prioritizes the following foods:

Bread

Cereals, especially whole grain

Rice

Pasta

Potatoes

Fruit

Vegetables

Olive oil

Milk products

Fish and seafood

Lean meat

Eggs

Pulses

Nuts, especially chestnuts, walnuts, almonds and hazelnuts

Atlantic diet benefits

New research on the Atlantic diet observed over 200 families that either followed the diet or stuck to their normal eating pattern for six months. The authors of the study were interested in which group had higher rates of metabolic syndrome, a group of conditions that increase risk of heart disease, stroke and Type 2 diabetes, such as excess body fat, high blood pressure or blood sugar, and abnormal triglyceride or cholesterol levels.

After six months, those who followed the Atlantic diet had a lower risk of developing metabolic syndrome than those in the control group. “The Atlantic diet particularly benefits cardiometabolic health,” says Routhenstein.

The study also found that the Atlantic diet decreased risk of obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and high triglycerides, a type of fat found in the blood, ""so it could really influence the risk of heart disease down the line,” NBC News medical contributor Dr. Natalie Azar said on TODAY on Feb. 17, 2024.

Previous research has also showed that higher adherence to the diet was linked to lower risk of death.

There are several benefits to the Atlantic diet that may play a role in outcomes observed in the recent studies. First, the abundance of fish contributes healthy omega-3 fatty acids, which reduce bodily inflammation and benefit the heart. As a matter of fact, the American Heart Association recommends all adults eat fish at least twice a week to reduce the risk of heart attack.

The combination of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, pulses and nuts provides fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, all of which are crucial for heart health. Although most Americans don’t eat enough daily fiber, observational studies show that meeting the daily 25 to 30 grams reduces the risk of heart disease. And nutrients like potassium and magnesium, both of which are abundant in plant-based foods, contribute to healthy blood pressure and heart function.

“Systematic reviews of feeding trials and prospective population studies consistently show that dietary patterns rich in plant foods ... and seafood and low in processed foods are associated with a reduced risk of chronic diseases,” says Dr. Mar Calvo-Malvar, one of the authors of the study and a specialist in Laboratory Medicine at the University Clinical Hospital of Santiago de Compostela, Spain.

Atlantic Diet versus Mediterranean Diet

Although Spain is part of the Mediterranean region, the Atlantic diet differs slightly from the traditional Mediterranean diet. Both diets emphasize fresh ingredients, such as fruits, vegetables, pulses, whole grains and olive oil, but the Mediterranean diet is more plant-forward. The Atlantic diet highlights different ingredients, such as bread, fish, milk, and potatoes, as well as some red meat. Keeping up with the stewing preparation method, vegetable soup is a common staple on the Atlantic diet.

“Both the Atlantic diet and the Mediterranean diet offer scientific evidence supporting their benefits for heart health, with the Atlantic diet providing omega-3 fatty acids from seafood and the Mediterranean diet offering antioxidants and healthy fats from olive oil and plant-based foods,” says Routhenstein. “However, the Mediterranean Diet has a more extensive research base, particularly regarding its association with reduced cardiovascular risk.""

Summer is peak cherry season and the best time to enjoy this delicious fruit. Besides being a sweet summer treat, cherries are loaded with nutritional benefits. In fact, if you eat them every day, you can expect both your short-term and long-term health to benefit.

Curious as to what changes you can expect to experience? Here, registered dietitians reveal seven.

What Are the Health Benefits of Cherries?

Just what makes cherries such a nutritious snack? Rebecca Russell, MS, RD, IFNCP, ATC, a functional medicine registered dietitian at The Social Nutritionist, says that one major reason is that cherries are loaded with antioxidants, including vitamins A and C. “They also contain a powerful polyphenol called anthocyanin which is what gives cherries their bright red color and helps fight inflammation in the body,” she explains.

Russell adds that cherries are also a good source of potassium, which is important for heart health. “They are also a good source of fiber which helps digestive health and the gut microbiome,” she shares, listing yet another health benefit of cherries.

For those who want to keep their blood sugar levels steady, cherries are a good snack choice. “Cherries have a low glycemic load and glycemic index score, which makes them a great fruit choice for people who are concerned about their blood sugar numbers,” explains Stephanie Dunne, RDN, an integrative dietitian nutritionist and founder of Nutrition QED.

What Happens if You Eat Cherries Every Day?

With all these nutritional benefits, you may want to start eating cherries every day. If you do, there are several ways your short-term and long-term health will be affected.

1. You may sleep better

Dunne says that tart cherries contain two compounds linked to helping with falling asleep as well as staying asleep: melatonin and tryptophan. “Consuming tart cherry juice before bed has been proven in research to help most people get a more restful night's sleep,” she explains.



Russell points to the same research, highlighting that drinking tart cherry juice before bed helped people stay asleep longer. So if you often wake up in the middle of the night, enjoying a cup of tart cherry juice in the evening may help.

2. You could recover from working out faster

Cherries are a great food to integrate into a pre-workout snack or meal. “Some research shows that the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of cherries may help reduce muscle pain and inflammation after exercising,” Russell says.



According to Dunne, the best way to get the recovery benefits of cherries is to eat them before working out instead of after. “Research has shown that consuming fresh, powdered or juiced tart cherries in the days before heavy exercise, such as weight lifting and endurance running, can speed recovery after the exercise is complete,” Dunne says. “This is an important distinction as many professional and amateur athletes give a lot of thought as to when certain nutrients should be consumed in relation to their exercise schedule.”

3. You could get sick less often

As Russell pointed out earlier, one of the antioxidants in cherries is vitamin C. Both dietitians say that this vitamin plays a crucial role in immune health, so eating cherries every day could lead to a stronger immune system. That means you could get sick less often and recover quickly when you do get sick. Dunne recommends snacking on cherries when you feel a cold coming on to give your immune system a needed boost.

4. Your digestion may improve

Since cherries contain fiber, eating them for a snack in place of a lower-fiber option could lead to better digestion and less constipation. Russell says that the cherries’ fiber isn’t their only gut-supporting nutrient—anthocyanin, a polyphenol found in cherries, helps boost beneficial gut bacteria.

5. You’ll have better cardiovascular health

If one of your health goals is lowering your risk of cardiovascular disease, add cherries to your heart-healthy shopping list. Dunne and Russell both say the antioxidants in cherries make them a heart-healthy food choice.



“They are also an excellent source of potassium, which is beneficial for people who are trying to control their blood pressure. The balance between sodium and potassium in the body is one of the things that keeps our blood pressure low,” Dunne says, giving another way cherries benefit heart health.

6. Your brain will benefit

If you continue eating cherries every day long-term, it’s not just your heart that will benefit—your brain will too.



“Cherries are also full of polyphenol antioxidants such as anthocyanins that can reduce inflammation in the body and protect our cells from damage,” Dunne says.



This includes the brain. Scientific research performed on mice shows that anthocyanins significantly reduce inflammation in the brain, improving memory and helping lower the risk of dementia.

7. Your risk for chronic diseases will be lower

Both experts emphasize that the antioxidants and other nutrients in cherries benefit the entire body and—when eating regularly long-term—reduce the risk of chronic diseases that inflammation can cause. “Eating polyphenol foods, like cherries, are a great preventative strategy for heart disease, diabetes, mental illnesses and certain cancers. This is due to their powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties,” Russell explains.

It’s easy to find cherries now because they’re in season, but when summer ends, both dietitians say buying frozen cherries is a great way to keep your cherry-eating going. “Frozen cherries are just as nutritious as fresh cherries. Frozen cherries are often picked at peak ripeness and then flash frozen which helps to retain their nutrients and antioxidants. Especially during the off-season, frozen cherries are a great option,” Russell says.

With this in mind, cherries make a great snack both now and all year long. Three cheers for cherries!

It’s no secret that fiber supplements are making a major comeback these days. From gummies and capsules to psyllium husk to help your gut health, there are plenty of products on the market these days to aid digestion, ease constipation, and help you stay fuller for longer. When it comes to good nutrition, experts say you shouldn’t sleep on a high-fiber diet—but before shopping for supps, it may help to stock up on fiber-rich foods first.

Consuming more fiber in your diet has many health benefits, says dietitian Deborah Cohen, RDN, an associate professor in the Department of Clinical and Preventive Nutrition Science at Rutgers University. Because fiber is typically found in plant-based foods, consuming more of those tends to be good for your overall health, she says. Fiber also helps your intestinal tract function optimally and plays an important role in preventing metabolic diseases, according to a 2022 study in Nutrients.

So, what does a high-fiber diet involve and can it really help your gut health? Ahead, dietitians break down what fiber is, how much you need, and simple ways to work more into your diet.

Meet the experts: Vanessa Rissetto, RD, is a dietitian and the CEO and co-founder of Culina Health. Deborah Cohen, DCN, RDN, is an associate professor in the Department of Clinical and Preventive Nutrition Science at Rutgers University. Nutritionist Karen Ansel, RDN, is author of Healthy in a Hurry.

What is fiber and how much do you need?

Fiber is a nutrient that comes from the food you eat and is an essential part of a healthy diet, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The current recommendation for daily fiber intake is 14 grams for every 1,000 calories per day—about 25 grams for women and 38 grams for men, according to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. That said, most adults need about 25 to 30 grams of fiber per day, according to a 2022 review in the National Library of Medicine. “Trouble is, most of us only consume about 10 to 15 grams a day, so almost all of us could use more,” says dietitian Karen Ansel, RDN, author of Healthy in a Hurry.

Here are the different types of fiber to have on your radar:

Dietary Fiber

This type is typically found in plants, says dietitian Vanessa Rissetto, RD, co-founder and CEO of Culina Health. “It’s resistant to digestion in the human small intestine,” she says, meaning that it can’t be broken down and therefore passes through your body undigested. Dietary fiber can help keep your hunger and blood sugar in check, per Harvard Health.



Added Fiber

Also known as ""functional fiber,"" this type is added to foods during the manufacturing process, Cohen says. “Types of added fiber include beta-glucan soluble fiber, psyllium husk, cellulose, guar gum, pectin, locust bean gum, and hydroxyethylcellulose,” she says. “These fibers are either found naturally in foods or made synthetically in a lab and added to foods to increase the fiber content of a food.” Added fiber may help with lowering cholesterol and keeping you regular, Ansel says.



Soluble Fiber

Soluble fiber interacts with water to create a gel-like substance, Cohen says. It is found in oats, peas, beans, apples, citrus fruits, barley, nuts, and many vegetables, per Mount Sinai. It’s also known for its role in lowering cholesterol in the blood, per Cohen.

Insoluble Fiber

This form of fiber doesn’t dissolve in water and is found in wheat products (especially wheat bran), quinoa, brown rice, legumes, and leafy greens, per Harvard Health. “Insoluble fiber works like a broom, moving food through your gut so it’s great for keeping you regular and preventing constipation,” Ansel says.

Benefits Of A High-Fiber Diet

Here are a few potential perks of going on a high-fiber diet, according to experts.

More fiber may help lower your cholesterol.

Foods high in soluble fiber, in particular, may cause at least moderate (0.20-0.40 mmol/L) reductions in LDL cholesterol (the “bad” kind), per a 2021 review in Nutrition, Metabolism and Cardiovascular Diseases. “This gel blocks cholesterol absorption and whisks it out of the body, making it a powerful tool for anyone trying to lower their cholesterol,” Ansel says. “Soluble fiber is so effective that consuming five to 10 grams a day has been shown to lower LDL cholesterol by five to 11 points,” she says.

It supports good gut health.

Loading up on fiber helps keep you regular (as in, pooping frequently), Cohen says. Keeping things moving also lowers your risk of constipation and diverticulosis, a condition where small pouches form in the lining of the intestine, she says. Fiber-rich diets may help improve your gut microbiome, per a 2022 review in Trends in Food Science and Technology.

It may lower your risk of certain diseases.

Getting more fiber in your diet has been associated with a lowered risk of dying from heart disease and cancer, among other serious health conditions, per a study on dietary fiber in The Lancet. High fiber intake is associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, research shows, and it has even been linked to a lower risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer, per a 2020 study.

It helps you to feel full and may help with weight loss.

“Fiber promotes satiety and helps us feel full,” Cohen says. This is because fiber helps stimulate signals from the gastrointestinal tract to parts of the brain involved in appetite regulation, according to a 2024 review in Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition.

In addition to staying fuller for longer, if you’re trying to lose weight, increasing your fiber intake may be beneficial. In a recent 16-week study of 4,477 participants in the U.S., 62.5 percent of people who participated in a plant-based, fiber-rich eating program reported weight loss (about 7.2 pounds on average).

Potential Risks Of A High-Fiber Diet

“Adults—typically those who are vegans or following a raw food diet—could run into problems with too much fiber or if they increase their fiber intake too quickly,” Cohen says. Having more than 40 grams a day is usually too much for people, leading to uncomfortable symptoms like bloating, gas, feeling really full, cramps, diarrhea, constipation, and nausea, she says.

This also means that having a high-fiber diet may not be ideal for people with certain bowel diseases. In fact, a low-fiber diet may be recommended for people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBS) during a flare, per Mount Sinai. If you’re upping your fiber intake, be sure to drink plenty of water to avoid constipation.

Additionally, having too much fiber may also cause nutrient deficiencies of calcium, iron, and zinc, Cohen says. “Fiber binds to these nutrients and prevents their absorption,” she says. If you suspect you may have a nutrient deficiency, consult your healthcare provider about lab tests and the best next steps.

General Guidelines For A High-Fiber Diet

“If you’d like to increase your fiber intake, start with small servings of fiber-rich foods to give your digestive system time to adjust,” Ansel says. This may mean sprinkling a few tablespoons of canned black beans on top of tacos before amping up to having a mixture of half beef and half beans. “Once that feels comfortable, skip the beef and try a taco made entirely with beans,” Ansel says.

It's a good idea to drink plenty of water when you’re having lots of fiber, since fiber binds to water, she says. Otherwise, you run the risk of getting constipated or bloated.

Fiber supplements can be one way to increase your intake of the nutrient, but Cohen doesn’t recommend going this route if you can help it. “Taking a fiber supplement does not make up for a diet that is low in fruits, veggies, and whole grains, or high in ultra processed food,” Cohen says. “Most published research on the health benefits of fiber were conducted in populations who consume foods high in fiber, and not just supplements with fiber.”

The bottom line: If you’re looking to increase your fiber intake, start slow. Listen to your body, and gradually increase things up from there.

Most of us are aware of the impact our diet has on our health. Health bodies such as the NHS remind us that eating a healthy, balanced diet packed with fruits and vegetables can help lower our risk for certain conditions.

However, what is perhaps less known is the potential health benefits of a specific fruit, mostly used as an ingredient to add a spicy kick to meals. As shown in a number of studies, chilli peppers could hold the key to a healthy heart among other benefits.

This is mainly due to a compound found in chillies known as capsaicin, which is said to have cholesterol-lowering properties and even lower the risks of cancer and arthritis. One scientific study, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology in 2019, found that people who eat chilli peppers on a regular basis appear to lower their risk of dying from heart disease.

As part of the study, researchers analysed the diets and health records of more than 22,000 people living in southern Italy and followed them for an average time period of just over eight years. It was revealed that people who ate chilli peppers more than four times a week were about one-third less likely to die of heart disease than those who rarely or never ate the spicy-hot peppers.

This protective benefit was found whether or not the participants also followed a Mediterranean-style diet or a less healthy diet. The study authors said: “In a large adult Mediterranean population, regular consumption of chilli pepper is associated with a lower risk of total and cardiovascular disease (CVD) death independent of CVD risk factors or adherence to a Mediterranean diet. Known biomarkers of CVD risk only marginally mediate the association of chilli pepper intake with mortality.”

Separate research, published in Angiology journal in 2021, analysed four existing studies that looked at spicy food (chilli pepper, chilli sauce, or chilli oil) consumption and the link between cardiovascular disease. Combined the studies followed 564,748 participants over an average duration of 9.7 years.

The study authors found that spicy food was linked to a lower risk of all-cause death as well as cardiovascular disease-related death. They noted: “The pooled data suggested that compared with people who did not regularly consume spicy food, regular consumers of spicy food experienced a 12 per cent lower risk of all-cause mortality. Moreover, spicy food consumption was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of death from cardiac diseases, but not from cerebrovascular disorders.”

They added: “In conclusion, available epidemiological studies suggest that the consumption of spicy chilli food is associated with reduced risk of all-cause as well as heart disease-related mortality. Further studies in different populations are needed to confirm this association.”

Another study, found in Molecules journal in 2022, said that capsaicin which is found in chillies could help prevent obesity. It added that capsaicin had anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. The study said: “Capsaicinoids act against high cholesterol levels and obesity, show anticancer effects, and are used to treat arthritis pain.”"

The Number 1 Thing A Cardiologist Recommends You Avoid Eating For A Healthy Heart is eating healthy.,https://ca.style.yahoo.com/practicing-gratitude-optimism-makes-life-125327763.html,"Practicing gratitude and optimism makes your life better and may extend it, too | Opinion

We who’ve entered our so-called golden years can recite for you the usual prescriptions for extending our lives, and for improving the quality of those lives while we’re here.

Doctors tell us. Medicare tells us. Our insurance companies tell us.

Watch your waistline, exercise, keep your mind active, socialize, go for your medical checkups.

But there’s something else, less cited, that apparently can add years to our lives: our attitude.

A couple of Harvard publications suggest that practicing gratitude and optimism may benefit us about as dramatically as taking our blood pressure pills or joining a water aerobics class.

The first publication, a press release from Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, tells how researchers from the school found gratitude was associated with greater longevity among seniors.

Harvard scientist Ying Chen, the lead researcher, said earlier studies had already shown an association between gratitude and a lower risk for mental distress, as well as greater emotional and social well-being.

A new study, published in JAMA Psychiatry in July, demonstrated a positive link to physical health.

“Our study provides the first empirical evidence on this topic,” Chen said.

Chen and colleagues used data from the Nurses’ Health Study to assess levels of gratitude and mortality among almost 50,000 older women, whose average age was 79. The women completed a gratitude questionnaire measuring their agreement or disagreement with statements such as, “I have so much in life to be thankful for,” and, “If I had to list everything that I felt grateful for, it would be a very long list.”

Four years later, the Harvard researchers followed up, looking at deaths from all causes among the women. Participants whose gratitude scores were in the highest one-third of the group had a 9 percent lower incidence of death than those who scored in the bottom one-third.

Gratitude, the researchers said, appeared to protect against every cause of mortality. The results were controlled for demographics, prior health issues and lifestyle factors such as social participation, religion and even optimism, which is closely related to gratitude.

The other piece I saw was a 2019 Harvard Medical School blog by David R. Topor, then a clinical psychologist on the medical school’s faculty.

“Plenty of research suggests optimistic people have a reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, and declines in lung capacity and function,” his blog entry began. “Optimism is also associated with a lower risk of early death from cancer and infection. And now a new study links optimism to living a longer life.”

That study found highly optimistic people had longer lives and also a greater chance of achieving “exceptional longevity” — living past 85.

It controlled for diseases such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol and for health behaviors such as smoking or alcohol use.

Granted, the first thing I learned in my graduate-school courses in research methods is that correlation is not causation. The fact that two things are linked doesn’t automatically mean one caused the other.

We might find — I’m making this up — that 97 percent of drivers involved in fatal car wrecks are wearing shoes at the time of their accidents. That wouldn’t mean shoes cause car crashes.

Similarly, discovering that grateful and/or optimistic people often live longer than ungrateful and/or sour people doesn’t necessarily prove either group’s attitudes are causing their outcomes.

Still. These studies and basic common sense suggest that our attitudes do play a role in our physical and mental health, not to mention our very will to live.

Fortunately, as Topor said, all of us can take steps to improve our disposition and with it, perhaps our long-term health.

Among other things, he suggested practicing the half-smile, a technique to cope with sad feelings. You practice smiling a few minutes each day. If you can’t force a full smile, a half-smile will do. Then you note how your thoughts and mood change.

Another suggestion was setting aside time to focus on the positive. At a set time each day, think about the day’s positive aspects. What went well? What made you happy or proud?

I’m not naturally a Dr. Pangloss myself. But as I’ve aged I’ve worked on myself.

A trick I do when I’m experiencing what my dad used to call “the mulligrubs”: I force myself to make a mental list of things I’m grateful for. It’s like the old hymn said, “Count your blessings, name them one by one.” I do that and, hey, it works. I feel better despite myself.

Another tactic: I remind myself that everybody has setbacks, failures, fears. Often it’s not so much what happens to us that determines our lot, but what we do with what happens. We can be discouraged or we can look for opportunities to grow and conquer.

As Hamlet put it, “There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.”

Will my efforts to focus on the positive earn me bonus years? Who knows?

But this I do know. I feel better when I count my blessings instead of cursing my woes, and when I expect the best instead of assuming the worst.

I have a soft spot for cash back credit cards. There’s none of that beating around the bush, trying to predict when your rewards points expire or getting slapped with fees for converting air miles. One of Citibank’s most fuss-free cash back cards is the Citi Cash Back+ Card.

It’s not to be confused with the plain old Citi Cash Back Card (without the plus), which is a very popular all-round cash back card in Singapore, but operates very differently.

In a nutshell, the Citi Cash Back+ Card falls under the “unlimited cashback card” category, offering 1.6% cash back on all purchases, with no minimum spending and no cash back cap. Let’s see how it stacks up.

Citi Cash Back+ Mastercard Review—Is it MoneySmart? citi-cash-back-plus-card Overall: ★★★★☆ (3.7)

Best for: Both small spenders (as there’s no minimum spend requirement) and big spenders (as cashback is unlimited) who want a fuss-free cashback card.

The catch: Some cashback categories are excluded, such as healthcare, insurance premiums, bills and instalments. Category Our rating The deets Earn rates: Cashback ★★☆☆☆ – 1.6% unlimited cashback

– No minimum spend required

– Cashback earned doesn’t expire.

– Earn cashback on practically everything. Exceptions include: Annual fees, instalments, bills, payments to educational, governmental, and financial institutions, insurance premiums, and more. Earn categories ★★★★★ Annual fees and charges ★★★★☆ $196.20 (first year waived)

First supplementary card free, $98.10 for subsequent supplementary cards. Accessibility ★★★★☆ Minimum income requirement: $30,000 (Singaporeans and PRs) / $42,000 (Non-Singaporeans) Extras/periphery rewards ★★☆☆☆ – Complimentary travel insurance with up to S$1 million coverage when you charge your travel tickets to this card

– Get exclusive shopping, dining and travel deals with Citi World Privileges Sign-up bonus ★★★★★ Sign-up reward:

– Apple iPad (10th Gen), 64GB (worth $529)

– Secretlab TITAN Evo Lite Chair (worth $519)

– Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones (worth $589)

How the Citi Cash Back+ Card works

The card’s main benefits are the following:

1.6% cashback on everything.

No minimum spending requirement

No cashback cap

Typical exclusions apply: you can’t get cashback when you pay your income tax, late payment fees, etc

The Citi Cash Back+ Card’s strongest selling point is that it’s very straightforward. You don’t have to worry about meeting minimum spending requirements or rack your brains trying to remember what it offers cashback for.

This is typical of all unlimited cash back cards: They’re easy to use because they reward you for all kinds of spending, but the catch is that the cash rebate is relatively low. For such cards, 1.6% is already fairly high in the market.

If you’re looking exclusively in that bag of cards, then the Citi Cash Back+ Card is a good contender. However, if you’re comparing cashback cards in general, then you’ll find that 1.6% is pretty low.

Other cash back cards that offer rebates for selected spending categories typically give a much better earn rate of 5% to 10%—but only for those bonus categories. Let’s take the Citi Cash Back (without a +) card for example—this card offers 8% cashback when you spend on dining, petrol and groceries.

Who should use the Citi Cash Back+ Card?

First of all, if you’ve already found a cashback card that suits your daily spending habits, you probably shouldn’t cancel it for the Citi Cash Back+ Card. You can continue using that—your usual card—for your typical expenses like dining out, grocery shopping and transport.

However, due to the lack of a minimum spending requirement, the Citi Cash Back+ Card is a good card to have on hand as a backup card to pay for things you just don’t have a better card for. Think super niche purchases, like repairs at the car workshop, dental appointments or music lessons, to name a few.

Additionally, once you hit your cashback cap for the month, you can switch over to the Citi Cash Back+ Card to continue earning rebates since 1.6% cash back is better than none.

If all that was mind-boggling and you don’t want to think about having multiple cards for different purposes, then this card could be great for you too. The Citi Cash Back+ Card is as straightforward and fuss-free as it gets: just swipe, earn some rebates, and that’s it.

Citibank Cash Back+ Card promotions

If you are not yet a Citibank credit card member, you get to choose generous a welcome gift for getting the Citi Cash Back+ Card:

Alternatives to the Citi Cash Back+ Card

Here are the Citi Cash Back+ Card’s closest competitors.

UOB Absolute Cashback Card: This card has the highest cashback in the market at 1.7%, and works exactly like the Citi Cash Back+ Card, but better because categories like insurance also earn your cashback. The main downside is that it’s an Amex card, so you’ll be hard-pressed to find smaller merchants to accept it.

The OCBC INFINITY Cashback Card offers the same 1.6% cashback rate, while the Amex True Cashback Card offers a more attractive 2.5% cashback on foreign currency purchases.

So, if you shop online or travel often, you would probably be better off going for the Amex card.

And as for the OCBC INFINITY Cashback Card, you can eventually switch to it if your request for an annual fee waiver for the Citi Cash Back+ Card gets rejected and vice versa—it’s always good to have options!

Don’t write off the Standard Chartered Simply Cash Credit Card too. It comes in at a close second with its 1.5% earn rate, and may have an attractive welcome gift that makes it worth your while.

P.S. Here’s our MoneySmart credit card ranking rubric

In case you’re wondering, here’s how we decide on our credit card rankings.

Is that credit card MoneySmart?

Our MoneySmart credit card ranking rubric Category Our rating Overall The average rating for the credit card on the whole, calculated from the ratings for the individual categories below. Plus, we’ll give you a one-liner on who we think the credit card is best suited for. Earn rates: Air miles / Cashback / Rewards points Air miles / Cashback / Rewards points. This category looks at the depth rather than breadth of earn rates.

– 5 stars means this card’s got the highest earn rates within that credit card type.

– 3-4 stars mean it’s average

– 1-2 stars reflect earn rates that are below average. Earn categories This category looks at the breadth rather than depth of your earnings.

– 5 stars: Earn with practically any spend—usual exclusions like taxes apply.

– 3-4 stars: Earn on a large number of categories (e.g. all dining, transport and retail, but not telco bills) OR earn on 1 very broad category (e.g. all contactless/mobile payments).

– 1-2 stars: Earn a decent rate only on selected categories, such as fast food only. Annual fees and charges – 5 stars: $0

– 4 stars: $1-200

– 3 stars: $201-500

– 2 stars: $501-$999

– 1 star: $1,000 and up

We dock a star if fee waiver is NOT allowed. Accessibility Minimum income requirements: 5 stars: Less than $30,000 a year

4 stars: Around $30,000 a year for Singaporeans and $40,000-$45,o00 for non-Singaporeans

3 stars: $30,000-$60,000 a year for Singaporeans, $40,000-$70,000 for non-Singaporeans

2 stars: $60,000-$120,000 a year for Singaporeans, $70,000-$120,000 for non-Singaporeans

1 star: $120,000 and up for either, or both Exclusivity: We dock 1-2 stars if there is/are another category/categories that make the card exclusive and very specific to a certain clientele. Extras/periphery rewards These include:

– Travel benefits, such as airport lounge access

– Lifestyle benefits, such as spa privileges

– Dining benefits, such as complimentary AMEX Love Dining or Entertainer with HSBC subscriptions

We count the number of benefits and award between 0.5 to 2 stars for each, depending on how good the perk is. Sign-up bonus 5 stars: The gift(s), cash, or miles are the highest we see out there compared to other credit cards of the same type (miles, cashback, etc). Also easy to attain these welcome bonuses.

3-4 stars: Average but not disappointing sign-up bonus compared to other credit cards. You aren’t losing out.

1-2 stars: You are probably losing out in terms of the welcome bonus you’re getting; there are other similar credit cards with sign-up bonuses that are better or easier to attain.

(Getty Images)

SINGAPORE — Two Singaporean women made it to Forbes' The World 100 Most Powerful Women list released on Tuesday (5 December).

The chairperson of Temasek Trust, Ho Ching sits at No. 33, while Jenny Lee, a renowned venture capital investor, is at No. 97.

Both have featured regularly in the annual list. Ho, who has been on the list since 2004, was at No. 35 in 2022 list, while Lee ranked at No. 78. The 70-year-old former Temasek Holdings CEO's highest position was No. 3 in 2007.

Ho, who is also the wife of Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, was appointed to lead Temasek's philanthropic endowments in October 2021, after she stepped down as CEO on 1 October 2021.

During her 17 years helming Temasek, Forbes noted, Ho helped the country's sovereign wealth fund to grow its portfolio to more than US$313 billion (S$419 billion).

Jenny Lee described as trailblazer

Jenny Lee, 51, is managing partner of GGV Capital based in Shanghai. She is considered a trailblazer in her field, focusing on areas like ed-tech, robotics and AI.

Lee, who has been on the list since 2017, was also the first woman to crack the Forbes Midas List Top 10 in 2012. The Midas List is the annual ranking of the most influential and best-performing venture capital investors.

Her 2023 highlights, according to Forbes, include US$1.1 billion in gains on GGV AUM of US$9.2 billion, US$151 billion last round valuation/market cap across 31 qualifying companies, and seven IPOs.

The other two Southeast Asian women on the list are from Indonesia. The country's Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati came in at No. 47 – keeping her position from 2022 – while CEO and president-director of state-owned oil and gas company Pertamina, Nicke Widyawati, slipped to No. 51 from No. 49 in 2022.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen topped the list for the second consecutive year followed by European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and US Vice President Kamala Harris, who retain their ranking at No. 2 and No. 3 respectively.

Triumvirate of Swift, Beyonce and Barbie

Notably, the ""triumvirate of Taylor Swift, Beyonce and Barbie"" also featured on the list of powerful women.

Swift's Eras Tour, along with Beyonce's Renaissance World Tour and the blockbuster ""Barbie"" movie sparked billions of dollars of consumer spending, which also boosted the US economy. Their influence on consumers was so powerful that Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell addressed it in a July press conference.

Story continues

Because of her huge influence, Swift made her highest-ever appearance at No. 5 on the list, while Beyonce jumped to number 36 from 80 in 2022.

Barbie took the last spot, No. 100 – a position that is ""allocated every year to a figure that's not the traditional image of power but one who has, nonetheless, come to define a year"", said Forbes.

SINGAPORE — Property magnate Kwek Leng Beng is the sole Singaporean in the latest edition of Forbes Asia's annual Heroes of Philanthropy list.

Announced on Thursday (30 November), the list of 15 leading philanthropists in the Asia-Pacific region is unranked. It considers those who are providing capital from their own money—not their company's unless it is privately held and they are the majority shareholders—and giving personal time and attention to their select causes.

Kwek, No. 5 in the 2023 Forbes' Singapore's 50 Richest list with a US$11 billion (S$14.6 billion) net worth, is the executive chairman of Hong Leong Group – founded by his father in 1941 – and also executive chairman of City Developments, one of the largest real estate companies in the city state.

The 82-year-old hotel and property tycoon made it to the Heroes of Philanthropy list after he and City Developments announced a joint S$24 million (US$17.8 million) endowment to the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) in November at the launch of his biography, Strictly Business: The Kwek Leng Beng Story.

With a matching grant from the government, the total donation amounted to S$60 million and will help fund the construction of the university's administrative building at its future campus.

""With this donation, I hope to uplift further and empower a new generation of professionals paving the way for a bright future and successful careers,"" Kwek was quoted as saying during the book launch event.

Advancing higher education and research

Just like Kwek, several altruists on the list also chose to direct their donations to advance higher education and research, especially in AI. Midea Group founder He Xiangjian pledged to donate three billion yuan (US$410 million) to set up a fund supporting scientific research – including in AI and climate change – in China, while veteran philanthropist Li Ka-shing donated HK$60 million (US$7.7 million) to support using AI in medical training and research at two universities in Hong Kong.

Meanwhile, Indonesian billionaire Low Tuck Kwong gave S$101 million (US$73 million) to the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy through his eponymous foundation. It will be used to fund leadership programmes for policymaking and public service.

Others on the list are some billionaires who continue to endow their philanthropic foundations with significant amounts to carry on their missions. Japan's Takemitsu Takizaki gave 7.45 million Keyence shares worth nearly ¥390 billion (US$2.6 billion) to his foundation, while Australia's Andrew Forrest and his wife, Nicola, gave an estimated A$5 billion (US$3.3 billion) worth of Fortescue Metals Group shares to their philanthropic arm Minderoo Foundation.

Mental health was another focus. In Hong Kong, New World Development's Adrian Cheng set up a foundation that aims to support children's mental well-being, while Australian billionaire James Packer, who has personally struggled with mental health issues, donated to research in this area at the University of New South Wales.

Newcomers to the list include India's youngest billionaire Nikhil Kamath, who became the country's latest signatory of the Giving Pledge.

The Number 1 Thing A Cardiologist Recommends You Avoid Eating For A Healthy Heart is eating healthy.,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/ni-health-staff-above-inflation-203718396.html,"Health service staff in Northern Ireland should get a 5.5% pay rise this year, an independent review body has said.

A separate review has recommended a 6% pay rise for doctors and dentists.

The health minister is not obliged to follow the recommendation and will need clarity on the size of his budget.

Stormont will get extra money as a result of spending decisions announced by the Chancellor on Monday.

However, the precise amount is unlikely to become clear for several weeks.

'Severe budgetary pressures'

Stormont’s Department of Health assumes that every 1% on pay will cost roughly £50m.

Earlier this year, the department suggested it would not be able to afford any pay raises unless it received a larger budget.

Health service workers in NI accepted a 5% pay rise and one of payment of £1,505 for 2023/24.

The Executive was only able to afford that due to additional funding provided by the UK government when devolution was restored.

In a statement on Monday, Health Minister Mike Nesbitt welcomed the publication of the two reports.

Mr Nesbitt says he supports the recommendations ""in principle"" and will be engaging with his executive colleagues and the government to ""confirm the financial implications for NI and to see to secure the additional funding required"".

""The severe budgetary pressures on health and social care in NI mean I am unable to make an immediate decision on the recommendations,"" he said.

""This is very regrettable, but I can assure staff I will do everything in my power to ensure they are properly rewarded for the great work they do.""

The recommendation on doctor’s pay is separate from the pay offer being made to junior doctors in England aimed at ending a long running dispute.

Junior doctors in Northern Ireland have also been taking part in the industrial action, but it will be down to the Executive to make its own offer to end the dispute.

Singtel (SGX: Z74)

Singtel will support the amalgamation of Intouch Holdings (BKK: INTUCH) and Gulf Energy (SGX: TGED) to help simplify its shareholding in its Thai associate Advanced Info Services (AIS) (SGX: TADD).

Currently, Singtel and Gulf hold a 24.99% and 47.37% stake in Intouch, respectively, with Intouch owning a 40.44% stake in AIS.

An as-yet-unnamed company, NewCo, will result from this amalgamation and is expected to become one of the largest and most liquid listed companies in Thailand.

In exchange for its stake in Intouch, Singtel will receive an approximately 9% stake in NewCo.

The blue-chip telco will also book a gain of around S$400 million from this amalgamation.

After the transaction is completed, Singtel will evaluate its options for NewCo even as it continues to be a long-term investor in Thailand through its stake in AIS.

Arthur Lang, Singtel’s group CFO, mentioned that the telco will have the opportunity to increase its (now) direct 23.3% stake in AIS through this transaction.

This transaction should close by the second quarter of 2025 subject to the approval of the shareholders of both Intouch and Gulf.

Thai Beverage PCL (SGX: Y92)

Thai Beverage, or ThaiBev, has proposed a share swap transaction with TCC Assets Limited (TCC) with no cash outlay involved for either party.

The proposal will see ThaiBev transfer its entire 28.78% stake in Frasers Property Limited (SGX: TQ5), or FPL, to TCC.

In turn, TCC will transfer its 41.3% shareholding in Fraser & Neave (SGX: F99), or F&N, to ThaiBev.

This transaction can be clearly understood in the diagram below.

Source: Thai Beverage’s Presentation Slides

As a result of this transaction, ThaiBev will cease to hold any shares in FPL while increasing its stake in F&N from 28.3% to 69.61%.

For TCC, its stake in FPL will increase from the existing 58.1% to 86.89% and its shareholding in F&N will plunge from 58.9% to just 17.6%.

The proposed share swap will be carried out based on around 1.88 FPL shares for each share of F&N.

The ratio was determined based on a share price of S$1.89 per FPL share and S$3.55 per F&N share.

When completed, ThaiBev will become a pure-play food and beverage company with no stake in the property sector.

The group can also leverage its stronger relationship with F&N to increase its exposure to the fast-growing non-alcoholic beverage and dairy segments.

With F&N’s strategic focus on building a strong portfolio of non-alcoholic drinks, ThaiBev can also benefit as it gives the latter exposure to isotonic drinks and dairy products.

Story continues

These new products are also in line with the growing consumer focus on health and wellness.

This consolidation exercise will result in ThaiBev’s earnings per share increasing by 3.4% from THB 1.06 to THB 1.10 for the 12 months ending 31 March 2024.

An extraordinary general meeting will be convened in mid-September 2024 for shareholders to vote on this proposal.

If the resolution is approved, the transaction should be completed by the end of September, which is also the fiscal year-end for F&N, FPL, and ThaiBev.

Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Holdings (SGX: BS6)

Yangzijiang Shipbuilding, or YZJ, has entered into an agreement with the government of Jinjiang City in Jiangsu province (China) for the acquisition of land use rights for approximately 1,300 acres of land.

This land is earmarked for the establishment of a new clean energy ship manufacturing base (the “project”).

The piece of land features around 1,320 metres of shoreline along the Yangtze River and offers expansion opportunities in the future.

This project is located adjacent to YZJ’s existing manufacturing base and will allow the group to seamlessly integrate the two facilities to achieve better productivity and higher operating efficiency.

YZJ plans to invest around RMB 3 billion in capital expenditure over two years to fund the project but is awaiting the outcome of a feasibility study before proceeding.

Management believes that there is good potential for LNG and other clean energy vessels, which forms the basis for this move.

The shipbuilder also needs to seek approval from various government agencies and if approval is granted, the project will be executed in phases to ensure resources are utilised optimally.

Millennials and Gen Xers face higher risk of 17 cancers than previous generations.,https://www.sciencealert.com/millennials-and-gen-x-face-higher-risk-of-these-17-cancers-than-boomers,"Cancer cases in younger generations are continuing to rise at a disturbing rate, according to a massive new study from the American Cancer Society (ACS).

The analysis considers the health data of more than 23 million US patients, born between 1920 and 1990, who were later diagnosed with cancer from 2000 to 2019.

Compared to baby boomers, researchers found Gen Xers and millennials are at a higher risk of developing 17 out of 34 considered cancers, including leukemia, breast cancer, and gastric cancer.

Millennials born in 1990 were two to three times more likely to develop pancreatic, kidney, or small intestinal cancer than baby boomers born in 1955. Female millennials also face an increased risk of liver and bile duct cancer.

What's more, nine cancers, for which incidence rates have mostly fallen in the older generations, such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, testicular cancer, and anal cancer, are on the rise in younger people.

Uterine cancer alone is 169 percent more likely to impact a person born in the 1990s than people born in the 1930s.

The risk of death from these cancers is also increasing.

That's never a good sign, and it suggests there has been a quiet, generational shift in cancer risk over the past century or so.

Researchers suspect this is partly because younger generations, under the age of 50, are increasingly exposed to carcinogens in early life or young adulthood. These risky exposures, however, have ""yet to be elucidated"".

Ten of the 17 cancers increasing in incidence among millennials and Gen Xers are related to obesity, which could also play a role in the generational disparity.

""As the elevated risk in younger generations is carried over as individuals age, an overall increase in cancer burden could occur in the future, halting or reversing decades of progress against the disease,"" says cancer epidemiologist Ahmedin Jemal of ACS.

""The data highlights the critical need to identify and address underlying risk factors in Gen X and Millennial populations to inform prevention strategies.""

The results of the current analysis expand on previous research, which found cancer rates in people under 50 have surged by almost 80 percent in 30 years.

If trends continue, the World Health Organization warns that by 2050 cancer cases could jump by a further 77 percent. Officials blame tobacco, alcohol, obesity, and air pollution as key factors.

Other exposures, such as poor diet, sedentary lifestyles, or sleep disturbances, could also play a role in cancer incidence, although these factors ""remain poorly understood"", researchers note.

There is, however, some good news hiding in the recent analysis from ACS.

An ""accelerated downturn"" in young people with cervical cancer ""shows the effectiveness of HPV vaccination, particularly in women born in approximately 1990"", who were just the right age when the vaccine was approved in the US.

Previous studies have shown cervical cancer cases have dropped 90 percent since the advent of this vaccine.

Additionally, cancers related to smoking, such as lung and throat cancer, are also declining in younger birth cohorts.

""These findings add to growing evidence of increased cancer risk in post-Baby Boomer generations,"" says cancer epidemiologist Hyuna Sung of ACS.

""Although we have identified cancer trends associated with birth years, we don't yet have a clear explanation for why these rates are rising.""

The study was published in The Lancet Public Health."
Millennials and Gen Xers face higher risk of 17 cancers than previous generations.,https://www.health.com/millennials-gen-x-higher-risk-17-cancers-8690476,"New research finds that younger generations have higher rates of 17 different types of cancer as compared to older generations.

More research is necessary to understand how environmental and lifestyle factors—including nutrition habits and exercise—may increase the risk of developing cancer.

Experts said health interventions among individuals and at a population level are needed to address this trend.

Younger generations seem to have a higher risk of developing 17 different types of cancer, according to a new study.

The research, published on August 1 in The Lancet Public Health, looked at incidence rates for 34 different cancers in people born between 1920 and 1990. The results showed that many of these cancers—including pancreatic, ovarian, and colorectal cancers—are becoming more prevalent in Generation X (Gen X) and millennials.

These findings are “somewhat shocking and a little disappointing to see,” Corinne Joshu, PhD, associate professor of cancer epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told Health.

This isn’t the first piece of research to come to this conclusion—in fact, a study published just last month predicted that Gen X will see higher rates of certain cancers as compared to their parents. Plus, other studies have called attention to concerning increases in early-onset cancer incidence, or cancer cases in people under age 50.

But this newly published study, led by researchers at the American Cancer Society, discovered that cancer prevalence isn't the only concern—mortality rates also increased for multiple types of cancer in younger individuals, data showed.



“Despite many unknowns, emerging evidence suggests that early-lifetime exposures to well-established cancer risk factors, such as obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and unhealthy diet, increase the risk of early-onset cancers,” study author Hyuna Sung, PhD, a senior principal scientist and cancer epidemiologist at the American Cancer Society, told Health.

Younger People Are Seeing More Cancer Cases and Higher Mortality

To investigate how cancer was showing up differently across generations, Sung and her team looked at health records from the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics. They included data from over 23.6 million people who were diagnosed with one of 34 types of cancer. They also looked at records of over 7.3 million deaths from 25 different types of cancer.

The health records were from individuals aged 25 to 84 and were collected between January 2000 and December 2019.

The researchers divided the records based on birth year to compare cancer rates and mortality across five-year birth cohorts between 1920 and 1990. These birth cohorts helped the researchers control for social, economic, and environmental factors that might affect or explain cancer risk.

Overall, the study found that the incidence of eight of the 34 cancers increased with every successive birth cohort.

More specifically, the 1990 birth cohort had incidence rates two to three times higher than the 1955 birth cohort for pancreatic, kidney, and small intestinal cancer. This was also true for liver cancer in women.



The 17 cancers that had a higher incidence in younger people include:

cardia gastric, a type of stomach cancer

small intestine

estrogen receptor-positive breast

ovary

colon and rectum

leukemia

endometrial and other cancers of the uterine corpus

gallbladder and biliary tract

kidney and renal pelvis

pancreas

myeloma (white blood cell)

non-cardia gastric, a type of stomach cancer

testicles

liver and intrahepatic bile duct in women

non-HPV-associated oral and pharynx in women

anus in men

Kaposi sarcoma (a cancer that causes lesions to grow throughout the body) in men

However, not all trends were negative for younger people—the incidence rate and mortality of 14 different cancers either decreased or remained stagnant across birth cohorts. These included brain and nervous system cancer, cervical cancer, lung cancer, and more.

Despite the large amount of data that was included in the researchers’ analysis, Sung said there are further questions to explore. In particular, the researchers did not examine whether there were race-based differences in mortality or incidence trends, which warrants a follow-up study, she said.

However, this research provides a look at the many different cancer types that previous studies didn’t take into account and includes valuable information about younger generations’ risk of dying from cancer, said Sung.

Why Are Cancer Rates and Mortality Increasing?

For now, researchers don’t exactly know what’s behind the increase in cancer rates and mortality in younger generations.

One hypothesis is that cancer only seems more prevalent in younger people because doctors now have better tools to spot the signs of cancer early. However, Sung doesn’t think this explains the increase across birth cohorts.

“If there is an age-related difference, it would likely be more pronounced in older individuals as they tend to seek medical care more often,” she said. “Yet, the faster rise in cancer cases among younger adults and the disproportionate increase in this group cannot be fully attributed to advancements in diagnostics alone.”

Instead, exposure to carcinogenic (cancer-causing) environmental and lifestyle factors may be behind these increases.

“Ten of 17 cancers with [an] increasing trend are associated with excess body weight,” Sung said. “Other suspected risk factors include unhealthy diet, sedentary lifestyle, altered sleep patterns, and environmental chemicals, exposed during early life and young adulthood.”

In particular, more research is needed to understand the impacts of these environmental hazards—including microplastics—on people’s overall cancer risk, Sung said.

“The challenge now is to understand what part of these increases that we’re seeing is due to established, known risk factors, and exposure to those risk factors at younger and younger ages, and then how much of this is due to novel exposures,” Joshu added.

Reducing Cancer Risk on an Individual and Systemic Level

While scientists aren’t sure yet what’s causing the increase in all of these cancers, there are well-known modifiable risk factors such as diet, sleep, and physical activity that can play a role in cancer risk, said Joshu.

Staying on top of regular screenings and addressing some of these risk factors are ways that individual people combat these trends.

“Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is not really that easy, and certainly not easy for everyone,” Joshu said. “I think as a society, we have to decide whether or not we value making a healthy lifestyle and healthy choices, the easy choices to make for everyone.”

But Sung also emphasized that positive health changes need to be promoted on a systemic level, too. These interventions can and should start young.

“Investing in education for health promotion, and improving the built environment and school food systems for children and adolescents [are] crucial to reducing the risk of cancer and other chronic diseases,” Sung said.

For kids, the importance of healthy school lunches, accessible spaces for physical activity, and education about how smoking and alcohol can affect our bodies “cannot be overstated,” she said.

Millennials and Gen Xers face higher risk of 17 cancers than previous generations.,https://www.medicalbrief.co.za/millennials-and-gen-xers-have-higher-risk-of-17-cancers-us-study/,"US and Canadian researchers have identified 17 cancer types that appear to be more common in Generation X and millennials than in older age groups, after analysing data from more than 23m patients – but on the upside, found that lung cancer and cervical cancer rates are dropping.

Among adults born between 1920 and 1990, they found a significant difference between each generation in the incidence of cancer rates and cancer types, including breast, colon and rectal, pancreatic and uterine cancers, according to the study published in The Lancet Public Health.

“Uterine cancer is one that really jumps out – it has about a 169% higher incidence rate if you’re born in the 1990s as opposed to if you’re born in the 1950s, and this is for people at the same age,” said Dr William Dahut, chief scientific officer for the American Cancer Society, whose colleagues authored the study.

“Someone born in the 1950s… when they were in their 30s or 40s… saw a different incidence rate compared with those born in the 1990s when they got to their 30s or 40s,” he added.

“What’s different about this paper is that it includes a wider variety of cancers. It actually looked at 34 different cancers, in 17 of which we saw an increase in incidence, and five an increase in mortality in young adults under 50.”

Those 17 cancers are:

gastric cardia

small intestine

oestrogen receptor-positive breast

ovary

liver and intrahepatic bile duct in women

non-HPV-associated oral and pharynx cancers in women

anus

colon and rectal

uterine corpus

gallbladder and other biliary

kidney and renal pelvis

pancreas

myeloma

non-cardia gastric

testis

leukaemia

Kaposi sarcoma, which affects the lining of blood vessels and lymph vessels, in men.

CNN reports that the researchers, from the American Cancer Society and the University of Calgary in Canada, analysed data on more than 23m patients diagnosed with 34 types of cancer and more than 7m people who died of 25 types of cancer.

The data, which came from the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and the US National Centre for Health Statistics, included adults between 25 and 84, from January 2000 to December 2019.

The researchers calculated cancer incidence rates and cancer death rates by birth years, separated by five-year intervals, from 1920 to 1990, and found that the incidence rates had increased with each successive cohort born since about 1920 for eight of 34 cancers.

The rate was about two to three times higher among those born in 1990 than among those born in 1955 for pancreatic, kidney and small intestinal cancers in both men and women, and for liver cancer in women.

Across cancer types, the increased incidence rate among people born in 1990 ranged from 12% higher for ovarian cancer to 169% higher for uterine corpus cancer, compared with the birth cohorts that had the lowest incidence rates.

“The increasing incidence of certain cancers among young adults suggests the rise is potentially due to changes in the environment or lifestyle,” said Dr Andrea Cercek, a gastrointestinal medical oncologist and co-director of the Centre for Young Onset Colorectal and Gastrointestinal Cancers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre.

“The study shows that some cancers which were previously not prevalent in young adults, are now rising,” added Cercek, who was not involved with the study.

“It is not known why gastrointestinal, gynaecological and ER-positive breast cancers are rising in young adults, but we believe it may be due to early exposure to an environmental factor or factors.”

The researchers found that 10 of the 17 cancers with increasing incidence in younger birth cohorts are related to obesity: colon and rectal, kidney and renal pelvis, gallbladder and other biliary, uterine corpus, pancreas, cardia gastric, oestrogen receptor-positive breast, ovary, myeloma, and liver and bile duct.

As cancer requires time to develop, an obesity-related cancer in a young adult could be associated with their childhood health.

“If people are developing cancer at an earlier age, that means their exposure – whether it was environmental or climate or diet or whatever else – occurred at a younger age too,” Dahut said. “If you have cancer in your 30s or 20s, then your teens, or even earlier, is probably the time when you had that exposure or the instigating event.”

The researchers also found that cancer death rates increased in successively younger generations alongside incidence rates for liver cancer among women, uterine corpus, gallbladder, testicular, and colon and rectal cancers.

The new study had some good news. The cancers that are not rising – and are even on the decline in younger generations – include those related to tobacco, such as lung cancer, and HPV infections, such as cervical cancer.

The “accelerated downturn” in the trend of cervical cancer incidence shows the effectiveness of HPV vaccination among women born around 1990, who were about 16-years-old when that vaccination was approved in the United States, according to the study.

And the downward trends for tobacco-related cancers parallel a rapid decline in the prevalence of smoking among younger generations.

“These findings add to growing evidence of increased cancer risk in post-Baby Boomer generations, expanding on previous findings of early-onset colorectal cancer and a few obesity-associated cancers to encompass a broader range of cancer types,” said Dr Hyuna Sung, lead author of the study and a senior principal scientist of surveillance and health equity science at the American Cancer Society.

“Birth cohorts, groups of people classified by their birth year, share unique social, economic, political, and climate environments, which affect their exposure to cancer risk factors during their crucial developmental years.

“Although we have identified cancer trends associated with birth years, we don’t yet have a clear explanation for why these rates are rising.”

Growing trend of earlier screening

Several factors – including changes in diet, decreased physical activity levels, rising childhood obesity rates and the increased use of more advanced diagnostic tests – are probably behind the rising cancer incidence among younger age groups, said Dr Ernest Hawk, chair of the Division of Cancer Prevention and Population Sciences at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Centre, who was not involved in the study.

He added that the findings signal that screening might need to start at earlier ages for some types of cancer.

“That has already taken place for both breast cancer screening as well as colon cancer screening. For both of those, just within the past five years, we have decreased the age at which to initiate screening in the general, average-risk population,” Hawk said. “So the downward migration in the age to start screening has already begun to move in that direction for some cancers, partly for this very reason.”

“Overall, the findings of increased cancer incidence in recent birth cohorts for 17 cancer types have important public health implications,” the researchers wrote.

“Improving awareness among healthcare providers and the public about the signs and symptoms of cancer among young adults is crucial for early detection and treatment.”

Study details

Differences in cancer rates among adults born between 1920 and 1990 in the USA: an analysis of population-based cancer registry data

Hyuna Sung, Chenxi Jiang, Priti Bandi, et al.

Published in The Lancet Public Health in August 2024

Summary

Background

Trends in cancer incidence in recent birth cohorts largely reflect changes in exposures during early life and foreshadow the future disease burden. Herein, we examined cancer incidence and mortality trends, by birth cohort, for 34 types of cancer in the USA.

Methods

In this analysis, we obtained incidence data for 34 types of cancer and mortality data for 25 types of cancer for individuals aged 25–84 years for the period Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 31, 2019 from the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and the US National Centre for Health Statistics, respectively. We calculated birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and mortality rate ratios (MRRs), adjusted for age and period effects, by nominal birth cohort, separated by 5 year intervals, from 1920 to 1990.

Findings

We extracted data for 23 654 000 patients diagnosed with 34 types of cancer and 7 348 137 deaths from 25 cancers for the period Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 31, 2019. We found that IRRs increased with each successive birth cohort born since approximately 1920 for eight of 34 cancers (pcohort<0·050). Notably, the incidence rate was approximately two-to-three times higher in the 1990 birth cohort than in the 1955 birth cohort for small intestine (IRR 3·56 [95% CI 2·96–4·27]), kidney and renal pelvis (2·92 [2·50–3·42]), and pancreatic (2·61 [2·22–3·07]) cancers in both male and female individuals; and for liver and intrahepatic bile duct cancer in female individuals (2·05 [1·23–3·44]). Additionally, the IRRs increased in younger cohorts, after a decline in older birth cohorts, for nine of the remaining cancers (pcohort<0·050): oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer, uterine corpus cancer, colorectal cancer, non-cardia gastric cancer, gallbladder and other biliary cancer, ovarian cancer, testicular cancer, anal cancer in male individuals, and Kaposi sarcoma in male individuals. Across cancer types, the incidence rate in the 1990 birth cohort ranged from 12% (IRR1990 vs 1975 1·12 [95% CI 1·03–1·21] for ovarian cancer) to 169% (IRR1990 vs 1930 2·69 [2·34–3·08] for uterine corpus cancer) higher than the rate in the birth cohort with the lowest incidence rate. The MRRs increased in successively younger birth cohorts alongside IRRs for liver and intrahepatic bile duct cancer in female individuals, uterine corpus, gallbladder and other biliary, testicular, and colorectal cancers, while MRRs declined or stabilised in younger birth cohorts for most cancers types.

Interpretation

A total of 17 of 34 cancers had an increasing incidence in younger birth cohorts, including nine that previously had declining incidence in older birth cohorts. These findings add to growing evidence of increased cancer risk in younger generations, highlighting the need to identify and tackle underlying risk factors.

A variety of cancers are on the rise among young adults, according to a new study.

However, the rise in the majority of these cancers is related to one cause: obesity.

Worldwide obesity rates recently hit 1 billion, making it one of the most significant public health problems to date. The Dallas Express has reported extensively on the epidemic of obesity and the many health problems that it causes. Carrying excess fat can heighten a person’s risk for an array of diseases and conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, dementia, heart disease, and more. Now add over 10 different types of cancer to that list, including colon and rectal, kidney and renal pelvis, gallbladder and other biliary, pancreas, and cardia gastric.

CNN reports on the new study’s findings, and some of the things researchers speculate are behind the rise in numbers. Here’s the start of the story:"
Millennials and Gen Xers face higher risk of 17 cancers than previous generations.,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/08/health/stroke-death-rising-middle-age-adults-us/index.html,"CNN —

Middle-age people in the United States are more likely to die from a stroke than they have been in about two decades, according to a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

After at least a decade of decline, the death rate from stroke for people ages 45 to 64 started to rise in 2012. By 2019, the stroke death rate for this age group had grown 7% from where it was seven years earlier, and it spiked another 12% in the early years of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Stroke deaths for this age group dipped slightly in 2022 but were still significantly higher than before the pandemic. More than 19,700 people ages 45 to 64 died from a stroke in 2022, according to the new report – about 24 deaths for every 100,000 people in this age group.

Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the US overall, and most strokes happen to people 65 and older. Earlier research has found that Covid-19 infection raises the risk of stroke for people of all ages.

But the longer-term rise in stroke death rates among middle-age people contrasts with the downward trend seen among seniors and elderly people over the past decade, says Sally Curtain, a statistician with the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics and author of the new report.

Also, racial and ethnic disparities in the death rate from stroke are much higher among middle-age adults than they are for older adults, she said. Among those 65 and older, the stroke death rate for Black people was 24% higher than it was for White seniors; among those ages 45 to 64, it was 133% higher for Black people than White people.

Middle-age men are more likely to die from a stroke than middle-age women, and stroke death rates are higher in the South than any other region, according to the new report.

In 2022, there were about 66 deaths from stroke for every 100,000 middle-age Black men living in the South – nearly three times more than the overall rate for this age group.

Experts warn that middle age is an important time to monitor your health and manage risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity.

“Many people think about stroke being an older person’s disease, and it is. The longer you’re alive, the longer the risk factors have to cause plaque to form in blood vessels,” said Dr. Elisabeth Breese Marsh, a vascular neurologist and director of the Comprehensive Stroke Center at Johns Hopkins Bayview. But the arteries start to harden in middle age, which can exacerbate the build-up and lead to complications.

“All of these risk factors are so prevalent in society, and we’re seeing them at earlier ages. It is not uncommon for younger people now to have strokes due to these comorbidities,” said Marsh, who was not involved in the new report. “No one wants to feel old, but it’s taking care of yourself earlier on that really helps you to thrive in middle and later life.”

Stroke diagnosis and treatment options have evolved greatly over the past decade, experts say. And new ways to address comorbidities – such as blockbuster GLP-1 drugs that are used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity – hold promise in managing risk factors.

But it’s crucial for people who are having a stroke to act fast – and to have equitable access to health care and treatment, experts say.

Strokes are often identified by a sudden severe headache, vision problems in one or both eyes, trouble walking, paralysis or numbness in the face or limbs, and trouble speaking or understanding others, according to the Mayo Clinic.

The younger brains of middle-age adults have significant potential to recover if treated quickly and aggressively, Marsh said, but people in this age group may wait longer to seek care because they may be less likely to admit they need help.

“It’s really important, whether it’s the patient or their family, that they recognize the symptoms and get to the hospital as fast as possible,” she said. “Those first couple of hours are critical.”"
Millennials and Gen Xers face higher risk of 17 cancers than previous generations.,https://www.biznews.com/health/2024/08/07/ft-rising-rates-cancer-young-people,"Cancer, once predominantly seen as a disease of old age, is increasingly affecting younger generations. A study by the American Cancer Society reveals that Gen X and Millennials face higher risks of developing certain cancers compared to Baby Boomers. Notably, gastrointestinal cancers are prevalent, suggesting potential links to microplastics and lifestyle changes. These findings highlight the need for revised screening programs and further investigation into environmental carcinogens affecting younger populations.

That many of the cancers are gastrointestinal offers clues and could point to microplastics ___STEADY_PAYWALL___

The idea of cancer as predominantly a disease of old age is beginning to creak. An analysis last year showed that, in the G20 group of industrialised nations, rates of several cancers are rising faster among the young than among the old.

Now, scientists at the American Cancer Society have confirmed the trend across a wider range of cancers, with statistics broadly suggesting that a Gen X or Millennial is more likely to develop certain types of the disease than her Baby-boomer parents. Half of the 34 types studied showed a “birth cohort effect”, meaning they are increasingly common among successively younger cohorts. For pancreatic and kidney cancer, for example, the incidence rate among those born in 1990 was two to three times the rate of those born in 1955.

The academics who published their findings in Lancet Public Health last week say these are “generational shifts in cancer risk”. The shifts come with profound implications. A tide of younger patients poses a challenge for future cancer care, whether it is rethinking screening programmes or finding ways to preserve fertility during treatment. As the disease itself metastasises into something unfamiliar, the dream of consigning it to history grows more challenging.

Hyuna Sung, an Atlanta-based epidemiologist at the ACS, teamed up with colleagues to dig into American cancer registry data on more than 23mn people who were diagnosed with 34 types of cancer between 2000 and 2019. The researchers also drew on registries recording over 7mn deaths from 24 types of cancer over the same period.

The data was sorted according to birth year, with patients grouped in five-year intervals from 1920 to 1990. Previous research by the ACS and other groups has found evidence of several cancers — including colorectal (or bowel), pancreatic, kidney, gallbladder and testicular — rising in the under-50s. Sung and colleagues found that same pattern writ large.

Among the new conditions trending upwards in younger generations are cancers of the small intestine, liver cancer in women and anal cancer among men. In some cases, death rates tacked upwards with incidence, including for colorectal, liver (in women) and testicular cancers. “These findings are sobering as they indicate the increased cancer risk in younger generations is not merely an artefact due to more frequent cancer detection and diagnosis,” Sung told me. “Instead, it points to a genuine increase in cancer risk at the population level, with the increase in incidence being substantial enough to outweigh improvements in cancer survival.”

That many of the cancers afflicting younger patients are gastrointestinal — including colorectal, bile duct, liver and gall bladder — might offer clues. Jeffrey Meyerhardt, chief clinical research officer at Harvard University’s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, which recently opened a clinic focusing on under-50s with colorectal cancer, says there are likely unidentified risk factors but there are also known risk factors, like sedentary behaviour, a change in diet, plus rising rates of obesity and diabetes.

Those same factors could be disrupting the gut microbiome, the balance of internal bacteria thought to influence health and immunity. “But exactly what those [microbiome] changes are and how to reverse or improve them are not known,” Meyerhardt said.

Bafflingly, many of the new clinic’s young patients are in good shape, exercise regularly and eat healthily. That is prompting a hunt for environmental carcinogens capable of affecting entire generations. Last year, New Zealand researchers showed that microplastics, now found everywhere and ingested from infancy onwards, could disrupt the gut lining. The prevalence of microplastic pollution since the 1960s — the tiny plastic particles come from consumer products and the breakdown of industrial waste — has the right timeline and might explain the compounding effect between generations, but it needs further investigation.

In the meantime, screening programmes are changing: in the US, a task force has advised breast cancer screening starts a decade earlier at 40; but experts agonise over doing something similar for colorectal cancer, because it would still miss those in their twenties and thirties.

These are delicate calls. Wider screening carries downsides: expense, radiation exposure and false positives. And the over-50s still make up 90 per cent of cancer cases. Still, the shifting burden of disease deserves closer policy attention now.

Millennials and Gen Xers face higher risk of 17 cancers than previous generations.,https://evrimagaci.org/tpg/younger-generations-face-rising-cancer-risks-8490,"Younger Generations Face Rising Cancer Risks Millennials and Gen X show alarming increases in 17 cancer types, prompting urgent health interventions

Younger generations are facing alarming rates of cancer diagnoses, as recent research indicates. Notably, millennials and Generation X are more at risk for developing 17 specific types of cancer compared to their older counterparts, including baby boomers. This rise has sparked significant concern among health experts and researchers alike.

Published findings from The Lancet Public Health reveal startling statistics about cancer incidence. The study reviewed health records of over 23 million individuals born between 1920 and 1990 and diagnosed with cancer from 2000 to 2019. The data shows rising rates not only of common cancers like breast and pancreatic cancer but also of lesser-known forms like gastric cardia cancer and Kaposi sarcoma.

Among the shocking findings, individuals born around 1990 are reported to have two to three times the likelihood of developing pancreatic, kidney, and small intestinal cancers than those born in 1955. ""What is happening with these generations can be seen as indicative of future cancer trends,"" notes Hyuna Sung, a cancer epidemiologist leading the study. She emphasizes the necessity for healthcare interventions to address these rising risks.

Interestingly, the rise isn't just limited to incidence rates. Mortality rates for certain cancers have also increased among younger demographics, with endometrial and colorectal cancers showing particularly concerning growth. ""These shifts may suggest early-life exposures to established cancer risk factors, like obesity and sedentary lifestyles,"" Dr. Sung explained.

Many professionals suspect environmental and lifestyle shifts have contributed to this trend. Dr. Otis Brawley of Johns Hopkins University, noticing parallels between obesity rates and cancer incidence, stated, ""Approximately 20% of cancer diagnoses in the U.S. are linked to excess body weight."" Indeed, obesity rates have climbed dramatically since the 1980s, correlatively matching the rise of cancer incidence among younger adults.

The nature of the 17 identified cancers varies considerably. Some are more prevalent due to genetic factors, but many are also associated with lifestyle choices and the environment. For example, some cancers linked to obesity include endometrial and kidney cancers, as well as various gastrointestinal cancers. This correlation adds urgency to health promotion interventions aimed at younger populations.

Although the statistics look grim, it’s also important to note where progress has been made. Data suggests reduced incidence rates for some cancers, including lung and cervical cancers, thanks to successful public health campaigns like the HPV vaccine rollout. The vaccine has led to a notable decrease in cervical cancer cases among younger women, showcasing the potential impact of preventive healthcare.

While there’s not yet a clear answer as to why cancer rates are climbing, experts are exploring various potential culprits. Theories range from the changes in dietary habits to increased exposure to carcinogenic substances over the decades. Whether from processed foods, environmental pollutants, or shifts in reproductive health practices, the influences are multifaceted.

Researchers highlighted the importance of continuing to monitor these trends closely as new data emerges. ""Understanding generational cancer patterns can give insights not just for current care, but also for the future health of these populations,"" underscores Dr. Sung.

The collective findings from this study and others reveal the pressing need for targeted research to understand the underlying mechanisms behind these rises. Identifying environmental and lifestyle factors will be critical for establishing effective public health policies and preventative measures moving forward.

Research efforts are underway to understand better not only the “why” behind these trends but also the “how” we can combat them. Encouraging healthier lifestyles among younger individuals could be one aspect of solution. Though challenges certainly lie ahead, the continued interest and investigations opened up by these findings are promising. Acting on this information may pave the way for better health outcomes and more informed healthcare strategies for future generations."

(MENAFN- The Conversation) A worrying new study by the American Cancer Society has revealed that generation X and millennials are at more risk of developing many types of cancer than their predecessors. This is in line with a growing body of evidence which shows that some cancers, like those of the bowel, breast and pancreas, are becoming more common in young people .

This new study looked at data from almost 24 million cancer patients collected from US cancer registries over a 20-year period, beginning in 2000. The research team sorted the data according to cancer type, sex and birth cohort – in other words, the five-year period during which they'd been born. They also carried out a statistical adjustment to take into account the fact that, for everyone, the older you get the more likely you are to develop cancer.

By analysing rates of the 34 most commonly occurring cancers (those which had at least 200,000 cases over the two decades) the study provides the most definitive evidence yet for a changing picture of how many people are getting cancer – and when and why they're getting it.

Shockingly, 17 different cancers are becoming increasingly common in the younger cohorts analysed. For example, people born in 1990 were between two and three times more likely to develop cancers of the small intestine, thyroid, kidney and pancreas than those born in 1955. They also found that people born more recently are getting cancer at a younger age. Across all ages and all cancers, the most dramatic increases in cancer were those of the pancreas and small intestine in the under-30s.

In some cases, such as with bowel cancer, the increased incidence in younger generations has even reversed a previous trend of decline seen in previous generations – suggesting that previous public health gains are now being lost.

Lifestyle and behaviour changes

So, what's going on? Why are gen X and millenials more likely to get certain types of cancer than their parents' and grandparents' generations? The answer probably lies in changing lifestyles and behaviour.

Poor diet and increasingly sedentary behaviour are two probable culprits.

Ten of the 17 cancers identified, such as bowel and breast cancer, have been associated with obesity. The US, like many other countries, is experiencing an obesity epidemic, with rates increasing year on year. There's growing evidence to suggest that obesity in childhood or early adulthood can increase the risk of some cancers. A related factor that is likely to be important is the increase in consumption of ultra-processed foods. These have been linked with increased likelihood of developing cancer .

Increased binge drinking, particularly in millenial women , was highlighted by the study's authors as a cause of the increased rates of liver and oesophageal cancers seen among this specific cohort.

Meanwhile in men, they noted a U-shaped trend (meaning rates declined after an initial peak, then began rising again) for Kaposi's sarcoma and anal cancer – two cancers associated with HIV infection. After a period of declining rates, this trend was reversed for cohorts born from the mid-1970s onwards. This mirrors the recent resurgence in HIV infection rates in the US.

Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) – a sexually transmitted virus known to cause cervical cancer – may also be a factor in the increase in anal cancer rates. It's estimated that 90% of anal cancers are caused by HPV infection .

Interestingly, in contrast to the trend seen for anal cancer in men, the study observed a sharp decrease in cervical cancer risk for women born in the 1990 birth cohort – the first to have been vaccinated against HPV. When HPV vaccines were first rolled out they were only provided to girls , meaning that young men in this generation will not have been protected.

While some of the changes the researchers observed in cancer rates can be attributed to generational shifts in lifestyles and behaviours with known links to cancer, they can't account for all the changes they saw – such as increases in leukaemia. The authors note that more work needs to be done to understand the causes of cancers. Without fully knowing why these cancers are becoming more common, it will be difficult to take appropriate steps to reverse these trends.

The picture isn't uniformly gloomy though. Some cancers are actually becoming less common in younger generations. The study showed a steady decline in the risk of developing lung cancer for successive generations. People born in 1990 are five times less likely to develop the disease versus those born in 1955. Similar progress is also beginning to be seen for melanoma, where people born in 1990 were less at risk than every other cohort born in the preceding 50 years.

These trends reflect the success of public health campaigns aimed at discouraging tobacco use and encouraging sun-safe behaviour . They highlight how changing behaviour and making healthier choices can reduce our risk of getting cancer."
Onondaga County completes the spray of the Cicero Swamp after detecting viruses in mosquitoes.,https://www.cnycentral.com/news/local/cicero-swamp-mosquito-aerial-spraying-west-nile-virus-eastern-equine-encephalopathy-onondaga-county-health-department-dengue,"The Onondaga County Health Department has identified an elevated level of Eastern Equine Encephalopathy (EEE), as well as West Nile Virus in the mosquitoes they collected from the Cicero Swamp.

""It is not necessarily when we find EEE that it has just arrived. I think that it is something we probably have every year, and we probably have present even before we find it in traps,"" said Dr. Kathryn Anderson, the commissioner of the Onondaga County Health Department. Dr. Anderson added that there are not necessarily more mosquitoes this year, but the ones that do exist are circulating more viruses.

We typically wait until we see positive traps for two weeks in a row for EEE or West Nile, which we have seen now, and we should say that when we spray, the goal is to knock out as many infected mosquitoes as we can.

Data shows that EEE and West Nile likely came to Central New York from Florida and do so every year. The good news is that dengue, a viral infection spread by mosquitoes, is not in Onondaga County.

""From what we know right now, the mosquito that spreads dengue is not present in the county,"" said Laura Adams, an epidemiologist with the CDC Dengue Branch.



Dr. Anderson added, ""There's different mosquitoes that spread EEE and West Nile, they're Culex mosquitoes, the ones you get with Dengue, Zika, those are Aedes mosquitoes.""



Below is the map for the spray site at the Cicero Swamp, completed on August 7. The Health Department does not anticipate having to do another one, but if numbers stay where they are at the beginning of August, they will again.

If you live around the Cicero Swamp or anywhere being sprayed for mosquitoes, some tips from the Health Department:

Onondaga County completes the spray of the Cicero Swamp after detecting viruses in mosquitoes.,https://cnycentral.com/news/local/syracuse-new-york-vaccines-eeev-wnv-violent-property-crime-poverty-substance-abuse-issues-social-workers-911-lead-water-mayor-ben-walsh,"Syracuse Mayor Ben Walsh and other officials provided a community briefing Thursday, addressing some ongoing issues within the city including crime, homelessness and drinking water.

Department of Health

The Department of Health encouraged parents to immunize children as schools begin to open. Mayor Walsh also noted that COVID-19 is on the rise, and to make sure children are fully vaccinated in time for the school year.

""That could be the difference between your child being able to attend school and not,"" said Mayor Walsh.



Walsh also cited that the West Nile Virus and Eastern Equine Encephalitis viruses have been detected in Onondaga County and advised residents to use bug spray containing DEET.





Crime Update

Overall violent crime is down by 13% compared to this time last year, with homicides up by 1%. Property crimes also remain a large issue at nearly 23%. Mayor Walsh cited car thefts as a driving factor related to the number but also said that overall car thefts are down compared to June of last year. Major gun and firearm crimes have also lowered, with deaths down by 30%.





Poverty Issues and Social Services

Mayor Walsh also provided a lot of details regarding issues that the city has faced involving poverty and substance abuse issues. Walsh said that those dealing with homelessness, substance abuse, poverty, and other issues are disproportionately in the City of Syracuse.

Often times, folks that are dealing with those issues throughout the region end up here in our city because we are where the resources are.

The city is looking to solve this disproportionality by facing the human element of crimes and behavioral crises. Syracuse Police Deputy Chief Mark Rubin spoke about a new pilot program that allows social workers and crisis communicators to respond with ambulance services to 9-1-1 calls.

""When the 911 system was created, it was really created to pull three levers: police, fire, EMS,"" said Rubin. ""And really what I think we're hoping to do is pull a fourth lever""



Syracuse police already have a Friendly Faces program which matches those going through a behavioral crisis to resources in the county. Mayor Walsh said the city was investing ""unprecedented"" resources into the problem and advised residents to call 911 if they are worried about someone's safety.

Drinking water

Residents can expect a notice in their mail during the coming days as the city also provided an update on the drinking water in Syracuse. Mayor Walsh said the UV Treatment System at the Woodland Reservoir became temporarily ineffective as two UV Lights broke for about a week. This UV Light prevents a microorganism called cryptosporidium from entering drinking water. The city has sampled drinking water and found no sign of cryptosporidium.

I want to be crystal clear, your drinking water is safe.

Mayor Walsh also noted that due to high winds, sediment from the bottom of Skaneateles Lake can also end up in drinking water. Lead can also be a problem in older homes with lead pipes. During a recent water test, 27 homes exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency's standard limit. With tests being set every six months and the EPA lowering its standard of lead, Mayor Walsh is expecting to see more of this issue.

Walsh advised homeowners to let their water run longer before drinking it after leaving it off for a while and to avoid drinking from a backyard spigot, which is more exposed to lead."
