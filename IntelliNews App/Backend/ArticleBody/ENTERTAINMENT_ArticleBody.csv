"ISIS-inspired suspect planned suicide attack at Taylor Swift concert, Austrian authorities say.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/08/europe/isis-inspired-suicide-terror-attack-taylor-swift-vienna-intl/index.html,"CNN —

Police in Austria have questioned three teenagers suspected of plotting a suicide attack at a Taylor Swift show, sparking renewed concerns over the indoctrination of young people online.

Foreign intelligence agencies helped authorities uncover the alleged scheme, according to the country’s Interior Minister Gerhard Karner. A source familiar told CNN that the US issued a warning to authorities in Vienna.

Organizers canceled three concerts, which were scheduled to take place in the European capital from Thursday to Saturday. CNN has reached out to Swift’s representatives for comment.

Investigators unearthed a stockpile of chemicals, explosive devices, detonators and 21,000 euros in counterfeit cash at the home of the main suspect, a 19-year-old ISIS sympathizer who had been radicalized online, according to authorities.

The young man – who was arrested Wednesday morning in the eastern town of Ternitz – planned to kill himself and “a large number of people,” according to the head of the domestic intelligence agency, Omar Haijawi-Pirchner.

“He said he intended to carry out an attack using explosives and knives,” Haijawi-Pirchner told reporters in Vienna on Thursday. “His aim was to kill himself and a large number of people during the concert, either today or tomorrow.”

Two other suspects were detained, aged 17 and 15. The 17-year-old worked for a facilities company that would have provided services at the concert venue. He was near the stadium when he was arrested and had recently broken up with his girlfriend, according to Haijwai-Pirchner.

Little has been revealed about the 15-year-old. Prosecutors will decide later if he was a witness or directly involved in the alleged plot.

The three are all Austrian-born with either Turkish, North Macedonian or Croatian backgrounds.

The trio were in contact with other individuals who knew about the plan, said the country’s director general for public security, Franz Ruf. No one else is being sought in direct connection with the plot, Ruf added.

The cancellations of the Swift concert triggered an outpouring of heartbreak, grief and relief among Swifties hoping to attend the record-breaking Eras Tour in Vienna. Hailed as a cultural phenomenon, the scale, influence and intricacy of Swift’s musical voyage have made headlines for boosting the economies of the cities she visits.

The show-stopping tour began in Glendale, Arizona in March 2023, and has been extended several times. Vienna was scheduled to be the penultimate venue of the European leg, with Swift set to play five nights at London’s Wembley Stadium over the next two weeks, before moving on to Canada in November and December.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the city would “carry on” with the scheduled events, telling Sky News: “I’m sure Vienna has got its own reasons to cancel the Taylor Swift concerts, we’re going to carry on, working closely with police (and) ensuring that the Taylor Swift concerts can take place in London safely.”

A rush of excitement descended on the Austrian capital in the days leading up to the three-day fest, according to locals, with Swifties filling the cobbled streets and spontaneously breaking out into song.

Several fans who were planning to attend shows in Vienna told CNN they participated in a series of events Thursday that were staged in a community-led effort to rekindle the spirit and energy of the tour.

Footage has emerged of Swifties serenading each another at local squares in Vienna and trading personalized friendship bracelets – a concert tradition inspired by the lyrics on Swift’s song “You’re on Your Own, Kid” from her 10th studio album “Midnights.”

Julia Schnizlein, a pastor at the Lutheran City Church, told CNN that she bought tickets as a Christmas gift for her 14-year-old daughter, Leni, who was left heartbroken on Wednesday.

“We were really looking forward to the concert and have met a lot of fans over the last few days,” the 45-year-old said. “The whole city was full of happy, peaceful people exchanging bracelets and spontaneously singing together.”

Instead, the pastor opened the doors of her church to host a Swift-themed singalong for fans. Social media videos show people bopping their heads to melodies of some of the Grammy-winning artist’s greatest hits – including “Blank Space” and “Style” – as music blares from the speakers of the hall, illuminated by the glow of yellow candles.

“People were crying, holding hands, singing along softly,” said Kristi Hovington, 46, who wandered into the chapel after hearing tunes from the Eras Tour setlist. “It was such a beautiful moment, a pocket of beauty amidst the disappointment and anger.”

The school librarian journeyed from Barcelona, Spain, to attend the tour with her 14-year-old daughter, Esme, who had dreamed of seeing Swift live in concert. “She cried for an hour, at least; this was her dream, to see Taylor.”

Elsewhere in the capital, dozens of fans congregated at the Stephansplatz, a central square, to belt out an array of Swift songs. One participant, Elie Fares, said he was “devastated” for fans who had lost their chance to see the US pop star on tour.

“I just walked right over and basked in the camaraderie of it all, the way it exuded a lot of joie de vivre, a giant middle finger to all of those who wanted the squash that joy and instil fear,” added the 34-year-old physician, who has attended shows in the US and Europe.

“Swifties have shown time and time again that they are a formidable community among music fans,” he told CNN on Thursday. “In the grand scheme of what’s happening around the world today, we are all aware of where a concert cancellation falls, but that doesn’t mean we can’t be supportive of each other.”"
"ISIS-inspired suspect planned suicide attack at Taylor Swift concert, Austrian authorities say.",https://apnews.com/article/austria-taylor-swift-concerts-canceled-extremism-arrests-17b494f1a164b205128d7faeb607e731,"VIENNA (AP) — Both suspects in a foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift shows in Vienna appeared to be inspired by the Islamic State group and al-Qaida, Austrian authorities said Thursday, and investigators found bomb-making materials at one of their homes. Officials said one of the two confessed to planning to “kill as many people as possible outside the concert venue.”

Three sold-out concerts were canceled Wednesday because of the plot, devastating Swifties from across the globe. Many of them had dropped thousands of euros (dollars) on travel and lodging in Austria’s expensive capital city to attend the Eras Tour shows at the Ernst Happel Stadium, which sat empty Thursday morning.

Europe is enamored with the American superstar: The German town of Gelsenkirchen renamed itself “Swiftkirchen” before its mid-July concerts.

Concert organizers in Austria said they had expected up to 65,000 fans inside the stadium at each concert and as many as 30,000 onlookers outside, where authorities said the suspects planned to strike. The foiled attack was planned for Thursday or Friday, according to Austria’s interior minister, Gerhard Karner.

Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer defended the decision to cancel the concerts, saying the arrests of the suspects took place too close to the shows, scheduled for Thursday, Friday and Saturday.

“I understand very well that those who wanted to experience the concert live are very sad,” Nehammer told a news conference Thursday. “Moms and dads are looking after their daughters and sons, who were full of enthusiasm and anticipation for this concert. But it’s also important that in such serious moments as now, it’s inevitable that safety comes first.”

Swift is also scheduled to perform at London’s Wembley stadium in five concerts between Aug. 15 and 20 to close the European leg of her record-setting Eras Tour.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan said that while he understood Vienna’s reasons for canceling, “We’re going to carry on.” Khan said the capital’s authorities were prepared for shows there following lessons learned from a 2017 attack at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, that killed 22 people.

A suicide bomber had set up a knapsack with explosives in Manchester Arena. The bomb detonated at the end of Grande’s concert as thousands of young fans were leaving.

Last month, an attacker in England killed three girls and wounded 10 people in a knife attack during a Taylor Swift-themed dance and yoga class. Swift at the time said she was ‘’completely in shock’’ over the violence.

In Austria, the main suspect confessed that he had started planning the attack in July, authorities said. The 19-year-old just a few weeks ago uploaded to the internet an oath of allegiance to the current leader of the Islamic State group.

He was “clearly radicalized in the direction of the Islamic State and thinks it is right to kill infidels,” said Omar Haijawi-Pirchner, head of the Directorate of State Security and Intelligence.

Haijawi-Pirchner added that the suspect “wanted to carry out an attack in the area outside the stadium, killing as many people as possible using the knives or even using the explosive devices he had made.”

During a raid of the suspect’s home in Ternitz, south of Vienna, investigators found chemical substances and technical devices that indicated “concrete preparatory acts,” said Franz Ruf, director general for public security at the Ministry of the Interior.

Authorities said they also found Islamic State group and al-Qaida material at the home of the second suspect, who is 17. That suspect, who has so far refused to talk, was employed a few days ago by a company providing unspecified services at the venue for the concerts. The 19-year-old is an Austrian with North Macedonian roots. The 17-year-old is an Austrian with Turkish and Croatian roots.

The North Macedonian Interior Ministry released a statement Thursday saying that it had received a request from Austria to look into the 19-year-old.

Both teens were arrested Tuesday. Neither of their names was released in line with Austrian privacy rules.

The suspects had undergone clear social changes recently, authorities said. The 19-year-old had quit his job but said he “still had big plans,” while the other broke up with his girlfriend. Neither suspect appeared to have a ticket to any of the shows, Haijawi-Pirchner said.

Karner said that Austria’s intelligence service had worked closely together with foreign intelligence services to capture the two teens. He did not identify the agencies, but added that the help was needed because Austrian investigators, unlike some foreign services, can’t legally monitor text messages.

The CIA declined to say Thursday whether U.S. intelligence agencies played any role in the investigation. The U.S. State Department and the broader U.S. government have been in contact with Austrian officials about the alleged plot, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said.

No other suspects are being sought, though a 15-year-old who had been in contact with both suspects was also interrogated by police, Karner said.

“The situation is serious. But we can also say: A tragedy was prevented,” he said.

Concert organizer Barracuda Music said in an Instagram post late Wednesday that it had “no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone’s safety.”

Barracuda said all tickets would be refunded. The same message was posted under the Vienna dates on Swift’s official website. Austrian rail operator OeBB in the meantime said that it would reimburse fans for unused train tickets for the concerts.

Swift has not spoken publicly about the plot or canceled shows. “Taylor Nation,” a verified Instagram page widely believed to be run by her team, reposted the announcement from Barracuda Music in a “story,” which is only visible for 24 hours. Her main account has not posted anything.

Swift’s biggest fear has always been that such large-scale violence could take place at her concerts, the superstar told Elle magazine in 2019 ahead of her Lover Tour, which was ultimately canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. The attack at Grande’s concert, as well as a 2017 mass shooting at an outdoor country music festival on the Las Vegas Strip where 58 people were killed, worried Swift as she prepared to circle the globe.

“I was completely terrified to go on (the Lover Tour) this time because I didn’t know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months,” she told the magazine. “There was a tremendous amount of planning, expense, and effort put into keeping my fans safe.”

An official inquiry reported in 2023 that Britain’s domestic intelligence agency, MI5, didn’t act swiftly enough on key information and missed a significant opportunity to prevent the Manchester bombing, the deadliest extremist attack in the United Kingdom in recent years.

Terrorism expert Magnus Ranstorp, based at the Swedish Defense University in Stockholm, told The Associated Press by phone that any mass public event constitutes a potential threat now.

“So we shouldn’t be surprised that these extremely popular iconic popstars that attract a massive audience will also attract terrorists that want to create fear and destruction and mayhem,” he said.

Terrifying details of the foiled suicide-bombing attack emerged after authorities revealed that two men, ages 19 and 17, had been taken into custody in Vienna on Wednesday — resulting in Swift’s three sold-out Eras shows in the city being canceled.

The two suspects, who investigators say had become radicalized online by ISIS, had allegedly wanted to carry out the attack outside the Ernst Happel Stadium — killing fans with self-made explosives and machetes, security officials said Thursday.

“The suspects actually had very specific and detailed plans … to leave a bloodbath in their wake,” Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said.

The alleged ringleader, a 19-year-old Austrian with North Macedonian roots, had chemical substances and technical devices stashed inside his home when it was raided by authorities, according to officials.

He had allegedly also made progress in building the bomb he planned to strap to the car, they added.

Meanwhile, the second suspect — a 17-year-old Austrian citizen with Turkish and Croatian roots — was nabbed by special police forces near the stadium where the concerts were supposed to take place this week.

The second suspect had only just been employed a few days ago by a company providing services at the venue during the concerts, officials said.

Sources told German news outlet Kurier that he’d been hired to work there as security.

The pair had displayed noticeable changes in their behavior in the leadup to their arrests, according to Franz Ruf, public security director at Austria’s Interior Ministry.

Here's everything we know about the attempted terrorist attack at a Taylor Swift concert A 17-year-old and a 19-year-old were arrested for plotting an ISIS-style terror attack at one of Taylor Swift’s Austrian concerts this week.

The would-be terrorists planned to drive a bomb-filled car into the Eras Tour crowd to kill as many people as possible.

The main suspect — who authorities say fully confessed to the attack plans after his arrest — had recently sworn allegiance to Islamic State’s leader online, security officials said. He had reportedly just been hired by the venue to work security.

Swift’s three sold-out Eras shows in Vienna have been canceled.

Taylor Swift previously said her “biggest fear” in life was a violent attack at one of her concerts in a resurfaced article penned by the singer in 2019.

The older teen had quit his job on July 25 and told people he had “something big” planned, while the 17-year-old recently broke up with his girlfriend, Ruf said.

The pair had also made contact with others who were apparently aware of the terror plot plans.

A 15-year-old boy was also taken in for questioning Wednesday after the sinister plans were uncovered, though it was unclear if he had been arrested.

Meanwhile, both older suspects had been under surveillance by Austrian authorities and were known risks before their arrests, officials said.

Investigators said they found extensive material related to ISIS and al Qaeda during a raid at the second suspect’s home.

Haijawi-Pirchner added that the suspect “wanted to carry out an attack in the area outside the stadium, killing as many people as possible using the knives or even using the explosive devices he had made.”

The names of those allegedly involved haven’t been released due to Austria’s privacy laws, and the 17-year-old suspect has reportedly refused to talk since his arrest.

Swift had been slated to play the three sold-out shows, which were expected to draw 195,000 people, Thursday through Saturday.

Nehammer defended the decision to nix the shows, saying they occurred too close to the arrests.

“I understand very well that those who wanted to experience the concert live are very sad,” the chancellor told a news conference Thursday. “Moms and dads are looking after their daughters and sons, who were full of enthusiasm and anticipation for this concert. But it’s also important that in such serious moments as now, it’s inevitable that safety comes first.”

It wasn’t immediately clear for which concert the thwarted attack was meant to target.

Austria’s Vice Chancellor Werner Kogler said in a post in X: “For many, a dream has been shattered today. On three evenings in Vienna, tens of thousands of #Swifties should have celebrated life together.

“I am very sorry that you were denied this. Swifties stick together, hate and terror can’t destroy that,” Kogler wrote.

But some Swifties who had traveled to Vienna for the show were undeterred – with many turning out in the streets of the Austrian capital city to console each other over the near miss.

Filling the city streets by the hundreds, fans joined arms to belt out their favorite Swift songs together, swapped friendship bracelets, and shared group hugs.

Swift’s next shows, scheduled for August 15 through 20 in London, are expected to go ahead as planned.

“We’re going to carry on,” said London Mayor Sadiq Khan, adding that England had learned the hard way to deal with concert threats after a bomb detonated at a 2017 Ariana Grande concert killed 22 people.

Swift hasn’t yet commented publicly about the cancellations or terror threat.

The 17-year-old suspect conspiring the terror threat reportedly started working at concert stop - Ernst Happel Stadium - days before the pop star's shows. TMZ stated that the teenager had got the gig with a facility management company at the concert venue as a means to better prepare for the alleged attack alongside his accomplice.

Authorities also claimed that the terrorists possibly had plans to drive a vehicle into the crowd outside the stadium, where Taylor's fans - who miss out on bagging a ticket to the show - gather around to listen to their favourite singer. Here, the 17-year-old, who was arrested outside the venue, could have detonated a bomb.

What's been discovered about the suspects of the foiled Taylor Swift Vienna concert terror attack?

General Director for Public Security Frankz Ruf said the purported suspects' disposition reflected “concrete preparatory actions,” resulting in authorities labelling the near disaster a “serious terror plot.” He also uncovered that the oldest teen suspect of the trio “had a particular focus on the Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna.”

In addition to confessing to the charges against him, the suspect also revealed he had recently left his job while swearing allegiance to ISIS.

“There is nothing to indicate that the matters being investigated by the Austrian authorities will have an impact on upcoming events here in London,” a spokesperson for London's Metropolitan Police said."
"ISIS-inspired suspect planned suicide attack at Taylor Swift concert, Austrian authorities say.",https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/planning-a-bloodbath-details-emerge-of-taylor-swift-concert-terror-plot/8xcubwnlf,"An Austrian man arrested over an alleged plot to strike a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna planned to carry out a suicide attack that would have caused a ""bloodbath"" and had vowed loyalty to Islamic State (IS), authorities said.





The 19-year-old man made a full confession in custody, Austria's general director for public security Franz Ruf told a news conference on Thursday.





He swore allegiance to the IS group's leader on the internet and had chemicals, machetes and technical devices at his home in the town of Ternitz in preparation for an attack, Ruf added.





The suspect was planning a lethal assault among the estimated 20,000 'Swiftie' fans set to gather outside Vienna's Ernst Happel Stadium, said national intelligence head Omar Haijawi-Pirchner. Two other Austrian youths aged 17 and 15 were detained on Wednesday over the reported plot.





""The main perpetrator has confessed that he was supposed to carry out a suicide attack with two accomplices,"" Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said.



""The suspects actually had very specific and detailed plans ... to leave a bloodbath in their wake.""





Authorities painted a picture of the main suspect having self-radicalised, transforming his appearance and sharing Islamist propaganda online. He quit his job on 25 July, telling people he had ""big plans"", Ruf said.





The 17-year-old suspect had been given a job with a company a few days ago that was providing services at the stadium, according to security officials.





Event organiser Barracuda Music said it had cancelled Swift's three concerts in Vienna, due to start on Thursday for a sold-out 65,000 audience each, in coordination with the singer's management team.





Fans, many of whom had travelled a long way to Vienna, expressed both dismay and understanding.





""It's just heartbreaking, just frustrating. But at the end of the day I guess it's for everyone's safety,"" said Mark del Rosario, who had flown from the Philippines to see the wildly popular US singer.



Taylor Swift performed to more than 600,000 fans in seven sold-out shows during the Australian leg of her Eras tour. Source: AAP / DEAN LEWINS/AAPIMAGE US broadcaster ABC cited law enforcement and intelligence sources as saying Austrian authorities had received information about the Swift concert threat from US intelligence.





It quoted the sources as saying that at least one of the suspects had pledged allegiance to ISIS-K, a resurgent wing of IS, on Telegram in June, though the plot was IS-inspired rather than directed by the group's operatives.





Austrian Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said foreign intelligence agencies had helped with the investigation, as Austrian law does not allow monitoring of messenger apps.





British police said on Thursday there was nothing to indicate that the planned attack in Vienna would have an impact on Swift's shows at Wembley Stadium in London next week.





This week's shows were to be part of the record-breaking Eras Tour by American singer-songwriter Swift which started in March 2023 and is set to conclude in December.





Swift, 34, has not yet commented on the cancellations on her official Instagram account, which has 283 million followers.

"ISIS-inspired suspect planned suicide attack at Taylor Swift concert, Austrian authorities say.",https://au.news.yahoo.com/taylor-swift-vienna-concerts-cancelled-202604056.html,"Swift concert plot aimed to kill 'as many as possible'

Both suspects in a foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift shows in Vienna appeared to be inspired by the Islamic State group and al-Qaeda, Austrian authorities say, and investigators found bomb-making materials at one of their homes.

One of the two confessed to planning to ""kill as many people as possible outside the concert venue"", officials said.

Three sold-out concerts were cancelled a day earlier because of the plot, devastating Swifties from across the globe, many of whom had dropped thousands of euros on travel and lodging in Austria's expensive capital city to attend the Eras Tour shows at the Ernst Happel Stadium.

The foiled attack was planned for Thursday or Friday, Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said.

Officials told reporters the 19-year-old Austrian suspect began working on his attack plans in July, and just a few weeks ago uploaded to the internet an oath of allegiance to the current leader of the Islamic State group militia.

He planned to use knives or homemade explosives to carry out the attack outside the stadium.

He was ""clearly radicalised in the direction of the Islamic State and thinks it is right to kill infidels"", said Omar Haijawi-Pirchner, the head of the Directorate of State Security and Intelligence.

During a raid of his home south of Vienna, investigators found chemicals and technical devices that indicated ""concrete preparatory acts"", said Franz Ruf, director-general for public security at the interior ministry.

Authorities also found Islamic State group and al-Qaeda material at the home of the second suspect, a 17-year-old Austrian.

He was employed a few days ago by a company providing services at the concert venue, and was arrested near the stadium.

The suspects' names were not released in line with Austrian privacy rules.

No other suspects were being sought, the interior minister said.

However, police interrogated a 15-year-old who had been in contact with both suspects.

""The situation was serious, the situation is serious. But we can also say: a tragedy was prevented,"" he said.

Barracuda Music said in an Instagram post on Wednesday that ""we have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone's safety"".

Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer posted on X that ""the cancellation of the Taylor Swift concerts by the organisers is a bitter disappointment for all fans in Austria"".

""The situation surrounding the apparently planned terror attack in Vienna was very serious,"" he wrote.

But thanks to intensive co-operation between police and Austrian and foreign intelligence, ""the threat could be recognised early on, tackled and a tragedy prevented"".

Barracuda Music said all tickets would be refunded.

An estimated 170,000 fans were expected for the concerts in Austria.

Swift is expected to perform at London's Wembley stadium in five concerts between August 15 and 20 to close the European leg of her record-setting Eras Tour.

UK police said there was nothing to indicate the investigation in Austria would affect Swift's concerts in London."

Speaking to the media following the arrest of the 19-year-old and 17-year-old male suspects, Austrian officials said the terror plot was planned for either Thursday or Friday’s show and that the suspects’ aim was to “kill as many people as possible outside the concert venue.”

Bomb-making materials were found at the home of the 19-year-old suspect, who officials say was inspired by Al Qaeda and ISIS. He was “clearly radicalized in the direction of the Islamic State and thinks it is right to kill infidels,” said Omar Haijawi-Pirchner, Austria’s head of the Directorate of State Security and Intelligence (via The Associated Press). “His goal was to kill himself and a large crowd of people.”

The 19-year-old suspect allegedly began planning the attack in July and had recently signed an online oath to ISIS. A raid of his home south of Vienna uncovered chemical substances and technical devices that indicated “concrete preparatory acts,” the Ministry of the Interior said.

According to officials, the suspect stole chemicals from his workplace to build a bomb. The suspect also planned to drive his vehicle into the crowd congregated outside the stadium while armed with knives and machetes.

The 17-year-old suspect was arrested by police near the Vienna stadium where Swift was set to perform; authorities said that the suspect — who also had ISIS and Al Qaeda material at his home — was employed by a company that provided unspecified services to concerts at the Ernst Happel Stadium.

“The situation was serious, the situation is serious. But we can also say: A tragedy was prevented,” Austria’s interior minister Gerhard Karner said Thursday.

Although investigators do not believe anyone else was involved in the terror plot, the decision was still made by Barracuda Music, the organizer of the Eras Tour Vienna shows, to cancel the concerts, which were estimated to draw 65,000 people inside the stadium and an additional 10,000 people outside the venue for each show. Editor’s picks

“With confirmation from government officials of a planned terrorist attack at Ernst Happel Stadium, we have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone’s safety,” Barracuda Music shared in a statement.

“The cancellation of the Taylor Swift concerts by the organizers is a bitter disappointment for all fans in Austria,” Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said in a statement. “The situation surrounding the apparently planned terrorist attack in Vienna was very serious. Thanks to the intensive cooperation of our police and the newly established DSN with foreign services, the threat was recognized early, combated and a tragedy prevented. Many thanks to the emergency services who are currently investigating at full speed.”

He continued, “We live in a time in which violent means are being used to attack our Western way of life. Islamist terrorism threatens security and freedom in many Western countries. This is precisely why we will not give up our values ​​​​such as freedom and democracy, but will defend them even more vehemently.”

Swift has not yet commented on the cancelled Vienna shows.

Vienna was the second-to-last stop on the European leg of the Eras Tour, which concludes next week with five shows at London’s Wembley Stadium.

Swift’s sold-out Vienna shows – slated for Thursday, Friday, and Saturday – were called off after the terror scare, her Austrian show promoter Barracuda announced.

“With confirmation from government officials of a planned terrorist attack at Ernst Happel Stadium, we have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone’s safety,” the promoter said in a post on Instagram.

A 19-year-old suspect living at his parents’ home in Ternitz — just south of Vienna — was arrested Wednesday morning during a police raid on the house, law enforcement sources told The Post.

A second suspect was apprehended later in the afternoon.

A bomb squad found various chemicals and substances potentially being used to make explosives, and evacuated the home.

The pair were allegedly targeting Swift’s concerts at Vienna’s Ernst Happel Stadium, where she is scheduled to play Thursday through Saturday night to sold-out crowds, according to Kronen Zeitung.

“The suspects were focused on the Taylor Swift concerts. We discovered that he was taking action to prepare for the attack,” said Austrian Director General for Public Safety Franz Ruf.

“A clear threat has been averted,” he said, adding that authorities had not yet declared the concerts entirely safe and were still investigating other accomplices, according to Kronen Zeitung.

The 19-year-old suspect is an Austrian national, and is believed to have pledged allegiance to the Islamic terror group in July.

He and the other suspect are believed to have become radicalized online.

Both suspects had been under surveillance by Austrian authorities and were known risks before the arrest, a pair of US officials familiar with the matter said, according to NBC News.

Here's everything we know about the attempted terrorist attack at a Taylor Swift concert A 17-year-old and a 19-year-old were arrested for plotting an ISIS-style terror attack at one of Taylor Swift’s Austrian concerts this week.

The would-be terrorists planned to drive a bomb-filled car into the Eras Tour crowd to kill as many people as possible.

The main suspect — who authorities say fully confessed to the attack plans after his arrest — had recently sworn allegiance to Islamic State’s leader online, security officials said. He had reportedly just been hired by the venue to work security.

Swift’s three sold-out Eras shows in Vienna have been canceled.

Taylor Swift previously said her “biggest fear” in life was a violent attack at one of her concerts in a resurfaced article penned by the singer in 2019.

The 19-year-old had allegedly purchased the chemicals required to create a bomb but did not yet have all the necessary components, according to officials.

It is unlikely he would have been able to assemble a bomb before the concerts this week, officials added, noting they nevertheless decided to make arrests in case the suspects found other means to attack the shows.

Security plans have been increased at the concerts.

In 2017, 22 people were killed when extremist Salman Abedi, 22, detonated a homemade bomb at Ariana Grande’s concert in Manchester, England.

More than 200 people were injured, and nearly 1,000 reported suffering severe psychological trauma in the fallout.

The bomber was killed in the explosion, but his brother, Hashem Abedi, later admitted to helping plot the attack and was sentenced to 55 years in prison.

On July 29, three girls were killed when a hooded 17-year-old burst into a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport, England, and began slashing attendees with a knife.

Nine others were injured, several of whom were parents trying to defend their kids.

The motivation behind that attack remains unknown, and false rumors surrounding it sparked riots across the country.

Swift previously told Elle magazine that a terror-style attack at a concert was one of her biggest fears in life.

“After the Manchester Arena bombing and the Vegas concert shooting, I was completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didn’t know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months,” she told the magazine in 2019 ahead of her Lover tour.

“There was a tremendous amount of planning, expense, and effort put into keeping my fans safe,” she said, adding that her “fear of violence” had spread into her personal life so much so that she carries military-grade gunshot bandages around with her.

Swifties without tickets have begun a tradition of celebrating out front of stadiums on the Eras Tour where they can often hear the music even if they cannot see the superstar.

Police in Austria believe a 19-year-old suspect planned to drive a car into the fans. In Munich last week, more than 40,000 of the singer’s fans gathered outside the Olympic Stadium.

Taylor Swift Cancels Three European Concerts After ISIS Attack Thwarted

U.S. intelligence learned about the plan and passed details on to Europol and the Austrians, according to ABC News.

Austrian Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said on Thursday that the 19-year-old suspect with Macedonian roots has admitted to the terror plot. He did not have a ticket for the concert.

Two others, one aged 17 and another 15, are also being questioned. The 17-year-old worked for a “facility company” that offered concert services in Vienna and was arrested at the stadium. He is said to have broken up with his girlfriend shortly before the planned attack, according to the German tabloid Bild.

Karner reportedly said the 19-year-old built a bomb made from the chemical TATP that he stole from work at a metal processing plant before quitting on July 25 and telling colleagues: “I still have big plans.”

The interior minister also said that the suspect also “hoarded knives, machetes, blank ammunition, counterfeit money, and a blue police light,” according to Bild.

The police light was to get to or from the scene of the Swift concert on Friday night.

Bild reported that the teenager watched Islamic State bomb-making videos and IS propaganda. He is also said to have sworn an oath of loyalty to the terrorist group in early July.

The 19-year-old was arrested in Vienna on Wednesday afternoon. Swift was due to perform in front of more than 170,000 fans in Vienna on August 8,9 and 10. The shows have now been canceled.

Vienna police said the suspects had friends hired as security for the event. The three suspects – aged 19, 17, and 15 – reportedly planned to “bomb the gig and mow down fans” before the terror suicide plot was foiled by U.S. intelligence and Europol. One suspect, a 19-year-old Austrian who has been identified only as Beran A., apparently planned to drive a car through the roughly 20,000 fans expected to gather outside Swift’s first concert on Thursday night. Knives and machetes were also said to be included in the botched ISIS-inspired attack plans. The 19-year-old suspect later confessed, saying he “intended to carry out an attack using explosives and knives”.

Domestic Intelligence Agency head Omar Haijawi-Pirchner said during a news conference Thursday: “He wanted to carry out an attack in the area outside the stadium, killing as many people as possible using the knives or even using the explosive devices he had made. “His aim was to kill himself and a large number of people during the concert either today or tomorrow.” At least one suspect also reportedly infiltrated security at the event. He was hired to help set up and supervise the three shows.

"ISIS-inspired suspect planned suicide attack at Taylor Swift concert, Austrian authorities say.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/taylor-swift-vienna-concert-plot-planning-suicide-attack-rcna165734,"MAINZ, Germany — The prime suspect in a plot to attack Taylor Swift’s upcoming ""Eras Tour"" shows in Vienna confessed that he had planned to kill himself and a large number of other people with knives and explosive devices, officials in Austria said Thursday.

The 19-year-old Austrian with North Macedonian roots had downloaded manuals for bomb building, Omar Haijawi-Pirchner, head of Austria's Directorate of State Security and Intelligence, told a news conference.

They also found hydrogen peroxide, homemade explosives, detonators and detonator cables at his apartment, he added. Explosives had been assembled, he said.

“The situation was serious, the situation is serious. But we can also say: A tragedy was prevented,” Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said at the same news conference.

“Large concerts are often a target of Islamist attacks,” he added.

Haijawi-Pirchner said Islamic State terrorist group and Al Qaeda material had been found at the home of the second suspect in the foiled plot, a 17-year-old Austrian citizen with Turkish and Croatian roots.

He added that the suspect had been employed for some days by a company that would have provided services at the concert, although he did not specify which services it provided.

Police also found videos and screenshots of home laboratories, which are often shared by ISIS and Al Qaeda, on the suspects' cellphones, he added.

A third suspect, a 15-year old Austrian national with Turkish roots, was currently being questioned by authorities, he added.

No one else is being sought in connection with the plot, although others may have known about the plans and are part of the ongoing investigation, Haijawi-Pirchner said.

“There is no information of explicit danger to further concerts,” he added.

Franz Ruf, the public security director at Austria’s Interior Ministry, said the prime suspect “gave a full confession” and no one else was being sought in connection with the case.

The United States intelligence community was the first to alert Austrian law enforcement about a potential terror attack, a senior U.S. law enforcement official told NBC News on Thursday. The U.S. intelligence community told Austria officials they had a problem and the general sense of what to look for, the official said.

Swift had been scheduled to play at the Austrian capital’s Ernst Happel Stadium on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. An estimated 170,000 fans were expected to attend over the three days.

After news of the plot broke Wednesday, Barracuda Music, the events' organizer, said it had “no choice but to cancel” the shows “for everyone’s safety.”

Taylor Nation, an Instagram account run by Swift’s team, reposted the message to its story. All tickets will be refunded and ticketholders can visit a website to request refunds, the post said.

Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said in a post on X that “the cancelation of the Taylor Swift concerts by the organizers is a bitter disappointment for all fans in Austria.”

“The situation surrounding the apparently planned terror attack in Vienna was very serious,” he wrote.

But, he added, thanks to intensive cooperation between police, Austrian and foreign intelligence, “the threat could be recognized early on, tackled and a tragedy prevented.”

Swift has previously spoken about her concerns of a terrorist attack at one of her stadium shows. In 2019, she told Elle magazine it was her biggest fear.

“After the Manchester Arena bombing and the Vegas concert shooting, I was completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didn’t know how we were going to keep three million fans safe over seven months,” Swift said ahead of the ""Lover Tour,"" which was then canceled because of the Covid pandemic.

VIENNA -- Both suspects in a foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift shows in Vienna appeared to be inspired by the Islamic State group and al-Qaida, Austrian authorities said Thursday, and investigators found bomb-making materials at one of their homes. Officials said one of the two confessed to planning to ""kill as many people as possible outside the concert venue.""

Three sold-out concerts were canceled a day earlier because of the plot, devastating Swifties from across the globe. Many of them had dropped thousands of euros (dollars) on travel and lodging in Austria's expensive capital city to attend the Eras Tour shows at the Ernst Happel Stadium, which sat empty Thursday morning as media filmed outside.

Concert organizers said they stood behind their decision, saying they expected up to 65,000 fans inside the stadium at each concert and as many as 30,000 onlookers outside, where authorities said the suspects planned to strike.

Officials told reporters that the main suspect, a 19-year-old Austrian, began working on his attack plans in July, and just a few weeks ago uploaded to the internet an oath of allegiance to the current leader of the Islamic State group militia. He planned to use knives or homemade explosives.

""He wanted to carry out an attack in the area outside the stadium, killing as many people as possible using the knives or even using the explosive devices he had made,"" said Omar Haijawi-Pirchner, the head of the Directorate of State Security and Intelligence, citing the 19-year-old's confession.

The foiled attack was planned for Thursday or Friday, according to Austria's interior minister, Gerhard Karner. Neither suspect appeared to have a ticket to any of the shows.

During a raid of the main suspect's home in Ternitz, south of Vienna, investigators found chemical substances and technical devices that indicated ""concrete preparatory acts,"" said Franz Ruf, Director General for Public Security at the Ministry of the Interior.

Authorities also found Islamic State group and al-Qaida material at the home of the second suspect, a 17-year-old Austrian. He was employed a few days ago by a company providing services at the venue for the concerts, and was arrested by special police forces near the stadium.

Both teens were arrested Tuesday. Neither's name was released in line with Austrian privacy rules.

No other suspects are being sought, Karner, the interior minister, said. However, a 15-year-old, who had been in contact with both suspects, was also interrogated by police.

""The situation was serious, the situation is serious. But we can also say: A tragedy was prevented,"" he said.

Concert organizers, Barracuda Music, said in an Instagram post late Wednesday that ""we have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone's safety."" It cited government officials' confirmation of a planned attack at the stadium.

Swift and her team have not spoken publicly about the plot or canceled shows. Her Instagram page reposted Barracuda Music's announcement in a ""story,"" which only last 24 hours.

Last month, an attacker in England killed three girls and wounded 10 other people in knife attack during a Taylor Swift-themed dance and yoga class. Swift at the time said she was ''completely in shock'' over the attack.

Europe is enamored with the American superstar, with the German town of Gelsenkirchen renaming itself ""Swiftkirchen"" before its mid-July concerts.

Austria's Vice-Chancellor Werner Kogler wrote on social platform X: ""For many, a dream has been shattered today. On three evenings in Vienna, tens of thousands of #Swifties should have celebrated life together.""

""I am very sorry that you were denied this. Swifties stick together, hate and terror can't destroy that,"" Kogler added.

Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer posted on X that ""the cancellation of the Taylor Swift concerts by the organizers is a bitter disappointment for all fans in Austria.""

Barracuda Music said that ""all tickets will be automatically refunded within the next 10 business days."" The same wording was posted under the Vienna dates on Swift's official website.

The Vienna stadium had been sold out for the planned concerts, APA reported, with an estimated 170,000 fans expected for the concerts in Austria. Some who posted on X lamented months of now-wasted efforts to make friendship bracelets and pick out fashionable outfits for the performance.

Swift is expected to perform at London's Wembley stadium in five concerts between Aug. 15 and 20 to close the European leg of her record-setting Eras Tour.

In 2017, an attack at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, killed 22 people. Suicide bomber Salman Abedi set up a knapsack bomb in Manchester Arena at the end of Grande's concert as thousands of young fans were leaving. More than 100 people were injured. Abedi died in the explosion.

An official inquiry reported in 2023 that Britain's domestic intelligence agency, MI5, didn't act swiftly enough on key information and missed a significant opportunity to prevent the bombing, the deadliest extremist attack in the United Kingdom in recent years."

One of the two teens confessed to planning to “kill as many people as possible outside the concert venue,” officials said.

All three of Swift’s tour dates in Vienna were cancelled by the event organizers on Wednesday after government officials learned of the planned terrorist attack at Ernst Happel Stadium. Swift was scheduled to perform there Thursday, Friday and Saturday.

The two suspects, ages 19 and 17, were arrested Wednesday and no other suspects are being sought, according to Interior Minister Gerhard Karner.

“The situation was serious, the situation is serious. But we can also say: A tragedy was prevented,” Karner said, according to CBS News.

The main suspect, a 19-year-old Austrian with North Macedonian roots, began working on his attack plans in July. Just a few weeks ago he uploaded to the internet a pledge of allegiance to the current leader of the Islamic State group militia, also known as ISIS, officials said. He planned to use knives or homemade explosives to carry out the attack outside the stadium.

The 19-year-old was “clearly radicalized in the direction of the Islamic State and thinks it is right to kill infidels,” said Omar Haijawi-Pirchner, the head of the Directorate of State Security and Intelligence.

During a raid of his home in Ternitz, south of Vienna, investigators found chemical substances and technical devices that indicated “concrete preparatory acts,” said Franz Ruf, director general for public security at the Ministry of the Interior.

Ruf told Austria’s public radio that Austrian authorities learned of the planned terrorist attack on the Swift concerts from “foreign services.”

Austrian media also reported that the 19-year-old had stolen the bomb-making chemicals from his former employer, a local metalworking company, and that he planned to drive a car through the crowd outside the stadium, The Guardian reports.

The second suspect, a 17-year-old Austrian citizen with Turkish and Croatian roots, was arrested by special forces on Wednesday near Ernst Happel Stadium, where the concerts were supposed to take place.

Just a few days prior, he had been employed by a company providing venue services for the Swift concerts. Authorities say they found materials linked to the Islamic State and al-Qaeda at his home.

The suspects’ names were not released in line with Austrian privacy rules.

Concert organizers stood by their decision to cancel Swift’s three shows in the interest of “everyone’s safety,” as devastated Swifties express their frustration online and to the media. Many concertgoers flew from outside Europe and dropped thousands of euros on lodging in Austria’s expensive capital city to attend the Eras Tour.

All ticketholders will have their money refunded in the next 10 business days, but remaining tickets for the Eras tour are limited and resale prices exorbitant. Swifties who missed their chance to see the artist in Vienna may not get another chance.

Ariella Kimmel, a woman from Ontario who flew to Vienna to see Swift in concert, said she felt “deflated and sad” after learning that the shows were cancelled, but is grateful that authorities were able to foil the plot.

“We were out for dinner last night and started to see tweets coming in saying that there had been the arrests and … that the shows were being cancelled,” Kimmel told Global News’ 640 Toronto radio. “And then we got the official word of the cancellations and you could kind of feel everyone just felt very deflated and sad.”

“I’m definitely grateful to the police and all of the protective services who played a role in stopping this,” Kimmel added. “So there’s definitely some relief to it, and gratefulness that our integrated security services work.”

The sold-out shows were expected to play host to some 65,000 fans each night, with as many as 30,000 onlookers outside, concert organizers said. The foiled attack was planned for Thursday or Friday.

Cops foiled the terror plot the day before Swift's first concert of the week after US intelligence was passed to Europol and Austrian cops, sources told ABC News.

A 19-year-old Austrian had allegedly planned to carry out an attack at the sold-out gig on Thursday or Friday - with a 17-year-old and a 15-year-old acting as his accomplices.

It's understood the 19-year-old planned to drive a car into the some 20,000 fans who were due to gather outside Vienna's huge stadium during the concert.

Just days ago, his friends reportedly infiltrated the event by getting jobs as stewards at the event.

On Thursday, the 19-year-old confessed to planning to ""kill as many people as possible"" outside the venue, Austrian security officials said.

He also planned to kill himself in the attack, officials added.

It's alleged that the men had detailed plans on how to carry out a mass attack at the huge Ernst Happel Stadium in Vienna.

According to reports, the trio planned to use knives and machetes in the attack.

Concert organisers said they had ""no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows"" lined up for Thursday, Friday and Saturday.

Austria's elite Cobra police helped with the arrests on Wednesday - storming the apartment of the 19-year-old in Ternitz after cutting off electricity and gas supplies.

Pictures showed investigators in hazmat suits at the scene.

He was living in his parent's house along with another man, Kronen Zeitung reports.

Security officials said the suspect recently changed his appearance and had been reading and sharing Islamist propaganda online.

During the search of his home, authorities found various substances and tools used for building bombs.

They also found ISIS propaganda, 21,000 euros in counterfeit money, machetes, knives and blank ammunition.

After the 19-year-old's arrest in the early hours of Wednesday, two other teens were arrested.

It's understood the 19-year-old was the mastermind behind the plot - with the two youngsters acting as accomplices.

The 17-year-old Austrian national - who has Turkish-Croatian roots - had been acting conspicuously near Happel Stadium, where Swift's shows had been due to take place, officials said.

He had been given a job with a company working at the stadium just a few days ago.

The third and final suspect - a 15-year-old boy - is an Austrian national with Turkish heritage, officials said.

Cops are not looking for anyone else in connection with the alleged plot.

The suspects names have not been released due to Austria's privacy laws.

American intelligence had discovered that at least one of the men pledged support to ISIS-K, an ugly offshoot of the death cult, on Telegram in early July.

Omar Haijawi-Pirchner, the head of the Directorate of State Security and Intelligence, said: ""He was clearly radicalised in the direction of the Islamic State and thinks it is right to kill infidels.""

US intel also uncovered a video which showed one of them swearing allegiance to ISIS, Bild reports.

Franz Ruf, Austria's Director General for Public Security, said: ""During a raid of his home in Ternitz, south of Vienna, investigators found chemical substances and technical devices that indicated concrete preparatory acts.""

Some 65,000 fans were expected at each of Swift's shows this week with another 20,000 gathering outside the stadium, local outlet Kurier reports.

Ruf said of the attack yesterday: ""A concrete threat has been averted.

""The suspected perpetrator was focused on the Taylor Swift concerts. Preparatory actions were detected.""

Investigators believe the attack was inspired by ISIS but not directed by the horror group.

Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said the cancelled shows are a ""bitter disappointment"" but added that a ""tragedy [had been] prevented"".

The Sun revealed yesterday that Taylor Swift plans to keep on working and finish the tour after the sick plot was foiled on Tuesday.

An insider close to Taylor Swift's entourage said news of the planned attacks came as a huge shock to the entire team, stressing the day was ""not easy.""

Speaking to The U.S. Sun, they said Swift had explained the situation in a meeting, saying they were in ""shock"".

The insider went on to say that Taylor held a meeting with her team, who felt ""tense"" after the threats, to explain what was happening and ensure everyone's safety.

They claimed Swift is planning to continue working the Eras Tour following the threats.

""We are going to keep working for the next shows coming in London after the stop in Austria, but it wasn’t an easy day to, that is for sure,"" the source continued.

Many devastated Swift fans from across the globe had dropped thousands on travel for the Eras Tour shows in Austria."

The 19-year-old ISIS fanatic has been identified as Beran A., who lived in a newly-built end-terraced house in Ternitz, nearly 50 miles south of Vienna, where he spent his childhood.

A few years ago, Beran A.'s parents - who immigrated to Austria from North Macedonia - moved into a new-built house in the Neunkirchen district of Ternitz with him and his younger sister.

Ternitz residents told local media that he used to be a 'harmless boy next door' in jeans and sneakers, who was born in Austria and attended a local school.

But Beran A. had changed recently, according to his neighbours, coinciding with his pledge of allegiance to ISIS in early July. He grew a long beard and was often spotted wearing a long-sleeved cotton shirt, with a new picture of him showing him posing with huge zombie knives and an ISIS flag.

The 19-year-old was arrested in Ternitz, south of Vienna, Wednesday morning while a second teen, aged 17, was detained in the Austrian capital in the afternoon, according to director-general for public safety Franz Ruf. The two inhaled laughing gas before planning their terror acts, according to Heute.

Taylor Swift was due to perform in front of an estimated 170,000 fans on August 8, 9, and 10 at Vienna's Ernst-Happel-Stadion, but the shows were cancelled last night.

Beran A. and his accomplice had planned to attack Swift's concert venue by driving into the crowd outside at 4pm today before attacking them with knives and machetes and detonating a suicide bomb.

Resident Mara T. told Austrian outlet Kurier that she had last seen the terror suspect on Tuesday morning, adding: 'He looked like how you would imagine a sleeper agent for a terrorist cell.'

Another neighbour, Nicole, said the family was 'inconspicuous and quiet' and that they didn't cause any problems. She said that Beran A.'s mother speaks German 'very well', but that the father's language skills were not as good.

Nicole said the family even helped her clear away debris thrown against her terraced house during a storm.

But not everyone had such a positive experience with the family, as neighbours Mara T. and Dieter S. reveal.

They said they got into arguments with Beran A.'s family when loading and unloading their car in front of their neighbour's house.

Until two weeks ago, Beran A. had worked in the same stainless steel plant in Ternitz as his father.

He was doing an apprenticeship as a retail salesman in the factory, where he had access to the plant's laboratory, including various chemicals.

Behind the bright white walls of the family home in Ternitz, bomb disposal experts secured chemicals to produce the explosive triacetone triperoxide (TATP), which Beran A. - who is said to be the mastermind behind the plot - is said to have already experimented with.

TATP is often used by ISIS in terror attacks and requires acetone as well as hydrogen peroxide, which officials confirmed was found in the house.

The head of the Directorate of State Security and Intelligence, Omar Haijawi-Pirchner, said Beran A. was 'clearly radicalized in the direction of the Islamic State and thinks it is right to kill infidels'.

Beran A.'s parents and sister reportedly are currently on holiday in North Macedonia, but police is expected to question the parents over their son upon their return.

Several people close to the terror suspect knew of his attack plans, according to Austrian media reports.

Beran A., who reportedly planned the attack for five years, has been arrested alongside a 17-year-old.

The suspects - who allegedly radicalised themselves online - took 'concrete preparatory actions' for an attack - with Beran A. 'focused' on Swift's Vienna concert, Ruf confirmed.

Beran A. had quit his job and announced that he 'still had big plans' on July 25, Ruf revealed at a press conference today, adding that the teen also 'significantly changed his appearance' and that the 17-year-old had recently broken up with his girlfriend. 'There has been a clear social change,' Ruf added.

The 17-year-old regularly visited a mosque in Vienna's Meidling district and carried ISIS stickers in his wallet when he was arrested on Wednesday afternoon, outlet Heute reports.

But the teenager claims he only visited the Bosnian mosque because his 'girlfriend at the time lived in the area'. He broke up with this girlfriend recently, according to the Austrian head of state security.

Austrian media reported the suspects' plans included driving a car into groups of Swifties expected to gather outside the venue before attacking with machetes and knives. They had reportedly planned to launch their attack at 4pm today.

Beran A. fully confessed to his plans to 'kill as many people as possible outside the concert venue', Austrian security officials said.

His planned terror attack was supposed to end with him detonating his homemade bomb and killing himself in the process, according to the Austrian Heute newspaper.

Director-general for public safety Ruf confirmed today that 'explosives were manufactured' at the suspect's home after local media reported that Beran A. had stolen chemicals from his former workplace, a metal processing company also in Ternitz, to build a bomb.

Beran A. - who was living in his parents' house along with another man - was arrested on Wednesday after police raided the home, according to Kronen Zeitung.

A bomb squad found chemical substances, fluids as well as 'explosive devices and technical equipment', Ruf said, after raiding the home and it is believed that the 19-year-old stole these from his workplace.

Ruf confirmed at a press conference today that the 'preparatory action' in the home in Ternitz focused on the manufacturing of explosives.

Among the substances was hydrogen peroxide, which Ruf said is used to create explosives and he confirmed that 'explosives were manufactured'.

The suspects reportedly planned to ram a car into fans outside the stadium as it is well known that those who missed out on tickets will still come to the venue of Swift's shows to listen from outside, like a week ago in Munich when 40,000 ticketless fans gathered on hills outside the Olympic Stadium.

Neither Beran A. nor the second suspect appeared to have a ticket to any of the shows and instead planned to focus the attack on fans standing outside the stadium.

Kurier also cited several sources who claimed the 17-year-old suspect had gotten jobs as security guards at the concert a few days ago, suggesting this could have facilitated the attack.

The newspaper also reported that the 17-year-old is said to be a major player in the gang war in Vienna, with police issuing a wanted notice for the boy in relation to a fight earlier this month.

Beran A. intensely prepared for and 'focused on his planned terror attack' since quitting his job on July 25, according to Ruf.

He also had blank ammunition, €21,000 (£18,000) in counterfeit money and a blue police flashing light and siren he wanted to use to get to the venue undeterred, German tabloid Bild reports.

According to Austrian media reports, Beran A. and his accomplice wanted to launch the attack at 4pm today, when the outside of the stadium would have been packed with thousands of fans waiting to get inside as security guards were due to unlock the gates at this time.

Beran A.'s plan reportedly was to attack the blue flashing police light to his VW Beetle and to disguise himself as a police officer to get as close to the stadium as possible before running over as many Swifties as he can, before attacking them with knives and machetes and detonating his suicide bomb.

During his interrogation, Beran A. gave a full confession, but reportedly showed no remorse for his terror plans.

'The suspects had concrete and detailed plans to create a tragedy of the same magnitude as the Paris, Manchester and Moscow attacks, also at a concert, with many people, and to leave a blood bath behind,' Austrian chancellor Karl Nehammer said at a news conference this afternoon.

'It is really inconceivable to think about what immeasurable damage a successful attack could have created,' he added.

The name of the second suspect, aged 17, has not yet been released. He is said to have Austrian nationality but Turkish and Croatian roots and reportedly was in 'intense contact' with Beran A. over the last few days.

While it has been reported that the second suspect would have likely been able to gain access to the venue due to his new job with the facilities company, it is unclear what horrors he wanted to unleash inside the stadium.

A 15-year-old Austrian with Turkish heritage has also been detained and is currently being questioned after police found that he had communicated with both suspects.

Beran A. had uploaded an oath of allegiance to the current leader of the Islamic State group (ISIS) to an internet account in early July, police said.

A video of this pledge of allegiance as well as a video confessing responsibility for the attack has been seized by police.

Authorities also found Islamic State group and al-Qaida material at the home of the second suspect, a 17-year-old Austrian.

He was employed a few days ago by a company providing services at the venue for the concerts, and was arrested by special police forces near the stadium.

The 17-year-old reportedly denies the terror accusations against him. He told police that him and Beran A. 'just wanted to drive around'.

He reportedly spoke to Beran A. on the phone for an hour on July 7 - 'but only because we were friends', not because they were planning a terror attack.

The teenager even stayed over at Beran A.'s house in Ternitz on August 2, according to Heute.

Law enforcement sources told ABC News information about the threat to the shows originated with U.S. intelligence and was passed to the Austrians and Europol on July 25.

Ruf said: 'The suspects were focused on the Taylor Swift concerts. We discovered that he was taking action to prepare for the attack. A clear threat has been averted.'

Officials said at a press conference that no other suspects are being sought after identifying the two teens aged 17 and 19.

Austria's chancellor Karl Nehammer declared on X following news of the arrests: 'Thanks to the intensive cooperation of our police and the newly established DSN (Directorate for Security and Intelligence) with foreign services, the threat was identified early on, combated, and a tragedy was prevented.'

Swift's concert promoter confirmed the cancellation in a post, citing public safety

The shows are expected to be attended by 65,000 concertgoers per day, with an additional 30,000 fans outside of the area, police said - Swift pictured performing in Amsterdam in July

Commending the police and intelligence services for preventing a potential attack on the Swift concerts, Nehammer said: 'We live in a time in which violent means are being used to attack our western way of life.

'Islamist terrorism threatens security and freedom in many western countries. This is precisely why we will not give up our values ​​​​such as freedom and democracy, but will defend them even more vehemently.

'These values ​​​​are the foundation of our society and make us resilient against extremism and terrorism. It is important to remain vigilant, stand together and take decisive action against Islamism.'

'The situation was serious, the situation is serious,' Austria's Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said at a press conference today.

He added: 'But we can also say that a tragedy could be prevented.'

'The danger posed by Islamist extremism significantly increased in Europe following the devastating terror attack by Hamas on Israel. [...] Austria was and is no exception here.

Karner said that the terror alert level in Austria had been raised to four since October 7, the second highest level.

'Large concerts are a preferred target for Islamist assassins,' he explained, referencing the attack in the Bataclan in Paris in 2015, the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester 2018 as well as the Moscow City Hall attack earlier this year.

British band Coldplay is due to play four shows in Vienna later this month from August 21 to August 25, but it is unclear whether these concerts will go ahead in light of the foiled terror attacks.

Swift's concert promoter Barracuda Music posted a statement which read: 'Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour Vienna Shows Cancelled Due to Government Officials Confirmation of Planned Terrorist Attack.

'With confirmation from government officials of a planned terrorist attack at Ernst Happel Stadium, we have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone's safety.

'All tickets will be automatically refunded within the next 10 business days.'

Ruf initially said that there would be a special focus on entry checks and concertgoers should plan to arrive in plenty of time.

The shows were expected to be attended by 65,000 concertgoers per day, with an additional 30,000 fans outside of the area, police said.

Swift is expected to perform at London's Wembley stadium in five concerts between August 15 and 20 to close the European leg of her record-setting Eras Tour.

Policing minister Diana Johnson said Scotland Yard will look at 'all the intelligence' ahead of Swift's UK shows."
"ISIS-inspired suspect planned suicide attack at Taylor Swift concert, Austrian authorities say.",https://ca.news.yahoo.com/2-arrested-planning-terror-plot-173700330.html,"Taylor Swift's three concerts in Vienna this week have been canceled after two suspects were arrested for allegedly plotting a terror attack, authorities said.

""We have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone's safety,"" a message from Barracuda Music said. ""All tickets will be automatically refunded.""

The cancellation comes hours after authorities announced a 19-year-old Austrian citizen was arrested Wednesday morning and a second suspect was arrested in the afternoon.

The suspects allegedly radicalized themselves online, Franz Ruf, director-general for public safety in the Ministry of the Interior, said at a press conference. The 19-year-old suspect allegedly pledged allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State at the beginning of July, Ruf said.

Vienna was a target of their planned attack and the 19-year-old suspect had a particular focus on Swift's Vienna concert, Ruf said.

The pop star had concerts scheduled in Vienna this Thursday, Friday and Saturday.

Information about the threat to the tour dates originated with U.S. intelligence and was passed to the Austrians and Europol, multiple law enforcement and intelligence sources told ABC News.

Though inspired by ISIS, the sources said investigators do not believe the alleged plot was directed by ISIS operatives.

U.S. intelligence found at least one of the suspects pledged to ISIS-K on the messaging app, Telegram, in early July, the sources said.

Investigators are not convinced that the alleged plot would have worked and they do not know if a functioning bomb was produced. However, Viennese investigators did find explosive precursor chemicals which showed a degree of motivation and planning, sources told ABC News.

Before the shows were canceled, Ruf said security at the concerts would be increased. The shows were expected to draw 65,000 concertgoers per day, with an additional 10,000 to 15,000 fans outside of the area, police said.

Swift kicked off the massively successful ""Eras Tour"" in Glendale, Arizona, on March 18, 2023.

Investigators in Austria are looking at surveillance footage to determine whether one or more of the suspects had previously visited the concert site for reconnaissance or if they had visited other potential targets.

As ABC News has previously reported, law enforcement officials have been concerned about mass gathering attacks since the deadly Moscow concert hall assault earlier this year for which ISIS-K claimed credit.

In October 2023, the pop star released a concert film chronicling the record-breaking tour, ""Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,"" that went on to break records of its own and earn a Golden Globe nomination.

At the 100th stop of the tour this summer in Liverpool, England, the 14-time Grammy winner told the audience the tour ""has definitely been the most exhausting, all-encompassing, but most joyful, most rewarding, most wonderful thing that has ever happened in my life thus far.""

The Eras Tour will end in Vancouver, Canada, on Dec. 8.

"ISIS-inspired suspect planned suicide attack at Taylor Swift concert, Austrian authorities say.",https://www.sheppnews.com.au/aap-entertainment/isis-led-suspect-in-swift-plot-planned-suicide-attack/,"The 19-year-old man, who has North Macedonian roots, made a full confession in custody, Austria's general director for public security Franz Ruf told a news conference on Thursday.

He swore allegiance to the IS group's leader on the internet and had chemicals, machetes and technical devices at his home in the town of Ternitz in preparation for an attack, Ruf added.

The suspect was planning a lethal assault among the estimated 20,000 ""Swiftie"" fans set to gather outside Vienna's Ernst Happel Stadium, said national intelligence head Omar Haijawi-Pirchner. Two other Austrian youths aged 17 and 15 were detained on Wednesday over the reported plot.

""The main perpetrator has confessed that he was supposed to carry out a suicide attack with two accomplices,"" said Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer.

""The suspects actually had very specific and detailed plans ... to leave a bloodbath in their wake.""

Authorities painted a picture of the main suspect having self-radicalised, transforming his appearance and sharing Islamist propaganda online. He quit his job on July 25, telling people he had ""big plans"", Ruf said.

One neighbour told Austrian broadcaster Puls24 that the suspect had kept himself to himself and had grown a ""Taliban beard"".

Fans were devastated that organisers of three Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna decided to cancel. (AP PHOTO)

The 17-year-old suspect had been given a job with a company a few days ago that was providing services at the stadium, according to security officials.

Event organiser Barracuda Music said it had cancelled Swift's three concerts in Vienna, due to start on Thursday for a sold-out 65,000 audience each, in coordination with the singer's management team.

Fans, many of whom had travelled a long way to Vienna, expressed both dismay and understanding.

""It's just heartbreaking, just frustrating. But at the end of the day I guess it's for everyone's safety,"" said Mark del Rosario, who had flown from the Philippines to see the wildly popular US singer.

US broadcaster ABC cited law enforcement and intelligence sources as saying Austrian authorities had received information about the Swift concert threat from US intelligence.

It quoted the sources as saying that at least one of the suspects had pledged allegiance to ISIS-K, a resurgent wing of IS, on Telegram in June, though the plot was IS-inspired rather than directed by the group's operatives.

Austrian Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said foreign intelligence agencies had helped with the investigation, as Austrian law does not allow monitoring of messenger apps.

Event organiser Live Nation urged fans of Coldplay, which is due to play at the same stadium on August 21, to stay calm and said it was in contact with authorities.

It did not comment on whether the show would take place.

British police said on Thursday there was nothing to indicate that the planned attack in Vienna would have an impact on Swift's shows at Wembley Stadium in London next week.

""Concerts are often a preferred target of Islamist attackers, large concerts,"" said Karner, listing the 2015 attack on the Bataclan venue in Paris and the 2017 bombing at England's Manchester Arena where US pop star Ariana Grande had played.

The plot in Austria also brought to mind a foiled plan by three IS-linked suspects to attack Vienna's gay pride parade last year.

Islamic State was largely crushed by a US-led coalition several years ago after establishing a ""caliphate"" in large areas of Iraq and Syria, but has still managed some major attacks while seeking to rebuild and reinvent itself.

This week's shows were to be part of the record-breaking Eras Tour by American singer-songwriter Swift which started on March 17, 2023, in Glendale, Arizona, and is set to conclude on December 8, 2024, in Vancouver, Canada.

Swift, 34, has not yet commented on the cancellations on her official Instagram account, which has 283 million followers.

Her fans were horrified at the threat, with some begging organisers to postpone the concert instead of cancelling it outright. Promoters have said they will pay back tickets.Â"

Disturbingly, they had reportedly just been hired by the venue as security personnel.

Chilling new details of the thwarted attack emerged after authorities announced that two men, aged 19 and 17, were arrested in Vienna on Wednesday, leading to the cancellation of Swift's three sold-out Eras shows in the city. According to investigators, the suspects had been radicalized online by ISIS and allegedly planned to carry out the attack outside the Ernst Happel Stadium.

Chilling Plans of Mass Casualty

The two men allegedly were planning to kill fans with homemade explosives and machetes, security officials said on Thursday. The alleged mastermind, a 19-year-old Austrian with North Macedonian heritage, was found with chemical substances and technical devices hidden in his home when authorities raided it, officials reported.

He had reportedly made significant progress in making the bomb he planned to attach to the car, they added.

Meanwhile, the second suspect, a 17-year-old Austrian citizen of Turkish and Croatian origin, was arrested by special police forces near the stadium where the concerts were scheduled to take place this week.

Officials stated that the second suspect had only recently been hired by a company providing services at the venue during the concerts.

Sources told the German news outlet Kurier that he had been hired to work as security at the venue.

In the lead-up to their arrests, both suspects had shown noticeable changes in behavior, according to Franz Ruf, public security director at Austria's Interior Ministry.

The older teen had quit his job on July 25, telling others he had ""something big"" planned, while the 17-year-old had recently ended his relationship with his girlfriend, according to Ruf.

The two suspects had also been in contact with others who were apparently aware of their terror plot.

A 15-year-old boy was also brought in for questioning on Wednesday after the plot was uncovered, though it's unclear if he was arrested.

Both older suspects were already under surveillance by Austrian authorities and were considered known risks before their arrests, officials revealed.

During a raid on the second suspect's home, investigators found extensive materials related to ISIS and al Qaeda.

Meanwhile, the main suspect, who authorities say fully confessed to the attack plans after his arrest, had recently pledged allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State online, according to security officials.

Mass Murder Plans Thwarted

Officials stated that the older suspect was ""clearly radicalized towards the Islamic State and believes it is justified to kill infidels."" The names of the suspects have not been disclosed due to Austria's privacy laws.

Swift was scheduled to perform three sold-out shows, expected to attract 195,000 people, from Thursday through Saturday.

It remains unclear which specific concert the foiled attack was intended to target. ""The situation was serious, the situation is serious. But we can also say: A tragedy was prevented,"" Austria's Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said Thursday.

Event organizer Barracuda Music announced late Wednesday on Instagram that they ""have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone's safety,"" citing government officials' confirmation of the planned attack at the stadium.

The news of the terror threat and the subsequent cancellations left ""Swifties"" around the world heartbroken.

Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer expressed his regret on X, stating that ""the cancellation of the Taylor Swift concerts by the organizers is a bitter disappointment for all fans in Austria.""

""The situation surrounding the apparently planned terror attack in Vienna was very serious,"" he wrote, adding that, thanks to intensive cooperation between police and Austrian and foreign intelligence, ""the threat could be recognized early on, tackled and a tragedy prevented.""

Austria's Vice Chancellor Werner Kogler shared in a separate post: ""For many, a dream has been shattered today. On three evenings in Vienna, tens of thousands of #Swifties should have celebrated life together.

""I am very sorry that you were denied this. Swifties stick together, hate and terror can't destroy that,"" Kogler wrote."
"ISIS-inspired suspect planned suicide attack at Taylor Swift concert, Austrian authorities say.",https://townpress.co.za/suspect-in-isis-inspired-outfit-in-taylor-swifts-event-plans-a-suicide-attack/,"In detention, the 19-year-old male, who is of North Macedonian descent, fully confessed, according to Franz Ruf, Austria’s general director for public security, during a press conference

Ruf said, “He declared his loyalty to the IS group, opened a new tab’s leader on the internet, and had weapons, machetes, and other technical equipment at his house in the town of Ternitz in case of an attack.”

According to national intelligence chief Omar Haijawi-Pirchner, the suspect was preparing a deadly attack on the 20,000 or more “Swiftie” fans expected to assemble outside Vienna’s Ernst Happel Stadium. Due to the alleged plot, two further Austrian adolescents, ages 17 and 15, were placed under arrest on Wednesday.

Chancellor Karl Nehammer of Austria stated, “The main perpetrator has confessed that he was supposed to carry out a suicide attack with two accomplices.”

“The suspects actually had very specific and detailed plans … to leave a bloodbath in their wake.” Authorities presented an image of the primary suspect as having become an Islamist propagandist online, changed his look, and become a self-radicalized individual. He told folks he had “big plans” when he resigned from his position on July 25, Ruf claimed.

A neighbor who talked to Austrian television Puls24 claimed that the suspect had developed a “Taliban beard” and remained reclusive.

The 17-year-old suspect, according to security officials, was employed a few days ago by a business that supplied services at the stadium.

Event planner Barracuda Music reported that it had canceled Swift’s three scheduled gigs in Vienna, which were set to start on Thursday and draw a total of 65,000 fans each, after consulting with the singer’s management team.

Supporters, many of whom had traveled far to Vienna, voiced their sympathy as well as their dismay.

It’s just irritating and depressing. Ultimately, though, I suppose it’s for everyone’s protection “said Mark del Rosario, who had traveled from the Philippines to witness the enormously well-liked American musician

American network ABC reported that Austrian authorities had been informed by U.S. intelligence about the Swift concert threat, citing law enforcement and intelligence sources.

Although the scheme was inspired by IS rather than carried out by the group’s agents, it was reported by the sources that at least one of the suspects had sworn allegiance to ISIS-K, a resurgent branch of IS, on Telegram in June.

Since Austrian legislation forbids the monitoring of chat apps, foreign intelligence organizations reportedly assisted with the probe, according to Austrian Interior Minister Gerhard Karner.

Coldplay is scheduled to perform at the same stadium on August 21. The event’s organizer, Live Nation, advised Coldplay supporters to remain composed and stated that it was in communication with the police.

Regarding whether the show would air, it remained silent.

Swift’s concerts at London’s Wembley Stadium next week are not expected to be impacted by the planned attack in Vienna, according to British police, who made this announcement on Thursday.

“Large concerts are often a preferred target of Islamist attackers,” Karner added, citing the bombing of England’s Manchester Arena in 2017 that took place just after American pop sensation Ariana Grande performed there and the 2015 attack on the Paris Bataclan venue.

The plot in Austria also reminded me of the attempted attack on Vienna’s gay pride march last year by three men connected to the Islamic State.

Although the Islamic State was substantially destroyed by a coalition led by the United States a few years ago after creating a “caliphate” over a sizable portion of both Iraq and Syria, the group has continued to launch significant attacks as it attempts to reorganize and reinvent itself.

The concerts this week were scheduled to be a part of American singer-songwriter Swift’s record-breaking Eras Tour, which began in Glendale, Arizona on March 17, 2023, and is scheduled to end in Vancouver, Canada on December 8, 2024.

With 283 million followers on her official Instagram account, Swift, 34, has not yet responded to the cancellations.

The threat infuriated her supporters, several of whom begged the concert’s organizers to reschedule rather than cancel it altogether. The ticket promoters have promised to reimburse the cost."

Cardi explained that she felt a “weird jerk” in her side and she could not get up.

Cardi decided to take a nap hoping the pain would subside. However, she woke up feeling much worse.

The doctors gave Cardi morphine to help with the pain. After she was released following a three-day hospital stay, she was put on bed rest.

Cardi B spent several days in hospital, revealing a “freak accident” left her paralyzed and her unborn baby’s life hanging in the balance.

Cardi B reveals she almost lost her unborn child in a freak accident that left her in excruciating pain and in hospital for days.

On Wednesday (August 7), less than a week after announcing her pregnancy, the “Wanna Be” hitmaker took to social media to update her fans. She hopped on X (Twitter) Spaces to reveal that she was back home after spending a few days in hospital.

“I had a f###### freak accident,” she explained. While Cardi B withheld the specific details of what led to her hospitalization, she added, “It become so big to the point I was literally paralyzed.”

She continued, revealing that her unborn baby was at risk during the terrifying ordeal. “And that little thing almost cost me my little one to come,” she said. “But it didn’t.”

While Cardi B is back at home and in good spirits, she’s struggling to cope with the pain.

“Yesterday I was feeling good. I came home, but I came home high as a kite,” Cardi added. “Today, I woke up sober, honey. I’m dying … If I don’t feel good in four hours, I’m going to the hospital and I don’t give a f###. I’ma exaggerate this s### so I can get more morphine. Morphine me down! I don’t give a damn.”

Elsewhere during the update, Cardi B said “a little freak accident” landed her a spell in the hospital for two or three days. “I’m in a lot of pain,” she added. “I don’t even know how the f### it happened … but I injured myself.”

Cardi B has revealed that she had a ‘freak accident’ that caused serious harm that nearly resulted in her miscarrying her third child.

Cardi B, real name Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar, is currently pregnant with her third child which she revealed to the world earlier this month shortly after filing for divorce from her husband Offset.

The 31-year-old, who is also mum to daughter Kulture and son Wave, has revealed that the pregnancy has not all been plain sailing and just a week after revealing her pregnancy she has been involved in a ‘freak accident’.

In a message on X spaces chat, the WAP singer revealed: ‘I had a f*****g freak accident. That’s what I have to explain I don’t know how something – well, it wasn’t little, it actually hurt.’

‘It doesn’t really happen often, but it became so big to the point I was literally paralysed. And that little thing almost cost me my little one to come. But it didn’t.’

People reported that she then later explained that she fell down the stairs. ‘I was going down the stairs and I slipped a little,’ she said on August 8 in another X Spaces message. ‘I practically fell, but I was trying to prevent myself from falling, so I was holding myself on the railing. My foot still slipped, and I kind of busted my a*s.

‘I dilated and I was having contractions for every two minutes for a whole 24 hours. So they had to monitor me and I was in a lot of pain. I couldn’t move for two days straight.’

The star also revealed that she was given morphine to treat her pain. ‘Yesterday I was feeling good. I came home, but I came home high as a kite. Today, I woke up sober, honey. I’m dying, if I don’t feel good in four hours, I’m going to the hospital and I don’t give a f**k,’ she explained in the voice message.

‘I’mma exaggerate this s**t so I can get more morphine. Morphine me down! I don’t give a damn.

‘Oh my god, this is probably why b*****s are getting addicted to drugs and s**t ’cause I ain’t gonna lie to you when them motherf*****s were shooting that morphine in me I was timing it every f******g four hours, every four hours I was waiting for my s**t,’ she concluded.

The star announced her third pregnancy in a social media post on August 1 that showed the I Like It rapper in a draped red gown with her bump poking through a gap.

Cardi cradled her bump in the photo and captioned the image: ‘With every ending comes a new beginning! I am so grateful to have shared this season with you, you have brought me more love, more life and most of all renewed my power!

‘Reminded me that I can have it all! You’ve reminded me that I never have to choose between life, love, and my passion! I love you so much and can not wait for you to witness what you helped me accomplish, what you pushed me to do!

‘It’s so much easier taking life’s twists, turns and test laying down, but you, your brother and your sister have shown me why it’s worth it to push through!’ the caption read.

Cardi and Offset first started dating in 2017, and married in September of that year. According to reports, Cardi has acquired a lawyer and is seeking a divorce from her husband.

This isn’t the first time the couple has split and it was reported in 2020 that Cardi submitted documents to end their marriage, but the matter was dropped. The couple has yet to confirm their current relationship status.

Cardi B Reveals She Had a 'Freak Accident' That Left Her with a 'Freak Accident'.,https://marketresearchtelecast.com/cardi-b-reveals-freak-accident-that-nearly-caused-miscarriage-and-paralysis/,"Cardi B revealed a recent medical scare that almost led to the loss of her unborn child and left her temporarily paralyzed.

The popular “Like It” rapper shared the unsettling experience during an X Spaces conversation, describing a “freak accident” that caused her significant pain. Cardi B, 31, is currently expecting her third child while navigating divorce proceedings with estranged husband Offset.

“I had a f***ing freak accident. I don’t know how something, well, it wasn’t little. It actually hurt,” she shared on X Spaces. “It doesn’t really happen often, but it became something that is so big to the point I was literally paralyzed. But yeah. And that little thing almost cost me my little one to come. But it didn’t. Yesterday I was feeling good. I came home, but I came home high as a kite. Today, I woke up sober, honey. I’m dying. Like, I’m dying. I swear to God, if I don’t feel good in four hours I’m going to the hospital and I don’t give a f**k. I’mma exaggerate this s**t so I can get more morphine. Morphine me down! I don’t give a damn [laughs]. Oh my God.”

Cardi and Offset share two other children — daughter Kulture, 6, and son Wave, 2. Offset is also father to Jordan, 13, and Kalea and Kody, both 8, from previous relationships.

At the beginning of this month, Cardi announced her pregnancy with her third child. The GRAMMY winner took to Instagram and shared a photo of her baby bump, with the New York City skyline in the background.

“With every ending comes a new beginning! I am so grateful to have shared this season with you, you have brought me more love, more life and most of all renewed my power,” Cardi captioned the post featuring two images of her cradling her baby bump in a revealing red dress.

She continued, “Reminded me that I can have it all! You’ve reminded me that I never have to choose between life, love, and my passion! I love you so much and can not wait for you to witness what you helped me accomplish, what you pushed me to do! It’s so much easier taking life’s twists, turns and test laying down, but you, your brother and your sister have shown me why it’s worth it to push through!”

The pregnancy announcement came amid her divorce proceedings with Offset. The couple secretly tied the knot in 2017. Their tumultuous relationship reached a breaking point in December when Cardi B confirmed their separation. Cardi B had previously filed for divorce twice before eventually calling it off.

During the convo, Cardi stated the incident occurred on August 3rd. “Guys I just got home yesterday I was in the hospital for like 2 or 3 days and now that I’m back at home I’m a lot of pain.

As we previously reported, Just a week ago, Cardi B put an end to speculation by confirming her pregnancy with her third child.

The “Bodak Yellow” sensation revealed the news through a glamorous maternity photoshoot, showcasing her blossoming baby bump against the backdrop of the New York City skyline.

She captioned the photos with a note to her unborn baby: “With every ending comes a new beginning,” she wrote. “I am so grateful to have shared this season with you, you have brought me more love, more life and most of all renewed my power!

Michelle Pfeiffer will officially star in the next spinoff in the “Yellowstone” world, helmed by creator Taylor Sheridan.

Called “The Madison,” the show will star Pfeiffer, 66, who will also exec produce.

The show’s previous working title was “2024.” The story will follow a New York City family in the Madison River valley of central Montana.

According to Paramount, the show is “a heartfelt study of grief and human connection.”

“Michelle Pfeiffer is a remarkable talent who imbues every role with emotional depth, authenticity and grace. She is the perfect anchor to the newest chapter of the ‘Yellowstone’ universe, ‘The Madison,’ from the brilliant mind of Taylor Sheridan,” Chris McCarthy, Paramount Global co-CEO and the president and CEO of Showtime and MTV Entertainment Studios, said in a statement on Thursday.

“Suits” star Patrick J. Adams and Kurt Russell are also rumored to be in talks to co-star, but no official deals have been announced with them.

9 “It’s time to move on,” Kevin Costner said about “Yellowstone.”

“Yellowstone” follows wealthy rancher John Dutton (Kevin Costner) and his adult children, including Kayce (Luke Grimes), Jamie (Wes Bentley), Beth (Kelly Reilly) and his son-in-law, Rip Wheeler (Cole Hauser).

Previously, it was reported that McConaughey would likely star in the sequel series, but a deal was never officially announced. McConaughey’s future in the “Yellowstone” world is unclear. The Post reached out to his rep for comment.

There was also a chance that “Yellowstone” stars Reilly, Hauser and Grimes would reprise their roles and join him in that series, although that was never officially confirmed, either.

“Yellowstone” has numerous other spinoff shows, including “1883” starring Tim McGraw, Faith Hill and Sam Elliott, and “1923” starring Helen Mirren and Harrison Ford.

Sheridan has gotten into several public rumored feuds with his stars. Kevin Costner left “Yellowstone” under a cloud of rumors and accusations that he didn’t prioritize the series over his film work, which he denied.

“I have taken a beating from those f–king guys, and I know a lot of times where it’s coming from,” Costner said in May, referring to the “Yellowstone” producers and Sheridan.

Sheridan told the Hollywood Reporter in June 2023 about his feud with Costner, “He and the network were arguing about when he could be done with ‘Yellowstone.’ I said, ‘We can certainly work a schedule toward [his preferred exit date],’ which we did.”

Sheridan added, “Once lawyers get involved, then people don’t get to talk to each other and start saying things that aren’t true and attempt to shift blame based on how the press or public seem to be reacting.”

In June, Costner officially confirmed he won’t be returning to the show, instead shifting his focus on making his Western movie “Horizon: An American Saga.” The first out of four films received dismal reviews and its sequel is headed to the Venice Film Festival for its world premiere.

“It was a necessary decision to say, ‘Hey, OK, I don’t want to really talk about this anymore. It’s time to move on,’” Costner told the Hollywood Reporter at the time, referring to “Yellowstone.”

The “Dances With Wolves” star also addressed his fans in an Instagram video about it.

“I just want to reach out and let you know that after this long year and a half of working on Horizon and doing all the things that that’s required,” Costner said at the time.

9 Kevin Costner had some harsh words for the “Yellowstone” producers after he left.

“Thinking about Yellowstone, that beloved series that I love, that I know you love. I just realized that I’m not going to be able to continue, season five or into the future.”

He added, “I loved it and I know you loved it. I just wanted to let you know that I won’t be returning. I love the relationships that I’ve been able to develop. And I’ll see you at the movies.”

Sheridan’s ranch also sued “Yellowstone” star Hauser’s coffee brand.

The Post reached out to reps for “Yellowstone” for comment.

The new show does not yet have an announced premiere date, but it’s expected in 2025.

The second half of the fifth and final season of “Yellowstone” premieres Nov. 10 at 8 p.m. on Paramount Network."
Michelle Pfeiffer will officially star in ‘Yellowstone’ sequel series.,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/michelle-pfeiffer-to-lead-yellowstone-sequel-series-1235969376/,"When the end of Yellowstone was officially announced last year, Paramount Network had set the wheels in motion for two more spinoffs. There was the prequel series, to be set in 1944, and then the present-day continuation, set to take place after the events of Yellowstone, which had the working title 2024.

Now, that sequel series is very much beginning to take shape.

That series will be titled The Madison and will star Michelle Pfeiffer, and it will be the next series to roll out in the Yellowstone universe. The Oscar-nominated movie star will also executive produce the new series from franchise boss Taylor Sheridan.

The Madison is described as a heartfelt study of grief and human connection following a New York City family in the Madison River valley of central Montana.

“Michelle Pfeiffer is a remarkable talent who imbues every role with emotional depth, authenticity and grace,” said Chris McCarthy, Paramount Global co-CEO and president/CEO, Showtime & MTV Entertainment Studios. “She is the perfect anchor to the newest chapter of the Yellowstone universe, The Madison, from the brilliant mind of Taylor Sheridan.”

Pfeiffer, a three-time Oscar nominee, Golden Globe Award winner and Emmy nominee, is the latest A-list star to join Sheridan for the Yellowstone-verse, following Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren leading Yellowstone prequel series 1923 (which is currently in production on its second and final season).

Matthew McConaughey was initially in talks to star; however, a deal was never announced. When first announced, The Madison had been described as a sequel series that would take place after the events of Yellowstone, but that would continue to explore the Dutton family dynasty with new characters and locations, as well as some existing characters — which has sparked speculation about what other familiar faces will pop up.

Another spinoff, set in 1944, was also announced as a prequel series that will follow in the footsteps of 1883 and 1923.

The Yellowstone flagship, meanwhile, launches its highly anticipated, long-delayed final episodes beginning Nov. 10.

Yellowstone has become a pop culture and ratings phenomenon, ranking as the most popular drama series on TV. In 2022, the production took an extended hiatus in the middle of filming its fifth season, which turned into a delay that lasted over a year amid wrangling over the busy schedules of showrunner Sheridan and star Kevin Costner. After much speculation, Costner finally confirmed his exit from the series earlier this summer, saying, “It was a necessary decision to say, ‘Hey, OK, I don’t want to really talk about this anymore. It’s time to move on.’” Viewers will have to wait and see how Sheridan handles the storyline around Costner’s formerly starring John Dutton when the final season airs.

Pfeiffer, who famously rose to prominence in the cult classic Scarface, recently starred as Betty Ford in the Showtime anthology The First Lady and can next be seen on Oh. What. Fun! for Amazon. Her storied film credits include French Exit, mother!, Hairspray, White Oleander, What Lies Beneath, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, The Deep End of the Ocean, One Fine Day, Up Close & Personal, Dangerous Minds, Wolf, Batman Returns and The Witches of Eastwick.

She is repped by CAA, Entertainment360, Hirsch Wallerstein and WKPR.

The Madison is produced by MTV Entertainment Studios, 101 Studios and Bosque Ranch Productions. Along with Sheridan and Pfeiffer, David C. Glasser, John Linson, Art Linson, Ron Burkle, Bob Yari, David Hutkin, Christina Voros, Michael Friedman and Keith Cox executive produce."

Now, we've finally got some of that, as Paramount officially revealed that the much-discussed Yellowstone sequel series officially has a new name, a premise, and a star—none of which were what we previously thought.

Taylor Sheridan's sequel series will be called Madison—not the previously floated 2024—and the show will not star Matthew McConaughey, who was long rumored to take the reigns of Sheridan's flagship franchise, but rather Michelle Pfeiffer. We don't know yet how Madison will connect to Yellowstone's ongoing Dutton family drama (or, if Kevin Costner's departure will somehow figure in).

Paramount's logline provided of the show is short and simple, for now:

The series is a heartfelt study of grief and human connection following a New York City family in the Madison River valley of central Montana.

Pfeiffer, a three-time Academy Award nominee who has been a top-tier performer for decades, is the only announced cast member of the series so far.

“Michelle Pfeiffer is a remarkable talent who imbues every role with emotional depth, authenticity and grace,"" Paramount executive Chris McCarthy said in the press release. “She is the perfect anchor to the newest chapter of the Yellowstone universe, Madison, from the brilliant mind of Taylor Sheridan.”

Pfeiffer, who's well known for playing Catwoman in Batman Returns in addition to roles in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Janet Van Dyne and in movies like Brian De Palma's Scarface, has never starred in a Western or led a TV series before. So this is somewhat uncharted ground, despite all of her past successes on the big screen.

While it's definitely a shift from the long-rumored McConaughey lead—and we still don't know how this will connect to Yellowstone proper, if it does at all—we're excited to see how Madison plays out."

Madison is the seventh spinoff from the Kevin Costner-led series, which premiered in 2018 and will debut its final season in November – though Costner has confirmed he will not be part of the second half of season 5 following rumors of his exit.

The first spinoff, 1883, was a prequel series starring Faith Hill and Tim McGraw as the Dutton family's 19th-century ancestors, James and Margaret Dutton, on their journey from Texas to Montana through the Great Plains.

Lawmen: Bass Reeves is a limited series – with no set premiere date as of yet – that merged with 1883 and will star David Oyelowo as the titular iconic lawman.

1923 is another prequel series from Taylor Sheridan, which saw Helen Mirren and Harrison Ford star as Cara Dutton and Jacob Dutton and chronicled the family's trek to Montana. It originally premiered in 2022, and was later renewed for a second season, with both Mirren and Ford confirmed to return.

Michelle Pfeiffer will officially star in ‘Yellowstone’ sequel series.,https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a61777052/the-madison-yellowstone-spinoff-cast-news/,"Yellowstone fans, the era of the Dutton family is nearing its end. According to The Hollywood Reproter, there’s another spin-off in development. The series, titled The Madison, reportedly stars Michelle Pfeiffer (Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania) in a story that takes place directly after the events of Yellowstone. Much is still up in the air, but we can now confirm that Pfeiffer is officially on board.

""Michelle Pfeiffer is a remarkable talent who imbues every role with emotional depth, authenticity and grace,” announced Chris McCarthy, President of Showtime & MTV Entertainment Studios. ""She is the perfect anchor to the newest chapter of the Yellowstone universe, The Madison, from the brilliant mind of Taylor Sheridan.""



Pfeiffer plays newcomer Stacy Clyburn, TVLine reports, a family matriarch who moves her family from New York City to the Madison River Valley of Montana following her husband's death. THR describes the series as a ""heartfelt study of grief and human."" No word yet on any more Duttons joining the series, but the rest of the cast is rumored to include Kurt Russell (Monarch: Legacy of Monsters), Patrick J. Adams (Suits), and Beau Garrett (The Good Doctor).

Naturally, this new Yellowstone spin-off opens up a massive can of worms. Previously, Paramount announced that it was putting together a sequel series to Yellowstone, titled 2024, featuring Matthew McConaughey. Cole Hauser, Kelly Reilly, and Luke Grimes were also rumored to reprise their roles of Rip Wheeler, Beth Dutton, and Kayce Dutton, respectively. Paramount has yet to comment on the state of 2024. But it sounds like 2024 is now The Madison, and will not air in addition to 2024. As THR reports, The Madison will ""continue to explore the Dutton family dynasty with new characters and locations, as well as some existing characters.""

For fans, the future of Yellowstone is in dire need of a road map. Ever since Kevin Costner left the project due to an ongoing feud with creator Taylor Sheridan, the path ahead has remained uncertain. Yellowstone season 5 ended abruptly—and on a cliff-hanger, I might add!—all the way back on New Year’s Day 2023. Costner went on to make his own western film series titled Horizon, while Paramount seemingly struggled to let audiences know just what’s next for the Dutton family. Outside of Yellowstone prequels 1883 and 1923, none of Sheridan’s other shows—including Tulsa King, Mayor of Kingstown, Lioness, and Bass Reeves—have ever connected to the Duttons.

Season 5B of Yellowstone is expected to premiere on November 10. The remaining episodes will reportedly end the Dutton saga for the flagship series, before the story continues on in another form. Production on The Madison is rumored to begin later this month, with a tentative premiere in 2025. If all this proves true, get ready to meet the Clyburns."

Michelle Pfeiffer will officially star in ‘Yellowstone’ sequel series.,https://dailycaller.com/2024/08/08/taylor-sheridan-michelle-pfeiffer-madison-yellowstone-spinoff-sequel/,"We were finally given answers Thursday by Paramount+ as to the plan for Taylor Sheridan’s first “Yellowstone” sequel spin-off series. Here’s all we know so far, as of Thursday morning, Aug. 8.

Oscar nominee Michelle Pfeiffer is officially on board to executive producer and star in Taylor Sheridan’s new series “Madison,” which was previously titled “2024,” according to a press release shared with the Daily Caller. The series is being described as the next “installment” from the “Yellowstone” universe, suggesting some crossover but not necessarily an exact continuation of the Dutton-Yellowstone Ranch story.

“The series is a heartfelt study of grief and human connection following a New York City family in the Madison River valley of central Montana,” Paramount said in the press release.

“Michelle Pfeiffer is a remarkable talent who imbues every role with emotional depth, authenticity and grace,” said Chris McCarthy, Paramount Global co-CEO and president/CEO of Showtime & MTV Entertainment Studios. “She is the perfect anchor to the newest chapter of the [“Yellowstone”] universe, [“Madison”], from the brilliant mind of Taylor Sheridan.” (RELATED: Cody Johnson Claims He’s In Movie Talks With Taylor Sheridan)

The series, like all Sheridan shows, is brought to us by Paramount+, MTV Entertainment Studios and Sheridan’s Bosque Ranch Productions.

There are no other updates on who will be joining Pfeiffer on screen other than rumors around Patrick J. Adams and Kurt Russell.

It also appears Matthew McConaughey’s dreams of being part of the “Yellowstone” universe may be on hold. He apparently asked for an insane amount of money to be part of the series, which was probably (and rightfully) balked at by Sheridan and his team."
Michelle Pfeiffer will officially star in ‘Yellowstone’ sequel series.,https://www.joblo.com/madison-michelle-pfeiffer/,"Today, MTV Entertainment Studios and 101 Studios announced that Oscar nominee Michelle Pfeiffer will executive produce and star in The Madison, the latest addition to Taylor Sheridan’s Yellowstone universe. According to today’s official press release, the series is a heartfelt study of grief and human connection following a New York City family in the Madison River valley of central Montana.

“Michelle Pfeiffer is a remarkable talent who imbues every role with emotional depth, authenticity and grace,” said Chris McCarthy, Paramount Global Co-CEO and President/CEO, Showtime & MTV Entertainment Studios. “She is the perfect anchor to the newest chapter of the Yellowstone universe, The Madison, from the brilliant mind of Taylor Sheridan.”

Lighting up screens for more than three decades, Michelle Pfeiffer is a legend. Her role as Elvira Hancock in Brian De Palma’s Scarface cemented her as a star destined to burn bright within the entertainment industry. For many of us, her parts in titles like The Witches of Eastwick, Married to the Mob, Dangerous Liaisons, The Fabulous Baker Boys, Batman Returns, and Dangerous Minds made her untouchable.

Her silver screen appearances slowed in the 2000s, though she still made time to contribute to What Lies Beneath, Stardust, Dark Shadows, Mother!, and Murder on the Orient Express. She joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe in 2018 as Janey Van Dyne, reprising the role in 2019 for Avengers: Endgame and in 2023 for Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.

Despite Yellowstone’s end later this year, Taylor Sheridan continues to expand the rough-and-tumble universe through multiple spinoffs. In addition to Yellowstone, Sheridan’s world expands to 1923, 1944, 2024, and 6666. He’s also got the standalone series Lawmen: Bass Reeves and Tulsa King, starring Sylvester Stallone as Dwight “The General” Manfredi, a New York mafia capo. After he’s released from prison, his boss unceremoniously exiles him to set up shop in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Realizing that his mob family may not have his best interests in mind, Dwight slowly builds a crew from a group of unlikely characters to help him establish a new criminal empire in a place that might as well be another planet.

Rumors have been circulating for some time about a planned ""Yellowstone"" sequel series. The show, which has so far starred Hollywood star Kevin Costner (69) in the lead role, will conclude with the second half of the fifth season later this year. The follow-up project, which was initially known under the working title ""2024"", is now taking shape. As reported by the US industry magazine ""Variety"", screen legend Michelle Pfeiffer (66) will take on the lead role.**

""Yellowstone"" successor ""The Madison"" is coming

The title of the new series, which is set in the present and is likely to chronologically continue where ""Yellowstone"" left off, has also been revealed. It is called: ""The Madison"". Pfeiffer plays a New Yorker who moves to the rural US state of Montana with her family. They settle in the Madison River valley in central Montana. According to Paramount, which is behind the production, ""The Madison"" offers an honest look at ""grief and human connection"".

With the now officially confirmed casting of Pfeiffer and the revelation of the series title, there are finally concrete details about the ""Yellowstone"" successor.

Adams (42) have also been circulating for the series cast. It remains to be seen if they will also be officially confirmed in the coming days.

The neo-Western show ""Yellowstone"" was one of the most successful drama series on US TV in recent years. The production by series creator Taylor Sheridan (54), a former actor who has since turned to screenwriting, has already spawned two spin-offs. ""1883"" is set in the year of its title and follows a wagon train of settlers. In ""1923"", it's about another generation of the Dutton family, who in the 1920s, among other things, fight against Prohibition and the economic decline of the country.

The highly anticipated ""Yellowstone"" sequel series, titled ""The Madison,"" will feature Michelle Pfeiffer in the lead role. Her character, a New Yorker, moves to Montana with her family and settles in the Madison River valley. (From the text)

Initially, there were rumors that Matthew McConaughey could star in the ""Yellowstone"" sequel, but more recently, the names of Kurt Russell and ""Suits"" actor Patrick J. Adams have been circulating for the series cast. (Draws from the last part of the text)

Sadie Sink found her voice thanks to ‘Stranger Things’.,https://variety.com/2024/tv/features/sadie-sink-stranger-things-taylor-swift-singing-1236096387/,"When Sadie Sink was 11 years old, she started having panic attacks. After acting professionally for three years, she was starring in a Broadway revival of “Annie,” which she’d been loving. “And then it just flipped,” she says. “Singing became the worst thing ever. I was terrified by it.”

Turns out, the unyielding pressure of a Broadway show had Sink convinced that a single wrong note or flubbed line — anything less than absolute perfection — meant the show was ruined. “I didn’t want to sing ever again.”

So she gave it up.

Two years later, Sink was back on Broadway, in the Peter Morgan drama “The Audience” as a young Queen Elizabeth II opposite Helen Mirren. The part did not involve singing, but on the first night of previews, Sink felt the old panic bubbling up. She didn’t want to go out on the stage.

Popular on Variety

“But then I told myself, ‘Sadie, if you don’t do this, what else do you have?’ The anxiety had already taken singing from me. If acting was gone, then it’s just all gone.”

That night was the first time she pushed through the panic.

Sink, now 22, has spent her career playing characters who also confront, often quite literally, the source of their dread — characters like the headstrong Max on “Stranger Things” to the antisocial Ellie in “The Whale” to the wide-eyed young heroine of Taylor Swift’s “All Too Well: The Short Film.” Her ability to effortlessly conjure the darker and more difficult emotional complexities of adolescence is uncanny.

“She has always felt very raw and real and unlike most actors in terms of how she shows her vulnerabilities,” says Matt Duffer, who created and executive produces “Stranger Things” with his brother, Ross. “There are some actors who hit a few notes really, really well, but they kind of hit just those notes. Sadie is increasingly able to hit these very subtle, nuanced notes. That’s pretty rare.”

Sink joined “Stranger Things” in Season 2, when she was 14, but her character really blew up in Season 4, after the series’ main villain targets Max for a gruesome death that the rest of the cast spends all season trying to prevent. They succeed, but only just: Max is left blind and in a coma. It’s a stunning, heartbreaking character arc that captivated audiences worldwide, so much so that Kate Bush’s ’80s hit “Running Up That Hill,” which Max plays on repeat before she’s felled, became the song of the summer of 2022.

Matthew Sprout for Variety

Seated in a sunny café near her home in Atlanta, where she’s been filming the final season of “Stranger Things,” Sink says she had no idea audiences would have so much love for Max. “I really didn’t think people would care all that much about her journey,” she says with a good-natured shrug. Sink doesn’t have social media on her phone, so one of her older brothers had to show her how much Max was dominating his TikTok feed to convince her that people, did, in fact, care. “Still, I was kind of like, ‘That’s cool,’” she says.

She still hasn’t really absorbed just how massive an impact Max made. “I think I’m definitely numb to a lot of things now, which is a good thing. I think it keeps you stable.” In contrast to the tempestuous roles she often plays, Sink’s default expression is an amiable smile. She can be charming and engaging, and in conversation, she listens with a self-assured stillness. Unlike many young performers, she doesn’t project a need to be liked.

That hasn’t always been the case. As a child actor, she got accustomed to adults treating her “like a puppet,” telling her how to move her face and body in the most minute terms. “Whereas when you’re an adult, it becomes more of a discussion,” she says.

That transition began in earnest for Sink when she joined the cast of “The Whale,” the 2022 indie film that won Brendan Fraser an Oscar for his performance as a 600-pound gay man desperate to reconnect with his estranged daughter. Sink, 18 at the time, was drawn to the challenge of summoning the vindictive rage her character feels towards her father while still maintaining some amount of compassion for her character. But at first, Sink slipped back into people-pleasing, anxious that she wasn’t fulfilling the vision of the film’s director, Darren Aronofsky.

Instead, Aronofsky engaged Sink as an equal, encouraging her to focus on what she could bring to the role rather than trying to figure out how to please him. “It was very clear to me that she was an artist, that she cared about the work,” Aronofsky says. “I’ve got to credit Sadie with a lot of it. I don’t really remember having to spell out that much to her. I think she really got it off the page.”

Sink says that the experience of making “The Whale” “kind of changed everything for me.” But how that change is manifesting in her life is only now becoming clear to her. When she’s asked about where she accessed the raw anger that fuels so many of her characters, her eyes jump around as she answers, as if she’s working it out for herself in real time.

“I had this wall up before,” she says, twirling her braided pigtails around her fingers. “In my everyday life, I really suppress most emotions. Weirdly, when I’m acting, that’s when any anger or sadness that I have can just explode. That’s its moment.”

Just a few months after shooting “The Whale,” Sink had a chance to put her newfound sense of creative liberation to the test, when Taylor Swift cast her in “All Too Well” as, essentially, a 20-year-old Swift when she was dating Jake Gyllenhaal.

“At that point, I had never been in love,” Sink says. “I had never been through a breakup that intense. It was all foreign territory for me. I had to rely on just my years of research as a Swiftie.”

And yet, like so many Swift fans, Sink wound up connecting to herself in a profound way. For the scene, set to Swift’s most iconic lyric from the song — “And you call me up again just to break me like a promise” — Sink is curled up on her bed sobbing while her phone lights up nearby.

Matthew Sprout for Variety

As an actor, she’d always focused on her character’s circumstances rather than her own experiences to find the emotion in the scene. “But as I was going, things from my personal life kind of came forward, which fueled it even more,” she says. “Then I was like, ‘Whoa. Maybe I should do some work on Sadie in these areas.’”

She doesn’t elaborate, except to say that she’s dropped “All Too Well” from her “wind down song” rotation while making “Stranger Things.” “It holds this incredibly nostalgic feeling for me now that I feel physically in my body,” she says, wrapping her arms around herself. “It’s too intense.”

Shooting Season 5 of “Stranger Things” has been its own exercise in nostalgia. The cast has been living in the same Atlanta neighborhood so they can better hang out with each other in off-hours to soak up their final months together. What Sink is doing in those months, meanwhile, has been a source of great interest for fans of the show. When asked whether the fact that Sink is still shooting is proof that Max makes it out of the coma, Sink offers a single, cryptic clue. “They love having me run,” she says. Whether that means in real life, the Upside Down or the Void is left, for now, to the imagination. “That’s all I’ll say,” she says.

The Duffer Brothers are similarly circumspect when pressed about Sink’s participation in Season 5. “She’s going to play a part in the season,” says Matt Duffer.

“But we don’t want to reveal how that’s possible,” Ross Duffer adds.

“Right, because she’s in a coma,” Matt says. But while praising Sink’s acting chops, Matt does divulge his own tantalizing hint at what’s to come. “I think she’s grown just more confident as an actor and in her choices,” he says. “We did film a scene the other day with her that was just absolutely heartbreaking. I don’t know how she hits those notes.”

Sink likens growing up on “Stranger Things” to “the best training in the world,” but she also affectionately compares the show to “a machine.” The elaborate production and sprawling cast mean Sink has a great deal of downtime punctuated by periods on set that can be bracingly intense. “I’ve been working all of last week, and I’m like, ‘Oh my God, I forgot how hard this show is,’” she says with a laugh. “You’re a team player here. It’s not about me. It’s not about anyone. It’s about the show and what’s best for it.”

As fulfilling as playing Max has been for Sink, she understands enough about herself now to know that she’s not keen to join another Hollywood machine any time soon. “I don’t want to play a superhero or a princess,” she says. “I just want to make sure everything that I’m doing is different than the last. I’m still young, and I’m still learning.”

She’s even ready to push past her profound fear of singing in front of anyone other than her closest friends and family. In early 2023, she signed up to play the title role in Searchlight’s 2025 feature “O’Dessa,” an ambitious indie from writer-director Geremy Jasper (“Patti Cake$”) about a farm girl who leaves home for a postapocalyptic metropolis to find a family heirloom. Most crucially for Sink, it’s also a rock opera — which means she had to sing professionally, almost every day, for the first time since she was 11.

“There was this moment where I was just like, ‘Oh my God. I can’t believe I said yes to this. Fuck. What am I doing?!’” she says, her eyes going so wide, it’s clear she’s still shocked she did it.

At first, singing in front of strangers was indeed still excruciating. “I would sing a song, and no one else would really know that I’m freaking out on the inside, but in my own head, it’s like, ‘Oh, that’s not my voice. That’s not how I can sing this song,’” she says.

But eventually that inner monologue began to fade. “Not always,” Sink is quick to say. “There were some days where it was harder than others. But sometimes, it was like, ‘I feel completely fearless right now, and I’m singing in front of a lot of people!’”

The trick? “She was singing; it wasn’t me,” she says about her character. As long as she was playing a part, she didn’t need to be perfect. “That, I feel comfortable with. But Sadie is not going to be singing anytime soon.”

Sadie Sink found her voice thanks to ‘Stranger Things’.,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/taylor-swift-fans-sing-vienna-195802789.html,"Earlier this week, Kristi Hovington and her family made the trip from their current home of Barcelona to celebrate their daughter’s 14th birthday with what promised to be an unforgettable night at one of Taylor Swift’s “Eras Tour” shows in Vienna. Only, after a planned terrorist attack resulted in the arrest of two local teenagers and the subsequent cancellation of Swift’s three Austrian concerts, it ended in wasted airfare, sunk hotel costs and, of course, crushed dreams.

“Obviously, she was devastated when we heard the news last night,” Hovington tells Variety of her daughter, who’s an aspiring singer-songwriter. Hovington, an educator and a school librarian, was there with her partner, her daughter and her other two children. “There were a lot of tears shed in the hotel that we’re at. [Vienna] is almost entirely comprised of people from all over the world who came for the concert.”

More from Variety

Hovington, a native of Atlanta, Georgia, was one of the tens of thousands of attendees who descended upon the European city to witness the Eras tour, which has just five more dates slated for London next week before completing its overseas run. After news struck yesterday that the terrorist attack was thwarted and local promoter Barracuda Music canceled the performances, the streets of Vienna became something of a vigil for the Swifties who came together to mourn the loss — not just of the shows, but also the time and money spent to get there.

My friend is in Vienna and sent me this video of swifties coming together this morning and I’m fully sobbing 😭🫶🏻 @taylornation13 @taylorswift13 #WeLoveYouTaylor #ViennaTStheErasTour pic.twitter.com/B4ZAXy5AvD — elizabeth 🪩 (student at ttpd) (@cateyeswift13) August 8, 2024

But the cancellations also had an unexpected effect, unifying those Swifties in a time of danger and uncertainty. Fans filled the streets in photos and videos posted on social media, and local churches and business came out in support of the Vienna Swifties.

On social media, attendees documented chalk drawings on the pavement outside of the stadium where Swift was slated to perform that referenced Swift lyrics: “Fuck the patriarchy (and terrorists),” “This is why we can’t have nice things.”

In front of the stadium 🫶🏻💔 #ViennaTStheErasTour pic.twitter.com/SCnhFxkFX0 — Alina 🤍🔜 eras vienna (@alinalovestay) August 8, 2024

Photos and videos showed fans congregating on Vienna’s Corneliusgasse due to its similarity to “Cornelia Street,” Swift’s song that was included on 2019’s “Lover.” Throngs of people rallied together to sing “Cruel Summer,” an ironic nod to their current situation. One couple even got engaged on the streets while the crowd belted out “Love Story.”

“This [is] happening right now in Cornelia Street,” wrote one on X. “We create our own safe spaces you stupid spider boys can’t destroy.”

Local establishments came out in support of Swifties. “My daughter heard a Taylor Swift song playing in the street, and she just stopped,” says Hovington. “There was this sign outside of this building. We didn’t realize it was a church, but there was a sign that said, ‘Dear Swifties, we sympathize with you. You’re welcome to come and sing your sadness away.'”

thank you lovely church in #vienna that played Taylor swift songs the day of the first cancelled concert and gave lots of sad swifties a place to gather. Thanks to the police for keeping us all safe! #ViennaTStheErasTour pic.twitter.com/p9eZeIJaeT — kristi hovington (@kristihov) August 8, 2024

She said they walked in “not knowing what to expect” and saw that the “pews were filled with people crying and singing.” The Eras tour song list was blasting out on the speakers in the church.

“Everybody had their arms around each other,” she continued. “It was just this really beautiful communal moment, just recognizing that we were all obviously sad that we can’t see Taylor and so sad that this horrific thing happened, targeting mostly women and girls at a concert. But the Swifties are very resilient, and people just got on about their day and were kind and swapping friendship bracelets and singing songs anyway.”

Another attendee, Josie Martin, shared her own experience with Variety about her trip to Vienna. A 28-year-old elementary school teacher from Grand Rapids, Mich., she made plans over a year ago to attend the concert with her family. Her brother, who lives in Madagascar, miraculously secured a VIP ticket code off of Reddit last year, and they coordinated a European family vacation, complete with a stop at the Eras Tour.

After hearing news of the cancellations while in Vienna, she and her family found fans singing together in the streets. “Walking around was kind of adorable,” she says. “I’m an elementary teacher, so it was kind of adorable seeing all these young girls, but then also the juxtaposition of their parents figuring out accommodations is so sad. They’re trying to pivot and be positive and take them around town. They’re all exchanging bracelets on the street, which is adorable. When we heard all the singing, my mom was like, ‘Do you think people are protesting?’ I was like, ‘No, they’re literally singing “You Belong With Me.'”

Despite the canceled concert and thwarted terrorist plot, people were “trying to stay positive.”

“When we were walking around St. Stephen’s Cathedral, there were people in their outfits. Like, you know they picked that out for tonight because they’re wearing poofy, sparkly dresses. This is their one outfit they probably brought, or they just wanted to wear it so they could wear it. That was cute but kind of sad.”

With a potential tragedy prevented, Swifties showed out and proved their loyalty – not only to Swift, but to each other. The hashtag #ViennaTStheErasTour continues to trend across social media apps with spectators from all over the globe chiming in with words of encouragement for the disappointed fans.

“We may not have gotten to hear ‘August’ live in August like we thought, but we still got to sing it together,” one fan wrote on X. “This healed something in me. Swifties are so beautiful. I will never forget this.”

'Unstoppable' movie First-Look Photos Unveiled By Amazon MGM Studios.,https://marketresearchtelecast.com/jennifer-lopez-unveils-sneak-peek-of-new-movie-with-ben-affleck-amid-marital-woes/,"Talk about awkward timing.

The first look at Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck’s new movie, “Unstoppable,” debuted on Thursday. This comes as the couple is reportedly living apart and working through the details of their impending divorce.

Amazon MGM Studios released some images of the upcoming film, which is set to premiere at the Toronto Film Festival in September.

Lopez, 55, stars as one of the leads in “Unstoppable,” while Affleck, 51, produced it through Artists Equity, the production company he co-founded with Matt Damon.

“Unstoppable” is based on the true story of wrestler Anthony Robles, who won the 2011 NCAA individual national championship despite being born with one leg.

In the film, Lopez portrays Robles’ mother, Judy, while Jharrel Jerome stars as Anthony Robles.

The cast also features Bobby Cannavale as Robles’ father, Rick, along with Michael Peña and Don Cheadle.

In one of the first-look images revealed by Vanity Fair, Lopez is seen wrapping her arm around Jerome’s neck, kissing his forehead. Lopez then shared this image on her Instagram Story, tagging Amazon MGM Studios and producer Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas, but made no mention of Affleck or his production company.

Director William Goldenberg, in an interview with Vanity Fair, clarified that Lopez’s role was not secured because of her marriage to Affleck. He emphasized, “She had to be somebody who’s lived a life, and I felt like Jennifer was one of the few actresses who could play the part. I think that she was right for it, and it was also serendipity that he happened to be married to the person we sort of wanted all along anyway.”

Robles, now 36, praised Lopez for her dedication, noting that she spent hours conversing with his mom to prepare for the role. He shared, “She really made us feel comfortable and safe.”

“Unstoppable” marks Lopez and Affleck’s second film collaboration since their marriage in 2022. Their first project together was “This Is Me…Now: A Love Story,” a musical film released in February.

Affleck previously expressed his excitement about working with Lopez on “Unstoppable”. He told CBS News, “What fun, what a joy to do something with her, see her be great, go to work with your wife, go to work with your best friend.”

Affleck humorously added, “Can’t make it look like she’s doing it as a favor to me, but actually, she is.”

Despite their professional collaboration, rumors of a divorce after two years of marriage cloud the personal lives of ‘Bennifer’. Although not officially confirmed, tensions have been evident since May, with Affleck reportedly staying at a separate residence.

Recently, the couple listed their $60 million Beverly Hills mansion and Affleck has purchased a separate $20.5 million home in Los Angeles.

Adding to the speculation, the pair did not spend their second wedding anniversary or Lopez’s 55th birthday together last month. According to TMZ, Affleck and Lopez are not in direct contact, leaving their business managers to finalize the details of their divorce.

A source informed People that “They’re moving on separately. Jennifer is trying to find a new home to start fresh.” The insider also mentioned that Lopez “is having a good summer” and focusing on “what’s next” in her life and career.

Colin Farrell opens up about his son with Angelman syndrome: ‘We still struggle.’’,https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/aug/08/colin-farrell-son-angelman-syndrome,"In a new interview, Colin Farrell opened up about his son who has a rare neurological condition called Angelman syndrome, and announced that he is launching a foundation to support people with intellectual disabilities.

Farrell’s son, James, who is now 20 years old, was diagnosed with Angelman syndrome when he was a two and a half years old, the Irish actor said in an exclusive interview with People Magazine released on Wednesday. He said his son was previously misdiagnosed with cerebral palsy, which shares many of the same characteristics.

This is the first time Farrell has spoken about his son and his son’s condition, the actor told People, adding that “the only reason I’m speaking is I can’t ask James if he wants to”.

The actor elaborated: “I mean, I can. I speak to James as if he’s 20 and [he] has perfect fluency with the English language and age-appropriate cognitive ability. But I can’t discern a particular answer from him as to whether he’s comfortable with all this or not, so I have to make a call based on knowing James’s spirit and what kind of young man he is and the goodness that he has in his heart.”

Angelman is a seizure condition, Farrell said, adding that the seizures are “one of the things that parents struggle with greatly”.

“Thankfully, James hasn’t had a breakthrough seizure now in about 10 or 11 years, but I’ve been in the back of ambulances, I’ve been in the hospital with him,” Farrell said.

In the interview, Farrell said that many families struggle with finding support and help when it comes to caring for their child with intellectual disabilities, especially as in some states across the country, many social supports that exist end when they reach 21.

“I obviously have a certain among of means, having had a career in film for 20-plus years now and we still struggle with finding the kind of support that James deserves, and should rightfully have,” Farrell said.

If his son could communicate verbally about his new public effort and that doing this could help families and other children, Farrell claimed that he would say, “‘Dad, what are you talking about? Why are you even asking me? It’s a no-brainer.’

“So that’s why we’re doing it. This is all because of James, it’s all in his honor.”

Theactor said that caring for James and watching his son grow up has given him the ability to “look at the human being and the human body and life as a marvel, because I see how much he struggles with things that I’d never have given a second thought to, that many of us take for granted”.

“I want the world to be kind to James,” Farrell said. “I want the world to treat him with kindness and respect.”

Farrell set up his foundation to do something in the realm of providing “greater opportunities for families who have a child with special needs, to receive the support that they deserve – basically assistance in all areas of life”, he said.

On the foundation’s website, it states that the California-based organization is focused on housing, day programs, workforce support and advocacy to create lasting change for individuals with intellectual disability."

“Once your child turns 21, they’re kind of on their own,” Farrell says. “All the safeguards that are put in place, special ed classes, that all goes away, so you’re left with a young adult who should be an integrated part of our modern society and more often than not is left behind.”

""They wear out every 7 years or so because he's in it 17 hours a day,"" they continued. ""We found that after 16, the charities and services just aren't interested anymore when you haven't got a 'cute kid.' Life is hard. Thank you for trying to help over 16's disabled people.""

Colin Farrell opened up about his 20-year-old son James’ struggles with Angelman syndrome in People interview. “I want the world to be kind to James,” the actor said of his son, who is non-verbal. “I want the world to treat him with kindness and respect.” He has now launched the Colin Farrell Foundation to support families with adult children living with intellectual disabilities as they navigate challenges when the support systems for special needs end at 21.

“Once your child turns 21, they’re kind of on their own,” Farrell says. “All the safeguards that are put in place, special ed classes, that all goes away.” He hopes to provide advocacy, education, and programs to improve the lives of families with similar experiences.

James is Farrell's child with his ex-partner, model Kim Bordenave.

In an interview with People magazine, Farrell mentioned that his son is approaching 21 and having this syndrome will make it challenging for him to integrate into society.

Farrell, who shared details about his and ex-partner Kim Bordenave’s 21-year-old son to promote his new foundation aimed at supporting people with intellectual disabilities, revealed that James was initially diagnosed with cerebral palsy at age 1 and also had many symptoms similar to Angelman syndrome.

“As a toddler, James was really checked out due to his inability to sit up or crawl,” said Farrell. He received an accurate diagnosis of the rare neurogenetic disorder when he was 2. Farrell affirmed that James and other individuals like him deserve greater individuality, autonomy in their lives, and a stronger sense of community.

“I want the world to be kind with James. I want the world to treat him with kindness and respect,” Farrell added.

What is Angelman Syndrome?

Angelman syndrome is an uncommon and intricate neurodevelopmental disorder that predominantly impacts the nervous system. It arises from abnormalities in a specific gene known as UBE3A.

The nervous system acts as your body's control centre, stemming from the brain and regulates your movements, thoughts, behaviours, and automatic reactions to your environment. Although Angelman syndrome is rare, it can occur in any fetus. Most cases are due to a spontaneous gene mutation, indicating that the condition is not inherited from biological parents. It affects both males and females equally.

There is no cure for Angelman syndrome at present. Research is exploring treatments aimed at specific genes. Currently, treatment is centred on managing symptoms and addressing developmental delays in children affected by Angelman syndrome."
Colin Farrell opens up about his son with Angelman syndrome: ‘We still struggle.’’,https://www.sheknows.com/health-and-wellness/articles/3078495/colin-farrell-son-james-angelman-syndrome/,"Colin Farrell is giving fans a look into how he cares for his 20-year-old son, James, who has a rare neuro-genetic disorder called Angelman Syndrome.

In a People cover story and video feature, Farrell opened up about James’ symptoms and diagnosis as well as what life is like for him now as a young adult — and how his son has inspired him to start the Colin Farrell Foundation, launched this month, to help people with disabilities and their families.

“I’m proud of him every day,” Farrell said of James. “I just think he’s magic.” Related story Chrissy Teigen ‘Competes’ Against Her Daughters Luna & Esti to be a Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader in the Cutest New Video

The first signs of James’ condition came early on, although Farrell said he didn’t initially recognize them for what they were. As a baby, he was very quiet, which Farrell thought meant he’d “hit the lottery: I have a chill child who’s not gonna keep me up at night!”

As James got older, he wasn’t hitting language or movement benchmarks typical of babies his age, including the ability to sit up on his own or crawl. “We knew that something was up, [like] developmental delays,” Farrell said.

James, whom Farrell shares with ex Kim Bordenave, was initially diagnosed with cerebral palsy at age one — a “common misdiagnosis” at the time, Farrell says. A year later, though, a pediatric neurologist noticed other telltale symptoms, like frequent outbursts of laughter. Blood testing confirmed that James had Angelman syndrome, which is caused by the UBE3A gene not functioning normally, according to the Angelman Syndrome Foundation. Related story Chrissy Teigen ‘Competes’ Against Her Daughters Luna & Esti to be a Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader in the Cutest New Video

Other symptoms of the condition include developmental delays, sleep problems, lack of speech, and seizures, which James also experienced. “I’ve been in the back of ambulances, I’ve been in the hospital with him,” Farrell said. “Thankfully he hasn’t had one in 10 or 11 years.” His current symptoms, Farrell says, include being nonverbal and some struggles with “balance [and a] jerky gait.”

When James will turn 21 in September, Farrell said he’ll age out of many support systems that are fundamental for families of kids with disabilities. “Once your child turns 21, they’re kind of on their own,” he explained. “All the safeguards that are put in place, special ed classes, that all goes away, so you’re left with a young adult who should be an integrated part of our modern society and more often than not is left behind.” (It was likely with similar concerns in mind that Farrell and Bordenave petitioned to be James’ co-conservators in 2021.)

Now, Farrell hopes to make a difference through the Colin Farrell Foundation. “For years I’ve wanted to do something in the realm of providing greater opportunities for families who have a child with special needs to receive the support that they deserve… and basically the assistance in all areas of life,” Farrell explained. “I obviously have a certain amount of means, having had a career in film for 20-plus years now, and we still struggle with finding the kind of support that James deserves.”

According to its website, the Foundation will look to address the “lack of affordable and accessible community-based housing and day programs” for those with intellectual disabilities, increase wages for paid caregivers, increase funding for disability-focused Medicaid programs, and establish a camp for those with intellectual disabilities and their families to relax and spend time together.

It’s an ambitious endeavor, but one Farrell clearly believes in deeply, “It’s all because of James. It’s all in James’ honor,” he said. “This is the first time I’ve spoken about it, and obviously the only reason I’m speaking is I can’t ask James if he wants to do this. I mean, I can. I speak to James as if he’s 20 and has perfect fluency with the English language and age-appropriate cognitive ability. But I can’t discern a particular answer from him as to whether he’s comfortable with all this or not, so I have to make a call based on knowing James’s spirit and what kind of young man he is and the goodness that he has in his heart.”

It’s the first time Farrell has talked extensively about James’ life and condition, though he has been a supporter of the disability community for decades. “The struggles of a child with special needs can be so brutal that they can tear at the very fabric of your heart, but the love shared and the pure strength and heroism observed is the needle and thread that mends all tears,” he told Today at an annual summit and gala for Angelman syndrome research in Chicago hosted by the Foundation for Angelman Syndrome Therapeutics in 2017. He also walked with athletes in the Special Olympics when they were held in Ireland in 2003, per the CFF website.

Still, Farrell is “very private” about his family life and understandably protective of James. “I want the world to be kind to James,” he told People. “I want the world to treat him with kindness and respect.”

He made the decision to open up about their lives as a way to promote the Foundation — and hopefully improve the lives and futures of adults with intellectual disabilities like James. Farrell said, “I choose to believe that if James knew that doing this could help families and could help other children and young adults who live with special needs, James would say, ‘Dad, what are you talking about? Why are you even asking me? It’s a no-brainer.'”

Colin Farrell opens up about his son with Angelman syndrome: ‘We still struggle.’’,https://www.comingsoon.net/guides/features/1826551-what-is-angelman-syndrome-colin-farrell-son,"Colin Farrell has typically been very private about his home life, but now he’s opening up about his experience having a child with Angelman syndrome. Despite being relatively common, affecting 1 in 12,000 to 20,000 people, the disorder receives very little publicity, leaving most of us in the dark about what it is and how it affects those who live with it. Fortunately, Farrell decided that the best thing for his son James and those like him is to shine a light on the difficulties and unique challenges surrounding Angelman syndrome.

What is Angelman syndrome, and how does it affect Colin Farrell’s son, James?

In an exclusive interview with People, Colin Farrell opened up about life with his son James, who has Angelman syndrome. James was diagnosed with a neurogenetic disorder when he was a toddler, and now, at 20, he still struggles to find the support he deserves.

Angelman syndrome is caused by a mutation or deletion of the UBE3A gene on Chromosome 15. It affects all aspects of life, and symptoms are widespread:

Symptoms encountered in all people living with Angelman syndrome are:

Severe developmental delay.

Speech impairment: minimal or no use of words.

Movement or balance disorders which can include tremulous movement or ataxia of gait.

Atypically positive behavior: Frequent laughter and smiles. Happy demeanor. Easily excitable, often expressed with hand flapping.

Hypermotoric behavior

Short attention span

Frequently, those living with Angelman syndrome also display these symptoms:

Abnormal EEG

Microcephaly

Seizures

Finally, these symptoms may occur more infrequently:

Digestive disorders, including GERD and constipation

Drooling

Fascination and attraction to water

Flat back of head

Flexed and uplifted arms when walking

Hyperactive tendon reflexes

Hypopigmented eyes and skin

Increased heat sensitivity.

Prominent mandible

Problems feeding during infancy

Sleep disturbances

Smooth palms

Strabismus

Tongue thrusting along with swallowing disorders

Wide mouth with wide-spaced teeth

Despite the numerous negative symptoms, those with Angelman syndrome have a normal life expectency. While that’s wonderful, it also presents a major challenge. According to Farrell, when James turns 21 this year, he will age out of many available support programs. Unfortunately, this leads to many special needs adults being left behind by society, which can be disastrous for people like James, who require life-long care.

Thankfully, Colin Farrell has created a foundation to support adults with intellectual disabilities. You can learn more or support the Colin Farrell Foundation on the official website."

The Colin Farrell Foundation aims to provide support for adult children who have intellectual disabilities through advocacy, education, and innovative programs.

Dublin native Colin has long been an advocate for not only the Angelman community but the wider intellectual disability community - in 2003, he walked with athletes in the Special Olympics World Summer Games in Ireland and has since become a passionate spokesperson, supporter, and advocate for the athletes and the organization.

His newly launched Foundation says: ""Inspired by his two sons, Colin is excited and deeply humbled by the hope that the Colin Farrell Foundation can help those who the larger systems of governance have neglected.""

In a recent interview from his home in Los Angeles, Colin told People that he is privileged to be able to provide in-home care for James, his son who is about to turn 21 whom he shares with Kim Bordenave.

He went on to explain his reasoning for launching his new Foundation: ""For years, I've wanted to do something in the realm of providing greater opportunities for families who have a child with special needs, to receive the support that they deserve, to receive assistance in life - whether it's in education, whether it's in intervention, therapeutics, social environment that the child can feel that they belong within - and just so that families who have a child with special needs can find a world of meaning and a life of connection for their children.

""I, obviously, have a certain amount of means having had a career in film for 20-plus years now, and we still struggle in finding the kind of support that James deserves and should rightfully have.""

Colin said there are systems across the country that vary state by state, ""But once your child turns 21, they're kind of on their own.

""All the safeguards that are put in place, all the inclusive programs, special ed classes, that all kind of goes away once your child turns 21.

""So you're left with a young adult who should be an integrated part of our modern society here and very much, more often than not, is left behind and so families struggle.""

Colin said the reason behind establishing his Foundation now is because James is approaching the age of 21 and while he's ""really well-adjusted"" and ""really happy,"" Colin and his family are ""looking toward the rest of his life - what's the next chapter of James's life look like?""

The Irish actor explained how he fears that if something happened to him or James's mother Kim, James would be put into an institute or residential care and that ""there'd be nobody there to call over and to take him out and to have lunch, and all that.

""But there's very, very few places and so I want to change that and I want to be part of the great team that we have behind this Foundation already.""

Colin continued: ""Hopefully over time, over the years, I hope, through funding and through community involvement, we want to take a good look at residential potential for families with young adults who are ready to go out into the world and have a greater sense of community and connection.""

Colin explained that his initial dream was to create a camp, something in the vein of what ""beautiful Paul Newman did"" that would be family-oriented, permitting parents and siblings to get some rest and relaxation.

Building a summer camp, Colin said, will be a part of the Foundation as well.

""That will be a big one for me to leave behind - and it's all because of James, it's all in James's honor.""

James was just a toddler when he was diagnosed with the rare neurogenetic disorder. Now 20, his family still struggles with finding the support that he “deserves and should rightfully have,” Farrell, 48, tells PEOPLE in this week’s issue.

“I want the world to be kind to James. I want the world to treat him with kindness and respect,” the actor says, which has been the driving factor for raising awareness about Angelman syndrome.

“I'm very private,” Farrell tells PEOPLE, calling his home a safe space. “But I choose to believe that, if James knew that doing this could help families and could help other children and young adults who live with special needs, James would say, ‘Dad, what are you talking about?

Angelman syndrome, which affects 1 in 15,000 people, is a rare neurogenetic disorder that stems from a mutation or deletion of a gene in the 15th chromosome, called the ubiquitin protein ligase E3A (UBE3A) gene.

The condition can cause severe developmental delays and is typically first noticed when a baby is not crawling or babbling between 6 and 12 months, according to the Mayo Clinic. It can cause difficulties walking, talking and eating, as well as seizures, balance issues, excessive laughter, sleep troubles, scoliosis and obesity due to limited mobility.

Angelman syndrome shares symptoms and characteristics with other disorders like autism, cerebral palsy and Prader-Willi syndrome, which is why 50% of individuals are originally misdiagnosed, according to the Angelman Syndrome Foundation.

“Angelman syndrome is not easy to get diagnosed,” Paula Evans, CEO of the newly established Colin Farrell Foundation, tells PEOPLE. “It doesn't come up in any prenatal testing, and you have to actually know what you're looking for in order to test for it.”

Children who have the disorder are often not diagnosed until they are between 3 and 7 years old. It's confirmed through a genetic blood test. Once officially diagnosed, early intervention is key.

Although there is no cure for Angelman syndrome, treatment for the condition involves managing symptoms and addressing any developmental delays. This can include anti-seizure medications, physical and occupational therapy, speech therapy, behavioral therapy, sleep training or sleep management medications, and more.

Colin Farrell photographed exclusively for People, with his son James, at his home in Los Angeles, CA, on June 7, 2024. Cliff Watts

For Farrell, doing research and finding a community helped him learn how to best care for his son. James started walking at age 4 and hasn’t had a seizure in a decade. He also feeds himself and is able to communicate and show affection, despite being nonverbal.

“With Angelman syndrome, not every child presents the same,” he says. “It's a broad spectrum of characteristics that come with the condition, but you can start zoning in on your child so that you can treat your child as an individual under the umbrella of wealth of information that's being gathered pertaining to the condition that they may have.”

“Rare disease by its nature means that in your own community, you're probably not going to find somebody that has any shared experience in what you're dealing with,” Evans also notes. “So that sense of community and being able to bond and network and share tips and strategies, it's critical.”

For more of Farrell's exclusive interview, pick up this week's issue of PEOPLE on newsstands Friday.

The life expectancy of people with Angelman syndrome is normal, but individuals with the condition will require life-long care. However, Farrell explains that with James turning 21 in September, he will age out of many of the support systems provided for families with kids who have special needs.

“Once your child turns 21, they’re kind of on their own,” he says. “All the safeguards that are put in place, special ed classes, that all goes away, so you’re left with a young adult who should be an integrated part of our modern society and more often than not is left behind.”

That is, in part, why Farrell is launching the Colin Farrell Foundation to provide support for adult children who have intellectual disabilities through advocacy, education and innovative programs.

The actor has ""for years wanted to do something in the realm of providing greater opportunities for families who have a child with special needs, to receive the support that they deserve, basically the assistance in all areas of life,"" he says.

James, and those like him, have ""earned the right to have a greater degree of individuality and autonomy in life, and a greater degree of community.""

Farrell opened up about his experiences and discussed the effects of the rare neurogenetic disorder James reportedly struggles to overcome each day.

“I want the world to be kind to James,” Farrell told People. “I want the world to treat him with kindness and respect,” he said. James is 20 years old and is non-verbal; when James turns 21, he will age out of the support he requires, according to the outlet. His famous father is determined to make a change, founding The Colin Farrell Foundation to help other families facing this uphill battle.

“This is all because of James — it’s all in his honor,” Farrell said of his new foundation, according to the outlet.

James reportedly has a live-in caregiver to help him through the challenges he faces.

“Angelman syndrome is a condition caused by a change in a gene, called a genetic change,” The Mayo Clinic states. The condition “causes delayed development, problems with speech and balance, mental disability, and, sometimes, seizures.”

Farrell told People his foundation aims to advocate for adult children that require care through education and innovative programs.

“Once your child turns 21, they’re kind of on their own,” Farrell said, according to People.

“All the safeguards that are put in place, special ed classes, that all goes away, so you’re left with a young adult who should be an integrated part of our modern society and more often than not is left behind,” he said.

Colin Farrell has fond and vivid memories of being on the pitch at Croke Park for the opening ceremony of the Special Olympics in 2003.

He proudly led a group of athletes into the stadium as towns and villages across Ireland opened their homes and their hearts to athletes with special needs from all over the world.

“We were at our best,” The Penguin actor recalls now. “The whole country came together. Every pub had a bingo night for a local athlete. Every place was putting on something and members of our society who in the 1950s and 60s were kept at home more – all of a sudden they were the stars of the story. There’s nowhere in the world that I’ve experienced anything like it.”

Colin didn’t know it then, but within a matter of months, he would become the parent of a child with special needs. James was born with Angelman syndrome, a rare condition characterised by developmental delay, problems with speech and balance and, in some cases, seizures.

It means that James’s achievements and the many milestones he has reached have been hard earned and greatly celebrated – and next month, the young man will mark a major birthday.

James is about to turn 21 so Colin is trying to give him independence while also maintaining the necessary care

“He’ll be 21 in September – which is just mad – and he's doing great,” says the actor. “He's cheeky and he's bold and he's bright, and he knows exactly what he wants.

“He’s strong now – he’s six foot. He was always like a beanpole, but he's filled out a bit, got a lovely big Ronnie (moustache) on him. He looks like Tom Selleck! He's brilliant – he's just a gorgeous young man, you know.

""And he's in a really good place, and I'm delighted that he's ready to get out in the world now and begin to be able to spread his wings and be a part of programmes that we (Colin and James’s mother, Kim Bordenave) are trying to figure out.”

James’s parents see him as a young man with his own life who wants to be out and about. But they are aware that this will bring challenges, as James’s condition means that he needs supported care.

“His mother and I are trying to think about the next stage of his life. He has earned autonomy, and he has earned having a greater sense of community and a greater sense of freedom,” says Colin.

“He shows us that, and he loves people, and he wants to be active in the community and all, but there's just very, very little there.”

As the family seeks suitable and supported independent living for James, they have become aware of the dearth of such home care for young adults with intellectual disabilities. Inspired by James and out of a desire to do what he can to better the lives of the many other families facing similar challenges, the actor has decided to establish The Colin Farrell Foundation.

James sporting a 'Ronnie' as he continues to flourish

The newly launched, not-for-profit organisation aims to initiate and promote progressive programmes and policies to improve and enhance the lives of individuals living with any form of intellectual disability. The foundation will also work with other intellectual disability (ID) policy advocates in campaigning for change at US governmental level.

Colin will lead the foundation, managed by a board of directors and an advisory board. They are comprised of highly experienced and successful professionals in various fields. Paula Evans, who previously founded The Foundation for Angelman Syndrome Therapeutics (FAST), will be CEO.

Among the foundation’s goals is to raise awareness of the funding and housing crises affecting the ID community. As well as fundraising and awareness campaigns, the foundation aims to create a respite retreat for people living with any form of ID and their families. It will be called Solas, from the Irish word for light.

The foundation’s work will happen initially in California, where Colin and his family live and work, but his ultimate dream would be to replicate such advocacy and support services across the US and internationally – including in Ireland.

“I've had 20 years to think about the struggles of a child with special needs, since James came into my world,” says Colin. “It's very much been localised for me, of course, personalised. It's very much been about James, about my son.”

Still, the communities he has met through Special Olympics, through FAST, and through his philanthropic work, convinces him that the challenges facing people with ID and their loved ones are universal.

“Mostly, the community that I've been a part of has been the Angelman syndrome community, which is very vocal and very supportive. I've met hundreds of families who care for and love and struggle with trying to find the resources they need. I've met mothers and fathers, grandparents and siblings, and talked to them about their experiences. And I've met the young men and the young women of these families going back 14,15 years now.

Colin is completely besotted with James and wants him to have as complete a life as possible

“I’ve been so blessed doing what I do for a living and having the career that I’ve had over the last 25 years. As you can well imagine, James has benefited a lot from the doctors I can get on the phone easier than most people, from the money I have to pay for certain therapeutic interventions: speech therapists and occupational therapists and physical therapists. And if James needs an iPad for communication, or if he needs a stander to work on his gait, it’s there. I’m that lucky, it’s gotten for him. Yet, I’m finding that James is a young adult now, and his mother and I are trying to think about the next stage of his life.

“I’m 48 and James is 20, and Henry (James’s younger brother) is 14. I have a little bit more space in my own life, in my own head. I feel the career thing, the acting thing, as much as I’m enjoying it and probably loving it more than ever, it’s clear to me that it is incredibly secondary, when I think of how important the present and the future of both my sons are to me,” adds Colin.

“If I have the struggles that I’m having with this kind of stuff, you can imagine a lot of the families I've met. Some of them have an income of 50 grand a year, and they have four children, and two of them have Angelman syndrome. How are they going to be able to provide or find somewhere that's loving and caring and clean and active to allow their young adults to have a rich and meaningful connected to the community life? I realised it was time,” he says of establishing the foundation.

“This is something that means the world to me now.

“I'm blessed to have a bunch of good people on the board. We've a scientist, a lawyer, humanitarians – just really bright, really hungry, decent people whose hearts are in the right place and who want to make a change.”

Like Colin, the foundation’s CEO has lived experience of raising a young adult with an intellectual disability. Paula Evans’s daughter, Ainsley, was born with Angelman syndrome, and she made contact with the Irish actor when he first spoke publicly about how James had special needs.

“We had a lovely chat about our kids. And it wasn't long after that that I started the FAST organisation,” says Paula, adding that the annual event they held in Chicago showed her that many of the issues facing families were universal.

“We grew the community beyond my wildest dreams, because Angelman was rare. Everyone came from all over. They came from all over the world – many from Ireland. Individuals with intellectual disability are facing multiple crises and those are funding, housing, and workforce – it's really those three issues,” she adds.

“Individuals with intellectual disability are stuck home with mom and dad, waiting sometimes decades for services that they could live meaningful, full lives within their communities. We have a broad mission statement and I have no doubt we're going to start tackling this really significant problem.

“I don't think many people are aware of the crises that people with intellectual disability face. So (we are) shining a big light on this, and just raising awareness so that everyday people understand.

“I think there's nobody better suited than Colin to help bring this to the forefront, to raise that awareness. Not only does he walk the walk, he talks the talk, he lives this every day as a child that has intellectual disability, and he knows what the challenges are.

“He can speak about it in such an authentic way to really educate the public as to what the challenges are that these individuals face. He is so passionate about this - I’m excited to see what we're going to be able to do.”

Colin adores James and has finally opened up his family album to the world

Colin has been motivated by the many stories he’s heard of parents who struggle to care for their children and to access the support services they need. “They're constantly advocating on behalf of their child to get what their child justifiably should have in their lives, in the form of education, in the form of community inclusion.”

This is why his plans include Camp Solas, which he named after the Irish word for light. He is establishing it to provide badly needed respite services for people with ID and their families.

“It would be open for families, for parents and siblings of a child with special needs. They would come and the kids would have activities throughout the day. The parents would be able to have their own time and space, because it's very hard.

""Parents of children with special needs don't really go on holidays too much. They certainly wouldn’t go on holidays on their own - of course they bring their children. Whatever joy they may experience on the holiday, whatever craic they have, it's also a lot of work. And so the idea is of giving parents a little bit of respite while the family would go together to the camp.”

The pair have forged an incredible bond

The foundation, he says, will enable fundraising, awareness and conversations about how best to serve the people who avail of its services. But Farrell also has a greater ambition that he hopes could bring about broader and real systemic change.

Among the foundation’s goals is to join other ID policy advocates in campaigning for national US legislators to provide badly needed funding and reform.

“The ultimate goal would be, within a couple of years, to end up in Washington and get a hearing and try and get some money allocated for exactly what we're talking about - not summer camps, but for community centres where parents can bring their young adults, and also for more independent living that will obviously have around-the-clock support and care, and what that's going to look like. So there's loads to do,” he says.

The actor adds that in many countries in the world, it’s those who can’t do for themselves who get short shrift. “It's children who are sick, and it's people later in their years in old age. So much more attention should be placed on making sure that children and those who are older of age, who need more care, get more support.

Colin is trying to ensure James has the fullest life possible now that he is turning 21

“And there's loads of great work, by the way. I'm not splitting the atom here now by saying what I'm saying. There are thousands of people in the world that are fighting for what I'm suggesting here. It's just my time to get in the fight.

“The area of major interest for me, of course, is because of James's birth and what he's meant to me in my life and the community that I've been afforded the opportunity to be a part of that is so loving and so supportive.”

When James was four, Colin first spoke publicly of his son being born with Angelman syndrome. Just a few weeks earlier, James took his first steps unaided, a moment that brought great joy to his family.

“Most kids are walking somewhere around one, one and a half. So what seem like minor steps are huge successes, and we all celebrate each other's successes,” says Colin.

“There's so much chance involved in life. There’s beyond measurable chance that has me talking to you now from a hotel in Macau, doing my third film in the last 12 months, and having all the good fortune that I've had in my life. You couldn't work hard enough to have the fortune that I've had. I love my work, and I apply myself to it as best I can. But it's chance - it’s so much chance.

“The fact that I have a bit of a voice, I want to use it to see if we can promote change and get some systemic change. Work to get some legislative change that will provide greater support for our communities, and not just Angelman syndrome, but communities of all children (with ID) as they grow up to be adults.

“We need to have a world and a place where they are involved and included and have meaningful lives, and it's just harder now for families than it should be. So that's why we're doing this.”

Colin spoke to Esther McCarthy in 2007 to reveal his son's syndrome

When Colin first spoke publicly about James’s Angelman syndrome diagnosis in 2007 – just days after his four-year-old boy had taken his first steps - the actor said he would do whatever he could to help James realise his potential and to be happy.

“It’s like any parent,” he said at that time. “What I want to do for my son is make sure he has the opportunity to reach his own individual potential, and that he’s as happy as can be. I’ll do whatever I can do, stay in his way or get out of his way, to see that realised.”

As James approaches his 21st birthday, his dad reflects on those words. “It’s time to kind of get out of James’s way a little bit, for the first time in my life,” he says.

“I do believe fully, in every cell of my being, that's what he wants, and that's what he's earned, that's what he's worked so hard all these years for in his socialisation and his schooling, his at-home work and physical therapy and occupational therapy. All the stuff he’s had done with his legs and his walking, so he can have a bigger life.”

His lived experiences of raising James and his aspirations for The Colin Farrell Foundation’s work, unsurprisingly, go hand in hand - and the actor is ready to take the next step in advocating for young adults with ID.

“I want to talk about how to help make the lives of our children and young adults with special needs better and to try and see if I can, in any way, help in ensuring that they have opportunities they should have in life.”

Colin Farrell opens up about his son with Angelman syndrome: ‘We still struggle.’’,https://evrimagaci.org/tpg/colin-farrell-launches-foundation-for-son-with-angelman-syndrome-7511,"Colin Farrell Launches Foundation For Son With Angelman Syndrome Actor Colin Farrell creates initiative to advocate for individuals with disabilities and their families

Colin Farrell, known for his substantial contributions to the film industry, is stepping up to raise awareness and support for individuals with intellectual disabilities through the launch of the Colin Farrell Foundation. This initiative is inspired by his personal experience as the father of James, his beloved son who has been diagnosed with Angelman syndrome, a rare neurogenetic disorder.

Farrell recently opened up about his son’s life and their unique struggles during an exclusive interview with People magazine. The actor highlighted the challenges families face as children with disabilities transition to adulthood, especially when they reach the age of 21, where many of the support services suddenly vanish.



""Once your child turns 21, they're kind of on their own,"" Farrell explained, emphasizing how the safety nets like special education programs often disappear, leaving young adults vulnerable. ""All the safeguards… all goes away... More often than not, they're left behind,"" he added, stressing the urgent need for systemic change.

With James set to celebrate his 21st birthday, Farrell's worries extend beyond individual struggles to the broader community of families facing similar dilemmas. He aims to create opportunities for individuals with intellectual disabilities to thrive and advocate for policy changes, particularly around Medicaid and community services, which are critical for those who require support.

The Colin Farrell Foundation will prioritize advocacy, education, and innovative programs to transform lives, especially for adults like his son. It’s not just about providing services but also fostering awareness and kindness within society. “I want the world to be kind to James,” Farrell told People, articulately expressing his aspiration for broader compassion and respect for those living with disabilities.

Angelman syndrome affects one out of every 12,000 to 20,000 individuals, leading to various challenges including delayed development, severe speech impairment, and problems with movement and balance. Seizures are another prevalent occurrence among those affected. Despite these challenges, People living with Angelman syndrome can often have near-normal life expectancy, according to the National Institutes of Health.

Farrell cherishes every milestone achieved by his son, who has shown incredible resilience. James's progress, such as learning to walk just before his fourth birthday, was especially meaningful for the actor, who recalls the fears of being told his son might never walk. Every small victory reinforces Farrell's belief in James's remarkable spirit. ""He's magical,"" he said, highlighting his admiration for his son's determination and joy.

The foundation will also focus on easing the transition between childhood and adulthood for those with disabilities. Farrell hopes to establish supportive communities and small group homes across the country, providing safe spaces for individuals to live and thrive. “I’ve wanted to do something for years to see families who have children with special needs receive the support they deserve,” Farrell expressed, making it clear his initiative is deeply personal.

Farrell's commitment to this cause is not just about celebrating his son’s life but about advocating for systemic changes to serve many families who often feel neglected. By sharing his story, he aspires to shed light on Angelman syndrome and amplify the voices of families affected by similar challenges.

The actor’s advocacy work is particularly timely as it bridges the gap left by government and societal support systems. With his foundation, he aims to inspire others to engage with and support families like his own. Farrell is determined to cultivate communities where people like James are provided with opportunities to achieve autonomy and feel included. This echoes his plea for society to recognize and acknowledge the diversity of abilities.

It is through heartfelt initiatives like the Colin Farrell Foundation, spearheaded by personal narratives and experiences, where real change can begin. By engaging his platform for advocacy, Farrell not only honors his son but also dedicates himself to the greater cause of inclusion, mutual respect, and awareness for all individuals living with disabilities.

By sharing his personal struggles, Colin Farrell brings to the forefront the urgent need for action and compassion toward individuals with intellectual disabilities. His foundation, built on the principles of empathy and support, aims to create a future where no one feels left behind. Farrell’s mission, fueled by love for his son, marks the beginning of significant changes for families across the nation."

The Irish actor held back tears while giving insight into his life with his 20-year-old son, James, and opening up about the Colin Farrell Foundation, which aims to provide support for adult children with intellectual disabilities. Farrell created the foundation in honor of James, whom he shares with his ex, Kim Bordenave.

James was diagnosed with Angelman syndrome, a rare neurogenetic disorder that causes delayed development and problems with movement, balance and speech, per the Mayo Clinic.

“I want the world to be kind to James,” Farrell told People in the interview published on Wednesday. “I want the world to treat him with kindness and respect.”

Taking a moment to gush over his son, the 48-year-old shared that James “has worked so hard all his life, so hard.”

“Repetition, repetition, balance, his jerky gait,” Farrell reflected. “When he started feeding himself for the first time, his face looks like a Jackson Pollock by the end of it. But he gets it in, he feeds himself beautifully. I’m proud of him every day, because I just think he’s magic.”

James turns 21 in September, which was a driving force behind the “Miss Julie” star’s decision to take matters into his own hands.

“Once your child turns 21, they’re kind of on their own,” Farrell explained. “All the safeguards that are put in place, special ed classes, that all goes away, so you’re left with a young adult who should be an integrated part of our modern society and more often than not is left behind.”

Meanwhile, the “Banshees of Inisherin” actor is looking to change that aspect and help young adults with intellectual disabilities receive the care they need through advocacy, education and innovative programs.

“This is the first time I’ve spoken about it, and obviously the only reason I’m speaking is I can’t ask James if he wants to do this,” Farrell confessed.

Giving insight into his communications with his son, the Golden Globe winner continued, “I mean, I can. I speak to James as if he’s 20 and has perfect fluency with the English language and age-appropriate cognitive ability.”

However, when it comes to getting James’ blessing on the project, Farrell, who is also dad to 14-year-old son Henry with ex Alicja Bachleda-Curús, is turning to his gut for the answer.

He added, “But I can’t discern a particular answer from him as to whether he’s comfortable with all this or not, so I have to make a call based on knowing James’s spirit and what kind of young man he is and the goodness that he has in his heart.”

In order to promote his nonprofit, Farrell and the young adult participated in a photo shoot for the outlet, which led the actor to ponder: “If James knew getting his photograph in the back garden with me, which is not my favorite thing to do, if us doing this could help families and other young adults who live with special needs, he would say, ‘Dad, what are you talking about? Why are you even asking me? It’s a no-brainer.’”

“So that’s why we’re doing it,” he noted. “This is all because of James — it’s all in his honor.”

But the star’s idea to start a foundation didn’t come out of left field.

Farrell admitted that for years, he has “wanted to do something in the realm of providing greater opportunities for families who have a child with special needs, to receive the support that they deserve, basically the assistance in all areas of life.”

As the Academy Award nominee put it, his eldest child and those similar to him have “earned the right to have a greater degree of individuality and autonomy on life, and a greater degree of community.”

In 2021, Farrell and Bordenave filed for James’ conservatorship to legally manage his needs once he turned 18.

The documents obtained by Page Six noted that James is “nonverbal, has issues with his fine motor skills and cannot provide for his own health and well-being.”

The paperwork also stated that while their child “lacks the capacity to express his preference over who he would want to serve as his conservator(s),” it is said that “he would choose [his parents] as co-conservators.”

In 2017, Farrell shared a rare insight into being a parent to James.

“The struggles of a child with special needs can be so brutal that they can tear at the very fabric of your heart,” he told Today at the time, “but the love shared and the pure strength and heroism observed is the needle and thread that mends all tears.”"

Colin Farrell is opening up about life with his 20-year-old son who has Angelman syndrome.

The Irish actor is sharing details of James’ life as they prepare for his 21st birthday, a milestone when many government safeguards for people with special needs are cut off.

Farrell is launching a new foundation in James’ honor with the goal of helping families across the country who are struggling with similar care issues for their adult children who have special needs.

Here is what to know about Angelman syndrome and Farrell’s new foundation:

What is Angelman syndrome?

Angelman syndrome (AS) is a rare neuro-genetic disorder that causes developmental delays.

It is caused by a missing or defective UBE3A gene in the 15th chromosome derived from the mother, according to the Angelman syndrome foundation .

The foundation says the disorder occurs in one in 15,000 births, or about 500,000 people worldwide.

Angelman syndrome causes delayed development that becomes noticeable around 6 - 12 months. People with AS also can have problems with speech and balance, mental disability, and, sometimes, seizures.

Angelman syndrome vs. autism

Angelman syndrome shares symptoms and characteristics with other disorders including autism, according to the Angelman syndrome foundation.

Similar traits include developmental delays, verbal issues and repetitive movements.

Hallmarks unique to AS include frequent smiles and outbreaks of laughter.

AS is also a confirmed genetic disorder, while there are many causes of autism .

Colin Farrell son

Actor Colin Farrell shared this month with People Magazine details of his life with 20-year-old son, James, who has Angelman syndrome.

Farrell remembers James as a baby barely making any sounds, and thinking he was just a ""chill, chill"" baby. But when James wasn’t hitting certain benchmarks, they suspected something was wrong.

James was initially diagnosed with cerebral palsy, which Farrell said is a common AS misdiagnosis. A year later, around 3 years old, James got the correct diagnosis.

Farrell said James is an incredibly hard worker and is very determined. James walked just shy of his fourth birthday and is able to complete certain tasks like taking off a T-shirt.

""He gifts me with the ability to look at the human being and the human body and life as a marvel because I see how much he struggles with things that I would’ve never given a second thought to; I would just, like many of us, take for granted,"" Farrell shared with People.

Farrell also credited James with being a big part in his sobriety.

Farrell has a second son, 14-year-old Henry, whom he shares with ""Ondine"" costar Alicja Bachleda-Curús.

James’ mother is Farrell’s ex-girlfriend Kim Bordenave.

Colin Farrell Foundation

In 2024, Farrell launched the Colin Farrell Foundation in honor of James.

The nonprofit provides support for families of adult children who have intellectual disabilities through education, advocacy and innovative programs.

""There are support systems in place across the country and it varies state to state, but once your child turns 21 they’re kind of on their own. All the safeguards that are put in place, all the inclusive programs, special ed classes, that all kind of goes away when your child is 21,"" Farrell told People. ""And so you’re left with a young adult who should be an integrated part of our modern society here and very much, more often than not, is left behind.""

Farrell said working with the foundation will help set in place what the next chapter of James’ life will look like, which is something other families struggle to figure out as well.

The foundation will focus on the lack of affordable and accessible community-based housing and day programs for people living with intellectual disability who require more than minimal daily living support.

Its goal is to create both small group homes, and large-scale communities, with access to meaningful and enriching day programs, across the country.

James was born with Angelman syndrome, a rare condition characterised by developmental delay, problems with speech and balance and, in some cases, seizures.

Colin's son will be turning 21 in September and anticipating the difficulty for adults with intellectual disabilities to gain independence the actor established The Colin Farrell Foundation.

Colin, who shares James with his ex, Canadian model Kim Bordenave, said in a new interview with People Magazine that he wants the ""world to be kind"".

The Irish star shared that James ""has worked so hard all his life, so hard"" at learning repetition and balance, and improving his jerky gait.

The In Bruges actor said: ""When he started feeding himself for the first time, his face looks like a Jackson Pollock by the end of it. But he gets it in, he feeds himself beautifully. I’m proud of him every day, because I just think he’s magic.

""This is the first time I’ve spoken about it and, obviously, the only reason I’m speaking is I can’t ask James if wants to do this.

""I mean, I can. I speak to James as if he’s 20 and has perfect fluency with the English language and age-appropriate cognitive ability.""

He explained that once children with James' cognitive abilities get to 21 much of the support put in place gets stripped away.

Which is what in-part inspired Colin to set up the foundation with the intention of helping others of a similar age.

And while Colin looks forward to his son's milestone birthday he can't help but be aware of the challenges it will bring to James.

He said: "" He has earned autonomy, and he has earned having a greater sense of community and a greater sense of freedom.

""I've had 20 years to think about the struggles of a child with special needs... it's very much been localised for me, of course, personalised. It's very much been about James, about my son.

""James has benefited a lot from the doctors I can get on the phone easier than most people, from the money I have to pay for certain therapeutic interventions.""

He went on: ""Once your child turns 21, they’re kind of on their own.

What is Angelman syndrome? Angelman syndrome is a rare genetic condition which affects the nervous system and causes severe physical and learning disabilities. Children with it have their development delayed when they are between six and 12 months old. Those with the condition have a near-normal life expectancy, but they will need lifelong support. It affects around one in 20,000 births.

This leads to them being unable to sit up unsupported, and they sometimes make babbling noises.

Later, they may not be able to speak at all, or will only be able to say a few words.

Most children with Angelman syndrome are able to communicate through gestures, signs or other methods.

The condition can also make walking difficult because of issues with balance and coordination.

Other physical signs include trembling arms or jerky movements, crossed eyes, a tendency to stick the tongue out, and the legs may also be stiff.

Angelman syndrome can cause children to laugh frequently with little reason, become easily excitable and restless, and can also give them a fascination with water.

They can also have a short attention span, struggle to sleep, and need less sleep than those without the syndrome.

Those with the condition have a near-normal life expectancy, but they will need lifelong support.

The most common cause of Angelman syndrome is when the gene known as UBE3A is either missing or not working properly.

A child usually gets two copies, one from each parent, but only the one from the mother is active. In most cases of Angelman syndrome, the child does not get a copy of the UBE3A gene from its mother, or the gene is not working. This means there is no active copy of the gene in the child's brain.

""All the safeguards that are put in place, special ed classes, that all goes away, so you’re left with a young adult who should be an integrated part of our modern society and more often than not is left behind.""

The Spaceman actor was seen playing with a ball in the garden with James during the photoshoot for People Magazine.

Colin said if James knew the purpose behind the shoot was to help young adults who live with special needs, he would say: ""Dad, what are you talking about? Why are you even asking me? It’s a no-brainer.""

The film star also has another son called Henry, 14, with actress Alicja Bachleda-Curús.

The focus of the foundation will begin in California - where the family live and work and Colin has ambitions to spread their endeavour across the US and ultimately to Ireland.

Advocate for children

Colin will lead the foundation, but be supported by a highly experienced board of directors and CEO.

The foundations CEO is Paula Evans who established FAST - The Foundation for Angelman Syndrome Therapeutics in the States.

Even before having James, Colin was an advocate for children with additional needs as he proudly stood front and centre in Croke Park for the 2003 Special Olympics.

And since then Colin has served as an Ambassador for the Special Olympics, each Olympiad raising money for the event and sometimes - even making an appearance.

FAMILY LIFE

Colin paid tribute to the two as the “loves of his life” in his 2023 Golden Globes acceptance speech.

He said of James, now 19, and 13-year-old Henry: “My kids at home are watching this, James and Henry, the loves of my life. I love you so much.”

Speaking of James and his achievements, he told People in 2013: “Things like walking and talking and eating and feeding himself, all those things that so many of us naturally take for granted because they come so easily, to James, they come somewhat harder.

“Everything he's achieved in his life has come through the presence and the kind of will that is hard work. He's a lot to be inspired by.”

He joked how younger son Henry was left mortified by one of his fashion choices.

He told Ellen DeGeneres: “I didn't know [short shorts are] in now. My youngest son would disagree vehemently with you. Because he's mortified.

“He says, 'Please Dad, do not wear the short shorts.' And I tell him, 'They feel good.' It's not a fashion thing.”

And in 2020, he told of his close bond with the two.

He told Express: “Although I don't know what I'm doing as a parent most of the time, I'm just flying by the seat of my pants. I think that as simple as it sounds, if you are just present and attentive as a parent, and also as cheesy as this sounds open to learning from your child, then that's the best you can do.”

And he said he has “very open and communicative relationships” with them, adding: “But just as I've introduced them to the best aspects of myself, I've also introduced them, just by virtue of regularly interacting with them, to the most traumatised and damaged aspects of myself. They are both of them there for me, like two samurai masters, there to teach me a lot of stuff.”

Colin Farrell, the acclaimed Irish actor, recently opened up to share the unique joys and struggles he experiences as the father of James, his 20-year-old son diagnosed with Angelman Syndrome—a rare neurogenetic disorder. This heartfelt disclosure came amid the announcement of the Colin Farrell Foundation, which aims to provide advocacy and support for adults with intellectual disabilities, highlighting Farrel's intention to raise awareness about the challenges faced by families with similar circumstances.

Angelman Syndrome affects roughly one in 15,000 people globally and is characterized by developmental delays, issues with speech and coordination, and, often, seizures. Individuals with this disorder typically have normal life spans, but many will not be able to live independently nor reach the same milestones as their peers.

For Farrell, the diagnosis was not immediately apparent. He reflected on the early days when James seemed like just the most relaxed baby, failing to hit typical developmental milestones but continuing to bring joy to his family. It wasn't until James reached age two, after observing developmental delays, testing revealed the cause: Angelman Syndrome.

One of the most poignant moments Farrell recounted was when James took his first steps just short of his fourth birthday. He described it as ""profound"" and “magical,” recalling how his heart swelled with pride and joy watching his son make progress against all odds. “To be told he may never walk and then seeing those first steps was overwhelming,” Farrell stated, tears coming to his eyes as he shared this touching memory.

Following this, it became apparent to Farrell how critical it is to advocate for children like James once they enter adulthood. He revealed the harsh reality many families face as their children age out of special education and support systems. “Once your child turns 21, they’re kind of on their own. All the safeguards... go away. You’re left with a young adult who should be integrated but often is left behind,” he lamented. This realization inspired Farrell to create the Colin Farrell Foundation, with initiatives aimed at filling the support gaps for families not only during childhood but continuing through adulthood.

While many children with Angelman Syndrome exhibit cheerful dispositions, they can also struggle significantly with coordination and functional speech. Treatment focuses heavily on managing symptoms through therapy, aiding families to cope effectively with the challenges imposed by such conditions. Despite these struggles, James’ personality has shone through, and Farrell often describes him as ""magic.” At home, they find joy exploring various activities together, such as playing catch, which brings smiles to both father and son.

Farrell’s desire to connect with others facing similar challenges spurred him to share his family’s story publicly. He explained with sincerity, “I want the world to be kind to James. I want the world to treat him with kindness and respect.” Through his foundation, he aims to raise awareness and promote advocacy for individuals like James, ensuring they retain autonomy and community integration.

Angelman Syndrome is caused by a genetic mutation, often involving deletions or changes to the 15th chromosome. Symptoms usually become noticeable before the age of two, and those affected may experience challenges such as severe developmental delays, mobility issues, and epilepsy. Despite this array of difficulties, there's considerable potential for these individuals to flourish within nurturing environments.

The Colin Farrell Foundation endeavors to support adults with Angelman and similar syndromes by creating systems of resources and advocacy. By emphasizing communal support and awareness, Farrell is striving to make the future brighter for families who might currently feel isolated or overwhelmed as their loved ones reach adulthood without ready support systems.

Farrell’s commitment reflects not only his love for James but also his larger vision for social change. He envisions a society where individuals with disabilities are seen as full members of communities rather than marginalized individuals. His efforts also encourage policymakers and society to create more inclusive environments for those living with disabilities.

His heartfelt approach and vulnerability have captured many hearts, showcasing not only the strength of familial love but also the urgent need for better support frameworks for those with disabilities. Through initiatives to increase awareness about Angelman Syndrome and build community support systems, Colin Farrell is turning his family's challenges and experiences with disability advocacy and empowerment. He’s certainly paving the way for more families to find their voice and the strength needed to face similar circumstances."
Colin Farrell opens up about his son with Angelman syndrome: ‘We still struggle.’’,https://evrimagaci.org/tpg/colin-farrell-creates-foundation-to-support-families-navigated-by-intellectual-disabilities-7836,"Colin Farrell Creates Foundation To Support Families Navigated By Intellectual Disabilities The actor launches his foundation focused on supporting those with Angelman syndrome and their families as he opens up about life with his son James

Award-winning actor Colin Farrell is stepping out of the limelight to shine a light on a very personal issue: the care and support of individuals with intellectual disabilities. The catalyst for this initiative is his 20-year-old son, James, who lives with Angelman syndrome. This genetic disorder has altered not only the life of young James but has also inspired Farrell to create the Colin Farrell Foundation, dedicated to advocating for families facing similar challenges.

Farrell, known for his roles in films like ""The Banshees of Insherin"" and ""The Batman,"" recently opened up about his son’s experiences during an exclusive interview with People Magazine. He poignantly highlighted the struggles families undergo after their children with special needs reach adulthood. “Once your child turns 21, they’re kind of on their own,” he explained, pointing out the sudden loss of support systems as young adults with disabilities transition out of educational and community programs. Farrell’s words underscore the harsh reality for many families who find themselves without the necessary assistance at this critical stage of life.

The Colin Farrell Foundation aims to fill this gap by advocating for increased funding and policy changes within Medicaid and Home and Community Based Services programs. Farrell expressed his desperation to create effective support networks for families, particularly after watching James navigate life’s challenges with immense determination. Despite these hurdles, Farrell describes his son’s spirit as “magic,” emphasizing the positivity James brings to their lives.

Understanding Angelman Syndrome

For those unfamiliar, Angelman syndrome is caused by the loss of function of a gene responsible for producing proteins important for the nervous system. This genetic disorder primarily affects movement and speech, leading to developmental delays and intellectual disabilities. Its myriad symptoms often lead to misdiagnosis, with characteristics resembling conditions like autism. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), affected individuals may experience problems with balance and coordination, have difficulty communicating verbally, and may suffer from seizures.

The Mayo Clinic notes those with Angelman syndrome typically have close to normal life expectancy, but will require varying degrees of support throughout their lives. This prospect raises significant concerns for parents like Farrell, who want to see their children thrive and integrate fully within society. The awareness of this need has fueled the foundation’s mission.

Colin Farrell articulated how painstakingly hard James has worked to develop skills many take for granted, such as feeding himself or walking. “I’m proud of him every day,” he said of his son’s accomplishments. Learning and growth has been filled with trials; moments when James struggled to accomplish tasks were painful yet potent reminders of his tenacity. Farrell recalls the exhilarating moment when James took his first steps—an event he describes with palpable emotion, signifying hope and joy amid the challenges.

The Journey to Diagnosis

Reflecting on James' early years, Farrell revealed how initial developmental delays raised red flags for him and James's mother, model Kim Bordenave. They noticed James wasn’t sitting up, crawling, or hitting critical benchmarks typical for his age. Despite early concerns, medical professionals initially misdiagnosed James with cerebral palsy. It was only at two years old, after persistent observation and pleading, did doctors finally conduct tests for Angelman syndrome—an important moment for the Farrell family.

The struggle for clarity was compounded by confusion over symptoms and the difficulty of obtaining appropriate resources. Like many parents of children with special needs, Farrell found the healthcare and support systems riddled with complications, illustrating the need for systemic changes. This prompted him to act, to create pathways not only for James but for countless others who might find themselves lost amid bureaucracy.

The Foundation's Purpose

The Colin Farrell Foundation is not merely about financial assistance; it’s about raising awareness, breaking stigma, and fostering community support. The actor says his motivation stems from years of wanting to create better opportunities for families. His goal is simple yet powerful: families who have children with special needs deserve consistent support and resources throughout life stages.

“Families must receive the assistance they deserve,” he explains. The foundation advocates for reforms aimed at keeping intellectually disabled youth integrated and supported within society, especially as they transition to adulthood. Farrell has taken significant steps beyond mere rhetoric, channeling his fame toward tangible outcomes for families like his own.

The foundation’s approach emphasizes connection, bringing families together, sharing stories, and building networks of parents who understand the unique challenges and celebrations of raising children with disabilities. This community-centric angle aims to create environments where families can share resources and find solace within each other’s experiences.

Despite the uphill battle, Farrell remains optimistic. His passion and dedication to this cause emerge vividly as he discusses James’s challenges. The powerful love between father and son is evident, sweeping aside barriers, and epitomizing the resilience found within families of children with disabilities.

Insights from the Community

While Farrell’s story is emotionally compelling and certainly highlights systemic issues, it also encourages discussions on broader societal norms surrounding disability. The need for awareness and advocacy isn’t solely confined to families affected directly; the problem extends to communities and institutions. Every society can play its part by removing stigmas associated with developmental disabilities and promoting inclusiveness.

With many individuals diagnosed with Angelman syndrome encountering similar struggles, the conversations surrounding this disorder need to expand. Advocates across various sectors stress the importance of increased funding for specialized education programs, therapies, and life skills training for those transitioning out of public services and educational systems.

Individuals with Angelman syndrome often look toward therapies like occupational and speech therapy—crucial for skill building and improved quality of life. This aligns perfectly with Farrell's vision for providing comprehensive support through the foundation.

Using his celebrity status as leverage, Farrell hopes to bring widespread attention to these issues, persuading policymakers to re-evaluate support systems for those with disabilities. His empathy and vulnerability help craft a narrative consistent with many families' experiences across the globe—emphasizing the need for advocacy and shared resources.

Looking Ahead

With the Colin Farrell Foundation now officially established, the actor’s vision is slowly coming to fruition. The prospect of building community, advocating for policy reform, and spreading awareness illuminates the path forward. An educated populace can drive change, pushing for better standards of care for individuals with disabilities, and Farrell is determined to lead this charge.

Speaking about future projects for the foundation, he expressed hope for collaborations with existing organizations focused on disability rights—providing platforms for information sharing and resource access.

Farrell’s narrative sheds light not just on the struggles faced by families like his but also urges society to act. It serves as a reminder how meaningful support can transform lives—changing perspectives, creating opportunities, and fostering inclusion. James may be facing challenges, but he is also paving the way for future generations.

Indeed, through love, dedication, and advocacy, Colin Farrell is making sure no family has to feel alone as they navigate the often-tumultuous waters of raising children with special needs. By fostering awareness and initiating foundational resources, he aims to sow hope where it is needed most."

Colin Farrell is sharing how he’s honoring his 20-year-old son, James amid his lifelong battle with Angelman syndrome.

In an interview with People, Farrell opened up about James’ condition and his diagnosis. James, now 20, was diagnosed with Angelman syndrome in 2007 — a rare neurogenetic disorder characterized by developmental delays, lack of speech, seizures, and impaired balance. Angelman Syndrome is often misdiagnosed as autism or cerebral palsy, and that’s exactly what happened with James.

“It was at the time — it probably still is, but in less measure — it was a common misdiagnosis, because it shared a lot of the same presentations, a lot of the same characteristics,” Farrell told the outlet.

It wasn’t until his son was about two-and-a-half that the Academy Award-nominee, who shares James with his ex, model Kim Bordenave, said a pediatric neurologist noticed a telltale sign of the syndrome — sudden outbreaks of laughter.

“The doctor saw that James was laughing a lot in the office,” Farrell recalled. “This pediatric neurologist just took a look at James and said to James’ mom, ‘Has he been tested for Angelman syndrome?’ And Kim said, ‘What’s that?'”

“Very few people knew about it at the time,” he continued. “The doctor said, ‘Well, let me just do a genetic test, a blood test. We can just do a genetic mapping,’ and it came back positive.”

“One of the biggest issues and one of the most significant moments you can experience as a child who has developmental disability or delay is getting a diagnosis, ’cause then if you get a diagnosis you can zero in,” Farrell explained.

“There are usually people you can find, whether it’s a community just emotionally to lean into, so you feel less alone in your struggles, or medical professionals, and physical therapists, and people who can have a specific system with which they can present to your child, present to you, and then help your child reach their potential.”

While the Banshees of Inisherin actor has largely leaned into that support system over the years to aide in James’ care, this interview marks the first time he’s really opening up about his son’s condition and the way he wants the world to see him as he approaches his 21st birthday.

“I want the world to be kind to James,” the actor told the outlet. “I want the world to treat him with kindness and respect.”

That also happens to be the age where James will age out of many of the support systems provided for families with kids who have special needs.

“Once your child turns 21, they’re kind of on their own,” Farrell said. “All the safeguards that are put in place, special ed classes, that all goes away, so you’re left with a young adult who should be an integrated part of our modern society and more often than not is left behind.”

That’s part of the reason Farrell decided to launch his foundation — the Colin Farrell Foundation — to provide support for adult children who have intellectual disabilities through advocacy, education, and innovative programs.

“This is the first time I’ve spoken about it, and obviously the only reason I’m speaking is I can’t ask James if he wants to do this,” he maintained of his son, who is nonverbal.

The actor then clarified that he can ask, and does “speak to James as if he’s 20 and has perfect fluency with the English language and age-appropriate cognitive ability.”

“But I can’t discern a particular answer from him as to whether he’s comfortable with all this or not,” he explained, “so I have to make a call based on knowing James’s spirit and what kind of young man he is and the goodness that he has in his heart.”

James, Farrell said, “has worked so hard all his life, so hard. Repetition, repetition, balance, his jerky gait. When he started feeding himself for the first time, his face looks like a Jackson Pollock by the end of it.”

He continued, getting emotional at multiple points throughout the interview, “But he gets it in, he feeds himself beautifully. I’m proud of him every day, because I just think he’s magic.”

As for the foundation, Farrell, who is also a dad to younger son Henry, 14, whom he shares with his Ondine co-star Alicja Bachleda-Curús, said it’s something he’s wanted to start for years.

“[The foundation] is providing greater opportunities for families who have a child with special needs, to receive the support that they deserve, basically the assistance in all areas of life,” Farrell explained.

James and those like him have “earned the right to have a greater degree of individuality and autonomy in life, and a greater degree of community,” he added.

Farrell is also choosing to believe that James is in support of getting his photograph taken in the garden — which is not his favorite thing to do. “if us doing this could help families and other young adults who live with special needs, he would say, ‘Dad, what are you talking about? Why are you even asking me? It’s a no-brainer.'”

“So that’s why we’re doing it,” he added. “This is all because of James — it’s all in his honor.”

'NCIS' actor Gabriel Olds is charged with 7 felony sexual assault counts amid LAPD investigation.,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-08-08/actor-gabriel-olds-charged-with-7-felony-sexual-assault-counts,"Actor Gabriel Olds has been arrested and charged with multiple violent sexual assaults, according to Los Angeles police, and investigators say they are searching for more potential victims.

The 52-year-old actor who appeared in TV shows such as “Six Feet Under,” “NCIS” and the movie “The Eyes of Tammy Faye” was booked into jail Wednesday morning on seven felony charges after a lengthy investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department. He is being held in lieu of $3.5 million bail.

Police began investigating Olds in January 2023 after a 41-year-old woman reported that he had raped her at her L.A. home, according to LAPD sex crimes detectives familiar with the case. Detectives later learned of two more women who had made similar allegations dating back to 2013. In each case, the women alleged that dating encounters with Olds descended into violent sexual assaults.

The woman obtained a restraining order against Olds last year and detailed her encounter with the actor, according to court documents. The Times is not identifying her because it does not name victims of alleged sexual crimes.

In the request for the restraining order, she alleges that Olds filmed and photographed a nonconsensual sexual encounter with the woman on Jan. 7, 2023.

She also alleged that two weeks later, on Jan. 19, 2023, Olds began to choke her during sex and she “asked [him] to stop.”

“I blacked out. I think he slapped me [to] wake up,” she said in the court filing.

She said she awoke to find Olds putting on a condom and trying to “open my legs” and alleged that he stopped the assault only after she vomited on him.

LAPD Det. Brent Hopkins said that Olds sexually assaulted three women, including the 41-year-old, in violent attacks as well as two other women who reported less violent sexual conduct. In each case, the assault on the victims was “very similar” and it is those similarities that bolster the allegations the victim made last year.

“We heard the same story again and again,” Hopkins said. “Mr. Olds started off charming, but then used brutal violence.”

“Some of these survivors suffered in silence for years before finding the strength to speak up,” Hopkins said.

Hopkins said that because there is a such a considerable span between the first two reported assaults in 2013 and the one last year, investigators suspect there are more victims. At the heart of these crimes is a lack of consent.

“There was a time there wasn’t as much understanding about sex assault. ... Post #MeToo, there is much more awareness, especially with the Danny Masterson and Harvey Weinstein case,” he said. “People are more aware of what is OK and what’s not and are more willing to speak up.”

Authorities say Olds, a New York native with screenwriting credits and numerous acting parts dating to the 1990s, used his status as a Yale-educated actor to entice the women, whom investigators said he typically met through dating applications. Police say Olds lured the women into a false sense of security during their initial encounters before turning sexually violent.

Based on the LAPD investigation, the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office filed seven felony assault charges against Olds last month. A warrant for his arrest was issued soon after by a judge.

The charges include rape, rape of an unconscious person, sodomy, assault with intent to commit rape and injury on a girlfriend or significant other. Prosecutors say Olds raped one woman on March 15, 2013, and another on Sept. 1 of that year, as well as a third woman on Jan. 19, 2023.

Investigators are hoping to develop further leads with search warrants for Olds’ various social media and dating applications accounts. Hopkins said the actor has lived in North Hollywood/Studio City for more than two decades but has worked all over the country on productions."

Blake Lively's It Ends With Us Movie Has Rotten Tomatoes Critics United.,https://www.slashfilm.com/1638964/blake-lively-it-ends-with-us-movie-rotten-tomatoes-critics-united/,"Only a few weeks after ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" supercharged the box office, perhaps it was fate that the first real rival to the Ryan Reynolds-led superhero movie would come in the form of a romantic drama starring Blake Lively, both of whom are married to one another and are undoubtedly, as the kids say, goals. (Lively even scores multiple fourth wall-breaking references in her husband's threequel and her own cameo voice appearance as well.) ""It Ends With Us"" might not seem like a conventional challenger to potentially knock off one of the most highly-anticipated blockbusters in years from the number one spot, but that would be underselling the sheer expectations the film comes with, based on the bestselling novel by author Colleen Hoover.

The story follows recent college graduate Lily Blossom Bloom (Lively), who has aspirations of opening her own floral shop and meeting the perfect guy. When she crosses paths with neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid (Justin Baldoni, who also directs) and embarks on a torrid romance, all appears to be straight out of, well, a romance novel ... until his darker side emerges and Lily is forced to reckon with the cycles of abuse she's only recently found out her own parents suffered from throughout their rocky marriage.

With all this hype and pressure leading up to the release of the first big screen adaptation, all eyes turned towards the reviews — and the results are, at best, mixed. /Film's own BJ Colangelo gave the effort a 4 out of 10 in her review, lauding Lively's ""committed"" performance and the good intentions in attempting to depict a realistic portrayal of domestic abuse. Unfortunately, its inherent reliance on dated tropes and penchant for becoming an ""emotionally manipulative watch"" end up sinking it. Here's what other critics had to say on the matter."

The movie stars the Gossip Girl alum, 36, as a floral designer named Lily Bloom, who falls in love with neurosurgeon Ryle (Justin Baldoni, who also directs the film), years after losing touch with her first love Atlas (Brandon Sklenar) after he joined the military.

But when Ryle's violent outburst leads her to fear he may be an abusive partner, she turns to Atlas for help after they reconnect when she runs into him at a restaurant he works at.

The film, set to be released in theaters this Friday, is based on the best-selling romance novel It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover, which was a hit with readers after it was published in 2016.

However, the movie is far from a critical darling, as it currently holds a 61% score on Rotten Tomatoes, with a review from the The Independent calling it 'sincere but completely ludicrous.'

Blake Lively's, 36, new romantic drama, It Ends with Us, has received mixed reviews from critics; seen in a still with co-star and director Justin Baldoni

'It Ends With Us tries to balance the realities of domestic violence inside a rom-com and a female-empowerment movie. All suffer in the process,' writes Mark Kennedy from Associated Press.

'The screenplay, by Daddio director Christy Hall, makes an effort with some early winking jokes that acknowledge the novel's clichés. But the adaptation can't be saved from the contrivance baked into the original text,' adds Lovia Gyarkye from the Hollywood Reporter.

'It's not Lively's fault that she’s so weakly defined as a character, but her performance still verges on vacuous, and Baldoni's on overbearing,' Daily Telegraph's Tim Robey quips.

Rolling Stone calls it the 'Starbucks Latte of movies' that's 'generic enough to hit the spot.'

However, Blake also received praise for her acting chops, with Variety's Owen Gleiberman writing that she, 'fills the screen with her acutely aware and slightly tremulous radiance.'

Meanwhile Emily Zemler from the Observer writes that the film, 'has the potential to be soapy and overwrought, potentially veering into Lifetime territory. But Lively and her director/co-star Justin Baldoni refuse to let the movie be consumed by the melodramatic nature of the story.'

The Guardian's Benjamin Lee writes, 'It's a plot of hackneyed soap tropes but there’s a real maturity to how it unfolds, a story of abuse that’s far less obvious than we’ve grown accustomed to, the details far knottier than some might be comfortable with. There are expected cliches but there are also many that are mercifully avoided too, the story not always conforming to type.'

'It Ends With Us savors the trappings of a glossy love triangle: the banter, the flirting, the turbulence, the extravagant costumes,' Amy Nicholson of The Washington Post writes. 'The movie has to cheat a bit to get at the complexity of Hoover’s book.'

'A child of domestic abuse, Hoover writes with painful intimacy about Lily’s struggle to claw free from her past. Baldoni shifts some of that turmoil to the audience, with editors Oona Flaherty and Robb Sullivan cutting key scenes so that, like Lily, we don’t know what to believe.'

Nicholson went on to state that 'even bouncing off male leads who are more pinball bumpers than dimensional characters,' Lively gave a 'great performance as a headstrong, sensible woman who struggles to consider herself a victim.'

The trailer for the film as released in May.

Blake's good friend Taylor Swift even lends her voice to the trailer - her 2020 song, My Tears Ricochet, serves as the soundtrack for the teaser.

The trailer begins with Lily meeting Ryle at her new flower shop, before the duo hit it off and strike up a romantic relationship.

The duo go on a date and it doesn't take long for things to get steamy.

'I want to see you again,' Ryle tells Lily. 'Now you see me,' she jokes.

'You know what I mean,' he replies. But then a darker side of Ryle emerges.

During a tense conversation, Ryle is shown standing up and smashing an object into the floor.

'I'm so sorry,' he tenderly tells her afterwards.

But then, Atlas returns. Lily is shown running into him, as flashbacks of their relationship as kids flash before the screen.

'I still remember the day I saw you in the window,' Atlas muses. 'Yeah, we were just kids then,' Lily replies.

But when Ryle's violent outburst leads her to fear he may be an abusive partner, she turns to Atlas for help after they reconnect when she runs into him at a restaurant he works at.

Noticing the man she is holding hands with, Atlas asks, 'Is that your guy?'

'Yeah. That's Ryle,' she replies.

Ryle seems suspicious of Lily as he asks her at one point, 'Do you love him?'

'I love you,' she assures him.

'That wasn't my question,' Ryle replies.

Lily poses a powerful question to Ryle: 'If one day you had a daughter, what would you say to her?

'She came to you and said the person she loved was hurting her? What would you say to her?'

Blake and her husband Ryan Reynolds — whose superhero movie Deadpool & Wolverine became the highest-grossing R-rated film ever, after earning $97 million over the weekend — are set to go head-to-head at the box office this weekend with their respective films.

Deadpool & Wolverine, which is in its third week of release, is projected to take in $50 million during the timeframe amid its red-hot run in theaters, Deadline reported.

Earlier this week, the Marvel Cinematic Universe blockbuster - which costars Hugh Jackman, Emma Corrin and Matthew Macfadyen - achieved another milestone in being the second film of the year (after Inside Out 2) to surpass the domestic total of $400 million after raking in $12.2 million Monday, according to the outlet.

It Ends with Us has kicked off with strong presales and estimates, according to Deadline, with the National Research Group estimating it makes $23 million.

Lively's past highest box office openings include 2011's Green Lantern (which costarred Reynolds) with $53.1 million; 2010's The Town with $23.8 million; and 2018’s A Simple Favor with $16 million."
Critic reviews of the Borderlands movie are absolutely savage. Early Borderlands movie impressions brand it as a bad movie.,https://www.pcgamer.com/movies-tv/critic-reviews-of-the-borderlands-movie-are-absolutely-savage/,"After first contact with fans yesterday , critics are somehow even more disappointed with the Borderlands movie. They hate it. They don't even give it credit as ""so bad it's good."" It is simply, by all appearances, a truly and extremely bad movie. It holds a remarkable 3% approval on aggregator Rotten Tomatoes as of press time. Without further improvement that will place Borderlands at a comfortable midpoint on RT's 100 worst movies of all time list… and at first place on their Worst Blockbusters of All Time list—below even 2010's disastrous The Last Airbender.

Perhaps the choicest Borderlands smackdown was delivered by Rolling Stone , where reviewer David Fear called it ""an insult to gamers, movie lovers, and carbon-based life forms."" Which I think is unnecessarily harsh judgment on the tastes of theoretical Silicon-Oxygen-Fluorine biochemistry life forms. They would also hate the Borderlands movie.

""You seriously wonder if the sole purpose of Borderlands is to make every other video game adaptation look a thousand times better in comparison,"" says Fear. Later saying that ""It is, in no uncertain terms, a horrendous waste of time, talent, and pixels. Not even the pleasure of seeing Blanchett twirling pistols and kicking ass can salvage this.""

On home turf at IGN , where you might expect a videogame movie to do better, Borderlands failed to land, earning an ""Awful"" rating from reviewer Matt Donato, who noted that it failed to live up to any of the promise the games hold. The fun locales are there, but they're ""all spoonfed, familiar, and as filling as a single rice cake.""

Even Variety failed to find anything lovable: ""By the time 'Borderlands' unlocks its vault, not even the characters seem to care what’s inside,"" said Peter Debruge.

What I found to be the finest summary of critic views, however, comes from The Wrap via writer William Bibbiani . Bibbiani's review notes all the ways in which Borderlands tries to be like other, better films and fails rather than finding its own voice derived from the games.

""The biggest problem with Eli Roth’s 'Borderlands' isn’t that it’s bad,"" says Bibbiani, ""it’s that it’s not interesting enough to be bad. It’s mass-produced pabulum. All the edges have been sanded down so it can be safe and mainstream, but they went too far and there’s almost nothing left. It’s technically a movie based on 'Borderlands.' Not much else.""

Steve Martin has turned down playing Tim Walz on Saturday Night Live.,https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2024-08-07/steve-martin-will-not-play-tim-walz-on-saturday-night-live,"Despite an offer from Lorne Michaels, Steve Martin says he will not portray vice presidential candidate Tim Walz on “Saturday Night Live.”

Not long after Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, picked Minnesota’s Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, social media users began to line up candidates to play Walz when “Saturday Night Live” returns in the fall.

At the top of the list: Steve Martin, who, with his wispy white hair, glasses and genial dad-like demeanor, bears a certain resemblance to Walz. Martin got into the spirit of things Tuesday, posting on Threads: “I just learned that Tim Walz wants to go on the road with Marty Short.”

“Saturday Night Live” producer Lorne Michaels must have been listening because he called Martin on Wednesday morning with an offer.

The comedian politely and promptly declined.

“I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,” Martin told The Times. “I said, ‘Lorne, I’m not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.’ I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.”

Maya Rudolph will be reprising her portrayal of Harris, whom she first played on “SNL” in 2019 during the Democratic presidential primaries and, later, when Harris was named Joe Biden’s running mate. (Jim Carrey portrayed Biden.) Per Deadline, Rudolph moved production of the third season of her Apple TV+ series “Loot” to January from August in order to play Harris through this year’s election cycle.

Martin, who will turn 79 next week, wasn’t willing to entertain that kind of commitment.

“It’s ongoing,” Martin says. “It’s not like you do it once and get applause and never do it again. Again, they need a real impressionist to do that. They’re gonna find somebody really, really good. I’d be struggling.”

Steve Martin has turned down playing Tim Walz on Saturday Night Live.,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/aug/08/tim-walz-saturday-night-live-snl-steve-martin,"On Thursday, comedian Steve Martin announced that he wouldn’t be playing the Minnesota governor turned Democrat veep pick, Tim Walz, on Saturday Night Live, even after SNL big cheese Lorne Michaels offered him the job.

“I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,” Martin told the Los Angeles Times. “I said, ‘Lorne, I’m not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.’ I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses … They’re gonna find somebody really, really good. I’d be struggling.”

Another reason he refused is that playing politicians is never a one-time gig: Maya Rudolph has been playing Kamala Harris since 2019. It is a shame, because Martin has an affable suburban energy to match Walz, who somehow looks like everyone’s dad and also every Australian prime minister. But if your dad or Scott Morrison doesn’t need work right now, here are our picks for SNL’s Walz.

1. Mark Proksch

This is a genuine plea for Proksch, who is very funny in What We Do in the Shadows, Better Call Saul and The Office. Like Walz, he also looks as if he could manage the heck out of your local supermarket. But this is also a plea for you to watch his run of appearances on midwest morning TV shows, in which Proksch pretended to be “yo-yo champion” Kenny Strasser. Kenny was very bad at yo-yo, but very good at trauma-dumping on unsuspecting TV hosts. One station’s news director said: “I hate that we got duped … He did some really lame things. He hit himself in the face and the groin with his yo-yo.” He’s really excellent.

2. Brian Doyle Murray

View image in fullscreen Bill Murray and Brian Doyle Murray in 2017. Photograph: Bruce Glikas/Getty Images

Yes, he’s Bill Murray’s older brother. Yes, he’s the voice of the Flying Dutchman in SpongeBob SquarePants. But he was also an SNL cast member between 1977 and 1982 – so the intense Aykroyd-Belushi-Chase years, when all the cocaine dealers within one mile of NBC Studios presumably had chauffeurs driving their Bentleys. After that, Doyle Murray could probably handle being the actual vice-president.

3. Michael McKean

He ticks many boxes. He’s another SNL alumnus (1994-1995) who has impersonated everyone from Bill Clinton to Jeffrey Dahmer. He has a Walzian face (cheerful, fleshy). And he played Spinal Tap lead singer David St Hubbins (named for “the patron saint of quality footwear”). But as a bonus, McKean can also do drama: he was Jimmy McGill’s brother Chuck in Better Call Saul. So if for some reason Walz is involved in a devastating fraternal tragedy, McKean could handle it.

4. Jim O’Heir

View image in fullscreen Aziz Ansari and Jim O’Heir in Parks And Recreation. Photograph: NBCUPHOTOBANK/Rex Features

O’Heir is perhaps best known for his turn as the endlessly amenable Jerry/Larry/Garry in Parks and Recreation, but his comedy is far more unhinged than that role would suggest. Though he’s never appeared on SNL, he trained and performed with the legendary improv group Second City in Chicago, and we know he can do midwest charm (Pawnee was in Indiana).

5. Bill Hader

We have all appreciated Hader’s journey from SNL goofball to troublingly attractive psycho in Barry. But he really loves dressing up like an old guy. He can impersonate everyone. Who are we to refuse him?"

Tim Walz on ""Saturday Night Live"" — everyone, it turns out, other than Steve Martin.

The ""Only Murders in the Building"" star, 78, revealed to the Los Angeles Times he has turned down an offer to play Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 running mate on ""SNL"" this fall.

Martin said ""SNL"" creator Lorne Michaels called him on Wednesday to offer him the role, but he declined.

""I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,"" Martin told the Times. ""I said, 'Lorne, I'm not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.' I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.""

Martin, who has hosted ""SNL"" 16 times going back to 1976, also said he wasn't prepared to make the commitment required for the role.

""They're gonna find somebody really, really good,"" he told the Times. ""I'd be struggling.""

Martin previously joked about the calls for him to play Walz on Threads, writing, ""I just learned that Tim Walz wants to go on the road with Marty Short.""

Harris on Tuesday officially named Walz her running mate in the 2024 presidential election, prompting ""SNL"" fans to debate who should play him on the show this fall. ""SNL"" typically spoofs the vice presidential debate during each election cycle, which this year would be between Walz and Sen. JD Vance. No casting for Vance has been announced.

Maya Rudolph, though, is set to reprise her role as Harris on ""SNL"" through the presidential election.

With Martin out of the mix, other names that have been floated for the ""SNL"" Walz role include comedian Jim Gaffigan and ""Parks and Recreation"" star Jim O'Heir. On Tuesday, O'Heir reacted to being included in a CNN segment on candidates for the role alongside Martin, Gaffigan and former Sen. Al Franken.

""I don't mind being in the mix but that's the best pic of me that they could come up with?"" O'Heir joked.

Other fans have urged ""SNL"" to choose a member of its cast to play Walz. For the 2020 election, Jim Carrey, who was not a regular ""SNL"" cast member, stepped in to play Joe Biden.

""Call me crazy but I think one of the 'SNL' cast members should play Tim Walz,"" comedian Paul Scheer wrote on X.

""SNL"" is set to return in September for its landmark 50th season. Cast members Punkie Johnson and Molly Kearney recently announced their exits from the show."

Walz was announced on Tuesday as Kamala Harris' vice presidential running mate for the 2024 US presidential election. The election will provide plenty of fodder for ""SNL,"" which returns for season 50 on September 28. Maya Rudolph is reportedly set to return as Harris.

Since Walz was selected as Harris' running mate, the internet has been having a field day sharing their opinions on who should play him on the show. Martin was perhaps the most popular choice, but in light of his turning down the role, here are other actors who fans think could do the role justice.

Stand-up comedian and actor Jim Gaffigan is a frontrunner

The Only Murders in the Building actor and frequent Saturday Night Live host turned down Lorne Michaels' ask -- despite fans begging him to take the role.

As Vice President Kamala Harris chose Walz to be her running mate in the 2024 election, social media quickly campaigned for Martin to play him on SNL alongside Harris' impressionist Maya Rudolph

But, according to Martin, he politely declined the TV gig.

The Only Murders in the Building actor -- whose appearance bears resemblance to Walz -- first took to Threads on Tuesday to poke fun of the comparisons, posting “I just learned that Tim Walz wants to go on the road with Marty Short.""

But social media users were not the only ones rooting for Martin to return to the SNL stage. By Wednesday, Michaels apparently extended an offer to Martin to play Harris' VP pick in the show's fiftieth season.

""I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,"" Martin told the LA Times. ""I said, 'Lorne, I'm not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.' I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.""

Despite never being an official member of the cast, Martin hosted the sketch comedy show 16 times and holds the title of person with the second most host appearances on the long-running variety show.

FYI: Alec Baldwin holds the first place, with 17 total hosting appearances.

""It's ongoing. It's not like you do it once and get applause and never do it again,"" Martin explained about his inability to commit to the role. ""Again, they need a real impressionist to do that. They're gonna find somebody really, really good. I'd be struggling.""

He is already committed to his role in Hulu's Only Murders in the Building alongside Selena Gomez as well as comedy collaborator Martin Short, who he is touring with this fall for ""The Dukes of Funkytown!"""
Steve Martin has turned down playing Tim Walz on Saturday Night Live.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/arts/television/snl-2024-election-harris-trump.html,"The approach of another presidential election brings with it many questions: In what direction is the United States headed? Who will be our next president and vice president? And, most crucially, who will play them on “Saturday Night Live”?

Election-season comedy sketches are an “S.N.L.” staple, providing cast members with opportunities to gain visibility for their impersonations of prominent politicians and — increasingly — for the show to tap into its network of celebrity guests, friends and spouses to play these roles. When new political figures come to national attention, we can’t help but indulge our inner Lorne Michaels and imagine who we’d cast to imitate them.

The show’s plans were likely scrambled last month when President Biden announced that he would stand down as the Democratic presidential nominee. That paved the way for Vice President Kamala Harris to take his place at the top of the ticket, and for Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota to join as her running mate. On the Republican side, former President Donald J. Trump offered his vice-presidential slot to Senator JD Vance of Ohio.

These are all characters likely to appear on “S.N.L.,” whose 50th season will begin on Sept. 28. And while the show hasn’t officially announced who it intends to cast in these key roles (and NBC declined to comment for this article), there is plenty of history and wild internet speculation to sift through. Let’s take a look at where these races currently stand."
Steve Martin has turned down playing Tim Walz on Saturday Night Live.,https://www.thedailybeast.com/steve-martin-says-he-just-declined-lorne-michaels-offer-to-play-tim-walz-on-snl,"Steve Martin won’t be gracing Studio 8H to impersonate a certain Midwest dad anytime soon.

Whenever a new politician gets vaulted onto the national stage, the internet scrambles to face-match them with their celebrity counterpart, its denizens generously taking it upon themselves to do the work of the Saturday Night Live casting team. Often these fan-castings go ignored, but something in the air was different on Tuesday when it was announced that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz would be Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate.

It wasn’t long before someone realized who Walz’s silver hair, glasses, and general folksy vibe reminded them of: Steve Martin. From there, the calls for Martin to return to SNL as Walz grew louder until the banjo-playing comedian himself acknowledged the noise. “I just learned that Tim Walz wants to go on the road with Marty Short,” Martin said on Threads, a reference to his longtime creative partnership with Short.

But Martin, famously a 16-time SNL host, has no desire to stake a claim on parodying the Democratic vice presidential nominee, according to the Los Angeles Times.

The newspaper reported on Wednesday afternoon that SNL head honcho Lorne Michaels had rung up Martin just hours earlier to ask him to play Walz on the show.

Martin “politely and promptly” turned him down, the Times reported.

“I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,” the funnyman told the paper. “I said, ‘Lorne, I’m not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.’ I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.”

Nearly two decades the Minnesota governor’s senior, too, and with both a packed touring schedule and obligations as one of the stars of Hulu’s Only Murders in the Building, Martin implied he either couldn’t or wouldn’t commit to more than one appearance as Walz.

“It’s ongoing,” he said. “It’s not like you do it once and get applause and never do it again.”

The 50th season of SNL is set to kick off Sept. 28. Alum Maya Rudolph was previously confirmed to be returning to portray Harris, whom she first played in 2019 alongside Jim Carrey’s toothy Joe Biden and Alec Baldwin’s pouting Donald Trump.

The question remains: Who will be tapped to play Walz? While the late Chris Farley and Don Rickles are no longer around to slip on his gubernatorial shoes, a fictionalized version of Walz might yet take the shape of anybody from Danny DeVito to Jim Gaffigan to “an unknown 60-year-old man who took an improv class as a fun retirement activity.”

Or even—and here’s a novel suggestion—one of the people Lorne Michaels hired specifically because of their talent for comedic impressions. “Call me crazy,” actor Paul Scheer tweeted on Wednesday, “but I think one of the SNL cast members should play Tim Walz.”"

Steve Martin said he rejected Lorne Michaels' offer to play Tim Walz on ""Saturday Night Live.""

Stand-up comedian Jim Gaffigan is a popular pick to play Kamala Harris' running mate on ""SNL.""

Fans also suggested Jim O'Heir, Al Franken, Danny DeVito, and Rick Moranis as options.

Steve Martin knows that fans wanted him to play Tim Walz on ""Saturday Night Live,"" but he's already turned down the job.

""I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,"" Martin told The Los Angeles Times, referring to a conversation with ""SNL"" creator and producer Lorne Michaels. ""I said, 'Lorne, I'm not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.' I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.""

Martin said that Michaels called him on Wednesday with an offer to portray Walz on the long-running sketch comedy series. Aside from saying that he's ""not an impressionist,"" Martin also pointed to the time commitment as a drawback.

""It's ongoing,"" he said. ""It's not like you do it once and get applause and never do it again. Again, they need a real impressionist to do that. They're gonna find somebody really, really good. I'd be struggling.""

Walz was announced on Tuesday as Kamala Harris' vice presidential running mate for the 2024 US presidential election. The election will provide plenty of fodder for ""SNL,"" which returns for season 50 on September 28. Maya Rudolph is reportedly set to return as Harris.

Since Walz was selected as Harris' running mate, the internet has been having a field day sharing their opinions on who should play him on the show. Martin was perhaps the most popular choice, but in light of his turning down the role, here are other actors who fans think could do the role justice.

Steve Martin has turned down playing Tim Walz on Saturday Night Live.,https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/snl-harris-walz-impression-steve-martin-20240808.html,"Who will play Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on ""Saturday Night Live?"" It won't be Steve Martin, who turned down the role. Read more

If you’re wondering who will play Tim Walz on Saturday Night Live, it won’t be Steve Martin.

Martin revealed to the Los Angeles Times he was offered the role by longtime SNL producer Lorne Michaels to play Walz alongside Maya Rudolph’s Kamala Harris, but turned it down.

“I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,” Martin said. “I said, ‘Lorne, I’m not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.’ I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.”

At 79, Martin is nearly 20 years older than Walz, who turned 60 in April. Only Murders in the Building star also wasn’t ready for the commitment of portraying a politician on SNL.

“It’s ongoing,” Martin said. “It’s not like you do it once and get applause and never do it again.”

Rudolph, an SNL cast member from 2000 to 2007, portrayed Harris throughout the 2020 election and when she hosted the show in 2021. As a result of her SNL commitment, preproduction of the third season of her Apple TV+ comedy series Loot has been paused, according to Deadline.

Former president Donald Trump will continue to be portrayed by James Austin Johnson, who joined the cast in 2021. It’s unclear who will play Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R., Ohio).

SNL will premiere it’s 50th season on Sept. 28. While most of the current cast is slated to return, at least two cast members — Punkie Johnson and Molly Kearney — have announced they won’t be back.

Only Murders in the Building’s fourth season will debut on Hulu on Aug. 27."
Steve Martin has turned down playing Tim Walz on Saturday Night Live.,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/steve-martin-reacts-tim-walz-snl-1235968202/,"Steve Martin has turned down the chance to play Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate Tim Walz on Saturday Night Live.

The Los Angeles Times reported that SNL boss Lorne Michaels offered him the role, but Martin politely declined.

“I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,” Martin told the L.A. Times. “I said, ‘Lorne, I’m not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.’ I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.”

He also spoke about the time commitment such a gig would involve. (Alec Baldwin ended up playing Donald Trump on SNL for several years after first taking on the role before the 2016 election.)

“It’s ongoing,” Martin says. “It’s not like you do it once and get applause and never do it again. Again, they need a real impressionist to do that. They’re gonna find somebody really, really good. I’d be struggling.”

Martin’s name quickly started trending on X (formerly Twitter) Tuesday after Harris selected Minnesota Gov. Walz as her running mate in her 2024 presidential bid.

The Only Murders in the Building star, who has made frequent guest appearances on and hosted SNL numerous times, on Tuesday indicated he had seen the chatter, writing on Instagram’s Threads, “I just learned that Tim Walz wants to go on the road with Marty Short.”

Martin and his longtime friend and OMITB co-star and SNL alum Short regularly perform live shows together, with the pair even filming one as a 2018 Netflix special titled An Evening You’ll Forget for the Rest of Your Life.

Indeed, Martin and Short already have a number of live shows, titled The Dukes of Funnytown, scheduled to take place throughout the U.S. this fall.

SNL has already enlisted alum Maya Rudolph to reprise her role as Harris through the 2024 election. Even Damon Lindelof got in on the action, posting a Photoshopped SNL promo with Martin and Rudolph as Harris.

Still, Martin was not the only person suggested as an option to play Walz on the long-running Saturday variety show.

Others suggested by X users include Danny DeVito, Tom Arnold, Bradley Whitford, Jim Gaffigan, Parks and Recreation alum Jim O’Heir, Bill Murray, Kyle Chandler (perhaps inspired by Walz’s background as a former high school football coach), Drew Carey, frequent SNL guest star and host John Goodman, and SNL alum and former Minnesota Sen. Al Franken. And Paul Scheer had the innovative idea of a current SNL castmember.

Others lamented that Chris Farley and Don Rickles were no longer alive to play the role.

SNL alum Julia Sweeney even suggested herself as someone to play Walz.

Walz spent 12 years in the House of Representatives, where he was well-respected and forged strong relationships with fellow legislators before being elected as Minnesota governor in 2018. His characterization of Trump’s running mate, J.D. Vance, as “weird,” was quickly picked up by Harris and other Democrats.

The former teacher and football coach has enacted progressive legislation in Minnesota like universal school lunches and laying the groundwork to get the state to 100 percent clean energy by 2040. And he signed a law that would seemingly be appreciated by Taylor Swift fans: House File 1989, which provides more transparency and protection for people buying tickets online for concerts, sports and other live events in Minnesota, prompted by the frustration felt by a local legislator and numerous other fans trying to buy tickets to Swift’s concerts.

Harris and Walz made their first appearance together as the 2024 Democratic presidential ticket at a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday night.

Steve Martin has turned down playing Tim Walz on Saturday Night Live.,https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/steve-martin-snl-tim-walz-turns-down-offer-1236099470/,"Almost immediately after Kamala Harris announced her running mate as Tim Walz, people on social media began dream-casting Steve Martin to play the role on “Saturday Night Live.”

Martin, who not only bears a physical resemblance to the Minnesota governor but also gives off the same friendly dad vibe, embraced the online fervor, joking on Threads: “I just learned that Tim Walz wants to go on the road with Marty Short.”

The next morning, Lorne Michaels apparently called Martin with an offer, which Martin unfortunately declined. “I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,” Martin told the Los Angeles Times. “I said, ‘Lorne, I’m not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.’ I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.”

Martin, who was never a part of the “SNL” cast but has hosted the show 16 times since 1976, would have joined Maya Rudolph, who is returning to play Vice President Kamala Harris. But Martin, who is also hard at work on his Hulu comedy “Only Murders in the Building,” says he wasn’t up for that kind of commitment.

“It’s ongoing,” Martin said. “It’s not like you do it once and get applause and never do it again. Again, they need a real impressionist to do that. They’re gonna find somebody really, really good. I’d be struggling.”

There’s been other news out of “SNL” in the past week, as cast members Punkie Johnson and Molly Kearney both announced they were departing the sketch comedy series ahead of its 50th season.

“Saturday Night Live” returns on NBC on Sept. 28."
Steve Martin has turned down playing Tim Walz on Saturday Night Live.,https://stylecaster.com/lists/who-play-tim-walz-snl/,"Sad news, folks, but Steve Martin has turned down the role of Tim Walz on Saturday Night Live. He’s got a good reason, though, and with that in mind, we’ve been racking our brains to think of who should play Kamala Harris’ Vice Presidential nominee.

Maya Rudolph announced she would be reprising her role as Harris on SNL and when Walz was announced as Harris‘ running mate on August 6, speculation in Hollywood immediately went to who would play the Minnesotan Governor on the legendary sketch show.

Martin said Lorne Michaels approached him with the opportunity to play Walz, but he declined. “I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,” Martin told The Times. “I said, ‘Lorne, I’m not an impressionist.

Again, they need a real impressionist to do that. They’re gonna find somebody really, really good. I’d be struggling.”

So who should play Tim Walz on SNL?"

For decades, Saturday Night Live’s political impressions almost entirely went to cast members. Historically, it’s been a mixed bag between the completely forgettable (remember Mark McKinney’s Al Gore during the 1996 election?) and generationally definitive (Dana Carvey’s George Bush, Will Ferrell’s George W. Bush) works of satire. But the debut of Tina Fey’s Sarah Palin in fall 2008 changed everything. It was one of the greatest political impressions ever performed, and the fact that it was the first major political SNL impersonation cast by the public remains a huge part of its legacy. And because Lorne Michaels always revisits what works, he followed the success of Fey’s Palin by doubling down on celebrities playing politicians in 2016, then tripled down during the Trump administration. As a result, SNL went from not casting anyone to play Joe Lieberman until after the 2000 election to today, when as soon as a nominee is announced, prospective celebrity roles start trending online and being debated on cable news.

With the biggest political figures cast well in advance for SNL’s 50th season — Maya Rudolph as Kamala Harris and (presumably) James Austin Johnson as Donald Trump — the public still wants to have a say in who they watch on Saturday nights (Sunday mornings on YouTube) and are voicing their casting ideas for the prospective VPs, Tim Walz and J.D. Vance. But not all predictions are equal. Based on what names have been floating around, here is who we think won’t be doing it, who might do it, and who we’re placing our bets on.

Tim Walz

Who definitely won’t play him:

Walz is a white-haired man with glasses who is pretty tall. He’s also a progressive dad who governs Minnesota, so people associate him with being really nice. All these traits lend themselves to a type that people — or at least Vanity Fair — associate with beloved family-friendly stand-up comic Jim Gaffigan. Vanity Fair’s speculation also included Parks and Recreation alum Jim O’Heir in the lineup of suspects for seemingly no other reason than the fact that he can pull off “folksy energy” and once played a nice man on a TV show. Tracy Letts, a dramatic actor, was suggested in an X post from New Yorker writer Michael Schulman, but aside from his hair and glasses, it’s a nonsensical suggestion for something on a sketch-comedy show and not a Drama Desk Award nominee. Drew Carey’s bespeckled face also made some people go “Ooh! Maybe?”

But none of these ideas make sense for a half-century-old institution that has a particular way of doing things. These gigs are typically handed to people who have a prior relationship with the show, either as a host or former cast member, and none of the above options have that sort of relationship with SNL. Gaffigan made one nonspeaking appearance in a pre-taped sketch in 1996 (presumably cast as a regular actor from a pool of hopefuls, considering this was pre–Hot Pockets fame), but otherwise, these men are simply not on Michaels’s radar. Plus, none of them are obvious enough choices that a live studio audience would go wild when they first appear in character like they did for Larry David as Bernie Sanders. Making the studio audience go wild is basically the point of bringing in a big guest star!

The most popular and convincing contender the internet clamored for, of course, was Steve Martin, but the day after Walz’s announcement, he had already turned down the role. “I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,” Martin told the Los Angeles Times. “I said, ‘Lorne, I’m not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.’ I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.”

Who could play him:

If you want an impressionist who is associated with the show, Darrell Hammond is already serving as the show’s announcer. He’s only seven years older than Walz, can impersonate anyone, and featuring him on-camera again would be a nice throwback as the show enters its 50th season. Al Franken is less known as an impressionist but would also bring the nostalgia factor, plus he has the Minnesota-politics connection. But the public has come to expect the likes of Matt Damon and Melissa McCarthy in even supporting political roles now, so it’s difficult to imagine either making much of a splash as acts of stunt casting.

John Goodman is a name that’s been floated on X and would cause a bigger reaction from the audience. Besides having hosted the show 13 times, Goodman played Linda Tripp on the show five times in the late ’90s, including once during an episode he hosted. He also played Rex Tillerson on “Weekend Update” in 2018. He’s got the dad thing down and could possibly play a former high-school football coach. He is a little too old (he’s 73, and Walz is 60), but that really doesn’t matter. This biggest strike against Goodman is that he is bigger and brassier than Walz.

Another possibility is Mike Myers, who has a round face and white hair now. His default comedic persona is not as low-key and midwestern as Walz, but he’s also an extremely gifted character comedian. Also, it would be nice to have him around as the show builds up to the 50th-anniversary celebration. Like Goodman, he’s not local, but the VP generally needs to be featured in only two episodes, so the travel is easy.

If they aren’t going to appear that often during the lead-up to the election aside from the VP debate cold open and maybe the season premiere, Michaels might give the role to a cast member to give them a spotlight. As the cast member with the best impersonation skills, James Austin Johnson seems like the best bet. Yes, he already plays Trump, but that isn’t without precedent; Hammond famously played Al Gore and Dick Cheney in the early 2000s. Something that jumps out about that Martin quote to the L.A. Times is that Michaels reportedly wanted him to say no. That suggests Michaels may want to go with a cast member, because if it was another celebrity, he would’ve just asked them first.

Who we think will play him:

Steve Martin. Yeah, we know what he told the L.A. Times, but we’re not buying it. Maybe he is lying to set up the eventual surprise. Maybe has yet to be convinced. Either way, he still seems most likely. He acts as if having white hair and glasses isn’t enough, but having white hair and glasses was why the show cast him to play Roger Stone in 2019.

Walz is a role that will definitely go to someone in the SNL family, and there’s no one more in the family than Martin. Walz aside, between it being the show’s landmark 50th season and Martin having a season of Only Murders in the Building to promote, he was likely going to host an episode anyway.

J.D. Vance

Who definitely won’t play him:

Vance is white and has brown hair and a beard, so the field is extremely wide. Paul Walter Hauser has been floated by multiple X users as an option, having recently showcased his comedic chops on I Think You Should Leave and the world of pro wrestling. Vanity Fair also named Haley Joel Osment as an option, whose appearances on shows like What We Do in the Shadows and Robot Chicken have more than proven his comedic merit. But, again, neither of these men have hosted SNL, so the odds that Michaels would reach out are slim. Also, despite being award-winning actors, they are not the level of famous that would make people scream loudly the moment the camera cuts to them. Again, the live audience’s reaction is the entire point of not using your existing cast!

Who could play him:

Based on Vance’s youth (he’s only 40 years old), there are several options from the cast. (James Austin Johnson is probably off the table since he’s doing Trump and, hypothetically to us, Walz.) Mikey Day is the show’s No. 2 white guy right now, and considering Michaels tried to have Day take over Biden last year to set him up for this season, clearly he was planning on showcasing Johnson and Day going into the 50th. Colin Jost, however, is the show’s No. 1 white guy and probably could pull it off with a fake beard. His only other major impression on the show was Pete Buttigieg in 2019 and 2020, a role he seemed to get only because they both went to Harvard. (Maybe Yale is enough like Harvard to get him the gig?) Michael Longfellow and Andrew Dismukes could also be chosen, but neither seem to have the right vibe, not to mention there would be such a fame imbalance if paired with Steve Martin, who is still our bet.

There are some past cast members who have been floated for Vance on X and in publications like the Daily Beast. He shares a passing similarity to Taran Killam, and since Killam left the show in 2016 on tense terms (and was public about his frustrations with Michaels having Trump host in 2015), casting him as Vance could serve as an act of peacemaking for the show’s 50th season. Will Forte, who was floated by political journalist Jessica Yellin, has more of an audience-pop factor, but he never seemed comfortable doing straight political impressions, like when took over George W. Bush in 2004 only to be replaced by Jason Sudeikis in 2006. Yellin also floated Sudeikis, who had success impersonating Biden during the Obama years. When he was on the show, Sudeikis’s impersonations were more fun-loving than hard-hitting satirical, so would be a wrong fit here. Aidy Bryant is not only a guaranteed pop but excels at satirizing snide pieces of shit in Trump’s orbit, like William Barr in 2019 and especially Ted Cruz in 2021 and 2022. She seems like the most likely option if the show doesn’t choose a current cast member or former host.

Zach Galifianakis got some tweets and a Daily Beast mention as a former-host option. It’s hard to see why that is other than the beard, but to be fair, he does have a beard. Also, Galifianakis is on the new season of Only Murders with Martin. But Galifianakis hasn’t appeared on SNL since the 40th-anniversary special in 2015, so it’s possible he isn’t on the show’s radar for cameos or drop-ins. Of the past hosts, Shane Gillis jumps out as a particularly charged option. Michaels is clearly very fond of Gillis and has expressed regrets about what happened to him. Gillis doesn’t look that much like Vance, but the two have partially overlapping fan bases of die-hard conspiracy-theory-curious dudes. He doesn’t have the pop factor, but it would get a lot of attention online.

Who we think will play him:

Martin Short! He looks absolutely nothing like Vance and is significantly older, but Short wouldn’t be cast in a vacuum. Getting Short onboard would be part of the reason Martin accepts playing Walz, whether it’s Martin’s, Michaels’s, Short’s, or honestly, our idea.

Marty is prone to do some normie political comedy from time to time and has a history of playing annoying characters with odious personalities. Sure, it wouldn’t extend post-election, but it’s hard to imagine Maya Rudolph making weekly appearances as Kamala Harris after November too. Right now, Michaels isn’t looking for a J.D. Vance for a long time, but a good time, which in this case would literally be a Short time. While presidential elections happen every four years, 50th seasons of television shows happen only once. Politics aside, Michaels will always support nostalgia, self-reference, and casting his friends."

“I said, ‘Lorne, I’m not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.’ I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.”

The time commitment required to play a character like Walz — who would likely be recurring through the start of the season — was also a factor in Martin’s decision.

Martin and his “Only Murders in the Building” co-star Martin Short are currently in the middle of their “Dukes of Funnytown” tour.

The tour may have been another contributing factor in Martin’s decision to pass on the chance to play Walz, given that he and Short have already booked shows on several weekends between the season premiere of “SNL” on September 28 and election day on November 5.

Martin and Short being on the road could also create one more hiccup in the sketch show’s fall casting, given that Short previously played Vice President Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, in 2021.

Should Lorne Michaels reach out to Short, and should Short want to reprise his role as Emhoff, he would only have a handful of Saturdays available before election day that wouldn’t conflict with his and Martin’s tour — but one of those dates does happen to be Season 50’s opening night on September 28.

Short was a former cast member on the tenth season of “SNL,” appearing in episodes from 1984 to 1985. Martin, on the other hand, was never a salaried cast member, but he has hosted the show 16 times, second only to Alec Baldwin, who has hosted on 17 separate Saturdays.

Martin first hosted “Saturday Night Live” in 1976.

Though fans won’t get to see Martin’s take on Tim Walz, Maya Rudolph will be back as Kamala Harris, according to Deadline.

Pre-production on her Apple TV+ series “Loot” has been pushed due to “scheduling reasons,” which, reading between the lines, strongly hints that Rudolph will be busy this fall with a different TV show.

All eyes will likely now turn to other potential contenders to play Walz. Social media has already thrown out some names, including Jim O’Heir from “Parks and Rec,” John Goodman, Jim Gaffigan, and even Danny DeVito.

What say you, Lorne?"

With Maya Rudolph’s wildly popular impression of Kamala Harris on “Saturday Night Live,” fans clamored to see who the late-night comedy show would pick to play Harris’ new running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

With similar hairstyles and their signature glasses, many fans quickly drew comparisons between Walz and Martin, who’s been a frequent “SNL” guest but never a formal cast member.

The Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday that “SNL” producer Lorne Michaels called Martin to offer him the role on the upcoming 50th season, premiering Sept. 28, which he declined.

“I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,” Martin said. “I said, ‘Lorne, I’m not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.’ I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.”

Although Martin initially leaned into the fun, writing on social platform Threads that he “just learned that Tim Walz wants to go on the road with Marty Short,” he also noted the impression comes with a long-term commitment of performing on the show.

“It’s ongoing,” Martin told the Times. “It’s not like you do it once and get applause and never do it again. Again, they need a real impressionist to do that. They’re gonna find somebody really, really good. I’d be struggling.”

Rudolph, for her part, will reportedly reprise her Emmy-winning role on the show as Kamala Harris, and she seems to understand the undertaking. Deadline reported that Rudolph pushed the shooting schedule for the comedy series “Loot” from August to January to accommodate playing the role through the election season. Rudolph executive produces and stars in the series.

After Harris revealed Walz as her pick for Vice President should she emerge victorious this November, viewers were quick to dream up their own choice for who might play the Minnesota governor when he inevitably appears in a future SNL episode. With SNL alum Maya Rudolph already set to portray the Democratic presidential nominee (according to Deadline ), Martin, for many, felt like the obvious choice to play her running mate.

The Father of the Bride and Only Murders in the Building star tells The Los Angeles Times that SNL mastermind Lorne Michaels has already called him with an offer to play Walz for an unspecified amount of time. It’s an enticing offer that Martin says he politely declined.

“I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,” he explains. “I said, ‘Lorne, I’m not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.’ I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.”

“ ""They’re gonna find somebody really, really good. I’d be struggling.

Although Martin has a lengthy history with the long-running New York sketch comedy series that has seen him featured as a host more than a dozen times, it wasn’t enough to convince him to commit to an extended stay. The nearly 79-year-old actor says it would simply be too much for him to return as the same character over a long period of time.

“It’s ongoing,” Martin continues. “It’s not like you do it once and get applause and never do it again. Again, they need a real impressionist to do that. They’re gonna find somebody really, really good. I’d be struggling.”

SNL is set to return for its 50th season next month, and Martin’s staying busy, too. The actor will return for Only Murders in the Building Season 4 along with his two co-stars, Selina Gomez and Martin Short, on August 27. In March, a two-part documentary about his life titled Steve! (Martin) released on Apple TV+. It sounds like Michaels is on the hunt for an actor to play Walz, but it’s currently unclear who will get the part.

Steve Martin has turned down playing Tim Walz on Saturday Night Live.,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/07/entertainment/steve-martin-declined-tim-walz-snl/index.html,"CNN —

Steve Martin has finally weighed in on all the online speculation about whether he will play newly minted vice presidential candidate Tim Walz on “Saturday Night Live.”

The comedian and actor told the Los Angeles Times in an interview published on Wednesday that he was approached regarding the possibility by “SNL” creator Lorne Michaels that morning, but declined.

“I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,” Martin told The Times.

“I said, ‘Lorne, I’m not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy,’” he added. “I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.”

Martin also pointed to the “ongoing” nature of doing an impression of a politician on “SNL” during an election cycle.

“It’s not like you do it once and get applause and never do it again. Again, they need a real impressionist to do that. They’re gonna find somebody really, really good. I’d be struggling,” the “Only Murders in the Building” star said.

CNN has reached out to representatives for both Martin and “SNL” for further comment.

CNN reported last week that fellow “SNL” alum Maya Rudolph will be returning to play Kamala Harris on the upcoming 50th season of the show. With the news earlier this week that Harris had chosen Minnesota Gov. Walz as her running mate, speculation ran rampant as to who would play him on the long-running sketch show.

Martin – who has hosted “SNL” over 15 times and has also frequently appeared as a special guest on the show over the years – was on the top of that list.

He even fanned the flames himself this week, when he posted to social media platform Threads, “I just learned that Tim Walz wants to go on the road with Marty Short” – in reference to his “Only Murders” costar.

“Saturday Night Live” will premiere its landmark Season 50 on September 28."

Tim Walz, who has been tapped as Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris‘ running mate. The SNL producer offered Martin the role, the Los Angeles Times reported, but Martin turned it down.

“I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,” Martin told the LA Times. “I said, ‘Lorne, I’m not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.’ I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.”

Maya Rudolph recently answered the comedy gods prayers with her decision to return to Saturday Night Live as Vice President Kamala Harris. And following the announcement Tuesday of Walz as Harris’ running mate, online users had begun to brainstorm who could star as Rudolph’s right-hand man. Martin played along giving fans some hope (though he officially declined later to Michaels), posting on Threads Tuesday: “I just learned that Tim Walz wants to go on the road with Marty Short.”

Martin’s wispy white hair and toothy grin have an uncanny resemblance to Walz, with one X user saying, “SNL get Steve Martin on the phone NOW” and another Thread user adding, “I don’t know who made this meme but this is the only way,” featuring an image of Rudolph and Martin on a campaign flyer.

Martin has been on the comedy sketch show many times before. He’s appeared on SNL at least 35 times, including serving as a host 16 times. Although never a cast member, Martin first appeared in 1976, and last hosted in 2022 alongside Only Murders in the Building co-star Martin Short.

Short and Martin, who became close friends on the set of Western comedy Three Amigos in 1986, have toured as a comedic duo for years, from the the two-sided interview stage show A Very Stupid Conversation to Netflix comedy special An Evening You’ll Forget for the Rest of Your Life (2018), which Rolling Stone called “wryly hip, cozily nostalgic but, also, unexpectedly touching.” Short and Martin are also on their “The Dukes of Funnytown” tour, which has dates through November and stops in cities like Nashville, Louisville, and Detroit.

Steve Martin has turned down playing Tim Walz on Saturday Night Live.,https://www.thewrap.com/who-should-play-tim-walz-on-snl/,"“Saturday Night Live” has already booked Maya Rudolph to return as Vice President Kamala Harris, but who should play her newly named running mate, Midwestern nice guy and governor of Minnesota Tim Walz?

The most apparently obvious candidate — similarly white-haired comedian Steve Martin — has, sadly, already turned down the gig as of Wednesday. But fear not, we’ve got plenty of other suggestions for Lorne Michaels to consider, including A-listers like Tom Hanks, Brad Pitt and John Goodman.

Read on for our full list below!

Tom Hanks

The very wholesome two-time Oscar winner Hanks, who is 68, has hosted “Saturday Night Live” a whopping 10 times, including as Halloween icon David S. Pumpkins. And we’ve already seen him with white hair when he played heroic pilot Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger in the 2016 biopic from Clint Eastwood. And he kind of looked like Walz when he hosted a COVID-era “SNL” from his house when the actor was bald and wearing glasses.

Jim Gaffigan

Jim Gaffigan (Credit: Gotham/FilmMagic)

Gaffigan, native Midwesterner (who was born in Elgin, Illinois and attended high school in LaPorte, Indiana), famously does not swear in his stand-up — which makes two solid arguments why he’d be a great fit for the job. And he’s only two years younger than Walz. You probably know him best from film roles in “13 Going on 30,” “17 Again” or “Unfrosted.” He’s also starred in his own series: 2000’s “Welcome to New York” and “The Jim Gaffigan Show,” which ran from 2015 to 2016 on TV Land.

Al Franken

Former “SNL” star Franken, who’s 73, has all the necessary requirements to step into Walz’s shoes: He’s from Minnesota, he’s been both a politician and a comedian … and he knows how to correctly pronounce the VP candidate’s last name. He shared a photo of himself with the Minnesota governor to X on Tuesday with a caption that read, “Veteran, teacher, football coach, congressman, governor. And he’s not weird!”

Julia Sweeney

Sweeney, the now white-haired 64-year-old comedian actress and author, who was on “SNL” from 1990 to 1994, suggested on Wednesday that she should be the one to play Walz. Her best-known character was Pat, an ambiguously androgynous person whose gender remained a mystery. The subsequent movie wasn’t great, but we also love Sweeney for the documentary “God Said Ha!” and her consulting work on “Sex and the City” and “Desperate Housewives.”

Danny DeVito

“Taxi” and “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” star DeVito is better known for playing short-tempered curmudgeons, but in a pinch, we could see the New Jersey native gently slam GOP rival JD Vance with the actual Waltz quote: “I can’t wait to debate the guy. That is, if he’s willing to get off the couch and show up.”

Jack McBrayer

A former “30 Rock” regular, McBrayer has a reputation for being politeness personified, particularly as NBC page Kenneth Parcell. He kept the niceness going with his Apple TV+ series “Hello, Jack! The Kindness Show.” The actor, who also voiced the Fix-It Felix character in the “Wreck-It Ralph” films, hails from the South, not the Midwest, but he did attend the University of Evansville in Indiana.

John Goodman

As the patriarch of “Roseanne” and spin-off “The Conners,” Goodman has spent a lot of time in the Midwest (fictional Lanford, Illinois, to be precise), and we think he’d be a great pick. Of course, when we hear that voice, we also think of Sully from “Monsters, Inc.”

Molly Kearney

Kearney just announced their exit from “SNL” a few days ago, but maybe NBC honchos could woo them back? The 32-year-old, who uses they/them pronouns, convincingly played a senior citizen twice their age in a recent “Elder PSA” skit. After playing more than one memorable nun on the sketch comedy series, Kearney joked to Cleveland Magazine earlier this year, “I’m either men or nuns, and I love my typecast. I’ll do it for the rest of my life.”

Brad Pitt

Brad Pitt (Credit: Getty Images)

OK, we’re not seriously suggesting that Pitt play Walz, but it’s as good an occasion as any to remember the time he donned a white wig to play Dr. Anthony Fauci in an April 2020 skit. Fauci had jokingly requested the “Fight Club” star should play him and Pitt was happy to comply for the one-shot appearance."
Steve Martin has turned down playing Tim Walz on Saturday Night Live.,https://www.comingsoon.net/tv/news/1827039-steve-martin-tim-walz-snl,"Steve Martin has issued a statement explaining why he turned down Lorne Michaels’ offer to play Kamala Harris’ running mate, Tim Walz, on Saturday Night Live.

Some of the most lucrative roles on SNL are portraying important political figures during election years, and almost as soon as Walz was announced as Kamala Harris’ running mate, there was speculation about who would play him on SNL alongside the returning maya Rudolph as Kamala Harris.

The popular choice was legendary comedy actor, writer, and banjo player Steve Martin. Martin does bear some resemblance to Walz, and Martin even joked about it on social media by quipping, “I just learned that Tim Walz wants to go on the road with Marty Short.”

The Saturday Night Live producer obviously thought Martin was the chosen one, as he swiftly contacted Martin about playing Walz on the show. But Martin wasn’t that keen and declined the offer.

Steve Martin rules out playing Tim Walz

In a statement to the LA Times, Martin said,

“I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no, I said, ‘Lorne, I’m not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.’ I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.”

Beyond that, Martin felt it was a bit too much of a commitment.

“It’s ongoing. It’s not like you do it once and get applause and never do it again. Again, they need a real impressionist to do that. They’re gonna find somebody really, really good. I’d be struggling.”

That’s not to say we won’t see Martin on the show again in the near future. Saturday Night Live enters its 50th season on September 28, 2024. That landmark season is very likely to bring big names from the show’s past back for guest stints and skits."

After Harris announced Walz as her right hand Tuesday for her Democratic presidential bid, social media users on X (formerly Twitter) quickly named Martin as a front-runner to parody the Minnesota governor on the NBC sketch show.

Apparently catching wind of the internet chatter, Martin, who bears a resemblance to the politician with white hair and glasses, reacted with a cheeky response on social media.

“I just learned that Tim Walz wants to go on the road with Marty Short,” the actor wrote Tuesday on Instagram’s Threads, nodding to his pal and fellow comedian Martin Short. Martin and Short, co-stars of “Only Murders in the Building,” are slated to go on a U.S. comedy tour this fall.

Martin told the Los Angeles Times on Wednesday that “SNL” creator Lorne Michaels reached out to him earlier that day to offer him the gig, but the comedian explained why he politely turned Michaels down.

“I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,” Martin told the Times of the offered recurring gig for the show’s 50th season. “I said, ‘Lorne, I’m not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.’ I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.”

There was one more thing that gave the Emmy winner, who will turn 79 on Aug. 14, pause: the time commitment.

“It’s ongoing,” Martin says. “It’s not like you do it once and get applause and never do it again. Again, they need a real impressionist to do that. They’re gonna find somebody really, really good. I’d be struggling.”

Fans of “SNL” will recall that actor Alec Baldwin spent years playing Donald Trump after taking on the role before the 2016 election. “SNL” mainstay Maya Rudolph has also regularly portrayed Harris since 2019 and will be reprising her role through the current presidential campaign, Deadline reported.

After chatter on Threads escalated, SNL boss Lorne Michaels today ended up calling the Only Murders in the Building star about impersonating Tim Walz, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Sadly, the veteran comic and former SNL mainstay said no.

“I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,” Martin told the paper. “I said, ‘Lorne, I’m not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.’ I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.”

Martin added that such a commitment requires, well, a commitment to the NBC show. “It’s ongoing,” Martin continued with the Times. “It’s not like you do it once and get applause and never do it again.

The Only Murders In the Building actor is now weighing in on social media after he was collectively cast to parody Walz on the NBC sketch show.

“I just learned that Tim Walz wants to go on the road with Marty Short,” Martin posted on Threads after fans hoped he would play the Minnesota governor.

CNN debated who should play Walz on SNL, citing Vanity Fair, which suggested Martin, Al Franken, Jim Gaffigan, and Jim O’Heir.

O’Heir took to social media to respond to suggestions that he should play Walz on the NBC late-night comedy show but had an issue with the photo they used of him on CNN.

“I don’t mind being in the mix,” O’Heir posted on X, the microblogging platform formerly known as Twitter. “But that’s the best pic of me that they could come up with? LOL.”

SNL has not shared who they are contemplating to play Walz when the show premieres this fall.

Deadline recently reported that Maya Rudolph would return to SNL to play Vice President Harris in the final stretch of the 2024 presidential race. Rudolph won an Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series in 2020 for her portrayal of Harris.

Fans say Steve Martin, who’s appeared on “SNL” many times over the years and guest-hosted the show sixteen times (second only to Alec Baldwin), looks like Walz. So logically, they’re campaigning for Martin to play Walz in the upcoming season of “Saturday Night Live.”

Martin said showrunner Lorne Michaels asked him to play the Democratic vice presidential candidate, but turned it down.

Martin said he’d struggle with the role of her running mate because playing Walz would likely require multiple appearances both before and after the election.

Martin previously played Trump advisor Roger Stone in a 2019 skit, but has long insisted impressions are not his strength.

“I don’t do impressions. And I don’t even try to. And If I ever try to, just backstage, Marty (Martin Short) will mock me,” Martin told syracuse.com in 2019. “But I was asked to do Roger Stone and I thought, ‘You know, he and I are pretty close.’ I listened to his voice and I thought, ‘OK, he’s just a little bit gravelly.’ And I thought, you know, I could do this. And then the incredible help from the ‘SNL’ makeup crew, who did a great job -- people couldn’t even tell I was wearing a fake nose. It’s incredible what they do.”

Martin, who co-stars with Short in “Only Murders in the Building” and frequently tours together, further joked about the hype on Threads: “I just learned that Tim Walz wants to go on the road with Marty Short.”

It’s unclear who will play Walz on the upcoming 50th season of “SNL” instead. According to the Hollywood Reporter, social media users have suggested other candidates like Danny DeVito, Tom Arnold, Bradley Whitford, Jim Gaffigan, Bill Murray and Kyle Chandler.

Casting also has not been announced for former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee in 2024, and his running mate J.D. Vance. Alec Baldwin won an Emmy Award for his portrayal of Trump, but “SNL” cast member James Austin Johnson played Trump most recently during the show’s 49th season.

Rudolph was a “Saturday Night Live” cast member from 2000 to 2007, but has returned to guest-host the show and played Harris when she was President Joe Biden’s running mate in 2020.

“It’s really such an honor to be involved in any presidential race, and this one is a real doozy. So it is really an honor,” Rudolph told ET in 2020 “I got to meet her, and she is so fantastic. She is so incredible, she is so energizing and I just feel so good to be associated with someone so positive.”

“I definitely tried to make her fun because I do feel that when I see her. You can tell she loves life and she is real and she is honest and she has no problem speaking her mind and being forthright about it, which I think is so important right now,” the comedian shared at the time. “But she is also so joyful and you see her dancing in the room and all this stuff. She is just a great human, and I forgot what it felt like to see that and to see something so positive. It feels so good to see her out there.”

“Saturday Night Live” returns for its 50th season on Sept. 28. A movie about the original 1975 cast, “Saturday Night,” directed by Jason Reitman, is due in theaters Oct. 11."
Steve Martin has turned down playing Tim Walz on Saturday Night Live.,https://www.thewrap.com/steve-martin-tim-walz-snl-role/,"Steve Martin won’t be playing Tim Walz on “Saturday Night Live.”

Despite much speculation following Tuesday’s announcement that the Minnesota governor was Kamala Harris’ pick for vice president, Martin confirmed to The Los Angeles Times that Lorne Michaels asked him to play the role and he said no.

“I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,” Martin said. “I said, ‘Lorne, I’m not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.’ I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.”

Maya Rudolph is already set to reprise appearances as Harris through the election. The ongoing commitment was one of the reasons Martin was hesitant to sign on for the political season.

“It’s ongoing,” he said. “It’s not like you do it once and get applause and never do it again. Again, they need a real impressionist to do that. They’re gonna find somebody really, really good. I’d be struggling.”

Walz took the internet by storm following the announcement that he was joining the Democrats’ presidential campaign ticket. Harris’ running mate earned his first viral moment while the duo spoke together in Philadelphia Tuesday night. He called out his excitement to debate Donald Trump’s running mate JD Vance.

“I’ve gotta tell you, I can’t wait to debate the guy – that is, if he’s willing to get off the couch and show up,” Walz said, likely referencing a false rumor that Vance had written in his book about having relations with a sofa.

Michaels still has some time to find the right fit to play Walz. The 50th season of “Saturday Night Live” begins Sept. 28."

The list?

Who would play the Minnesota governor on “Saturday Night Live,” of course.

But Martin, frequent “SNL” guest host and veteran actor-comedian, had to turn producer Lorne Michaels down.

“I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,” Martin told the Los Angeles Times. “I said, ‘Lorne, I’m not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.’ I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.”

Martin, who has an Emmy, five Grammys and an honorary Oscar, previously acknowledged the public call for him to play Walz by posting a good-natured line on Threads:

“I just learned that Tim Walz wants to go on the road with Marty Short.”

But Martin, 78, who is again nominated for an Emmy alongside co-star Martin Short for Hulu’s “Only Murders in the Building,” pointed out that the “SNL” gig would require appearances over multiple episodes.

“It’s ongoing,” he told the LA Times. “It’s not like you do it once and get applause and never do it again. Again, they need a real impressionist to do that. They’re gonna find somebody really, really good. I’d be struggling.”

Other names in the public conversation about who will play Walz include actor and comedian Jim Gaffigan; former “SNL” writer and star Al Franken, who is also a former Minnesota senator (who shared a hearty endorsement of Walz on Instagram); and sketch comedy veteran Rick Moranis (”SCTV,” “Ghostbusters”).

Maya Rudolph, an “SNL” cast alum who already plays Kamala Harris on the show, will be back to play the Democratic presidential nominee.

Rudolph, who debuted her “SNL” impression of then-Sen. Harris 2019, won an Emmy for her performance as the vice president in 2020 and another Emmy in 2021 for guest hosting the show, among her five career Emmys.

Deadline reports that production on Rudolph’s Apple TV+ series “Loot” will be delayed as she returns to play the vice president again when “SNL” enters its 50th season Sept. 28.

Rudolph is set to play Harris through the presidential election.

Harris herself has praised the actor for her impression.

“I grew up watching ‘Saturday Night Live’ so the thought that anyone would be in any way depicting me on ‘Saturday Night Live,’ I was a bit overwhelmed,” she told Seth Meyers in 2019. “But I will tell you that I fully intend to make sure she has a good eight years of work on ‘SNL.’”

Cue Harris’ famous laugh.

Rudolph is up for four awards at the 2024 Emmys in September. She’s nominated for guest hosting “SNL” and co-writing the music and lyrics her oh-so-mother Mother’s Day monologue song as well as for her performances as Molly Novak in “Loot” and Connie the Hormone Monstress in the Netflix animated series “Big Mouth.”

Steve Martin has turned down playing Tim Walz on Saturday Night Live.,https://www.film-news.co.uk/news/UK/111885/Steve-Martin-turns-down-Tim-Walz-role-on-SNL,"Steve Martin has turned down the chance to impersonate potential Vice President Tim Walz on Saturday Night Live.

The actor has been touted as the front runner to play Kamala Harris' running mate on SNL.

However, he's confirmed he isn't interested in taking on the much-publicised part, revealing he'd already spoken to SNL producer, Lorne Michaels about appearing on the cult show.

""I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,"" Steve, 68, told the Los Angeles Times.

""I said, 'Lorne, I'm not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.' I was picked because I have grey hair and glasses.""

He added that committing to parodying the governor of Minnesota didn't align with his current work schedule.

""It's ongoing. It's not like you do it once and get applause and never do it again. Again, they need a real impressionist to do that. They're going to find somebody really, really good. I'd be struggling.""

Maya Rudolph played Kamala Harris on SNL in 2019 when she ran for the democratic nomination for president, and has confirmed she'll reprise the role in the 50th season of the show.

""I think it starts with trying to get someone's voice if you can,"" the actress said in 2020. ""There's nothing crazily overt about Sen. Harris, but I have to tell you, when I got to (SNL) and they put the wig on me, it was done."""

Steve Martin has turned down playing Tim Walz on Saturday Night Live.,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/al-franken-tim-walz-colin-220302845.html,"It’s an election year and with all of the media frenzy and speculation, a bevy of new faces have stoically entered the national political fray. This sort of national political exposure comes for these career civil servants at a major inflection point for the country. So, naturally, this means that their parody equivalent will mock everything about them when they appear in Studio 8H at 30 Rockefeller for Saturday Night Live in a matter of weeks.

SNL returns for its 50th season with new episodes on Sept. 28 while the presidential election is set for Nov. 5. This gives the sketch comedy series six episodes before the race is decided to perfect caricatures of our nation’s next leaders. News broke last week that SNL alum and comedy superwoman Maya Rudolph will return to portray Harris (and let’s face it, would we ever want anyone else?). With his involuntary manslaughter charge dismissed, Alec Baldwin is available to return to his Emmy-winning turn as Donald Trump — or perhaps current castmember James Austin Johnson, who has portrayed the former president over the last few years, will reprise the role.

More from The Hollywood Reporter

This leaves the comic actors who will portray J.D. Vance and Tim Walz, the two veep candidates, yet to be cast. Of course, online speculation began the moment that their respective attachments to the GOP and Democratic tickets were announced, and within 48 hours, one of the obvious candidates publicly stated his lack of interest (more on that below). So, who should it be? The trick with an impression is to extract the nuance of their speech, any idiosyncrasies or mannerisms, and — you betcha! — any catchphrases they deliver. Here are The Hollywood Reporter’s picks to round out the top contenders of the 2024 presidential campaigns.

Tim Walz

Steve Martin

The hair. The glasses. It was blindingly obvious to anyone who knows Steve Martin, the treasured comic actor prone to frequent SNL hosting bookings (he’s a member of the 16-Timers Club) and cameo appearances. Many don’t even realize he was never a castmember. An SNL legend — his classic “King Tut” performance turned 46 this year — what could be more perfect than Martin returning to spoof the potential next VP? Not doing it. Martin told the Los Angeles Times on Wednesday that he turned down Lorne Michaels’ request to play the vice presidential candidate.

“I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,” Martin told the outlet. “I said, ‘Lorne, I’m not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.’ I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.”

Bradley Whitford

If SNL’s casting department is looking for someone with that white man, Midwestern, on-the-cusp-of-Gen-X Walz look, and Martin is unwilling to come on board, the next best thing is West Wing alum and Get Out villain Bradley Whitford. While he’d have to ditch the beard if he’s sporting a fuzzy face in late September, Whitford ticks plenty of boxes: he’s just 4 years older than Walz; their hairline and color nearly match; and Whitford is a staunch Democrat with a dry wit. He recently had one of the better lines in the White Dudes for Harris Zoom call when he mentioned the “rainbow if beige” he saw on his screen filled with white men.

Al Franken

Once again, the glasses could make it work. SNL-player-turned-U.S. Senator Al Franken, who resigned in disgrace (and some say, without due process) during a #MeToo scandal in 2018, could portray Walz. If he were to do so, it would be the strangest melding of politics and comedy seen since…well, since Franken won a U.S. Senate seat in 2008. The 73-year-old has also said that he regrets resigning from his Senate role after one of his accuser’s accounts of his acts of sexual misconduct were found to be exaggerated and that he may run to gain his seat back. Could a role on SNL be his springboard for a return to politics? It would be a bold move but may be a risk that Michaels will want to take.

The rest: Chris Farley was floated by many online speculators for the Walz role, but he is still dead, so, no. Danny Devito, the comedy legend, is always welcome. John Goodman got some mentions, too; he has a great history of SNL appearances (remember his Linda Tripp?), and like DeVito, should always be offered a seat at the table.

J.D. Vance

Colin Jost

The torch of a talented writer who sat in the head writer chair at Studio 8H going on to portray a GOP VP hopeful could be passed from Tina Fey to Colin Jost if he were to take on the role of J.D. Vance this season. Trump’s ripe-for-satire pick of a running mate has been off to a wobbly start to the campaign, and the public knows enough about his backstory and personal life that Jost would have plenty to pick (on) from. The writers room top dog (along with co-head writer Michael Che) might have to give up his golfing habit for a few weeks to prep, but it would be nice to see him step out front of the “Weekend Update” desk, slap on some eyeliner and give Vance a ribbing that could unite the parties in laughter.

Jason Sudeikis

The beloved SNL alum and Ted Lasso himself is wildly popular for the latter, but if he were thinking ahead, he’d be gunning for this gig. After all, the Ted Lasso love won’t go on forever. His nine-season run was full of funny-as-hell original characters and impressions of three major political figures over this tenure: President George W. Bush, current President Joe Biden, and onetime presidential hopeful Mitt Romney. Why not come back for a fourth one, Jason? I mean, as savvy SNL fanatics, or those who just watch it way too closely, will recall, he already portrayed a guy named Vance on the beloved “What Up With That?” series of sketches.

Shane Gillis

The story on Shane Gillis and SNL could have a redemption chapter if he were to be offered and then absolutely nail the Vance impression that the people all want and need. Gillis was fired from the show ahead of the 2019 season when ethnic slurs he’d used in the past were resurfaced. Since then, he launched the very, very popular Matt and Shane’s Secret Podcast and was invited to return as an SNL host in season 49. He was shaky at best, but there were some laughs in the episode. Michaels has also expressed regret over what happened with his casting on the show. Perhaps this is just too perfect? Maybe so, but maybe not for everyone still feeling stung by Gillis’ language and tone.

The rest: Current SNL cast member Mikey Day has got the look and would totally work as Vance. Ditto for former castmember Taran Killam — although it seems his departure was less than amiable, and he was certainly upset that Trump was allowed to host the show amid his first presidential campaign. Maybe the show should do some meta-casting and go with Gabriel Basso, the actor who portrayed Vance in Hillbilly Elegy, Ron Howard’s widely panned Netflix adaptation of his memoir?

Fans made the call within hours of Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party's presidential nominee, announcing her running mate in the 2024 election. Maya Rudolph has already confirmed she'll reprise Harris on the upcoming 50th season, People reported.

Martin, 78, inadvertently caused a sensation when he wrote on Threads, ""I just learned that Tim Walz wants to go on the road with Marty Short.""

One person on X promptly posted a side-by-side photo of the actor and Walz, writing, ""So Steve Martin is definitely gonna play Walz on SNL right.""

Another person added, ""SNL get Steve Martin on the phone NOW.""

The buzz led to ""SNL"" creator Lorne Michaels inviting Martin onto the late night show, but he declined.

""I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,"" Martin told the Los Angeles Times after disclosing how Michaels had called him. ""I said, 'Lorne, I’m not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.' I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.""

Martin also highlighted how much of a commitment it would be to take on the role.

""It’s ongoing. It’s not like you do it once and get applause and never do it again. Again, they need a real impressionist to do that. They’re gonna find somebody really, really good. I’d be struggling,"" he said.

Days earlier, Deadline confirmed that Rudolph would return to the late-night sketch comedy show. She originally took on the role in 2019, when Harris ran for the democratic nomination for president. She later spoke to Harris about the role, saying it was ""embarrassing"" as she detailed her approach to portraying the vice president.

""In terms of Senator Harris, I didn't have an impression because I wasn't walking around the house doing my 'Kamala.' But I think it starts with trying to get someone's voice if you can,"" she said, according to People. ""There's nothing crazily overt about Sen.

So when people noticed Martin has a passing resemblance to Tim Walz, the Democratic candidate for vice president, there were calls on social media for him to portray Walz for the upcoming 50th season of “SNL.” The show has turned to famous actors and comedians in recent years to portray political candidates, including Alec Baldwin as Donald Trump and Jim Carrey as Joe Biden.

But fans of Martin shouldn’t get their hopes up, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Martin, 79, politely but quickly declined an offer Wednesday from “SNL” producer Lorne Michaels to portray Walz on the show, The Times reports.

“I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,” Martin said, according to The Times. “I said, ‘Lorne, I’m not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.’ I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.”

Former “SNL” cast member Maya Rudolph has agreed to return to portray Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, reports say. Current cast member James Austin Johnson has been portraying Trump in recent seasons.

Martin’s history with “SNL” goes back to its early days in the 1970s, when he appeared with original cast members such as Dan Akroyd, Gilda Radner and John Belushi. His memorable moments include performing “King Tut” and the “Two Wild and Crazy Guys” skits with Akroyd.

The internet had already decided who should play him, but it's now being reported that they are passing on the role.

Steve Martin won’t be playing Tim Walz on season 50 of “SNL” despite fans outright begging him to do so.

“I said, ‘Lorne, I’m not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.’ I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.”

The time commitment required to play a character like Walz — who would likely be recurring through the start of the season — was also a factor in Martin’s decision.

Martin and his “Only Murders in the Building” co-star Martin Short are currently in the middle of their “Dukes of Funnytown” tour.

The tour may have been another contributing factor in Martin’s decision to pass on the chance to play Walz, given that he and Short have already booked shows on several weekends between the season premiere of “SNL” on September 28 and election day on November 5.

Martin and Short being on the road could also create one more hiccup in the sketch show’s fall casting, given that Short previously played Vice President Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, in 2021.

Should Lorne Michaels reach out to Short, and should Short want to reprise his role as Emhoff, he would only have a handful of Saturdays available before election day that wouldn’t conflict with his and Martin’s tour — but one of those dates does happen to be Season 50’s opening night on September 28.

Short was a former cast member on the tenth season of “SNL,” appearing in episodes from 1984 to 1985. Martin, on the other hand, was never a salaried cast member, but he has hosted the show 16 times, second only to Alec Baldwin, who has hosted on 17 separate Saturdays.

Martin first hosted “Saturday Night Live” in 1976.

Though fans won’t get to see Martin’s take on Tim Walz, Maya Rudolph will be back as Kamala Harris, according to Deadline.

Pre-production on her Apple TV+ series “Loot” has been pushed due to “scheduling reasons,” which, reading between the lines, strongly hints that Rudolph will be busy this fall with a different TV show.

Despite much speculation following Tuesday’s announcement that the Minnesota governor was Kamala Harris’ pick for vice president, Martin confirmed to The Los Angeles Times that Lorne Michaels asked him to play the role and he said no.

“I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,” Martin said. “I said, ‘Lorne, I’m not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.’ I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.”

Maya Rudolph is already set to reprise appearances as Harris through the election. The ongoing commitment was one of the reasons Martin was hesitant to sign on for the political season.

“It’s ongoing,” he said. “It’s not like you do it once and get applause and never do it again. Again, they need a real impressionist to do that. They’re gonna find somebody really, really good. I’d be struggling.”

Walz took the internet by storm following the announcement that he was joining the Democrats’ presidential campaign ticket. Harris’ running mate earned his first viral moment while the duo spoke together in Philadelphia Tuesday night. He called out his excitement to debate Donald Trump’s running mate JD Vance.

“I’ve gotta tell you, I can’t wait to debate the guy – that is, if he’s willing to get off the couch and show up,” Walz said, likely referencing a false rumor that Vance had written in his book about having relations with a sofa.

Michaels still has some time to find the right fit to play Walz. The 50th season of “Saturday Night Live” begins Sept. 28.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Steve Martin’s next role will not be the Midwestern politician the internet hoped he’d portray.

With Maya Rudolph’s wildly popular impression of Kamala Harris on “Saturday Night Live,” fans clamored to see who the late-night comedy show would pick to play Harris’ new running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

With similar hairstyles and their signature glasses, many fans quickly drew comparisons between Walz and Martin, who's been a frequent “SNL” guest but never a formal cast member.

The Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday that “SNL” producer Lorne Michaels called Martin to offer him the role on the upcoming 50th season, premiering Sept. 28, which he declined.

“I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,” Martin said. “I said, ‘Lorne, I’m not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.’ I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.”

Although Martin initially leaned into the fun, writing on social platform Threads that he “just learned that Tim Walz wants to go on the road with Marty Short,” he also noted the impression comes with a long-term commitment of performing on the show.

“It’s ongoing,” Martin told the Times. “It’s not like you do it once and get applause and never do it again. Again, they need a real impressionist to do that. They’re gonna find somebody really, really good. I’d be struggling.”

Rudolph, for her part, will reportedly reprise her Emmy-winning role on the show as Kamala Harris, and she seems to understand the undertaking. Deadline reported that Rudolph pushed the shooting schedule for the comedy series “Loot” from August to January to accommodate playing the role through the election season. Rudolph executive produces and stars in the series.

The “Bridesmaids” actor first played “America’s funt” – or “fun aunt” – on “SNL” in 2019 when Harris was running for president and continued with the role after she was announced as Joe Biden’s running mate."

Steve Martin has turned down playing Tim Walz on Saturday Night Live.,https://www.cinemablend.com/television/steve-martin-jim-oheir-responded-fans-want-play-tim-walz-snl,"Once Kamala Harris announced that Tim Walz would be her vice presidential candidate, speculation immediately began about who would play the Minnesota governor on Saturday Night Live when it returns to the 2024 TV schedule for its 50th season. Fans pointed to comedians like Steve Martin, Jim Gaffigan, Jim O’Heir and more as possible actors to play Harris’ running mate . Now, the Only Murders in the Building star and Parks and Rec alum have responded to the fan-casting in the most on-brand ways.

How Steve Martin Responded To The SNL Dream Casting

Honestly, Steve Martin feels like a natural pick for this part. In the past, Saturday Night Live has had cast members, alums and long-time friends of the show come on to play politicians – famously, Alec Baldwin impersonated Donald Trump for a long time and Melissa McCarthy reprised her role as Sean Spicer multiple times. Considering Martin is not only in the five-timers club but has hosted 17 times across the series’ run, he has the experience to take on the gig.

Fans were loud and proud about the possibility of Martin joining Maya Rudolph (who will be back to play Kamala Harris ) on SNL this season, and of course, he had an on-brand response to it all, posting on Threads :

I just learned that Tim Walz wants to go on the road with Marty Short.

It feels so on-par of Steve Martin to joke about switching roles with Walz, and it’s even more on-brand because he brought his long-time pal and comedic partner Martin Short into the bit.

Season 4 of Only Murders in the Building premieres this summer, so of course Martin has Short on his mind. Plus, this joke was not only hilarious but a fun little reminder (at least to me) about their whodunnit.

Overall, Steve Martin has the history and comedic skills to kill it as Tim Walz on Saturday Night Live. However, per the LA Times (via Yahoo), he has turned down the gig, saying:

I wanted to say no and, by the way, [Lorne Michaels] wanted me to say no. I said, 'Lorne, I'm not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.' I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.

Luckily, there are a lot of other comedians that fans could see playing the part of the VP candidate, including one very funny Parks and Rec actor.

How Jim O’Heir Responded To Stories About Him, Tim Walz And SNL

Jim O’Heir played Jerry/Garry/Larry/Terry Gergich in the Parks and Rec cast . Let’s just say the Jerry energy was alive and well in a lot of reports about the actor being considered as a candidate to play Tim Walz.

CNN posted a side-by-side of four actors who fans had put up as potential Tim Walz impersonators. This included Martin, Al Franken, Jim Gaffigan and O’Heir. Notably, the Parks and Rec alum’s photo isn’t as refined as the others, which is totally something that would happen to Jerry. Responding to that photo, O’Heir took to X to write:

I don’t mind being in the mix but that’s the best pic of me that they could come up with? LOL

How To Watch Saturday Night Live (Image credit: NBC) You can go back and watch old episodes of SNL now and Season 50 once it starts airing with a Peacock subscription.

He makes such a valid point, and he did so in such a kind and silly way, much like Jerry would.

Overall, O’Heir is also a good pick for this part. While he doesn’t have the SNL experience of folks like Martin and Franken, Parks and Rec is in the NBC family, and the Jerry actor proved that he could hold his own with comedic powerhouses like Amy Poehler, Nick Offerman and Chris Pratt. I think he’d bring a fun Midwest charm to the part – much like he did on the beloved mockumentary – and it’d be such a great opportunity for him.

At this point, we still don’t know who will play Tim Walz, and we probably won’t until Saturday Night Live Season 50 premieres on September 28. Considering the show’s past with hiring incredible actors to play politicians and the fact that it’s in a historic season, I imagine they’ll bring out the big guns for these presidential parts."
Steve Martin has turned down playing Tim Walz on Saturday Night Live.,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/why-steve-martin-won-t-230151380.html,"Steve Martin won’t be gracing Studio 8H to impersonate a certain Midwest dad anytime soon.

Whenever a new politician gets vaulted onto the national stage, the internet scrambles to face-match them with their celebrity counterpart, its denizens generously taking it upon themselves to do the work of the Saturday Night Live casting team. Often these fan-castings go ignored, but something in the air was different on Tuesday when it was announced that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz would be Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate.

It wasn’t long before someone realized who Walz’s silver hair, glasses, and general folksy vibe reminded them of: Steve Martin. From there, the calls for Martin to return to SNL as Walz grew louder until the banjo-playing comedian himself acknowledged the noise. “I just learned that Tim Walz wants to go on the road with Marty Short,” Martin said on Threads, a reference to his longtime creative partnership with Short.

But Martin, famously a 16-time SNL host, has no desire to stake a claim on parodying the Democratic vice presidential nominee, according to the Los Angeles Times.

The newspaper reported on Wednesday afternoon that SNL head honcho Lorne Michaels had rung up Martin just hours earlier to ask him to play Walz on the show.

Who Should Play Tim Walz on ‘Saturday Night Live?’

Martin “politely and promptly” turned him down, the Times reported.

“I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,” the funnyman told the paper. “I said, ‘Lorne, I’m not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.’ I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.”

Nearly two decades the Minnesota governor’s senior, too, and with both a packed touring schedule and obligations as one of the stars of Hulu’s Only Murders in the Building, Martin implied he either couldn’t or wouldn’t commit to more than one appearance as Walz.

“It’s ongoing,” he said. “It’s not like you do it once and get applause and never do it again.”

The 50th season of SNL is set to kick off Sept. 28. Alum Maya Rudolph was previously confirmed to be returning to portray Harris, whom she first played in 2019 alongside Jim Carrey’s toothy Joe Biden and Alec Baldwin’s pouting Donald Trump.

The question remains: Who will be tapped to play Walz? While the late Chris Farley and Don Rickles are no longer around to slip on his gubernatorial shoes, a fictionalized version of Walz might yet take the shape of anybody from Danny DeVito to Jim Gaffigan to “an unknown 60-year-old man who took an improv class as a fun retirement activity.”

Or even—and here’s a novel suggestion—one of the people Lorne Michaels hired specifically because of their talent for comedic impressions. “Call me crazy,” actor Paul Scheer tweeted on Wednesday, “but I think one of the SNL cast members should play Tim Walz.”

Martin Turns Down Offer

Immediately after Harris chose Walz as her running mate earlier this week, Martin received a call from SNL creator and producer Lorne Michaels. Since Martin and Walz have a resemblance to one another, Michaels thought that he would be perfect to play the Minnesota governor.

Martin, however, wasn’t having it. He “politely and promptly” turned down the offer.

“I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,” Martin explained.

“I said, ‘Lorne, I’m not an impressionist,” Martin continued. “You need someone who can really nail the guy.’ I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.”

That’s true, but Steve Martin is also one of the funniest comedians of all time – which is the biggest selling point!

Martin was also put off by the time commitment that would come from agreeing to play Walz.

“It’s ongoing,” he stated. “It’s not like you do it once and get applause and never do it again. Again, they need a real impressionist to do that. They’re gonna find somebody really, really good. I’d be struggling.”

Steve Martin has politely declined SNL producer Lorne Michaels’ offer to play Tim Walz on the show:

Martin Is On Tour With Martin Short

Immediately after Walz was announced as Harris’ running mate, Martin took to Threads to address their resemblance.

“I just learned that Tim Walz wants to go on the road with Marty Short,” he wrote.

This was a reference to Martin’s Only Murders in the Building co-star Martin Short. The two of them are currently on their “Dukes of Funnytown” tour.

This tour was likely another reason why Martin turned down the offer to portray Walz. Various shows are already booked for the dates between the September 28 premiere of Saturday Night Live! and Election Day on November 5.

Short previously played Vice President Harris’ husband Doug Emhoff on Saturday Night Live! in 2021. Short was in the cast of Saturday Night Live! for season 10, appearing in episodes from 1984 to 1985.

Meanwhile, Martin has never officially been on the Saturday Night Live! cast. However, he has hosted the show 16 times, with the first time being in 1976. This is second only to Alec Baldwin for the most Saturday Night Live! hosting gigs. Baldwin has hosted the NBC sketch comedy show 17 times.

Pre-production on Rudolph’s Apple TV+ series Loot has been pushed back for “scheduling reasons,” which indicates that she plans to be busy with Saturday Night Live! for much of the fall.

The 'Only Murders in the Building' actor - who has hosted the NBC sketch show 16 times over the years - has confirmed showrunner Lorne Michaels approached him about portraying the politician after Kamala Harris named him her running mate for the upcoming presidential election, but he insisted he isn't a good enough impressionist and would only have been chosen because of his physical similarities to the Minnesota governor.

He told the Los Angeles Times newspaper: “I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no.

“I said, ‘Lorne, I’m not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.’ I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.”

And the 78-year-old star was reluctant to take on the role because he knows he could end up tied to the show for years to come.

He said: “It’s ongoing. It’s not like you do it once and get applause and never do it again. Again, they need a real impressionist to do that.

""They’re gonna find somebody really, really good. I’d be struggling.”

Steve had previously joked about his resemblance to Tim and the online suggestions he play him on 'Saturday Night Live'.

Referring to the comedy tour he and Martin Short are embarking on next month, he wrote on Threads earlier this week: “I just learned that Tim Walz wants to go on the road with Marty Short.""

Maya Rudolph is to reprise her portrayal of current Vice President Kamala for the election campaign, having first played her on the show in 2019 during the Democratic presidential primaries and again when she was officially appointed current president Joe Biden's running mate.

Steve Martin seems uninterested in impersonating Tim Walz, the Illinois governor and Kamala Harris’ running mate, on “Saturday Night Live” despite pleas from fans.

Shortly after Harris announced that the Minnesota governor would be her running mate, Martin spoke to Los Angeles Times About receiving a phone call from “SNL” producer Lorne Michaels asking him to appear on the popular comedy show.

“I wanted to say no, and by the way, he wanted me to say no,” Martin told the newspaper of his phone call with Michaels.

“I said, ‘Lauren, I’m not a fan of impressionism. You need someone who can really embody this guy.’ I was chosen because I have gray hair and I wear glasses,” he continued.

The actor also noted that the commitment to appear as Walz on “SNL” would be “ongoing,” which doesn’t fit into his current schedule.

Shortly after Harris named Wallace as her running mate, Martin headed to Threads, sparking speculation that he would join “SNL” alongside Maya Rudolph.

“I just learned that Tim Walls wants to go on a trip with Marty Short,” Martin wrote.

Martin referenced his Only Murders in the Building co-star Martin Short in his post, prompting fans to point out the physical similarities between Martin and Walls.

Sony Pictures released the first trailer for Saturday Night ahead of its Oct. 11 theatrical release. Reitman helmed the feature that focuses on the behind-the-scenes moments leading up to SNL‘s premiere broadcast that aired Oct. 11, 1975.

The trailer highlights the chaos that transpired over the course of the final 90 minutes prior to the start of that first-ever episode. This includes a tense exchange between series creator Lorne Michaels (played by Gabriel LaBelle) and NBC executive Dick Ebersol (Cooper Hoffman).

Ebersol says in the footage, “Lorne, 90 minutes of live television by a group of 20-year-olds who have never made anything? Do you every stop and wonder why they said yes [to] a counterculture show starring total unknowns, with zero narrative and even less structure? They want you to fail.”

This leads Lorne to respond, “We just have to make it to air.”

Reitman and Gil Kenan wrote the screenplay based on their interviews with living cast, writers and crew about the launch of the show that is currently heading into its 50th season. Reitman, Kenan, Jason Blumenfeld and Peter Rice are producers on the film formerly known by the working title SNL 1975. Executive producing are Erica Mills and JoAnn Perritano.

In a recent piece for Vanity Fair, LaBelle — known for his starring role in The Fabelmans — discussed his mindset for playing Michaels. The actor noted that Michaels “started [SNL] when he was 30. He’s now 80 and has been doing it for 50 years. Nobody knows what to do when they first start.”"

This sort of national political exposure comes for these career civil servants at a major inflection point for the country. So, naturally, this means that their parody equivalent will mock everything about them when they appear in Studio 8H at 30 Rockefeller for Saturday Night Live in a matter of weeks.

SNL returns for its 50th season with new episodes on Sept. 28 while the presidential election is set for Nov. 5. This gives the sketch comedy series six episodes before the race is decided to perfect caricatures of our nation’s next leaders. News broke last week that SNL alum and comedy superwoman Maya Rudolph will return to portray Harris (and let’s face it, would we ever want anyone else?). With his involuntary manslaughter charge dismissed, Alec Baldwin is available to return to his Emmy-winning turn as Donald Trump — or perhaps current castmember James Austin Johnson, who has portrayed the former president over the last few years, will reprise the role.

More from The Hollywood Reporter

This leaves the comic actors who will portray J.D. Vance and Tim Walz, the two veep candidates, yet to be cast. Of course, online speculation began the moment that their respective attachments to the GOP and Democratic tickets were announced, and within 48 hours, one of the obvious candidates publicly stated his lack of interest (more on that below). So, who should it be? The trick with an impression is to extract the nuance of their speech, any idiosyncrasies or mannerisms, and — you betcha! — any catchphrases they deliver. Here are The Hollywood Reporter’s picks to round out the top contenders of the 2024 presidential campaigns.

Tim Walz

Steve Martin

The hair. The glasses. It was blindingly obvious to anyone who knows Steve Martin, the treasured comic actor prone to frequent SNL hosting bookings (he’s a member of the 16-Timers Club) and cameo appearances. Many don’t even realize he was never a castmember. An SNL legend — his classic “King Tut” performance turned 46 this year — what could be more perfect than Martin returning to spoof the potential next VP? Not doing it. Martin told the Los Angeles Times on Wednesday that he turned down Lorne Michaels’ request to play the vice presidential candidate.

“I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,” Martin told the outlet. “I said, ‘Lorne, I’m not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.’ I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.”

Bradley Whitford

If SNL’s casting department is looking for someone with that white man, Midwestern, on-the-cusp-of-Gen-X Walz look, and Martin is unwilling to come on board, the next best thing is West Wing alum and Get Out villain Bradley Whitford. While he’d have to ditch the beard if he’s sporting a fuzzy face in late September, Whitford ticks plenty of boxes: he’s just 4 years older than Walz; their hairline and color nearly match; and Whitford is a staunch Democrat with a dry wit. He recently had one of the better lines in the White Dudes for Harris Zoom call when he mentioned the “rainbow if beige” he saw on his screen filled with white men.

Al Franken

Once again, the glasses could make it work. SNL-player-turned-U.S. Senator Al Franken, who resigned in disgrace (and some say, without due process) during a #MeToo scandal in 2018, could portray Walz. If he were to do so, it would be the strangest melding of politics and comedy seen since…well, since Franken won a U.S. Senate seat in 2008. The 73-year-old has also said that he regrets resigning from his Senate role after one of his accuser’s accounts of his acts of sexual misconduct were found to be exaggerated and that he may run to gain his seat back. Could a role on SNL be his springboard for a return to politics? It would be a bold move but may be a risk that Michaels will want to take.

The rest: Chris Farley was floated by many online speculators for the Walz role, but he is still dead, so, no. Danny Devito, the comedy legend, is always welcome. John Goodman got some mentions, too; he has a great history of SNL appearances (remember his Linda Tripp?), and like DeVito, should always be offered a seat at the table.

J.D. Vance

Colin Jost

The torch of a talented writer who sat in the head writer chair at Studio 8H going on to portray a GOP VP hopeful could be passed from Tina Fey to Colin Jost if he were to take on the role of J.D. Vance this season. Trump’s ripe-for-satire pick of a running mate has been off to a wobbly start to the campaign, and the public knows enough about his backstory and personal life that Jost would have plenty to pick (on) from. The writers room top dog (along with co-head writer Michael Che) might have to give up his golfing habit for a few weeks to prep, but it would be nice to see him step out front of the “Weekend Update” desk, slap on some eyeliner and give Vance a ribbing that could unite the parties in laughter.

Jason Sudeikis

The beloved SNL alum and Ted Lasso himself is wildly popular for the latter, but if he were thinking ahead, he’d be gunning for this gig. After all, the Ted Lasso love won’t go on forever. His nine-season run was full of funny-as-hell original characters and impressions of three major political figures over this tenure: President George W. Bush, current President Joe Biden, and onetime presidential hopeful Mitt Romney. Why not come back for a fourth one, Jason? I mean, as savvy SNL fanatics, or those who just watch it way too closely, will recall, he already portrayed a guy named Vance on the beloved “What Up With That?” series of sketches.

Shane Gillis

The story on Shane Gillis and SNL could have a redemption chapter if he were to be offered and then absolutely nail the Vance impression that the people all want and need. Gillis was fired from the show ahead of the 2019 season when ethnic slurs he’d used in the past were resurfaced. Since then, he launched the very, very popular Matt and Shane’s Secret Podcast and was invited to return as an SNL host in season 49. He was shaky at best, but there were some laughs in the episode. Michaels has also expressed regret over what happened with his casting on the show. Perhaps this is just too perfect? Maybe so, but maybe not for everyone still feeling stung by Gillis’ language and tone.

The rest: Current SNL cast member Mikey Day has got the look and would totally work as Vance. Ditto for former castmember Taran Killam — although it seems his departure was less than amiable, and he was certainly upset that Trump was allowed to host the show amid his first presidential campaign. Maybe the show should do some meta-casting and go with Gabriel Basso, the actor who portrayed Vance in Hillbilly Elegy, Ron Howard’s widely panned Netflix adaptation of his memoir?

Jason Reitman’s ‘Saturday Night’ Movie Trailer Teases Jason Reitman’s ‘Saturday Night’ Movie Trailer.,https://mashable.com/video/saturday-night-trailer,"This year, Saturday Night Live celebrates its 50th season on the air. But before NBC's live sketch show was an American television institution, it was an unsure bet plagued by fighting cast members, onset catastrophes, and Muppet assault. At least, that's what we see in the trailer for the upcoming film Saturday Night.

Directed by Jason Reitman (Juno, Ghostbusters: Afterlife), Saturday Night takes us behind the scenes of the chaos leading up to SNL's first-ever taping in 1975. In the movie's first trailer, we follow creator Lorne Michaels (The Fabelmans' Gabriel LaBelle) as he attempts to launch the 90-minute live comedy show, all while network executives warn him he's headed for certain failure.

The trailer also introduces us to Saturday Night's version of SNL's original cast members, including Gilda Radner (Ella Hunt), Chevy Chase (Cory Michael Smith), Garrett Morris (Lamorne Morris), and Dan Aykroyd (Dylan O'Brien), all relative unknowns at the time SNL began.

Rounding out Saturday Night's star-studded cast are Rachel Sennott, Cory Michael Smith, Emily Fairn, Matt Wood, Kim Matula, Finn Wolfhard, Nicholar Braun, Cooper Hoffman, Andrew Barth Feldman, Kaia Gerber, Tommy Dewey, Willem Dafoe, Matthew Rhys, and J.K. Simmons.

The two-time Emmy nominee sat down with Cosmopolitan as her summer vacation winds down and she prepares to step into the lead role in Barbarella remake of the 1968 movie of the same name that starred Jane Fonda as the titular character.

When asked how it feels to be returning to Euphoria‘s Cassie Howard for season three, which is set to begin production in January 2025, she explained it was her first time reprising a character after many years.

“We did have a long time between season one and season two, but especially now with the time jump, it’s a new process for me,” she told the publication. “I’m kind of just learning as I go and being open for whatever’s to come. But I’m also really excited. I love Cassie. She is always such a thrilling character to play, so I’m really looking forward to what’s gonna happen in her life.”

As for what she’s most looking forward to about returning to set for the long-gestating third installment, she shared that she always feels like she’s coming home to her family when she reunites with her co-stars Zendaya, Jacob Elordi, Hunter Schafer and more.

“They were the crew and the cast that were there at the beginning of my career,” Sweeney said. “We all came up from different places but came together and were navigating so much at the same time, so it’s really nice having that core group. They’re experiencing a similarity to what I’m going through. It’s nice to have that community.”

The Anyone but You star and producer briefly talked about Euphoria season three in March but has since remained mum on the subject. When asked by MTV’s Josh Horowitz if she planned on taking a break after back-to-back press tours for the rom-com, Madame Web and Immaculate, Sweeney said she would be going directly into the hit HBO series.

Following her comment going viral, as people began hoping the show would be returning sooner rather than later, she admitted that talking about it feels “as scary as talking about Marvel,” so she hasn’t said much since.

Two days later, HBO announced that filming on season three had been delayed indefinitely and the cast was welcome to “pursue other opportunities.” In July, the network announced a production date for early next year."

Philippe Petit walked on the Twin Towers 50 years ago. Petit is still alive.,https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/a61828718/philippe-petit-wire-walk-anniversary/,"It was fifty years ago Wednesday that the country witnessed the greatest athletic feat of all time—Philippe Petit’s wire-walk between the two towers of the World Trade Center. (If you haven’t seen the terrific documentary Man on Wire, do so immediately, if only for the description of how they strung the wire without anyone noticing what they were doing. Hint: Think bow and arrow.) There is no video of the event, but the still photos of what Petit did are terrifying enough. The image that grabs me the most depicts his first step onto the wire. One of his feet remains on the roof of the tower. How do you take that first step? I wonder. How do you take your foot off the safety of the roof and out fully into the fog of the morning, 110 stories high?

Then, fifty years ago Thursday, one day after Petit came safely back to earth, the country came off the wire it had been on for two years. Richard Nixon had finally been run to ground for the criminal acts he’d committed in office and, a half century ago this week, he resigned his office in the face of certain impeachment by the House and conviction in the Senate. He gave a lachrymose speech to the White House staffers he’d betrayed, climbed the stairs to Marine One—pausing at the top to give what was almost a parody of his double-V campaign gesture—and then ducked inside.

Now, that was a helluva news week right there. Two staggering events, both of them almost too rich in metaphor to be believed. And fifty years later, here we are again, out on the wire, which seems to be even more unsteady than it was in 1974. After he came off the wire, Petit said, “It cannot be done all at once. To overpower vertigo—the keeper of the abyss—one must tame it, cautiously.”

That’s where we were in the summer of 1974, and that’s where we are here in the summer of 2024. Taming the keeper of the abyss...cautiously."

Philippe Petit walked on the Twin Towers 50 years ago. Petit is still alive.,https://www.thetimes.com/world/us-world/article/50-years-on-high-wire-star-philippe-petit-recreates-twin-towers-walk-in-cathedral-ngpk2dlmb,"The tightrope walker Philippe Petit stood poised at one end of a cable that stretched across the soaring nave of the world’s largest cathedral. An audience beneath him heard his voice playing from speakers.

“I approach the edge,” he said as he placed a foot on the wire. “On the one side, the mass of a mountain. The life I know. On the other, the universe of the clouds.”

Petit was in the cathedral of St John the Divine, on a platform 20ft above the pews, attempting to recreate the walk he took 50 years ago across a wire strung between the tops of the Twin Towers at the World Trade Center.

Ahead of him, on that day, was “60 yards of wide rope. It’s a straight line which sags, which sways, which vibrates,” he said. He felt “a wild longing to flee, but it’s too late, the wire is waiting. A moment later, without consulting me, my other foot will set itself on to the cable.”

The crowd of New Yorkers in the dark cathedral was silent on Wednesday night as he stepped out on to a cable illuminated by spotlights, which formed a bright white line against the vast darkness of the nave. The show, called Towering!!, was billed as a celebration of the crime he committed 50 years ago — “le coup”, as he likes to call it.

It also contained a confession. After the walk, he admitted in the press, he had embellished the story and took all the credit for himself. “After the success of my walk, consciously or unconsciously, I turned my back on my friends,” he said.

For several months in the spring of 1974, he and a group of accomplices had been casing the World Trade Center, working out how to smuggle cables and rigging equipment to the top of the South Tower, and how to smuggle themselves in too.

Petit was 24 when he balanced on a cable that stretched between the Twin Towers ALAN WELNER/AP

They forged IDs and disguised themselves as builders. Once, Petit posed as a journalist and conducted a series of supposed interviews with workmen on the roof, all while examining its layout and taking photographs.

“I took pictures to find out how the security was organised,” Petit said in a phone interview before the show. “So I could circumvent it.”

The crew did so on the morning of August 7, 1974. His friend and collaborator Jean-Louis Blondeau fired an arrow with a fishing line attached to it, from the roof of one tower to the other. They rigged a cable one inch thick between them. Then Petit mounted the parapet of the roof and placed his first foot on the wire.

How did he feel at that moment? “Impatient,” he said. “It was the result of many months of dreaming. Finally, it was the beginning.”

After his first crossing, he felt elated. He began to move back and forth along the wire, he said. He sat on the wire to look down.

“The audience were little grains of sand a quarter of a mile below,” he said. He could see a queue of tiny cars “bumper to bumper, the biggest traffic jam in New York. Everybody looking up. The world was looking up.”

When the police arrived on the rooftop, “I was amused, actually. I knew that they could not do anything.” But it began to rain, so “I gave myself to the cops”. Charges of disorderly conduct and trespassing were dropped after Petit agreed to perform a free show for children in Central Park.

The Twin Towers had been widely viewed as an eyesore. Petit, with his walk, was credited with helping to turn them into icons. In the years following their destruction in the September 11, 2001 attacks, a documentary called Man On Wire won an Oscar and a feature film titled The Walk, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, was released.

Blondeau complained that he had been cut out of the story. “When it comes to fame, nobody else can have even a bit, one per cent of light,” he told the New York Post when The Walk was released in 2015. Blondeau complained that had not been invited to the premiere of Man On Wire. “He [Petit] is the hero of this thing. There is no doubt about that. But there are two things. The walk and the planning of the walk. The planning and the making of the walk is me.”

A spokeswoman for Petit denied this at the time, saying that Blondeau did not come to the premiere because his father was ill. “Let’s just say his memory is distorted by the fact that he’s not the star, he never was,” she said. “It’s unfortunate that he never did anything with his life.”

By now a celebrity, Petit put on another high-wire show for New Yorkers in 1986 DAN FARRELL/GETTY

But on Wednesday night in the Cathedral of St John the Divine, Petit said his friend was correct. “We are in a church and I thought: ‘What a good place to make a confession,’” he told his audience. “I thought, 50 years later, it’s time for me to share the truth.”

He had not really been planning the feat for six years, ever since he saw an illustration of the Twin Towers in a dentist’s surgery, he said. He saw it, forgot about it, and then had the idea again on a trip to New York eight months before the walk.

His friends claimed he had spent 45 minutes on the wire, making eight crossings. He wasn’t sure about that, but he was certain he managed four, maybe six. The fame it brought him made him egocentric. “I was really bad to my friend Jean-Louis Blondeau. I did not even invite him to the premiere of Man On Wire,” he admitted. “I did not say what was his role in this.”

His friend was in the North Tower, pulling on the wire, struggling to make it stable. “It is thanks to my friend Jean-Louis Blondeau that I had a cable to walk on.”

He offered this apology after walking back and forth on the wire over the nave as another of his friends, the musician Sting, sang Fields of Gold. Petit’s balance beam swayed in time to the music, as he moved faster and faster on the wire.

Then the police arrived. Not the two other members of Sting’s band but two officers from the New York Police Department, played by the actors Tim Guinee and Lorenzo Pisoni.

“Sir! Get off the wire,” they shouted. “Look, that was very cool and very beautiful and all that, but it’s illegal,” said one after he had surrendered.

“You think you can just make beauty anywhere, sir?” said the other. “This is New York City!”

At the close of the show, Sting sang a new song he had written about the walk. “7.20 in the morning,” he sang. “I got one foot on the cable, blood is pumping in my chest.”

Petit has done other things since. Occasionally, “I wish I would be asked something else,” he admitted ahead of the show. “It’s one highlight of my life. I have done hundreds of high-wire walks around the world.” One was between the towers of Notre-Dame cathedral, one was over the Sydney Harbour Bridge. But none caught the public imagination quite like the Twin Towers walk.

Did he ever imagine in his early twenties, going about his dangerous profession, that he would live to be 74?

“I never look at myself as a package with a beginning, a middle and an end,” he replied. “I look at myself as a day-by-day person. It goes back to being present. When you are present, you drag your body behind you.”

On his property in the Catskills, he has four wires: one short and low to the ground, two others a little longer and higher, and one that is 20 feet in the air. He does not follow a regime to stay in shape but “I’m practising a lot. Sometimes a few hours a day.”

Nor does he keep to a strict diet. “After a good dinner, I like a good cigar. And I like a single malt.” He added: “I’m not opposed to champagne. I’m French, after all.” But in the weeks before his performance in the cathedral, as with any performance, he limited himself to water and orange juice.

Petit was made an artist-in-residence at the cathedral of St John the Divine in 1982 by James Morton, the dean, who had stepped up fundraising efforts to complete the enormous building. Petit said his appointment was in line with a longer tradition of rope walkers in the Middle Ages, who would string their wires to the spires of churches or between the towers of cathedrals.

St John the Divine is said to be the largest cathedral in the world and the sixth-largest church building. The columns of the nave rise 177ft to the ceiling. A walk there could never compare to a crossing between the Twin Towers. But it was still a gripping moment when he set out for the first time across the wire. “It’s going to be the most celebrated, profound performance of my entire life,” he said.

Even after 50 years, he still loves to think of the Twin Towers walk and “to relive it in memory”, he said. “I don’t have to make an enormous effort to travel back 50 years and to see myself at dawn on the corner of the South Tower, ready to cross, ready to take my life in my hands.”"

NEW YORK (AP) — Fifty years after his iconic high-wire walk between the twin towers of New York's World Trade Center, Philippe Petit recreated the death-defying stunt with a performance about 7 miles north of the trade center at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.

The artist, 74, sought to celebrate the “glorious days of the twin towers” rather than focus on their tragic end in a terrorist attack on Sept. 11, 2001.

“I don’t have to remind people of the doomed day,” Petit told The Associated Press after Wednesday's performance.

Petit said he aimed to honor both his remarkable feat and the legacy of the towers.

“It adds a certain significance when you discuss a legend or a piece of history, even when the object of that history is no longer present. That’s the miracle of memory,” Petit said.

The performance, titled “Towering!!,” recreated Petit’s unauthorized walk between the towers on August 7, 1974. After ascending to his perch inside the cathedral and reflecting on the day’s memories, Petit took to the wire while Grammy-nominated jazz clarinetist Anat Cohen played beneath him.

As Petit continued his daring walk, Sting took the stage to perform “Fragile.” Later, Petit donned a sequined gold tunic while “Fields of Gold” played in the background.

Petit harnessed the stunning visual and acoustic splendor of the world’s largest Gothic cathedral to recreate the grandeur of his historic walk 1,300 feet (400 meters) above the ground. Conceived and directed by Petit himself, the production featured a series of short scenes that brought his 1974 feat to life.

Petit was arrested after crossing the towers and depicts that in the performance, which continues for a second night on Thursday.

At one point in the show, while reflecting on the success of the Oscar-winning documentary “Man on Wire,” which chronicled his famous walk, Petit admitted that he handled success poorly, including distancing himself from his friends.

“I was really bad to my best friend Jean-Louis Blondeau, who has been the mastermind more than me on this adventure,” Petit said.

After the performance, Petit received a proclamation from the office of New York City Mayor Eric Adams designating the day as Philippe Petit Day.

Petit has been an artist in residence at St. John the Divine for over 40 years and has performed 23 times to support the cathedral.

It was illegal, of course, but it made headlines around the world.

Last night, exactly five decades later, Petit — a few days short of his 75th birthday– commemorated his magical moment. This time it was inside, at New York’s majestic, soaring Cathedral of St. John the Divine, where he produced an evening called “Towering” that left the audience breathless.

Petit’s long time friend, the musician Sting, provided the music, accompanying the great artist with two songs, “Fragile,” and “Fields of Gold,” with a classical ensemble. At the end of the evening, Sting returned with a gorgeous new song from a musical work in progress about Petit called “Let the Great World Spin.”

There were other performers, as well, all of whom were greeted with cheers by an audience that included Sting’s wife, Trudie Styler, plus the legendary singer Judy Collins, actors Griffin Dunne and Tony Danza, plus author Susan Cheever, and everyone’s favorite rapper, Shaggy.

After a selection of musicians and dancers opened the show, Petit himself climbed several dozen feet in the capacious cathedral, took a balance bar, and began his first walk back and forth along the wire. The first walk was done slowly and with precision, and I think the audience was satisfied he still had his game on.

But then came subsequent walks in which Petit abandoned any apprehension, walking sprightly and sometimes sitting down in the center of the suspended wire. A couple of times, he lay down on his back as if he were on chaise longue and kicked one leg with abandon. He was mesmerizing, to say the least.

As for this fellow, Sting, he certainly has a career in front of him. Considering that he is always on tour, the famed rock star’s voice proved to be as supple as Petit’s athletics. They’re a good match. And Sting’s acoustic guitar, made up of strings not unlike the one Petit crosses, provided a poetic juxtaposition, although not quite as dangerous. So did the choice of one song in which he sings, “How fragile we are.” Indeed.

After he’d dazzled the crowd, Petit spoke of his 1974 walk. He said he had some confessions to make. The principal one was that he had not practiced for six years before pulling off the Twin Towers feat. He admitted he’d only arrived in the US six months before the event.

Petit also corrected the record regarding his best friend, Jean-Louis Blondeau. He said that Blondeau did shoot the arrow between the towers — mapping out the path — and was responsible for holding one end of the wire when others had given up. The admission may be late, but it’s here.

It was a sublime night, and will be performed again tonight (Thursday) for those lucky enough to score a ticket."

The illicit walk took 45 minutes and Petit, who turns 75 next week, was arrested for disorderly conduct and criminal trespass, but today his act is remembered fondly, including as part of the 9/11 Memorial & Museum’s historical exhibition.

To commemorate the 50th anniversary of Petit’s Twin Towers’ walk, Petit will stage “Towering!!” at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine on Aug. 7 and 8 at 8:30 p.m. Eastern. He will wire-walk – also known as tightrope walking – across the cathedral’s nave, this time joined by fellow performance artists, including musicians, actors and dancers. They will perform a series of 19 short scenes conceived and directed by Petit.

Grammy Award-winning musician Sting, a friend of Petit, will perform original music for the event. A short film by James Marsh, who directed “Man on Wire,” the Academy Award-winning documentary about Petit’s Twin Towers’ wire-walk, will be screened.

Petit and St. John the Divine have had a longstanding relationship. In 1980, Petit was arrested again for wire-walking across the cathedral’s 601-foot-long nave, 20 feet above the ground. As police were taking him away in handcuffs, the cathedral’s dean at the time, the Very Rev. James Parks Morton, requested Petit’s release and shortly after named him artist-in-residence, a title Petit still holds.

Petit’s relationship with the cathedral also is personal. The ashes of his daughter, Cordia Gypsy, who died in 1992 at 13 of a cerebral brain hemorrhage, are interred in the cathedral’s columbarium. Morton led her funeral service.

When Morton retired at the end of 1996, Petit performed “Crescendo,” an aerial tribute on the cathedral’s close.

“A steel cable with a human being on it does not belong in a church. But this is not a daredevil act,” Petit said in a January 1997 interview with the Associated Press. “It is an act of poetry and art that reflects what a living cathedral should be.”

Shortly after his 1974 arrest, Petit received a lifetime pass to the World Trade Center’s observation deck in exchange for giving a free aerial show for children in Central Park. Petit’s Twin Towers’ aerial act also earned him a Guinness World Record for the highest tightrope walk without the use of a net or other type of safety tether. His record remained unbroken until 2015, when a man walked between two mountain peaks in Switzerland.

The Twin Towers weren’t Petit’s first, unauthorized high-profile act. In 1971, Petit juggled balls while he wire-walked between the two towers of Notre-Dame de Paris. Two years later, he wire-walked across the Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia.

“If I see three oranges, I have to juggle. And if I see two towers, I have to walk,” Petit told the New York Times after his walk between the Twin Towers.

Petit continues to wire-walk worldwide without any safety devices. In 1989, by invitation from then-Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution, Petit walked an inclined wire across the Seine between the Place du Trocadéro and the second level of the Eiffel Tower.

Petit has been the subject of numerous books, songs and films, including the 2015 biopic movie “The Walk,” directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Petit.

Tickets for “Towering!!!” are available for purchase on St. John the Divine’s website. Proceeds from “Towering!!” will benefit St. John the Divine’s community programs, the cathedral and preservation of Petit’s archives.

“My heart is here, my life is here,” Petit said about St. John the Divine to the Associated Press in the same 1997 interview. “It is my precious place.”

“Towering!!” is open to anyone age 6 or older.

Philippe Petit walked on the Twin Towers 50 years ago. Petit is still alive.,https://www.deseret.com/utah/2024/08/07/deseret-news-archives-50-years-ago-philippe-petit-committed-artistic-crime-of-the-century/,"The front page of the Deseret News on Aug. 7, 1974, as Frenchman Philippe Petit tightrope-walked between the twin towers of the World Trade Center.

A look back at local, national and world events through Deseret News archives.

On Aug. 7, 1974, French high-wire artist Philippe Petit performed an unapproved tightrope walk between the two towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, over 1,300 feet above the ground.

Fifty years after that daredevil act, at the time called the “artistic crime of the century,” Petit will reportedly note the anniversary with several events in New York City Wednesday and Thursday, alongside his friend Sting.

Petit, then 24, of Nemours, France, captured the imagination of New Yorkers on Aug. 7, by “cavorting across a wire slung between the World Trade Towers 110 stories above the streets.” He and his support accomplices were arrested, but the charges were dropped in exchange for him performing for a group of children and onlookers three weeks later in Central Park.

Petit had done it before, notably unauthorized high-wire walks between the towers of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris in 1971 and of Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1973.

The event would be chronicled in the Academy Award-winning documentary film “Man on Wire,” a Sundance Film Festival winner in 2008.

Here are some stories from Deseret News archives on Petit’s career, and how he has handled his fame:

Philippe Petit walked on the Twin Towers 50 years ago. Petit is still alive.,https://www.dtnext.in/edit/fifty-years-later-philippe-petit-is-still-a-man-on-wire-798546,"By Annie Aguiar

NEW YORK: It was 50 years ago this week that Philippe Petit defied gravity, and the police, by walking a high wire between the twin towers of the World Trade Center, braving the winds some 1,350 feet above the streets of Manhattan.

Petit, who will turn 75 next week, still has enviable balance, as was clear the other day when he ascended a simple metal ladder to reach what looked like a short diver’s platform 20 feet off the ground. A wire stretched out before him. Taking hold of a balancing pole, he stepped into the air, striding gracefully as if he were on solid ground — pausing only occasionally to assert his balance against the wire rolling underfoot.

“People think in old age you cannot do anything anymore,” he said in an interview. “I think it’s the opposite. I think I’m more majestic, more in control, more beautiful to look at today at 74 than I was at 18.”

He was inside the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine rehearsing “Towering!!,” a new show he will perform there on Wednesday and Thursday to commemorate the anniversary of his walk between the twin towers (which the two exclamation points in the show’s title suggest). The feat made Petit a national fascination. It took on a tragic dimension after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, destroyed the towers. Since then, new generations learned about his accomplishment through the Academy Award-winning documentary “Man on Wire” (2008) and a children’s book, “The Man Who Walked Between the Towers.”

The cathedral, in Morningside Heights in Upper Manhattan, is a special place for Petit: He has been an artist in residence there since 1980. The dean of the cathedral at the time, Rev. James Parks Morton, granted Petit the title to stop the police from arresting him after an illicit high-wire walk across its 601-foot-long nave. Two years later, he walked across Amsterdam Avenue to the cathedral to inaugurate a new phase of construction.

The venue has a personal resonance, too. The ashes of his daughter Gypsy, who died of a cerebral hemorrhage when she was 9, are interred in the cathedral. He said this show is important to him on many levels, and the connection to his daughter adds another.

The new show is not all high-wire walking, though Petit will walk along a 20-foot-high wire inside the cathedral, flanked on either side by a seated audience. “Towering!!” is composed of 19 scenes evoking different points in the story of his 1974 walk. The musician Sting, a friend of Petit’s, will also perform.

One segment will feature a group of students from Ballet Tech mimicking a shaky “high-wire” walk along a red-taped line on the stage before busting into a silly dance. At one point, Petit will take the microphone and “confess,” which he says is fitting for the cathedral setting. He will right some “embellishments” that he has made about his story that add to the legend of his adventure. He also said he would discuss how he wronged some friends after the success of his World Trade Center walk, especially Jean-Louis Blondeau, who helped plan the escapade and wept in “Man on Wire” when talking about the decline of their close friendship after the walk.

“It’s important for me, after all my life lying a little bit about what happened,” he said. “Why not tell the truth?” But above all he wants the “Towering!!” audience to first see the magnificent space of the cathedral and then see him up on the wire, walking in its hallowed air.

As a teenage street juggler working in Paris, Petit saw a photographic rendering of two buildings that didn’t yet exist in a city he had never seen. He felt the need to walk between them — and managed to do it. Fifty years after the feat, he still wants to amaze audiences.

“They will see a miracle,” he said. “A man dancing in the clouds.”"

The artist, 74, sought to celebrate the “glorious days of the twin towers” rather than focus on their tragic end in a terrorist attack on Sept. 11, 2001.

“I don’t have to remind people of the doomed day,” Petit told The Associated Press after Wednesday's performance.

Petit said he aimed to honor both his remarkable feat and the legacy of the towers.

“It adds a certain significance when you discuss a legend or a piece of history, even when the object of that history is no longer present. That’s the miracle of memory,” Petit said.

The performance, titled “Towering!!,” recreated Petit’s unauthorized walk between the towers on August 7, 1974. After ascending to his perch inside the cathedral and reflecting on the day’s memories, Petit took to the wire while Grammy-nominated jazz clarinetist Anat Cohen played beneath him.

As Petit continued his daring walk, Sting took the stage to perform “Fragile.” Later, Petit donned a sequined gold tunic while “Fields of Gold” played in the background.

Petit harnessed the stunning visual and acoustic splendor of the world’s largest Gothic cathedral to recreate the grandeur of his historic walk 1,300 feet (400 meters) above the ground. Conceived and directed by Petit himself, the production featured a series of short scenes that brought his 1974 feat to life.

Petit was arrested after crossing the towers and depicts that in the performance, which continues for a second night on Thursday.

At one point in the show, while reflecting on the success of the Oscar-winning documentary “Man on Wire,” which chronicled his famous walk, Petit admitted that he handled success poorly, including distancing himself from his friends.

“I was really bad to my best friend Jean-Louis Blondeau, who has been the mastermind more than me on this adventure,” Petit said.

After the performance, Petit received a proclamation from the office of New York City Mayor Eric Adams designating the day as Philippe Petit Day.

Petit has been an artist in residence at St. John the Divine for over 40 years and has performed 23 times to support the cathedral."

HBO's corporate drama 'Industry' is finally back.,https://www.npr.org/2024/08/07/nx-s1-5064320/hbo-industry-season-3,"HBO's corporate drama 'Industry' is finally back. Here's a quick refresher

toggle caption Simon Ridgway/HBO

It’s been about two years since Season 2 of HBO’s seedy corporate melodrama Industry aired. The series finally returns for a third season on Sunday, but, if you barely remember a thing about where we left off, you’re likely suffering from what I call hiatus brain.

Industry, with its cavalcade of ruthless investment bankers and ever-shifting alliances, absolutely warrants a refresher before jumping back in. Let’s get into it.



Where we left off

The show’s premise is simple: In Season 1, a class of young recent grads were thrown into the cutthroat, coke-strewn world of fictional investment bank Pierpoint & Co. in London. Some have fared better than others – one of them literally died from a combination of energy drinks and stimulant pills in the pilot episode – but all of their souls were ultimately compromised as they vied for permanent positions within the firm.

Season 2 took place in the immediate aftermath of the global COVID-19 shutdown, with Pierpoint and its clients re-emerging to seize on all the economic vulnerabilities created in the pandemic’s wake. Looming over the return to work were rumors that the company’s New York and London sales teams might be consolidated; everyone was on edge.

Harper (Myha’la Herrold), the crafty and amorally reckless trader who’s been called a “narcissist” to her face on more than one occasion, spent last season wooing a new client, hedge fund manager Jesse Bloom (Jay Duplass). She also strategized a plan with her boss and mentor Eric (Ken Leung) to convince Pierpoint management to keep them on amid the layoffs, while throwing two of their colleagues, Rishi and Dan, under the bus.

While dealing with Jesse, Harper did what she does best, which is to say she played huge, ethically dubious moves that both impressed and mortified Eric. However, his tolerance for Harper’s increasingly risky gambles eventually wore thin when, in the season finale, she passed an insider trading tip about the possibility of a huge corporate merger on to Jesse – who then used the info to make a ton of money on both sides of a trade. Worried about the legal bind she put herself and Pierpoint in, Eric blindsided Harper by revealing her long-held secret to management: that she faked her transcripts and never graduated from college. (He didn’t mention anything to them about the insider trading, though.) “I’m doing this for you,” he told her. She was fired, and Rishi got to stay on at the company.

Yasmin (Marisa Abela) struck up a professional and personal relationship with Celeste (Katrine De Candole), one of Pierpoint’s private wealth managers. We were also introduced to Yas’ dad Charles (Adam Levy), a sleazy and well-connected business mogul/playboy with whom she has a strained relationship. She and Celeste worked to move Charles’ financial assets to Pierpoint, but the whole thing quickly fell apart: Yasmin became aware that the family’s wealth was significantly drained because Charles paid off a number of women with whom he had affairs in exchange for signing NDAs. Eventually, she suggested they stop dealing with Charles and other people like him, but Celeste shrugged it off, much to Yasmin’s horror. In the finale, Celeste cut her loose from the account.

Yasmine also lambasted Charles in the middle of a restaurant, accusing him of “grooming” her teenaged nanny years ago. She told him she wanted “nothing more to do with [him],” but as Charles harshly reminded her, she’s been financially beholden to him in every possible way her entire life. Later that evening, she returned to her lavish flat to find the locks changed.

Meanwhile, struggling salesman Robert (Harry Lawtey) took on a new client, Nicole Craig (Sarah Parish). After a meeting over dinner, she made a sexual advance on him, and they began an uncomfortable ongoing affair, with Nicole manipulating his relative inexperience and junior status at the firm. Eventually, Robert found out that Nicole’s predation of Pierpoint staffers like him is a pattern and open secret – she’d attempted the same with Harper (as seen in Season 1). Robert was distraught and tried to sever ties with her, but by the season’s end, when she bailed him out of jail after he was arrested for drug possession, he’d resigned himself to their old ways.

Who’s out and who’s in for Season 3

At the end of the first season, Gus (David Jonsson), the urbane Eton and Oxford grad, wasn’t hired at Pierpoint, though he was still in the mix in Season 2. At first, he got a gig as a tutor for Jesse Bloom’s son; then he was hired to work for a member of Parliament. Through the latter gig, he gained that crucial intel he passed along to Harper, knowing exactly what she’d do with it. Jesse’s rogue act turned out well for Gus’ boss, who got promoted to secretary of health, but like Harper, Gus’ skirting of ethics ultimately got him fired. (Although as we’ve seen again and again, no bad deed goes punished for long – or at all – within the finance world; he quickly secured a new job with Jesse.) Gus won’t return for Season 3 – Jonsson’s been busy doing some other big things lately – but the fallout from his actions reverberates all throughout these upcoming episodes.

And in an environment full of old-school finance bro stereotypes – abrasive, vulgar, and ever coked up – sales associate Rishi (Sagar Radia) was one of the worst of their kind. After hanging around the background in Season 1, he became more integral to the Industry narrative in Season 2. He (very) briefly hooked up with Harper in a bar bathroom on the eve of his wedding, and survived the chopping block at Pierpoint once Eric decided to turn Harper in to HR. In the forthcoming third season, he’ll take on an even bigger role as Pierpoint faces a pivotal moment in its history.

Also: Harper and Yas’ frenemy dynamic goes into overdrive, and a new absurdly wealthy and arrogant white dude enters the scene in the form of Henry Muck (Kit Harington), a green tech CEO. More than anything, be prepared for Season 3 to be the most dramatic and stress-inducing yet."
Rapper Nelly arrested after casino jackpot win. Nelly ‘targeted’ Nelly.,https://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/2024/08/rapper-nelly-arrested-in-missouri-after-winning-jackpot-at-casino.html,"ST. LOUIS – Rapper Nelly was arrested Wednesday in St. Louis on charges of possessing ecstasy pills and not having insurance, the Missouri State Highway Patrol said.

The “Hot in Herre” singer whose real name is Cornell I. Haynes Jr. was arrested at 4:45 a.m. and charged with having four ecstasy pills — a controlled substance — and for being without insurance, according to state patrol records.

Scott Rosenblum, Nelly’s attorney, released a statement later Wednesday evening. Rosenblum says his client was at the casino, where the 49-year-old “frequently visits and entertains at its amphitheater” and won several jackpots.

Rosenblum said a background check has not previously been performed when Nelly won “similar or greater amounts” at the same venue.

He said the officer handcuffed Nelly “and parade[d] him through the casino,” and then “conducted a search without probable cause where he claimed to have found alleged ‘ecstasy,’” in Nelly’s personal items.

An officer, who usually supervises the money transfer, also ran a check for warrants, saying that “a background check was mandated when a player won over a certain amount,” according to Rosenblum.

Rosenblum said he was arrested for ‘No Proof of Insurance’ from 2018 on a warrant issued December 2023 that he received no notice.

The statement said Nelly was “targeted by an overzealous, out of line officer,” who said a background check was required after Nelly won a certain amount at the casino where he was arrested.

“I am 100% confident this case will go nowhere,” Rosenblum said. “And we will be asking for an inquiry into this officer’s conduct.”"

Grammy-winning rapper Nelly was arrested early Wednesday morning in his hometown of St. Louis on one count of possession of a controlled substance, per online records from the Missouri Highway Patrol.

Nelly, whose real name is Cornell Haynes II, was reportedly gambling at Hollywood Casino and won a jackpot when an officer conducted a criminal records search on the rapper. The officer allegedly found four ecstasy pills on Nelly’s person while arresting him on charges related to a separate, allegedly outstanding warrant from 2018.

“Mr. Haynes was not charged with drug possession,” the rapper’s lawyer, Scott Rosenblum, told “Entertainment Tonight” in a statement Wednesday. “He was arrested for ‘No Proof of Insurance’ from 2018 on a warrant issued December 2023 that he received no notice.” (In fact, Nelly ultimately was charged with drug possession.)

“Mr. Haynes was targeted by an overzealous, out of line officer,” Rosenblum said.

Rosenblum claimed his client had won “several jackpots for similar or greater amounts” at the casino before, but that the arresting officer told Nelly a background check was required “when a player won over a certain amount.”

“Once Mr. Haynes was informed of the warrant for a No Proof of Insurance infraction, this officer felt compelled to handcuff Mr. Haynes behind his back and parade him through the casino in front of other patrons,” the attorney told “ET.”

“This officer then conducted a search without probable cause where he claimed to have found alleged ‘ecstasy’ in Mr. Haynes’ personal property,” Rosenblum continued, adding that “any other citizen would have been told to address [the warrant] and allowed to go on their way.”

Rosenblum expressed an interest in the officer involved in Nelly’s arrest.

“It is also important to note, that Mr. Haynes, as part of the requirements to travel internationally, is regularly asked to supply proof of no warrants,” the lawyer told “ET.” “Including FBI checks. There were none. I am 100% confident this case will go nowhere.”

“And we will be asking for an inquiry into this officer’s conduct,” he continued."

The Grammy-winning music star was booked overnight by the Missouri Highway Patrol, in his hometown. Officers arrested Nelly on a failure to appear on a warrant, but when they took him into custody they allegedly found him to be in possession of multiple pills of Ecstasy.

According to Entertainment Tonight, Nelly — whose real name is Cornell Haynes II — was arrested after winning a jackpot at Hollywood Casino, following a background check by police, who claimed that it was necessary to do background checks on players who won large amounts of money. In addition to the aforementioned charges, Nelly was also charged with not having insurance.

In response to the arrest. Nelly's lawyer, Scott Rosenblum, has issued a statement. ""Mr. Haynes was not charged with drug possession. He was arrested for 'No Proof of Insurance' from 2018 on a warrant issued December 2023 that he received no notice,"" the attorney stated. ""Mr. Haynes was targeted by an overzealous, out of line officer.""

Regarding the events that led to Nelly's arrest, Rosenblum explained, ""After winning several jackpots, at a venue where Mr. Haynes frequently visits and entertains at its amphitheater; instead of just supervising the transfer of Mr. Haynes' winnings, this officer felt compelled to needlessly run a check for warrants.""

""The officer informed Mr. Haynes a background check was mandated when a player won over a certain amount; Mr. Haynes knew this to be untrue as he had won several jackpots for similar or greater amounts including one just a week prior without incident or a background check,"" Rosenblum continued. ""Once Mr. Haynes was informed of the warrant for a No Proof of Insurance infraction, this officer felt compelled to handcuff Mr. Haynes behind his back and parade him through the casino in front of other patrons.""

""This officer then conducted a search without probable cause where he claimed to have found alleged 'ecstasy' in Mr. Haynes' personal property,"" Rosenblum went on to state. ""Under similar circumstances, assuming there was an old warrant without any notice to the individual for no proof of insurance, any other citizen would have been told to address it and allowed to go on their way.""

Rosenblum's statement concluded, ""It is also important to note, that Mr. Haynes, as part of the requirements to travel internationally, is regularly asked to supply proof of no warrants.

Nelly's attorney, Scott Rosenblum, tells TMZ ... Nelly had won a jackpot at the Hollywood Casino in St. Charles Wednesday morning when the arresting officer falsely told him they needed to run a background check before giving Nelly his money.

Rosenblum says Nelly knew this claim to be bogus because he had won bigger jackpots at the same casino, and in those instances, he received his winnings without a background check and no issues whatsoever.

This time, though, Nelly's attorney claims the officer conducted a background check ... which police say turned up an active warrant for no insurance from a previous traffic stop conducted by Maryland Heights Police.

Nelly's attorney says once he was informed of the warrant the officer handcuffed Nelly and paraded him through the casino in front of other gamblers.

Rosenblum says the arresting officer then searched Nelly without probable cause and claimed to have found alleged ecstasy among Nelly's belongings.

Nelly's attorney says the active warrant was issued in December from a traffic stop that happened in 2018 ... and he says Nelly was NOT given notice of the warrant.

Rosenblum says if Nelly was not famous he would have been told to address the warrant and sent on his way ... instead of being arrested, as was the case here.

As we reported ... the Missouri State Highway Patrol, which has troopers from its gaming division at the casino, told us Nelly was booked for felony drug possession and on a warrant for no vehicle insurance.

Rosenbaum argued Nelly was allegedly “targeted by an overzealous, out of line officer.” The officer reportedly conducted the background check as part of the state’s gaming commission regulations. However, Rosenbaum said another search was done ""without probable cause"" which is when the officer claimed he allegedly discovered four ecstasy pills. Nelly was reportedly detained on allegations of possession of a controlled substance and his previous driving without proof of insurance offense.

Nelly has been arrested, ET has confirmed.

The rapper, whose real name is Cornell Haynes II, was arrested Wednesday at 4:45 a.m. by the Missouri Highway Patrol in his hometown of St. Louis, Missouri, online records show. The 49-year-old ""Air Force Ones"" rapper was arrested on a failure to appear on a warrant and was alleged to have been found in possession of a controlled substance (ecstasy -- 4 pills) and for not having insurance.

Nelly, who donned a black hoodie over a white shirt in his mugshot, was taken into custody and booked at the Maryland Heights Police Department and subsequently released. ET has learned Nelly was at Hollywood Casino and won a jackpot. An officer later did a search on him and found a warrant from 2018 for a failure to appear in court for not having insurance. He was handcuffed and later released.

In a statement to ET, Nelly's lawyer, Scott Rosenblum, addressed his client's arrest.

""Mr. Haynes was not charged with drug possession. He was arrested for 'No Proof of Insurance' from 2018 on a warrant issued December 2023 that he received no notice,"" the statement read. ""Mr. Haynes was targeted by an overzealous, out of line officer.""

As for the events leading up to the arrest, Rosenblum said, ""After winning several jackpots, at a venue where Mr. Haynes frequently visits and entertains at its amphitheater; instead of just supervising the transfer of Mr. Haynes' winnings, this officer felt compelled to needlessly run a check for warrants.""

""The officer informed Mr. Haynes a background check was mandated when a player won over a certain amount; Mr. Haynes knew this to be untrue as he had won several jackpots for similar or greater amounts including one just a week prior without incident or a background check,"" the statement continued. ""Once Mr. Haynes was informed of the warrant for a No Proof of Insurance infraction, this officer felt compelled to handcuff Mr. Haynes behind his back and parade him through the casino in front of other patrons.""

""This officer then conducted a search without probable cause where he claimed to have found alleged 'ecstasy' in Mr. Haynes' personal property,"" the statement read. ""Under similar circumstances, assuming there was an old warrant without any notice to the individual for no proof of insurance, any other citizen would have been told to address it and allowed to go on their way.""

The statement concluded, ""It is also important to note, that Mr. Haynes, as part of the requirements to travel internationally, is regularly asked to supply proof of no warrants. Including FBI checks. There were none. I am 100% confident this case will go nowhere. And we will be asking for an inquiry into this officer's conduct.""

The arrest comes nearly two months after news surfaced that he and Ashanti secretly tied the knot back in December 2023. The couple is expecting their first child together. Nelly and Ashanti got back together after crossing paths in 2021, nearly a decade after their split.

""Never in a million years did I think we would be here,"" she told ET's Deidre Behar in an exclusive interview. ""Ten years ago -- maybe yes -- but after our breakup, you know, I didn't even think we'd ever have a conversation again.""

Nelly popped the question when the couple was watching TV in bed one day. They were ""not dressy,"" she said, but she was ""completely shocked.""

""I cried. I gave him the biggest hug and kiss ever,"" she shared. ""I FaceTimed everyone I know... I was overjoyed and shocked and surprised and happy kind of like all in one."""

ORIGINAL STORY (AUG. 7):

Nelly was arrested for ecstasy possession and a previous warrant in his home state of Missouri earlier today.

Nelly Arrested for Ecstasy After Leaving Casino

On Wednesday (Aug. 7), news broke that Nelly had been taken into custody by the Missouri State Highway Patrol. According to Variety, the rapper was at Hollywood Casino near St. Louis when he was asked to show his ID by the Missouri Gaming Commission before leaving the premises.

Apparently, the St. Louis native was in the casino and won a jackpot. As a result of winning, a background check was done on Nelly. Authorities found a prior warrant on Nelly for failure to appear for not having proof of insurance stemming from a 2018 incident.

Nelly was also reportedly searched by Missouri State Highway officers and ecstasy pills were found on him. The Midwest MC was charged with drug possession and brought to the Maryland Heights Police Department around 4:45 a.m. He has since been released.

XXL has reached out to Nelly's team, Maryland Heights Police Department and Missouri State Highway Patrol for comment.

Despite his recent arrest, the diamond-selling artist has been grabbing more positive headlines lately. Nelly and singer Ashanti are expecting a baby together any day now. This marks his fifth child and Ashanti's first. The rapper and singer reportedly got married late last year, ahead of the baby's arrival. Public records show they were married in St. Louis county where Nelly is from. Nelly and Ashanti rekindled their romance last year after dating on-and-off for 11 years from 2003 to 2014."

The 49 year old rapper - who recently confirmed he is married - found himself in hot water on Wednesday (7 August) when he was pulled over in Missouri for driving without insurance, which subsequently led to the alleged discovery of ecstasy.

He was taken into custody at the early hour of 4.45am, as per the arrest report from the Missouri State Highway Patrol.

Yet, 'Hot in Herre' singer Nelly's lawyer, Scott Rosenblum has insisted that his client ""was not charged with drug possession"", and clarified to DailyMail.com that the arrest was due to a lack of proof of insurance from 2018, based on a warrant issued in December 2023.

The lawyer is adamant that Nelly - real name Cornell Iral Haynes Jr. - had no knowledge of the warrant, suggesting he was ""targeted by an overzealous, out of line officer"".

Earlier that evening, Nelly had been enjoying his time at the Hollywood Casino and Hotel in the St. Louis area, where he reportedly won ""several jackpots"".

According to Rosenblum, the arresting officer ""felt compelled to needlessly run a check for warrants"" instead of ""supervising the transfer of winnings"". The lawyer alleges that the officer then ""conducted a search without probable cause where he claimed to have found alleged ecstasy in [Nelly's] personal property"".

The lawyer stated in a release: ""Under similar circumstances, assuming there was an old warrant without any notice to the individual for no proof of insurance, any other citizen would have been told to address it and allowed to go on their way.""

""It is also important to note that Mr. Haynes, as part of the requirements to travel internationally, is regularly asked to supply proof of no warrants. Including FBI checks. There were none.""

""I am 100 per cent confident this case will go nowhere. And we will be asking for an inquiry into this officer's conduct.""

It comes after it was disclosed in June that Nelly and singer-songwriter Ashanti, 43, had secretly been husband and wife for months.

After rekindling their love story in 2023 following more than ten years apart, the duo announced their engagement and a baby on the way in April. However, it has now come to light that they actually exchanged vows well before sharing their happy news with the world."

Lawyer Scott Rosenblum said the rapper, whose real name is Cornell Haynes Jr, was arrested for no proof of insurance from 2018 “on a warrant issued December 2023” of which he “received no notice”.

“Mr Haynes was targeted by an overzealous, out of line officer,” Mr Rosenblum said in a statement given to the PA news agency.

Mr Rosenblum said Nelly had won several casino jackpots at a venue in St Louis, Missouri that he “frequently visits”.

When he sought to collect his winnings, the officer who would have supervised the transaction “needlessly” ran a search for warrants.

After the officer found the outstanding warrant for no proof of insurance, he “felt compelled to handcuff Mr Haynes behind his back and parade him through the casino” allegedly in front of other patrons.

A Missouri Highway Patrol online report said the arrest occurred at 4.45am on Wednesday morning before a search is said to have found Nelly in possession of illegal drugs.

Nelly was held and then released by police in Maryland Heights.

Mr Rosenblum said the officer at the casino did not have “probable cause” to conduct a search of the rapper, who he said wasn’t notified of the outstanding warrant.

He said in similar circumstances “any other citizen would have been told to address it (the outstanding warrant) and allowed to go on their way.”

“I am 100% confident this case will go nowhere. And we will be asking for an inquiry into this officer’s conduct,” Mr Rosenblum added.

Rapper Nelly was arrested for alleged drug possession in Missouri on August 7, reports Fox 2 Now. Police reportedly found four ecstasy pills in the car, and he was taken into custody early this morning. He has since been released. According to the rapper’s attorney Scott Rosenblum, Nelly was collecting a jackpot from a casino, and an officer who needed to supervise the money transfer ran a background check on him. That was when they found a warrant for his arrest from a 2018 infraction for driving without proof of insurance. The officer then searched his car and reportedly found the ecstasy pills. The attorney also claims that Nelly has won significant jackpots before, as recently as last week, and did not have to go through background checks.

Rosenblum also released a statement explaining that Nelly, legal name Cornell I. Haynes Jr., has to regularly go through security, including FBI checks, to tour, writing, “Under similar circumstances, assuming there was an old warrant without any notice to the individual for no proof of insurance, any other citizen would have been told to address it and allowed to go on their way.

Online Missouri court records show that Nelly, whose birth name is Cornell Haynes II, was cited in June 2018 in Maryland Heights with operating a vehicle without proper proof of insurance. A judge issued a warrant in December 2023, and it remained outstanding.

Rosenblum said Nelly had won several casino jackpots and when he sought to collect them, the officer who would have supervised the transaction “needlessly” ran a search for warrants. Once the officer found the outstanding warrant, he cuffed Nelly's hands behind his back and “felt compelled” to “parade him through the casino in front of other customers,"" Rosenblum said.

Nelly's attorney called what the officer found “alleged ‘ecstasy’” and said the officer did not have probable cause to justify searching him. Nelly wasn't notified of the warrant and did not know about it, Rosenblum said.

“I am 100% confident this case will go nowhere,” Rosenblum said. “And we will be asking for an inquiry into this officer’s conduct.”

The Highway Patrol's report provided no details about the arrest, and Maryland Heights police did not respond to a call Wednesday seeking comment.

Rosenblum said that in similar circumstances, “any other citizen would have been told to address it and allowed to go on their way.”

Nelly, a three-time Grammy Award winner, is known for hits like “Hot in Herre” and “Just A Dream.” He’s had four No. 1 hits and received nine Billboard Music Awards. He recently wrapped up a series of performances with Janet Jackson as a special guest on her tour.

He won Grammy Awards in 2002 for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration and Best Male Solo Rap Performance, and his “Nellyville” was nominated that year for both Best Rap Album and Album of the Year. He also won a Grammy the following year for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group the following year for “Shake Ya Tailfeather.”

Beyond his recording career, Nelly has appeared in a number of films and television series, including the sports film “The Longest Yard” and a BET reality series featuring his family. The artist announced in April he was engaged to singer and actor Ashanti and the pair is expecting a baby.

In April 2015, Nelly was arrested and faced felony drug charges in Tennessee after a bus he was traveling in was pulled over east of Nashville by the Tennessee Highway Patrol. He later pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge and was able to have his record expunged after less than a year of probation.

Nelly was also arrested in October 2017 in Auburn, Washington, south of Seattle, after a woman alleged he had sexually assaulted her on his tour bus. Rosenblum said then that the allegations were fabricated. The woman sued Nelly, who countersued, and they settled their legal claims in September 2018.

Rapper Nelly was arrested for drug possession and an outstanding insurance violation in Maryland Heights, Missouri early Wednesday (August 7th).

Nelly was arrested around 4:45 a.m. at the Hollywood Casino. In a statement, Nelly’s attorney, Scott Rosenblum, said the artist was targeted by an “overzealous” officer who then conducted an improper search.

According to Rosenblum, Nelly had won several jackpots at the casino that night.

Rosenblum added that the officer then “felt compelled” to “parade” Nelly through the casino after cuffing his hands behind his back. A subsequent search allegedly found him in possession of four ecstasy pills.

“I am 100% confident this case will go nowhere,” Rosenblum said. “And we will be asking for an inquiry into this officer’s conduct.” The attorney also said that “any other citizen would have been told to address [the warrant] and allowed to go on their way.”

This isn’t Nelly’s first time running into legal trouble. In 2015, he was arrested and faced felony drug charges in Tennessee. After the felony charge was dropped, he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor drug possession charge. The conviction was expunged from his record after less than a year of probation.

Nelly was also arrested outside of Seattle on suspicion of rape in October 2017. The woman filed a lawsuit against Nelly, who responded with a countersuit. Both suits were dropped after reaching a settlement in 2018.
