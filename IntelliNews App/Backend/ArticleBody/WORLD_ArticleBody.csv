Russia says its troops are battling to push Ukrainian forces back a cross-border incursion.,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-fighting-sudzha-a49c55fc367bcbaed2e95e515bf99b80,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian troops are battling to push back Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region on the third day of one of the largest cross-border incursions of the war, the Russian Defense Ministry said Thursday.

A ministry statement said the Russian military and border guards have blocked Ukrainian forces from pushing deeper into the region in southwestern Russia. It added that the army is attacking Ukrainian fighters trying to advance into the area from Ukraine’s Sumy region.

“Attempts by individual units to break through deep into the territory in the Kursk direction are being suppressed,” the ministry said.

Ukrainian troops had advanced as much as 15 kilometers (9 miles) into Russian territory, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank. The data that hasn’t been officially confirmed.

Kyiv has not commented on the incursion. In a video address to the nation late Thursday, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy did not mention the fighting in the Kursk region but emphasized that “Russia brought the war to our land, and it should feel what it has done.”

“Ukrainians know how to achieve their goals,” Zelenskyy said, adding that he received three “productive reports, exactly the kind our country needs now” on Thursday from the commander of Ukraine’s armed forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi.

Russia says the military has stemmed Ukrainian advances in the border area about 500 kilometers (about 320 miles) southwest of Moscow, but military bloggers and open source data indicate Ukrainian troops have made gains in several areas in Kursk.

The Kursk region’s acting governor, Alexei Smirnov, briefed Russian President Vladimir Putin on conditions there by video link Thursday. Smirnov said the region plans to equip gas stations with electronic warfare units and to provide them with unspecified armored defense.

Kursk regional authorities reported Wednesday that at least five civilians, including two ambulance workers, were killed. Russia’s Health Ministry said 66 civilians, including nine children, have been wounded in the Kursk region in the three days of fighting.

Putin, who described the incursion as a “large-scale provocation” that involved “indiscriminate shelling of civilian buildings, residential houses and ambulances” was briefed on the situation by his top military and security officials on Wednesday.

Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the Russian military’s General Staff, told Putin via video link that about 100 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in the battle and more than 200 others were wounded.

It wasn’t possible to independently verify the Russian claims. During the war, now in its third year, disinformation and propaganda have played a central role.

John Kirby, the White House’s national security spokesman, declined to comment on the operation and said the Biden administration has reached out to the Ukrainians to better understand the situation.

The cross-border foray would be among Ukraine’s largest since Russia launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.

Kyiv’s aim could be to draw Russian reserves to the area, potentially weakening Moscow’s offensive operations in several parts of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, where Russian forces have increased attacks and are advancing gradually toward operationally significant gains.

But it could risk stretching outmanned Ukrainian troops further along the front line, which is more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) long.

Even if Russia were to commit reserves to stabilize the new front, given its vast manpower and the relatively small number of Ukrainian forces engaged in the operation, it would likely have little long-term impact. Pulling units from the front line to stabilize the Kursk region would also be time consuming.

However, the operation could boost Ukrainian morale at a time when Kyiv’s forces are facing relentless Russian attacks, with more expected in the coming weeks.

Myhailo Podolyak, a top adviser to Zelenskyy, said Thursday that border region attacks will cause Russia to “start to realize that the war is slowly creeping inside of Russian territory.” He also suggested such an operation would improve Kyiv’s hand in the event of negotiations with Moscow.

“When will it be possible to conduct a negotiation process in the way that we can push them or get something from them? Only when the war is not going on according to their scenarios,” he said.

Several Ukrainian brigades stationed along the border region would not comment, along with Ukraine’s Defense Ministry and General Staff.

Russian forces have swiftly repelled previous cross-border incursions, but not before they caused damage and embarrassed authorities.

Responsibility for previous incursions into Russia’s Belgorod and Bryansk regions has been claimed by two murky groups: the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Freedom of Russia Legion, made up of Russian citizens and have fought alongside Ukrainian forces.

The Kursk region’s border with Ukraine is 245 kilometers (150 miles) long, making it possible for saboteur groups to launch swift incursions and capture some ground before Russia deploys reinforcements.

A state of emergency has been declared in the Kursk region of Russia, as a rare cross-border attack by Ukrainian troops continued on Wednesday. The acting regional governor, Alexei Smirnov, said the move was necessary ""to eliminate the consequences of enemy forces coming into the region"". Russian officials said at least five civilians had been killed and 31 wounded, six of them children, since the start of the incursion. Ukraine has not officially commented and the depth of the incursion remains unclear.

On Tuesday morning, up to 1,000 Ukrainian troops, as well as 11 tanks and more than 20 armoured combat vehicles, entered Russia near the town of Sudzha, Moscow said. Fighting reportedly took place in a number of villages throughout Tuesday, with local authorities urging residents to limit their movements and all public events cancelled. A number of air alerts were issued in Kursk and footage posted online – verified by the BBC - showed fighter jets flying low over the region, with smoke rising from areas on the ground. Thousands of people were evacuated from border areas and doctors were being drafted in from other cities, Mr Smirnov said.

Ukrainian incursions into Russian territory have been extremely rare since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. On Wednesday evening, Ukrainian MP Oleksiy Honcharenko said the Ukrainian army had established control over the Sudzha gas hub, a major gas facility involved in the transit of natural gas from Russia to the EU via Ukraine, which has continued despite the war. It is the only point of entry for Russian gas into the EU. Although the claim has not been verified by the BBC, Mr Honcharenko's comment was the first confirmation of an incursion into Russian territory by a Ukrainian official. Mr Honcharenko said on Facebook that while he did not know what the ""plan"" behind the incursion was, it would show ""Europeans and Americans that... Russia can and needs to be attacked"". Russia's military response to the incursion will be one of Andrei Belousov's first big leadership tests as the country's new defence minister, after he replaced his long-serving predecessor Sergei Shoigu in May. Speaking to the BBC’s Newshour, Mr Honcharenko added that ""from a military point of view, we are trying to take back the initiative”. “We are showing the world that the world should not be scared of escalation or the reaction of Putin. There is no reaction,” he said. “For the first time since the Second World War, Russian territory that is internationally recognised is occupied and Putin did not [turn] to nukes and so on."" He said the incursion would also force Russia to move troops to the region and hopefully decrease the number of attacks it can carry out in eastern Ukraine. In a lukewarm reaction White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the US had no prior knowledge of the attack and that it planned to reach out to the Ukrainian military ""to learn more about their objectives"". Speaking on Wednesday, Ms Jean-Pierre said Washington will continue to ensure Kyiv has what it needs ""to defend themselves against Russia's aggression"".

‘Heavy’ fighting in Sudzha

In a televised meeting with government officials on Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of launching a ""major provocation"" and ""firing indiscriminately"" at civilian buildings and residences. Russia's Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov said the ""advance"" into the Kursk region had been stopped, with Russian forces ""continuing to destroy the adversary in areas directly adjacent to the Russian-Ukrainian border"". Mr Gerasimov said Ukrainian forces aimed to take over the area around the town of Sudzha, and that Russia had already killed 100 men and injured another 215. However, some popular and generally well-informed pro-war Telegram channels suggested the situation on the ground was not as stable as the Kremlin said. Blogger Yuri Kotenok described the battles taking place in Sudzha and nearby Korenevo as ""heavy"", while the channel Rybar said that the situation in the area around Sudzha was ""continuing to deteriorate"" and Ukrainian formations were advancing towards the town. The BBC is unable to verify these claims. The influential pro-war Rybar Telegram channel went on to strongly criticise the highest ranks of the Russian military on Wednesday, saying that ""for two months the full information was sent to the useless headquarters"", adding that there was enough time ""to make an appropriate decision"". Rybar's concerns were echoed by several other pro-war bloggers, who are very popular with Russian readers. They often offer a more critical perspective of military developments than the Kremlin, without questioning whether or not the war is necessary. The Russian National Guard said it had strengthened the security of the Kursk nuclear power plant, which lies some 70km (43 miles) north-east of Sudzha. In its latest report, the Institute for the Study of War said geolocated footage from the past two days show that Ukrainian armoured vehicles have advanced to positions 10km into the Kursk region. In the Belgorod region, which neighbours Kursk, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov also issued missile attack warnings throughout Tuesday and said several people had been injured in Ukrainian air attacks."

Russia said it has been battling a significant cross-border incursion for the third consecutive day as Ukrainian troops advance in the Kursk region.

Russia’s Ministry of Defence said on Thursday its troops were “continuing to destroy” armed Ukrainian units and were using air strikes, rocket and artillery fire to try to push them back.

It said it had rushed in reserves and was “thwarting attempts to break through” deeper into the Kursk region.

Alexey Smirnov, the region’s acting governor, said he had announced a state of emergency after pro-Ukrainian forces stormed into the region on Tuesday, deploying about 1,000 soldiers and more than two dozen armoured vehicles and tanks, according to the Russian army.

Without mentioning the Kursk attacks, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Wednesday: “The more pressure we put on Russia … the closer we will get to peace. A just peace through just force.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused Ukraine of a “major provocation”.

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said Ukrainian troops have advanced up to 10km (6 miles) inside Russia in possibly the most serious border incursion of the conflict.

“The current confirmed extent and location of Ukrainian advances in Kursk Oblast indicate that Ukrainian forces have penetrated at least two Russian defensive lines and a stronghold,” the think tank based in Washington, DC said in its latest update that geolocated footage.

The troops appeared to be trying to advance along the Sudzha-Korenovo highway, it added.

The advance has centred on the logistical hub of Sudzha, a town of about 5,000 inhabitants located 8km (5 miles) from the Ukrainian border.

The Ministry of Health said 31 civilians, including six children, had been injured on Wednesday. Smirnov said the day before that five people had been killed as Ukrainian troops backed by tanks and armoured vehicles breached the border.

Russia did not provide any information on military casualties.

Witnesses interviewed on Russian television said they had fled border areas in cars under drone fire. A priest in Sudzha, Evgeny Shestopalov, said in a video shared by Russian media, that the town was “on fire” and that residents unable to evacuate had taken shelter in his church.

The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine did not mention the incursion in its daily battlefield update on Wednesday. In a late evening report, it said fighting had intensified in the Sumy region, where authorities have evacuated about 6,000 people.

It said Russian forces had deployed aircraft, helicopters and heavy weapons in the area, “but made no headway and suffered significant losses”.

An aide to Ukraine’s presidential office on Thursday blamed Moscow for the Ukrainian incursion into Russia, without taking direct responsibility for the most serious attack on Russian territory in months.

“The root cause of any escalation, shelling, military actions, forced evacuations and destruction of normal life forms – including within the Russian Federation’s own territories like Kursk and Belgorod regions – is solely Russia’s unequivocal aggression,” presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak said on social media.

This includes attempts to seize foreign… — Михайло Подоляк (@Podolyak_M) August 8, 2024

White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said the United States was seeking an understanding from Ukraine on the incursion, and said it had had no advance knowledge of it.

US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby stressed that Washington had not changed its policy on Ukraine’s use of US-supplied weaponry, which could be used only “to target imminent threats just across the border”.

Zelesnkyy posted on X that he had met with a bipartisan delegation of the US House of Representatives to discuss air defence and ways to stop “any attempts by Russia to prolong this war”.

In a separate post, he also said that “F-16s are already in Ukrainian skies, and there will be more”.

US-made F-16 fighter jets had been long sought after by Ukraine to protect its skies against Russian missiles.

The battles around Sudzha come as Russia announced advances along the front line in Ukraine’s east and claims to have taken 420 square kilometres (162 square miles) of territory from Ukrainian forces since June 14.

Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Pro-Ukrainian forces, including units of Russians fighting on Ukraine’s side, such as the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Freedom of Russia Legion, have made several brief incursions into Russia since then."

Intense battles between Ukrainian and Moscow’s troops inside the Russian border region of Kursk have entered a third day after an audacious attack by Kyiv’s forces.

War monitor the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said Ukrainian soldiers had penetrated more than six miles (10km) across the border, breaking through two Russian defensive lines and a stronghold.

Russia declared a state of emergency amid the fierce fighting, despite seeking to claim that the situation was under control. Russian state media said that 3,000 people have been evacuated from the area.

Moscow’s military chief Valery Gerasimov briefed president Vladimir Putin on Wednesday about the attack, while neither Kyiv nor president Volodymyr Zelensky has made any direct reference to the assault while exhorting Kyiv’s soldiers to press on and weaken Russian forces.

Multiple pro-Russian military bloggers said the battles continued into Thursday.

""Sudzha [a district in Kursk] is basically lost to us. And this is an important logistics hub,"" said Yuri Podolyaka, a popular Ukrainian-born pro-Russian military blogger, adding that Ukrainian forces were pushing north towards Lgov."

KYIV: Russian troops are battling to push back Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region on the third day of one of the largest cross-border incursions of the war, the Russian Defense Ministry said Thursday.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday that Russia needed to ""feel"" the consequences of its war as a major Ukrainian incursion across the Russian border stretched into a third day.

Pro-Kyiv forces stormed into Russia's southwestern Kursk region on Tuesday morning, deploying around 1,000 troops and more than two dozen armoured vehicles and tanks, according to the Russian army.

It appears to be the most significant Ukrainian attack into Russia since the war began, with independent analysts suggesting Kyiv's troops had advanced up to 10 kilometres into Russia.

""Russia brought the war to our land and should feel what it has done,"" Zelensky said in his evening address, without directly referring to the offensive.

""Ukrainians know how to achieve their goals. And we did not choose to achieve our goals in the war,"" he added.

Russia's defence ministry said Thursday its troops were ""continuing to destroy"" armed Ukrainian units and were using air strikes, rocket and artillery fire to try to push them back.

It said it had rushed in reserves and was ""thwarting attempts to break through"" deeper into the Kursk region.

The independent US-based Institute for the Study of War said Ukraine had made significant territorial gains in the first two days of the incursion.

""Ukrainian forces have made confirmed advances up to 10 kilometres (six miles) into Russia's Kursk Oblast amid continued mechanised offensive operations on Russian territory,"" it said in its latest update.

""The current confirmed extent and location of Ukrainian advances in Kursk Oblast indicate that Ukrainian forces have penetrated at least two Russian defensive lines and a stronghold,"" it added.

- 'Entrenching' -

Kyiv has not officially taken responsibility for the operation, but an aide to Zelensky said Moscow was to blame for the incursion.

""The root cause of any escalation, shelling, military actions, forced evacuations and destruction of normal life forms -- including within the Russian Federation's own territories like Kursk and Belgorod regions -- is solely Russia's unequivocal aggression,"" presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak said Thursday on social media.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has called it a ""large-scale provocation"" by Kyiv and Russia's top general vowed on Wednesday to crush the incursion.

The US State Department expressed support for Kyiv without directly commenting on the operation.

The surprise attack appeared to catch Russia's army off guard, triggering criticism of its top brass by the country's influential military bloggers.

The Ukrainian advance has centred on the logistical hub of Sudzha, a town of around 5,000 inhabitants located eight kilometres from the Ukrainian border.

Russian military bloggers, who have links to the army, also reported Thursday that Kyiv had made significant advances.

""The situation is complicated and continues to worsen,"" blogger Yury Podolyaka said in a post on Telegram.

""Sudzha has been completely lost,"" he said.

Residents evacuated from Sudzha also reported a difficult situation, according to images shared by Russia's LDPR party.

""The situation is bad. There's no communication"" with those who stayed behind, said Alexei, an ambulance worker waiting to receive humanitarian aid.

Another man also called Alexei, a volunteer, said the evacuees ""feel abandoned"".

The Dva Mayora Telegram channel said Ukraine was ""entrenching, indicating that the fighting is likely to be long-term"".

- Thousands evacuated -

Many reported Ukrainian troops had advanced towards the town of Korenevo, more than 25 kilometres from the Ukrainian border.

AFP could not verify those reports.

Russian energy giant Gazprom said on Thursday it would continue shipping gas through the Sudzha metering station, the last transit point for Russian gas heading to Europe via Ukraine.

Moscow also said its forces had destroyed a US-made Bradley Fighting Vehicle that Ukraine was using in the incursion.

The Russian defence ministry had initially blamed a pro-Ukrainian ""sabotage group"" for the raid, but it has since said Ukraine's army is carrying it out.

Pro-Kyiv militia, including those made up of Russian citizens fighting against Moscow, have previously staged several cross-border raids.

But the latest incursion into the Kursk region appears to be the most successful and organised attempt by Ukraine to penetrate Russian territory.

Kyiv's objectives remain unclear, with some analysts suggesting it is an attempt to stretch Russia's army, forcing them to move units away from the eastern Donetsk region where they have been advancing.

The governor of Kursk declared a state of emergency in the region on Wednesday evening, a move that gives authorities the power to restrict movement in a bid to bring the situation under control.

Several thousand people have been evacuated on both sides of the border.

Russia says its troops are battling to push Ukrainian forces back a cross-border incursion.,https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/07/ukraine-incursion-into-russia-kursk-region-continues-into-second-day,"Ukraine’s surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk region has continued into a second day, prompting Vladimir Putin to convene a meeting with his top defence and law enforcement officials.

A report from one Russia military blogger suggested Ukrainian forces had advanced northwards, possibly as far as nine miles (15km) from the border, along a highway north of the border village of Sverdlikovo and near a major natural gas transmission hub, but this could not be verified.

Official and unofficial Russian sources reported that a force of several hundred soldiers had crossed a lightly defended part of the border on Tuesday morning, in what appears to be one of the largest incursions into Russia since the war began in February 2022. Russia’s defence ministry said on Wednesday that the attack was being neutralised.

It had claimed Russian forces had repelled the raid on Tuesday, but acknowledged at lunchtime on Wednesday that fighting was ongoing. It said they had used air and missile strikes and artillery fire against the invaders, inflicting 260 casualties and knocking out 50 armoured vehicles.

In televised remarks at the start of a meeting with members of the Russian government, Putin described the raid as a major provocation. He later met Russia’s top military figures. The chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov, told Putin that Russian forces were battling Ukrainian forces near the border and would push them back to the border.

The acting governor of Kursk oblast, Alexei Smirnov, said he had introduced a state of emergency in the border region, though it was unclear what measures that entailed. Several thousand civilians were evacuated from frontline areas and 300 people were housed in temporary accommodation overnight.

Authorities in Ukraine’s northeastern Sumy region, just across the border from Kursk, also announced they were evacuating about 6,000 people.

Ukrainian officials have remained quiet as the incursion has developed, anxious perhaps not to appear triumphant or give away too much information about their intentions.

Russia said the attack began at about 8am on Tuesday morning, when Ukrainian troops crossed the border between the villages of Nikolayevo-Daryino and Oleshnya, with the apparent intention of heading north and east.

The attack is most likely to be an attempt by Ukraine, whose defences are stretched on the eastern Donbas front, to divert some Russian forces to defend a part of the frontline that has been largely inactive since early 2022.

Critics in Ukraine, however, argue that such assaults serve no long-term military purpose. Anti-Kremlin Russian groups launched attacks from Ukraine into Belgorod and Kursk regions in March, but were repelled with no strategic gain.

Information is scant, but this time the operation appears to be an attack by Ukraine’s military rather than Russian opposition groups. Russia said it was led by Kyiv’s 22nd mechanised brigade.

Fighting was taking place in and around the town of Sudzha, about 6 miles from the border. A local Russian Telegram channel released a short video showing bombed out rural homes, which it said demonstrated the “situation today”.

The main operational gas pipeline into Europe runs near Sudzha, where a metering station monitors the reduced Russian supplies to countries such as Austria and Hungary. Ukraine has allowed gas to continue flowing through the pipeline as part of a contract that expires at the end of 2024.

Other online speculation suggested that a target of the incursion could be the Kursk nuclear power plant, but the facility is 35 miles from the border and a long way from what a force of several hundred – or thousand – would be capable of.

Russia has been pouring soldiers into Ukraine. Its force in the country is estimated at about 520,000, two to three times the size of the original invasion. Ukraine, meanwhile, is finding it challenging to mobilise fresh recruits and is being pushed back in certain parts of the eastern front, particularly the central Donbas towards Pokrovsk.

Russia says its troops are battling to push Ukrainian forces back a cross-border incursion.,https://www.politico.eu/article/vladimir-putin-react-russia-battle-ukraine-attack-kursk-region/,"Exiled Russian units allied with Kyiv have launched cross-border attacks into Russia in the past, but this week's reported incursion into Russia's Kursk region is one of the largest. It is also the first that has apparently involved regular Ukrainian forces — and has sparked the greatest alarm in the Kremlin.

It's a big blow to Putin's prestige, as he has tried to shield the Russian public from the consequences of the war he launched.

“Following my conversation with the acting governor of the Kursk region, instructions have been given to several civilian agencies to provide the necessary assistance to the region's residents. I also ask the government to take up this matter immediately,” Putin said at the briefing.

The first reports of a Ukrainian ground attack came on Tuesday from the acting governor of the Kursk region, Alexei Smirnov, who wrote on Telegram about “attempted border breakthroughs” in the Sudzhansky and Korenevsky districts, and later claimed that Ukrainians had attacked Russian border forces units at the settlements of Nikolayevo-Daryino and Oleshnya.

Smirnov also said that several thousand civilians had been evacuated from the fighting; Russian authorities said five civilians had been killed and 24 injured.

On Wednesday, the Russian Defense Ministry also announced that fighting between Russian forces and Ukrainian troops was continuing in the areas of the Kursk region directly adjacent to the Russian-Ukrainian border."

Russia says its troops are battling to push Ukrainian forces back a cross-border incursion.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/08/06/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-incursion/63124012-540c-11ef-9a60-5b6e8b4da7c0_story.html,"KYIV, Ukraine — Russian authorities claimed that a Ukrainian force launched an incursion on Tuesday into Russia’s Kursk region but was being beaten back by troops and local border guards. The Russian Defense Ministry said as many as 300 Ukrainian troops, supported by 11 tanks and more than 20 armored combat vehicles, attacked Russian border positions in the area of Nikolayevo-Daryino and Oleshnya in the Kursk region.

It claimed that six Ukrainian tanks, four armored personnel carriers and six other armored vehicles were destroyed in the fighting.

The Russian report could not be independently verified. Disinformation and propaganda have played a central role in the war, now in its third year.

Responsibility for previous incursions, into Russia’s Belgorod and Bryansk regions, have been claimed by two murky groups: the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Freedom of Russia Legion.

The Russian statement claimed the Ukrainian forces belonged to the army’s 22nd Mechanized Brigade, but also referred to them as “fighters” rather than “soldiers.”

Contacted by The Associated Press, the brigade said it had no comment. The Freedom of Russia Legion also said it was not commenting.

The Ukrainian General Staff and Ministry of Defense did not immediately reply to questions.

The acting governor of the Kursk region, Alexei Smirnov, said a total of 26 Ukrainian drones were shot down in the area during the night.

Russia says its troops are battling to push Ukrainian forces back a cross-border incursion.,https://inews.co.uk/news/world/ukraine-taking-russian-town-solve-army-problem-3213541,"Ukrainian forces have reportedly launched a major cross-border raid into Russian territory, with claims they have captured the border town of Sudzha, but the incursion is unlikely to turn around the army’s frontline struggles.

Russia’s military said it had thwarted an advance of Ukrainian troops and tanks in the southern Kursk region overnight on Wednesday, with the regional governor ordering the evacuation of residents from some areas.

It came after a Ukrainian commander told i that his forces had seized Sudhza, a town of about 5,000 people about six miles from the border, saying the move would “force” Russia to “reinforce their own border instead of continuing to advance in Ukraine”.

Ukrainian officials have not publicly commented on the raid, however, and previous incursions into Russian territory have been claimed by groups made up of Russian fighters who are aligned with Ukraine, namely the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Freedom of Russia Legion.

Frank Ledwidge, senior lecturer in war studies at Portsmouth University and a former military intelligence officer, said the Kursk incursion was not too dissimilar to the cross-border attacks in Russia’s Belgorod region earlier this year and in 2023, which were carried out by pro-Ukraine Russian fighters “with very limited success”.

“I have no doubt that, once the Russian military got its act together and deploys a battalion, the Ukrainians will retreat across the border again in due course,” he told i . “Which is exactly what happened in Belgorod with these Russian resistance units.

“Will it help them [Ukrainians] on the front? No, I don’t think so… it helps in the information war, in that it gives the impression of striking back into Russia, but from a military perspective this is nothing significant… that part of the border is relatively quiet.”

The Kursk region shares a 150-mile-long border with Ukraine, leaving it vulnerable to cross-border shelling, missile strikes and ground raids from Ukraine. But as seen in the Belgorod incursions, fighters were pushed back with no gains to show.

The battle in Kursk comes as Ukrainian troops struggle to push back against Russia’s latest offensive along the eastern front, with reports that Kyiv has lost control of almost 200 sq km (77 sq miles) to Moscow advances last month.

Even with a fresh supply of US and European military aid on its way, Ukraine is still massively outgunned.

Dr Ledwidge said it may be possible that the Kursk incursion drew some Russian reserves away from their military posts, but that it is unlikely to have affected the number of troops on the front line.

“‘I think the numbers involved are so insignificant that they will have no effect,” he added. “The Russians don’t have a problem with manpower, or indeed gear. The Ukrainians have a problem with that.”

Lucian Kim, a senior analyst for Ukraine at the International Crisis Group think-tank, agreed, saying there is still no accurate picture of what is happening in the Kursk region.

“This kind of attack will unlikely change the overall picture of the war,” he told i . “But for the Ukrainians, it is more of psychological importance: showing Russians that they are not safe in their own borders and demonstrating to Ukrainians that their military is capable of striking back inside Russia.

“At a time when Russian forces are making steady gains in the [eastern Ukrainian] Donetsk region, this foray also raises the question of whether Ukraine shouldn’t instead be concentrating its forces on holding back the enemy on its own territory.”

Sudzha is the last operational trans-shipping point for Russian natural gas to Europe via Ukraine. The Urengoy–Pomary–Uzhhorod pipeline carried about half of Russia’s natural gas exports to Europe last year, according to Reuters. Gas transit continued on Wednesday at the same level as in previous days, said Sergei Kupriyanov, spokesman of Russia’s gas giant Gazprom.

With gas being a key source of income for the Kremlin, it cannot afford to ignore assaults or threats of attacks in Kursk, said Paul van Hooft, research leader of defence and security at Rand Europe.

Russia could be forced to divert military resources across their border to strategic areas “which then will not be available for the war in Ukraine”, he told i .

“That doesn’t just apply to soldiers, armoured carriers, and other fairly basic military assets; I could imagine that particularly good Russian sensors – manned or unmanned aircraft, satellites, radars – will be forced to devote more of their time monitoring border areas,” he added.

“These are limited and valuable already by themselves, but more so now for the Russian efforts to exploit attacks in Ukraine and hold off Ukrainian counterattacks.”

The Russian defence ministry claimed on Wednesday that up to 300 Ukrainian troops had crossed into Russia and suffered heavy losses. It added that the fighting was continuing and that its military had already destroyed 50 armoured vehicles, including seven tanks.

The acting regional governor of Kursk, Alexey Smirnov, said on Wednesday that he had reported to Russian President Vladimir Putin on the situation, saying it was “under control”.

“The President emphasised that support will be provided to our region in all areas,” he wrote on Telegram.

Just 15 minutes after that post, he warned of a missile threat and urged residents in the region to “shelter in rooms without windows with solid walls: in the hallway, bathroom, storage room. If you are outside, go into the nearest building or suitable shelter”."

MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia said on Wednesday it was fighting intense battles against Ukrainian forces that had penetrated its southern border near a major natural gas transmission hub, in one of the largest incursions into Russian territory since the war began.

The acting governor of Kursk region, Alexey Smirnov, said he had introduced a state of emergency in the border region. Regional officials said that meant restricting access to specific areas.

Russia's health ministry said 31 civilians, including six children, had been wounded. Smirnov said on Tuesday that five people had been killed.

No information on military casualties was available.

Russia's National Guard said it had beefed up security around the nearby Kursk nuclear power station and its four reactors.

Russia has advanced this year after the failure of Ukraine's 2023 counteroffensive to achieve major gains, and has taken 420 square km (162 square miles) of territory from Ukrainian forces since June 14, Russian officials say.

Ukraine struck back on Tuesday, and battles continued through the night into Wednesday as Ukrainian forces pushed to the northwest of the border town of Sudzha, 530 km (330 miles) southwest of Moscow, Russia's defence ministry said.

""The Kyiv regime has launched another major provocation,"" President Vladimir Putin told members of the Russian government, referring to the attack in Kursk region.

NEARLY 1,000 UKRAINIAN SOLDIERS

The chief of Russia's general staff, Valery Gerasimov, told Putin that Russian forces had halted a thrust by up to 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers - more than three times the figure that Russia's defence ministry had stated on Tuesday - and would push them back to the border.

The advance was stopped by ""the actions of the units covering the state border together with border guards and reinforcement units, with airstrikes, missile and artillery fire,"" Gerasimov said in televised comments.

The Ukrainian military appeared to have adopted a strategy of strict silence.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in his nightly video address on Wednesday, made no reference to the attack, while exhorting Kyiv's soldiers to press on and weaken Russian forces.

Ukraine's General Staff also made no acknowledgment in its daily battlefield update. In a late evening report, it said fighting had intensified in Sumy region -- across the border from Russia's Kursk region.

The General Staff said Russian forces had deployed aircraft, helicopters and heavy weapons in the area ""but made no headway and suffered significant losses"".

'NO VIOLATION' OF RULES ON WEAPONS, WASHINGTON SAYS

In Washington, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said the United States was seeking an understanding from Ukraine of the incursion, and said it had had no advance knowledge of it.

State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said U.S. rules on Ukrainian use of U.S. weapons - authorised in areas over the Russian border - remained in effect, but that Ukraine's actions were ""not a violation of our policy.""

The Russian ambassador to Washington, Anatoly Antonov, said on Telegram that U.S. statements on the Ukrainian action were ""outrageous...not a word criticising their clients, not a regret about the victims of the tragedy"".

There was fighting around Sudzha, the last operational trans-shipping point for Russian natural gas to Europe via Ukraine. The Urengoy–Pomary–Uzhhorod pipeline carried about 14.65 billion cubic metres of gas in 2023, about half of Russia's gas exports to Europe.

Ukraine's gas transmission operator said Russian gas was transiting to European consumers normally. Just 60 km to the northeast lies the Kursk nuclear power station.

The battles around Sudzha come at a crucial juncture in the conflict, the biggest land war in Europe since World War Two. Kyiv is concerned that U.S. support could drop off if Republican Donald Trump wins the November presidential election.

Trump has said he would end the war, and both Russia and Ukraine are keen to gain the strongest possible bargaining position on the battlefield. Ukraine wants to pin down Russian forces and show the West it can still mount major battles.

Russian military bloggers depicted the situation in Kursk region as more serious than the official accounts, with some suggesting that Ukraine had opened a new front. Russia has sent reserves to help shore up its defences.

Some bloggers suggested that Ukraine might be planning an advance on the Kursk nuclear plant.

Both Kyiv and Moscow say they do not target civilians in the war, triggered by Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.

Russian Telegram channels carried unverified footage of shelled houses.

Forces describing themselves as voluntary paramilitaries fighting on Ukraine's side penetrated parts of Kursk and the adjacent Belgorod region earlier this year, triggering a push by Russian troops to set up a buffer zone in Ukraine's northeast.

"ISIS-inspired suspect planned suicide attack at Taylor Swift concert, Austrian authorities say.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/08/europe/isis-inspired-suicide-terror-attack-taylor-swift-vienna-intl/index.html,"CNN —

Police in Austria have questioned three teenagers suspected of plotting a suicide attack at a Taylor Swift show, sparking renewed concerns over the indoctrination of young people online.

Foreign intelligence agencies helped authorities uncover the alleged scheme, according to the country’s Interior Minister Gerhard Karner. A source familiar told CNN that the US issued a warning to authorities in Vienna.

Organizers canceled three concerts, which were scheduled to take place in the European capital from Thursday to Saturday. CNN has reached out to Swift’s representatives for comment.

Investigators unearthed a stockpile of chemicals, explosive devices, detonators and 21,000 euros in counterfeit cash at the home of the main suspect, a 19-year-old ISIS sympathizer who had been radicalized online, according to authorities.

The young man – who was arrested Wednesday morning in the eastern town of Ternitz – planned to kill himself and “a large number of people,” according to the head of the domestic intelligence agency, Omar Haijawi-Pirchner.

“He said he intended to carry out an attack using explosives and knives,” Haijawi-Pirchner told reporters in Vienna on Thursday. “His aim was to kill himself and a large number of people during the concert, either today or tomorrow.”

Two other suspects were detained, aged 17 and 15. The 17-year-old worked for a facilities company that would have provided services at the concert venue. He was near the stadium when he was arrested and had recently broken up with his girlfriend, according to Haijwai-Pirchner.

Little has been revealed about the 15-year-old. Prosecutors will decide later if he was a witness or directly involved in the alleged plot.

The three are all Austrian-born with either Turkish, North Macedonian or Croatian backgrounds.

The trio were in contact with other individuals who knew about the plan, said the country’s director general for public security, Franz Ruf. No one else is being sought in direct connection with the plot, Ruf added.

The cancellations of the Swift concert triggered an outpouring of heartbreak, grief and relief among Swifties hoping to attend the record-breaking Eras Tour in Vienna. Hailed as a cultural phenomenon, the scale, influence and intricacy of Swift’s musical voyage have made headlines for boosting the economies of the cities she visits.

The show-stopping tour began in Glendale, Arizona in March 2023, and has been extended several times. Vienna was scheduled to be the penultimate venue of the European leg, with Swift set to play five nights at London’s Wembley Stadium over the next two weeks, before moving on to Canada in November and December.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the city would “carry on” with the scheduled events, telling Sky News: “I’m sure Vienna has got its own reasons to cancel the Taylor Swift concerts, we’re going to carry on, working closely with police (and) ensuring that the Taylor Swift concerts can take place in London safely.”

A rush of excitement descended on the Austrian capital in the days leading up to the three-day fest, according to locals, with Swifties filling the cobbled streets and spontaneously breaking out into song.

Several fans who were planning to attend shows in Vienna told CNN they participated in a series of events Thursday that were staged in a community-led effort to rekindle the spirit and energy of the tour.

Footage has emerged of Swifties serenading each another at local squares in Vienna and trading personalized friendship bracelets – a concert tradition inspired by the lyrics on Swift’s song “You’re on Your Own, Kid” from her 10th studio album “Midnights.”

Julia Schnizlein, a pastor at the Lutheran City Church, told CNN that she bought tickets as a Christmas gift for her 14-year-old daughter, Leni, who was left heartbroken on Wednesday.

“We were really looking forward to the concert and have met a lot of fans over the last few days,” the 45-year-old said. “The whole city was full of happy, peaceful people exchanging bracelets and spontaneously singing together.”

Instead, the pastor opened the doors of her church to host a Swift-themed singalong for fans. Social media videos show people bopping their heads to melodies of some of the Grammy-winning artist’s greatest hits – including “Blank Space” and “Style” – as music blares from the speakers of the hall, illuminated by the glow of yellow candles.

“People were crying, holding hands, singing along softly,” said Kristi Hovington, 46, who wandered into the chapel after hearing tunes from the Eras Tour setlist. “It was such a beautiful moment, a pocket of beauty amidst the disappointment and anger.”

The school librarian journeyed from Barcelona, Spain, to attend the tour with her 14-year-old daughter, Esme, who had dreamed of seeing Swift live in concert. “She cried for an hour, at least; this was her dream, to see Taylor.”

Elsewhere in the capital, dozens of fans congregated at the Stephansplatz, a central square, to belt out an array of Swift songs. One participant, Elie Fares, said he was “devastated” for fans who had lost their chance to see the US pop star on tour.

“I just walked right over and basked in the camaraderie of it all, the way it exuded a lot of joie de vivre, a giant middle finger to all of those who wanted the squash that joy and instil fear,” added the 34-year-old physician, who has attended shows in the US and Europe.

“Swifties have shown time and time again that they are a formidable community among music fans,” he told CNN on Thursday. “In the grand scheme of what’s happening around the world today, we are all aware of where a concert cancellation falls, but that doesn’t mean we can’t be supportive of each other.”"
"ISIS-inspired suspect planned suicide attack at Taylor Swift concert, Austrian authorities say.",https://apnews.com/article/austria-taylor-swift-concerts-canceled-extremism-arrests-17b494f1a164b205128d7faeb607e731,"VIENNA (AP) — Both suspects in a foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift shows in Vienna appeared to be inspired by the Islamic State group and al-Qaida, Austrian authorities said Thursday, and investigators found bomb-making materials at one of their homes. Officials said one of the two confessed to planning to “kill as many people as possible outside the concert venue.”

Three sold-out concerts were canceled Wednesday because of the plot, devastating Swifties from across the globe. Many of them had dropped thousands of euros (dollars) on travel and lodging in Austria’s expensive capital city to attend the Eras Tour shows at the Ernst Happel Stadium, which sat empty Thursday morning.

Europe is enamored with the American superstar: The German town of Gelsenkirchen renamed itself “Swiftkirchen” before its mid-July concerts.

Concert organizers in Austria said they had expected up to 65,000 fans inside the stadium at each concert and as many as 30,000 onlookers outside, where authorities said the suspects planned to strike. The foiled attack was planned for Thursday or Friday, according to Austria’s interior minister, Gerhard Karner.

Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer defended the decision to cancel the concerts, saying the arrests of the suspects took place too close to the shows, scheduled for Thursday, Friday and Saturday.

“I understand very well that those who wanted to experience the concert live are very sad,” Nehammer told a news conference Thursday. “Moms and dads are looking after their daughters and sons, who were full of enthusiasm and anticipation for this concert. But it’s also important that in such serious moments as now, it’s inevitable that safety comes first.”

Swift is also scheduled to perform at London’s Wembley stadium in five concerts between Aug. 15 and 20 to close the European leg of her record-setting Eras Tour.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan said that while he understood Vienna’s reasons for canceling, “We’re going to carry on.” Khan said the capital’s authorities were prepared for shows there following lessons learned from a 2017 attack at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, that killed 22 people.

A suicide bomber had set up a knapsack with explosives in Manchester Arena. The bomb detonated at the end of Grande’s concert as thousands of young fans were leaving.

Last month, an attacker in England killed three girls and wounded 10 people in a knife attack during a Taylor Swift-themed dance and yoga class. Swift at the time said she was ‘’completely in shock’’ over the violence.

In Austria, the main suspect confessed that he had started planning the attack in July, authorities said. The 19-year-old just a few weeks ago uploaded to the internet an oath of allegiance to the current leader of the Islamic State group.

He was “clearly radicalized in the direction of the Islamic State and thinks it is right to kill infidels,” said Omar Haijawi-Pirchner, head of the Directorate of State Security and Intelligence.

Haijawi-Pirchner added that the suspect “wanted to carry out an attack in the area outside the stadium, killing as many people as possible using the knives or even using the explosive devices he had made.”

During a raid of the suspect’s home in Ternitz, south of Vienna, investigators found chemical substances and technical devices that indicated “concrete preparatory acts,” said Franz Ruf, director general for public security at the Ministry of the Interior.

Authorities said they also found Islamic State group and al-Qaida material at the home of the second suspect, who is 17. That suspect, who has so far refused to talk, was employed a few days ago by a company providing unspecified services at the venue for the concerts. The 19-year-old is an Austrian with North Macedonian roots. The 17-year-old is an Austrian with Turkish and Croatian roots.

The North Macedonian Interior Ministry released a statement Thursday saying that it had received a request from Austria to look into the 19-year-old.

Both teens were arrested Tuesday. Neither of their names was released in line with Austrian privacy rules.

The suspects had undergone clear social changes recently, authorities said. The 19-year-old had quit his job but said he “still had big plans,” while the other broke up with his girlfriend. Neither suspect appeared to have a ticket to any of the shows, Haijawi-Pirchner said.

Karner said that Austria’s intelligence service had worked closely together with foreign intelligence services to capture the two teens. He did not identify the agencies, but added that the help was needed because Austrian investigators, unlike some foreign services, can’t legally monitor text messages.

The CIA declined to say Thursday whether U.S. intelligence agencies played any role in the investigation. The U.S. State Department and the broader U.S. government have been in contact with Austrian officials about the alleged plot, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said.

No other suspects are being sought, though a 15-year-old who had been in contact with both suspects was also interrogated by police, Karner said.

“The situation is serious. But we can also say: A tragedy was prevented,” he said.

Concert organizer Barracuda Music said in an Instagram post late Wednesday that it had “no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone’s safety.”

Barracuda said all tickets would be refunded. The same message was posted under the Vienna dates on Swift’s official website. Austrian rail operator OeBB in the meantime said that it would reimburse fans for unused train tickets for the concerts.

Swift has not spoken publicly about the plot or canceled shows. “Taylor Nation,” a verified Instagram page widely believed to be run by her team, reposted the announcement from Barracuda Music in a “story,” which is only visible for 24 hours. Her main account has not posted anything.

Swift’s biggest fear has always been that such large-scale violence could take place at her concerts, the superstar told Elle magazine in 2019 ahead of her Lover Tour, which was ultimately canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. The attack at Grande’s concert, as well as a 2017 mass shooting at an outdoor country music festival on the Las Vegas Strip where 58 people were killed, worried Swift as she prepared to circle the globe.

“I was completely terrified to go on (the Lover Tour) this time because I didn’t know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months,” she told the magazine. “There was a tremendous amount of planning, expense, and effort put into keeping my fans safe.”

An official inquiry reported in 2023 that Britain’s domestic intelligence agency, MI5, didn’t act swiftly enough on key information and missed a significant opportunity to prevent the Manchester bombing, the deadliest extremist attack in the United Kingdom in recent years.

Terrorism expert Magnus Ranstorp, based at the Swedish Defense University in Stockholm, told The Associated Press by phone that any mass public event constitutes a potential threat now.

“So we shouldn’t be surprised that these extremely popular iconic popstars that attract a massive audience will also attract terrorists that want to create fear and destruction and mayhem,” he said.

The two suspects, who investigators say had become radicalized online by ISIS, had allegedly wanted to carry out the attack outside the Ernst Happel Stadium — killing fans with self-made explosives and machetes, security officials said Thursday.

“The suspects actually had very specific and detailed plans … to leave a bloodbath in their wake,” Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said.

He had allegedly also made progress in building the bomb he planned to strap to the car, they added.

Meanwhile, the second suspect — a 17-year-old Austrian citizen with Turkish and Croatian roots — was nabbed by special police forces near the stadium where the concerts were supposed to take place this week.

The second suspect had only just been employed a few days ago by a company providing services at the venue during the concerts, officials said.

Sources told German news outlet Kurier that he’d been hired to work there as security.

The pair had displayed noticeable changes in their behavior in the leadup to their arrests, according to Franz Ruf, public security director at Austria’s Interior Ministry.

Here's everything we know about the attempted terrorist attack at a Taylor Swift concert A 17-year-old and a 19-year-old were arrested for plotting an ISIS-style terror attack at one of Taylor Swift’s Austrian concerts this week.

The would-be terrorists planned to drive a bomb-filled car into the Eras Tour crowd to kill as many people as possible.

The main suspect — who authorities say fully confessed to the attack plans after his arrest — had recently sworn allegiance to Islamic State’s leader online, security officials said. He had reportedly just been hired by the venue to work security.

Swift’s three sold-out Eras shows in Vienna have been canceled.

Taylor Swift previously said her “biggest fear” in life was a violent attack at one of her concerts in a resurfaced article penned by the singer in 2019.

The older teen had quit his job on July 25 and told people he had “something big” planned, while the 17-year-old recently broke up with his girlfriend, Ruf said.

Austria’s Vice Chancellor Werner Kogler said in a post in X: “For many, a dream has been shattered today. On three evenings in Vienna, tens of thousands of #Swifties should have celebrated life together.

“I am very sorry that you were denied this. Swifties stick together, hate and terror can’t destroy that,” Kogler wrote.

But some Swifties who had traveled to Vienna for the show were undeterred – with many turning out in the streets of the Austrian capital city to console each other over the near miss.

Filling the city streets by the hundreds, fans joined arms to belt out their favorite Swift songs together, swapped friendship bracelets, and shared group hugs.

Swift’s next shows, scheduled for August 15 through 20 in London, are expected to go ahead as planned.

“We’re going to carry on,” said London Mayor Sadiq Khan, adding that England had learned the hard way to deal with concert threats after a bomb detonated at a 2017 Ariana Grande concert killed 22 people.

Swift hasn’t yet commented publicly about the cancellations or terror threat.

"ISIS-inspired suspect planned suicide attack at Taylor Swift concert, Austrian authorities say.",https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/officials-say-suspects-in-foiled-plot-at-taylor-swift-shows-hoped-to-kill-as-many-people-as-possible,"VIENNA (AP) — Both suspects in a foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift shows in Vienna appeared to be inspired by the Islamic State group and al-Qaida, Austrian authorities said Thursday, and investigators found bomb-making materials at one of their homes. Officials said one of the two confessed to planning to “kill as many people as possible outside the concert venue.”

Three sold-out concerts were canceled a day earlier because of the plot, devastating Swifties from across the globe. Many of them had dropped thousands of euros (dollars) on travel and lodging in Austria’s expensive capital city to attend the Eras Tour shows at the Ernst Happel Stadium, which sat empty Thursday morning as media filmed outside.

Concert organizers said they stood behind their decision, saying they expected up to 65,000 fans inside the stadium at each concert and as many as 30,000 onlookers outside, where authorities said the suspects planned to strike.

Officials told reporters that the main suspect, a 19-year-old Austrian, began working on his attack plans in July, and just a few weeks ago uploaded to the internet an oath of allegiance to the current leader of the Islamic State group militia. He planned to use knives or homemade explosives.

“He wanted to carry out an attack in the area outside the stadium, killing as many people as possible using the knives or even using the explosive devices he had made,” said Omar Haijawi-Pirchner, the head of the Directorate of State Security and Intelligence, citing the 19-year-old’s confession.

He was “clearly radicalized in the direction of the Islamic State and thinks it is right to kill infidels,” Haijawi-Pirchner added.

The foiled attack was planned for Thursday or Friday, according to Austria’s interior minister, Gerhard Karner. Neither suspect appeared to have a ticket to any of the shows.

During a raid of the main suspect’s home in Ternitz, south of Vienna, investigators found chemical substances and technical devices that indicated “concrete preparatory acts,” said Franz Ruf, Director General for Public Security at the Ministry of the Interior.

Authorities also found Islamic State group and al-Qaida material at the home of the second suspect, a 17-year-old Austrian. He was employed a few days ago by a company providing services at the venue for the concerts, and was arrested by special police forces near the stadium.

Both teens were arrested Tuesday. Neither’s name was released in line with Austrian privacy rules.

No other suspects are being sought, Karner, the interior minister, said. However, a 15-year-old, who had been in contact with both suspects, was also interrogated by police.

“The situation was serious, the situation is serious. But we can also say: A tragedy was prevented,” he said.

Concert organizers, Barracuda Music, said in an Instagram post late Wednesday that “we have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone’s safety.” It cited government officials’ confirmation of a planned attack at the stadium.

Swift and her team have not spoken publicly about the plot or canceled shows. Her Instagram page reposted Barracuda Music’s announcement in a “story,” which only last 24 hours.

Last month, an attacker in England killed three girls and wounded 10 other people in knife attack during a Taylor Swift-themed dance and yoga class. Swift at the time said she was ‘’completely in shock’’ over the attack.

Europe is enamored with the American superstar, with the German town of Gelsenkirchen renaming itself “Swiftkirchen” before its mid-July concerts.

Austria’s Vice-Chancellor Werner Kogler wrote on social platform X: “For many, a dream has been shattered today. On three evenings in Vienna, tens of thousands of #Swifties should have celebrated life together.”

“I am very sorry that you were denied this. Swifties stick together, hate and terror can’t destroy that,” Kogler added.

Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer posted on X that “the cancellation of the Taylor Swift concerts by the organizers is a bitter disappointment for all fans in Austria.”

“The situation surrounding the apparently planned terror attack in Vienna was very serious,” he wrote. But he added that, thanks to intensive cooperation between police and Austrian and foreign intelligence, “the threat could be recognized early on, tackled and a tragedy prevented.”

Barracuda Music said that “all tickets will be automatically refunded within the next 10 business days.” The same wording was posted under the Vienna dates on Swift’s official website.

The Vienna stadium had been sold out for the planned concerts, APA reported, with an estimated 170,000 fans expected for the concerts in Austria. Some who posted on X lamented months of now-wasted efforts to make friendship bracelets and pick out fashionable outfits for the performance.

Swift is expected to perform at London’s Wembley stadium in five concerts between Aug. 15 and 20 to close the European leg of her record-setting Eras Tour.

In 2017, an attack at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, killed 22 people. Suicide bomber Salman Abedi set up a knapsack bomb in Manchester Arena at the end of Grande’s concert as thousands of young fans were leaving. More than 100 people were injured. Abedi died in the explosion.

An official inquiry reported in 2023 that Britain’s domestic intelligence agency, MI5, didn’t act swiftly enough on key information and missed a significant opportunity to prevent the bombing, the deadliest extremist attack in the United Kingdom in recent years."

Investigators who foiled a planned terror attack outside Taylor Swift’s concerts in Vienna, Austria, found bomb-making materials and propaganda from the Islamic State and al-Qaida at the two suspects’ homes.

Officials released a photo of one of the suspects, a 19-year-old Austrian, who had uploaded to the internet an oath of allegiance to the current ISIS leader. He planned to use knives or homemade explosives to ""kill as many people as possible outside the concert venue,"" authorities said Thursday.

All three sold-out Swift concerts in Vienna were canceled on Wednesday because of the planned attack, devastating Swifties from across the world who had spent thousands to attend the Eras Tour Shows at Ernst Happel Stadium.

Up to 65,000 fans were expected inside the stadium, with an additional 30,000 onlookers outside. Officials said the suspects planned to carry out the attack outside the venue on Thursday or Friday, as neither had tickets for the shows.

The 17-year-old suspect conspiring the terror threat reportedly started working at concert stop - Ernst Happel Stadium - days before the pop star's shows. TMZ stated that the teenager had got the gig with a facility management company at the concert venue as a means to better prepare for the alleged attack alongside his accomplice.

Authorities also claimed that the terrorists possibly had plans to drive a vehicle into the crowd outside the stadium, where Taylor's fans - who miss out on bagging a ticket to the show - gather around to listen to their favourite singer. Here, the 17-year-old, who was arrested outside the venue, could have detonated a bomb.

What's been discovered about the suspects of the foiled Taylor Swift Vienna concert terror attack?

General Director for Public Security Frankz Ruf said the purported suspects' disposition reflected “concrete preparatory actions,” resulting in authorities labelling the near disaster a “serious terror plot.” He also uncovered that the oldest teen suspect of the trio “had a particular focus on the Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna.”

According to a Thursday press release by the Vienna Federal Ministry of the Interior, the prime suspect, arrested on Wednesday, intended to attack fans using “bladed weapons as well as the construction of a bomb.”

Ruf added that officials found “chemical substances, liquids, explosive and technical devices that could be used to manufacture explosives” at the suspect's home. The search also discovered bomb-making instructions and machetes.

National intelligence head Omar Haijawi-Pirchner said, “He wanted to carry out an attack in the area outside the stadium, killing as many people as possible using the knives or even using the explosive devices he had made.”

In addition to confessing to the charges against him, the suspect also revealed he had recently left his job while swearing allegiance to ISIS.

Shortly after the news made headlines, the pop singer cancelled three of her Eras Tour concerts in Vienna. Her upcoming London shows remain unaffected by these recent cancellations and are expected to proceed as scheduled.

“There is nothing to indicate that the matters being investigated by the Austrian authorities will have an impact on upcoming events here in London,” a spokesperson for London's Metropolitan Police said."

Speaking to the media following the arrest of the 19-year-old and 17-year-old male suspects, Austrian officials said the terror plot was planned for either Thursday or Friday’s show and that the suspects’ aim was to “kill as many people as possible outside the concert venue.”

Bomb-making materials were found at the home of the 19-year-old suspect, who officials say was inspired by Al Qaeda and ISIS. He was “clearly radicalized in the direction of the Islamic State and thinks it is right to kill infidels,” said Omar Haijawi-Pirchner, Austria’s head of the Directorate of State Security and Intelligence (via The Associated Press). “His goal was to kill himself and a large crowd of people.”

The 19-year-old suspect allegedly began planning the attack in July and had recently signed an online oath to ISIS. A raid of his home south of Vienna uncovered chemical substances and technical devices that indicated “concrete preparatory acts,” the Ministry of the Interior said.

According to officials, the suspect stole chemicals from his workplace to build a bomb. The suspect also planned to drive his vehicle into the crowd congregated outside the stadium while armed with knives and machetes.

The 17-year-old suspect was arrested by police near the Vienna stadium where Swift was set to perform; authorities said that the suspect — who also had ISIS and Al Qaeda material at his home — was employed by a company that provided unspecified services to concerts at the Ernst Happel Stadium.

“The situation was serious, the situation is serious. But we can also say: A tragedy was prevented,” Austria’s interior minister Gerhard Karner said Thursday.

Although investigators do not believe anyone else was involved in the terror plot, the decision was still made by Barracuda Music, the organizer of the Eras Tour Vienna shows, to cancel the concerts, which were estimated to draw 65,000 people inside the stadium and an additional 10,000 people outside the venue for each show.

“With confirmation from government officials of a planned terrorist attack at Ernst Happel Stadium, we have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone’s safety,” Barracuda Music shared in a statement.

“The cancellation of the Taylor Swift concerts by the organizers is a bitter disappointment for all fans in Austria,” Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said in a statement. “The situation surrounding the apparently planned terrorist attack in Vienna was very serious. Thanks to the intensive cooperation of our police and the newly established DSN with foreign services, the threat was recognized early, combated and a tragedy prevented. Many thanks to the emergency services who are currently investigating at full speed.”

He continued, “We live in a time in which violent means are being used to attack our Western way of life. Islamist terrorism threatens security and freedom in many Western countries. This is precisely why we will not give up our values ​​​​such as freedom and democracy, but will defend them even more vehemently.”

Swift has not yet commented on the cancelled Vienna shows.

Vienna was the second-to-last stop on the European leg of the Eras Tour, which concludes next week with five shows at London’s Wembley Stadium.

Taylor Swift Cancels Three European Concerts After ISIS Attack Thwarted

U.S. intelligence learned about the plan and passed details on to Europol and the Austrians, according to ABC News.

Austrian Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said on Thursday that the 19-year-old suspect with Macedonian roots has admitted to the terror plot. He did not have a ticket for the concert.

Two others, one aged 17 and another 15, are also being questioned. The 17-year-old worked for a “facility company” that offered concert services in Vienna and was arrested at the stadium. He is said to have broken up with his girlfriend shortly before the planned attack, according to the German tabloid Bild.

Karner reportedly said the 19-year-old built a bomb made from the chemical TATP that he stole from work at a metal processing plant before quitting on July 25 and telling colleagues: “I still have big plans.”

The interior minister also said that the suspect also “hoarded knives, machetes, blank ammunition, counterfeit money, and a blue police light,” according to Bild.

The police light was to get to or from the scene of the Swift concert on Friday night.

Bild reported that the teenager watched Islamic State bomb-making videos and IS propaganda. He is also said to have sworn an oath of loyalty to the terrorist group in early July.

The 19-year-old was arrested in Vienna on Wednesday afternoon. Swift was due to perform in front of more than 170,000 fans in Vienna on August 8,9 and 10. The shows have now been canceled.

Vienna police said the suspects had friends hired as security for the event. The three suspects – aged 19, 17, and 15 – reportedly planned to “bomb the gig and mow down fans” before the terror suicide plot was foiled by U.S. intelligence and Europol. One suspect, a 19-year-old Austrian who has been identified only as Beran A., apparently planned to drive a car through the roughly 20,000 fans expected to gather outside Swift’s first concert on Thursday night. Knives and machetes were also said to be included in the botched ISIS-inspired attack plans. The 19-year-old suspect later confessed, saying he “intended to carry out an attack using explosives and knives”.

Domestic Intelligence Agency head Omar Haijawi-Pirchner said during a news conference Thursday: “He wanted to carry out an attack in the area outside the stadium, killing as many people as possible using the knives or even using the explosive devices he had made. “His aim was to kill himself and a large number of people during the concert either today or tomorrow.” At least one suspect also reportedly infiltrated security at the event. He was hired to help set up and supervise the three shows.

"ISIS-inspired suspect planned suicide attack at Taylor Swift concert, Austrian authorities say.",https://nypost.com/2024/08/07/world-news/isis-plot-against-taylor-swift-concert-in-vienna-narrowly-foiled/,"Three Taylor Swift shows have been canceled on the European leg of her Eras tour after police narrowly thwarted an ISIS plot to attack her concerts in Vienna — and authorities warned there could be other threats.

Swift’s sold-out Vienna shows – slated for Thursday, Friday, and Saturday – were called off after the terror scare, her Austrian show promoter Barracuda announced.

“With confirmation from government officials of a planned terrorist attack at Ernst Happel Stadium, we have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone’s safety,” the promoter said in a post on Instagram.

A 19-year-old suspect living at his parents’ home in Ternitz — just south of Vienna — was arrested Wednesday morning during a police raid on the house, law enforcement sources told The Post.

A second suspect was apprehended later in the afternoon.

A bomb squad found various chemicals and substances potentially being used to make explosives, and evacuated the home.

The pair were allegedly targeting Swift’s concerts at Vienna’s Ernst Happel Stadium, where she is scheduled to play Thursday through Saturday night to sold-out crowds, according to Kronen Zeitung.

“The suspects were focused on the Taylor Swift concerts. We discovered that he was taking action to prepare for the attack,” said Austrian Director General for Public Safety Franz Ruf.

“A clear threat has been averted,” he said, adding that authorities had not yet declared the concerts entirely safe and were still investigating other accomplices, according to Kronen Zeitung.

The 19-year-old suspect is an Austrian national, and is believed to have pledged allegiance to the Islamic terror group in July.

He and the other suspect are believed to have become radicalized online.

Both suspects had been under surveillance by Austrian authorities and were known risks before the arrest, a pair of US officials familiar with the matter said, according to NBC News.

Here's everything we know about the attempted terrorist attack at a Taylor Swift concert A 17-year-old and a 19-year-old were arrested for plotting an ISIS-style terror attack at one of Taylor Swift’s Austrian concerts this week.

The would-be terrorists planned to drive a bomb-filled car into the Eras Tour crowd to kill as many people as possible.

The main suspect — who authorities say fully confessed to the attack plans after his arrest — had recently sworn allegiance to Islamic State’s leader online, security officials said. He had reportedly just been hired by the venue to work security.

Swift’s three sold-out Eras shows in Vienna have been canceled.

Taylor Swift previously said her “biggest fear” in life was a violent attack at one of her concerts in a resurfaced article penned by the singer in 2019.

The 19-year-old had allegedly purchased the chemicals required to create a bomb but did not yet have all the necessary components, according to officials.

It is unlikely he would have been able to assemble a bomb before the concerts this week, officials added, noting they nevertheless decided to make arrests in case the suspects found other means to attack the shows.

Security plans have been increased at the concerts.

In 2017, 22 people were killed when extremist Salman Abedi, 22, detonated a homemade bomb at Ariana Grande’s concert in Manchester, England.

More than 200 people were injured, and nearly 1,000 reported suffering severe psychological trauma in the fallout.

The bomber was killed in the explosion, but his brother, Hashem Abedi, later admitted to helping plot the attack and was sentenced to 55 years in prison.

On July 29, three girls were killed when a hooded 17-year-old burst into a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport, England, and began slashing attendees with a knife.

Nine others were injured, several of whom were parents trying to defend their kids.

The motivation behind that attack remains unknown, and false rumors surrounding it sparked riots across the country.

Swift previously told Elle magazine that a terror-style attack at a concert was one of her biggest fears in life.

“After the Manchester Arena bombing and the Vegas concert shooting, I was completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didn’t know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months,” she told the magazine in 2019 ahead of her Lover tour.

“There was a tremendous amount of planning, expense, and effort put into keeping my fans safe,” she said, adding that her “fear of violence” had spread into her personal life so much so that she carries military-grade gunshot bandages around with her.

"ISIS-inspired suspect planned suicide attack at Taylor Swift concert, Austrian authorities say.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/taylor-swift-vienna-concert-plot-planning-suicide-attack-rcna165734,"MAINZ, Germany — The prime suspect in a plot to attack Taylor Swift’s upcoming ""Eras Tour"" shows in Vienna confessed that he had planned to kill himself and a large number of other people with knives and explosive devices, officials in Austria said Thursday.

The 19-year-old Austrian with North Macedonian roots had downloaded manuals for bomb building, Omar Haijawi-Pirchner, head of Austria's Directorate of State Security and Intelligence, told a news conference.

They also found hydrogen peroxide, homemade explosives, detonators and detonator cables at his apartment, he added. Explosives had been assembled, he said.

“The situation was serious, the situation is serious. But we can also say: A tragedy was prevented,” Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said at the same news conference.

“Large concerts are often a target of Islamist attacks,” he added.

Haijawi-Pirchner said Islamic State terrorist group and Al Qaeda material had been found at the home of the second suspect in the foiled plot, a 17-year-old Austrian citizen with Turkish and Croatian roots.

He added that the suspect had been employed for some days by a company that would have provided services at the concert, although he did not specify which services it provided.

Police also found videos and screenshots of home laboratories, which are often shared by ISIS and Al Qaeda, on the suspects' cellphones, he added.

A third suspect, a 15-year old Austrian national with Turkish roots, was currently being questioned by authorities, he added.

No one else is being sought in connection with the plot, although others may have known about the plans and are part of the ongoing investigation, Haijawi-Pirchner said.

“There is no information of explicit danger to further concerts,” he added.

Franz Ruf, the public security director at Austria’s Interior Ministry, said the prime suspect “gave a full confession” and no one else was being sought in connection with the case.

The United States intelligence community was the first to alert Austrian law enforcement about a potential terror attack, a senior U.S. law enforcement official told NBC News on Thursday. The U.S. intelligence community told Austria officials they had a problem and the general sense of what to look for, the official said.

Swift had been scheduled to play at the Austrian capital’s Ernst Happel Stadium on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. An estimated 170,000 fans were expected to attend over the three days.

After news of the plot broke Wednesday, Barracuda Music, the events' organizer, said it had “no choice but to cancel” the shows “for everyone’s safety.”

Taylor Nation, an Instagram account run by Swift’s team, reposted the message to its story. All tickets will be refunded and ticketholders can visit a website to request refunds, the post said.

Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said in a post on X that “the cancelation of the Taylor Swift concerts by the organizers is a bitter disappointment for all fans in Austria.”

“The situation surrounding the apparently planned terror attack in Vienna was very serious,” he wrote.

But, he added, thanks to intensive cooperation between police, Austrian and foreign intelligence, “the threat could be recognized early on, tackled and a tragedy prevented.”

Swift has previously spoken about her concerns of a terrorist attack at one of her stadium shows. In 2019, she told Elle magazine it was her biggest fear.

“After the Manchester Arena bombing and the Vegas concert shooting, I was completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didn’t know how we were going to keep three million fans safe over seven months,” Swift said ahead of the ""Lover Tour,"" which was then canceled because of the Covid pandemic.

VIENNA -- Both suspects in a foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift shows in Vienna appeared to be inspired by the Islamic State group and al-Qaida, Austrian authorities said Thursday, and investigators found bomb-making materials at one of their homes. Officials said one of the two confessed to planning to ""kill as many people as possible outside the concert venue.""

Three sold-out concerts were canceled a day earlier because of the plot, devastating Swifties from across the globe. Many of them had dropped thousands of euros (dollars) on travel and lodging in Austria's expensive capital city to attend the Eras Tour shows at the Ernst Happel Stadium, which sat empty Thursday morning as media filmed outside.

Concert organizers said they stood behind their decision, saying they expected up to 65,000 fans inside the stadium at each concert and as many as 30,000 onlookers outside, where authorities said the suspects planned to strike.

Officials told reporters that the main suspect, a 19-year-old Austrian, began working on his attack plans in July, and just a few weeks ago uploaded to the internet an oath of allegiance to the current leader of the Islamic State group militia. He planned to use knives or homemade explosives.

""He wanted to carry out an attack in the area outside the stadium, killing as many people as possible using the knives or even using the explosive devices he had made,"" said Omar Haijawi-Pirchner, the head of the Directorate of State Security and Intelligence, citing the 19-year-old's confession.

He was ""clearly radicalized in the direction of the Islamic State and thinks it is right to kill infidels,"" Haijawi-Pirchner added.

The foiled attack was planned for Thursday or Friday, according to Austria's interior minister, Gerhard Karner. Neither suspect appeared to have a ticket to any of the shows.

During a raid of the main suspect's home in Ternitz, south of Vienna, investigators found chemical substances and technical devices that indicated ""concrete preparatory acts,"" said Franz Ruf, Director General for Public Security at the Ministry of the Interior.

Authorities also found Islamic State group and al-Qaida material at the home of the second suspect, a 17-year-old Austrian. He was employed a few days ago by a company providing services at the venue for the concerts, and was arrested by special police forces near the stadium.

Both teens were arrested Tuesday. Neither's name was released in line with Austrian privacy rules.

No other suspects are being sought, Karner, the interior minister, said. However, a 15-year-old, who had been in contact with both suspects, was also interrogated by police.

""The situation was serious, the situation is serious. But we can also say: A tragedy was prevented,"" he said.

Concert organizers, Barracuda Music, said in an Instagram post late Wednesday that ""we have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone's safety."" It cited government officials' confirmation of a planned attack at the stadium.

Swift and her team have not spoken publicly about the plot or canceled shows. Her Instagram page reposted Barracuda Music's announcement in a ""story,"" which only last 24 hours.

Last month, an attacker in England killed three girls and wounded 10 other people in knife attack during a Taylor Swift-themed dance and yoga class. Swift at the time said she was ''completely in shock'' over the attack.

Europe is enamored with the American superstar, with the German town of Gelsenkirchen renaming itself ""Swiftkirchen"" before its mid-July concerts.

Austria's Vice-Chancellor Werner Kogler wrote on social platform X: ""For many, a dream has been shattered today. On three evenings in Vienna, tens of thousands of #Swifties should have celebrated life together.""

""I am very sorry that you were denied this. Swifties stick together, hate and terror can't destroy that,"" Kogler added.

Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer posted on X that ""the cancellation of the Taylor Swift concerts by the organizers is a bitter disappointment for all fans in Austria.""

""The situation surrounding the apparently planned terror attack in Vienna was very serious,"" he wrote. But he added that, thanks to intensive cooperation between police and Austrian and foreign intelligence, ""the threat could be recognized early on, tackled and a tragedy prevented.""

Barracuda Music said that ""all tickets will be automatically refunded within the next 10 business days."" The same wording was posted under the Vienna dates on Swift's official website.

The Vienna stadium had been sold out for the planned concerts, APA reported, with an estimated 170,000 fans expected for the concerts in Austria. Some who posted on X lamented months of now-wasted efforts to make friendship bracelets and pick out fashionable outfits for the performance.

Swift is expected to perform at London's Wembley stadium in five concerts between Aug. 15 and 20 to close the European leg of her record-setting Eras Tour.

In 2017, an attack at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, killed 22 people. Suicide bomber Salman Abedi set up a knapsack bomb in Manchester Arena at the end of Grande's concert as thousands of young fans were leaving. More than 100 people were injured. Abedi died in the explosion.

An official inquiry reported in 2023 that Britain's domestic intelligence agency, MI5, didn't act swiftly enough on key information and missed a significant opportunity to prevent the bombing, the deadliest extremist attack in the United Kingdom in recent years."

Two young people arrested in a foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna appeared to be inspired by the Islamic State and al-Qaeda, Austrian authorities said Thursday after finding bomb-making materials and chemicals at one of their homes.

One of the two teens confessed to planning to “kill as many people as possible outside the concert venue,” officials said.

All three of Swift’s tour dates in Vienna were cancelled by the event organizers on Wednesday after government officials learned of the planned terrorist attack at Ernst Happel Stadium. Swift was scheduled to perform there Thursday, Friday and Saturday.

The two suspects, ages 19 and 17, were arrested Wednesday and no other suspects are being sought, according to Interior Minister Gerhard Karner.

“The situation was serious, the situation is serious. But we can also say: A tragedy was prevented,” Karner said, according to CBS News.

The main suspect, a 19-year-old Austrian with North Macedonian roots, began working on his attack plans in July. Just a few weeks ago he uploaded to the internet a pledge of allegiance to the current leader of the Islamic State group militia, also known as ISIS, officials said. He planned to use knives or homemade explosives to carry out the attack outside the stadium.

The 19-year-old was “clearly radicalized in the direction of the Islamic State and thinks it is right to kill infidels,” said Omar Haijawi-Pirchner, the head of the Directorate of State Security and Intelligence.

During a raid of his home in Ternitz, south of Vienna, investigators found chemical substances and technical devices that indicated “concrete preparatory acts,” said Franz Ruf, director general for public security at the Ministry of the Interior.

Ruf told Austria’s public radio that Austrian authorities learned of the planned terrorist attack on the Swift concerts from “foreign services.”

Austrian media also reported that the 19-year-old had stolen the bomb-making chemicals from his former employer, a local metalworking company, and that he planned to drive a car through the crowd outside the stadium, The Guardian reports.

The second suspect, a 17-year-old Austrian citizen with Turkish and Croatian roots, was arrested by special forces on Wednesday near Ernst Happel Stadium, where the concerts were supposed to take place.

Just a few days prior, he had been employed by a company providing venue services for the Swift concerts. Authorities say they found materials linked to the Islamic State and al-Qaeda at his home.

The suspects’ names were not released in line with Austrian privacy rules.

Concert organizers stood by their decision to cancel Swift’s three shows in the interest of “everyone’s safety,” as devastated Swifties express their frustration online and to the media. Many concertgoers flew from outside Europe and dropped thousands of euros on lodging in Austria’s expensive capital city to attend the Eras Tour.

All ticketholders will have their money refunded in the next 10 business days, but remaining tickets for the Eras tour are limited and resale prices exorbitant. Swifties who missed their chance to see the artist in Vienna may not get another chance.

Ariella Kimmel, a woman from Ontario who flew to Vienna to see Swift in concert, said she felt “deflated and sad” after learning that the shows were cancelled, but is grateful that authorities were able to foil the plot.

“We were out for dinner last night and started to see tweets coming in saying that there had been the arrests and … that the shows were being cancelled,” Kimmel told Global News’ 640 Toronto radio. “And then we got the official word of the cancellations and you could kind of feel everyone just felt very deflated and sad.”

“I’m definitely grateful to the police and all of the protective services who played a role in stopping this,” Kimmel added. “So there’s definitely some relief to it, and gratefulness that our integrated security services work.”

The sold-out shows were expected to play host to some 65,000 fans each night, with as many as 30,000 onlookers outside, concert organizers said. The foiled attack was planned for Thursday or Friday.

Cops foiled the terror plot the day before Swift's first concert of the week after US intelligence was passed to Europol and Austrian cops, sources told ABC News.

A 19-year-old Austrian had allegedly planned to carry out an attack at the sold-out gig on Thursday or Friday - with a 17-year-old and a 15-year-old acting as his accomplices.

It's understood the 19-year-old planned to drive a car into the some 20,000 fans who were due to gather outside Vienna's huge stadium during the concert.

Just days ago, his friends reportedly infiltrated the event by getting jobs as stewards at the event.

On Thursday, the 19-year-old confessed to planning to ""kill as many people as possible"" outside the venue, Austrian security officials said.

He also planned to kill himself in the attack, officials added.

It's alleged that the men had detailed plans on how to carry out a mass attack at the huge Ernst Happel Stadium in Vienna.

According to reports, the trio planned to use knives and machetes in the attack.

Concert organisers said they had ""no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows"" lined up for Thursday, Friday and Saturday.

Austria's elite Cobra police helped with the arrests on Wednesday - storming the apartment of the 19-year-old in Ternitz after cutting off electricity and gas supplies.

Pictures showed investigators in hazmat suits at the scene.

He was living in his parent's house along with another man, Kronen Zeitung reports.

Security officials said the suspect recently changed his appearance and had been reading and sharing Islamist propaganda online.

During the search of his home, authorities found various substances and tools used for building bombs.

They also found ISIS propaganda, 21,000 euros in counterfeit money, machetes, knives and blank ammunition.

After the 19-year-old's arrest in the early hours of Wednesday, two other teens were arrested.

It's understood the 19-year-old was the mastermind behind the plot - with the two youngsters acting as accomplices.

The 17-year-old Austrian national - who has Turkish-Croatian roots - had been acting conspicuously near Happel Stadium, where Swift's shows had been due to take place, officials said.

He had been given a job with a company working at the stadium just a few days ago.

The third and final suspect - a 15-year-old boy - is an Austrian national with Turkish heritage, officials said.

Cops are not looking for anyone else in connection with the alleged plot.

The suspects names have not been released due to Austria's privacy laws.

American intelligence had discovered that at least one of the men pledged support to ISIS-K, an ugly offshoot of the death cult, on Telegram in early July.

Omar Haijawi-Pirchner, the head of the Directorate of State Security and Intelligence, said: ""He was clearly radicalised in the direction of the Islamic State and thinks it is right to kill infidels.""

US intel also uncovered a video which showed one of them swearing allegiance to ISIS, Bild reports.

Franz Ruf, Austria's Director General for Public Security, said: ""During a raid of his home in Ternitz, south of Vienna, investigators found chemical substances and technical devices that indicated concrete preparatory acts.""

Some 65,000 fans were expected at each of Swift's shows this week with another 20,000 gathering outside the stadium, local outlet Kurier reports.

Ruf said of the attack yesterday: ""A concrete threat has been averted.

""The suspected perpetrator was focused on the Taylor Swift concerts. Preparatory actions were detected.""

Investigators believe the attack was inspired by ISIS but not directed by the horror group.

Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said the cancelled shows are a ""bitter disappointment"" but added that a ""tragedy [had been] prevented"".

The Sun revealed yesterday that Taylor Swift plans to keep on working and finish the tour after the sick plot was foiled on Tuesday.

An insider close to Taylor Swift's entourage said news of the planned attacks came as a huge shock to the entire team, stressing the day was ""not easy.""

Speaking to The U.S. Sun, they said Swift had explained the situation in a meeting, saying they were in ""shock"".

The insider went on to say that Taylor held a meeting with her team, who felt ""tense"" after the threats, to explain what was happening and ensure everyone's safety.

They claimed Swift is planning to continue working the Eras Tour following the threats.

""We are going to keep working for the next shows coming in London after the stop in Austria, but it wasn’t an easy day to, that is for sure,"" the source continued.

Many devastated Swift fans from across the globe had dropped thousands on travel for the Eras Tour shows in Austria."

The 19-year-old ISIS fanatic has been identified as Beran A., who lived in a newly-built end-terraced house in Ternitz, nearly 50 miles south of Vienna, where he spent his childhood.

A few years ago, Beran A.'s parents - who immigrated to Austria from North Macedonia - moved into a new-built house in the Neunkirchen district of Ternitz with him and his younger sister.

Ternitz residents told local media that he used to be a 'harmless boy next door' in jeans and sneakers, who was born in Austria and attended a local school.

But Beran A. had changed recently, according to his neighbours, coinciding with his pledge of allegiance to ISIS in early July. He grew a long beard and was often spotted wearing a long-sleeved cotton shirt, with a new picture of him showing him posing with huge zombie knives and an ISIS flag.

The 19-year-old was arrested in Ternitz, south of Vienna, Wednesday morning while a second teen, aged 17, was detained in the Austrian capital in the afternoon, according to director-general for public safety Franz Ruf. The two inhaled laughing gas before planning their terror acts, according to Heute.

Taylor Swift was due to perform in front of an estimated 170,000 fans on August 8, 9, and 10 at Vienna's Ernst-Happel-Stadion, but the shows were cancelled last night.

Beran A. and his accomplice had planned to attack Swift's concert venue by driving into the crowd outside at 4pm today before attacking them with knives and machetes and detonating a suicide bomb.

Resident Mara T. told Austrian outlet Kurier that she had last seen the terror suspect on Tuesday morning, adding: 'He looked like how you would imagine a sleeper agent for a terrorist cell.'

Another neighbour, Nicole, said the family was 'inconspicuous and quiet' and that they didn't cause any problems. She said that Beran A.'s mother speaks German 'very well', but that the father's language skills were not as good.

Nicole said the family even helped her clear away debris thrown against her terraced house during a storm.

But not everyone had such a positive experience with the family, as neighbours Mara T. and Dieter S. reveal.

They said they got into arguments with Beran A.'s family when loading and unloading their car in front of their neighbour's house.

Until two weeks ago, Beran A. had worked in the same stainless steel plant in Ternitz as his father.

He was doing an apprenticeship as a retail salesman in the factory, where he had access to the plant's laboratory, including various chemicals.

Behind the bright white walls of the family home in Ternitz, bomb disposal experts secured chemicals to produce the explosive triacetone triperoxide (TATP), which Beran A. - who is said to be the mastermind behind the plot - is said to have already experimented with.

TATP is often used by ISIS in terror attacks and requires acetone as well as hydrogen peroxide, which officials confirmed was found in the house.

The head of the Directorate of State Security and Intelligence, Omar Haijawi-Pirchner, said Beran A. was 'clearly radicalized in the direction of the Islamic State and thinks it is right to kill infidels'.

Beran A.'s parents and sister reportedly are currently on holiday in North Macedonia, but police is expected to question the parents over their son upon their return.

Several people close to the terror suspect knew of his attack plans, according to Austrian media reports.

Beran A., who reportedly planned the attack for five years, has been arrested alongside a 17-year-old.

The suspects - who allegedly radicalised themselves online - took 'concrete preparatory actions' for an attack - with Beran A. 'focused' on Swift's Vienna concert, Ruf confirmed.

Beran A. had quit his job and announced that he 'still had big plans' on July 25, Ruf revealed at a press conference today, adding that the teen also 'significantly changed his appearance' and that the 17-year-old had recently broken up with his girlfriend. 'There has been a clear social change,' Ruf added.

The 17-year-old regularly visited a mosque in Vienna's Meidling district and carried ISIS stickers in his wallet when he was arrested on Wednesday afternoon, outlet Heute reports.

But the teenager claims he only visited the Bosnian mosque because his 'girlfriend at the time lived in the area'. He broke up with this girlfriend recently, according to the Austrian head of state security.

Austrian media reported the suspects' plans included driving a car into groups of Swifties expected to gather outside the venue before attacking with machetes and knives. They had reportedly planned to launch their attack at 4pm today.

Beran A. fully confessed to his plans to 'kill as many people as possible outside the concert venue', Austrian security officials said.

His planned terror attack was supposed to end with him detonating his homemade bomb and killing himself in the process, according to the Austrian Heute newspaper.

Director-general for public safety Ruf confirmed today that 'explosives were manufactured' at the suspect's home after local media reported that Beran A. had stolen chemicals from his former workplace, a metal processing company also in Ternitz, to build a bomb.

Beran A. - who was living in his parents' house along with another man - was arrested on Wednesday after police raided the home, according to Kronen Zeitung.

A bomb squad found chemical substances, fluids as well as 'explosive devices and technical equipment', Ruf said, after raiding the home and it is believed that the 19-year-old stole these from his workplace.

Ruf confirmed at a press conference today that the 'preparatory action' in the home in Ternitz focused on the manufacturing of explosives.

Among the substances was hydrogen peroxide, which Ruf said is used to create explosives and he confirmed that 'explosives were manufactured'.

The suspects reportedly planned to ram a car into fans outside the stadium as it is well known that those who missed out on tickets will still come to the venue of Swift's shows to listen from outside, like a week ago in Munich when 40,000 ticketless fans gathered on hills outside the Olympic Stadium.

Neither Beran A. nor the second suspect appeared to have a ticket to any of the shows and instead planned to focus the attack on fans standing outside the stadium.

Kurier also cited several sources who claimed the 17-year-old suspect had gotten jobs as security guards at the concert a few days ago, suggesting this could have facilitated the attack.

The newspaper also reported that the 17-year-old is said to be a major player in the gang war in Vienna, with police issuing a wanted notice for the boy in relation to a fight earlier this month.

Beran A. intensely prepared for and 'focused on his planned terror attack' since quitting his job on July 25, according to Ruf.

He also had blank ammunition, €21,000 (£18,000) in counterfeit money and a blue police flashing light and siren he wanted to use to get to the venue undeterred, German tabloid Bild reports.

According to Austrian media reports, Beran A. and his accomplice wanted to launch the attack at 4pm today, when the outside of the stadium would have been packed with thousands of fans waiting to get inside as security guards were due to unlock the gates at this time.

Beran A.'s plan reportedly was to attack the blue flashing police light to his VW Beetle and to disguise himself as a police officer to get as close to the stadium as possible before running over as many Swifties as he can, before attacking them with knives and machetes and detonating his suicide bomb.

During his interrogation, Beran A. gave a full confession, but reportedly showed no remorse for his terror plans.

'The suspects had concrete and detailed plans to create a tragedy of the same magnitude as the Paris, Manchester and Moscow attacks, also at a concert, with many people, and to leave a blood bath behind,' Austrian chancellor Karl Nehammer said at a news conference this afternoon.

'It is really inconceivable to think about what immeasurable damage a successful attack could have created,' he added.

The name of the second suspect, aged 17, has not yet been released. He is said to have Austrian nationality but Turkish and Croatian roots and reportedly was in 'intense contact' with Beran A. over the last few days.

While it has been reported that the second suspect would have likely been able to gain access to the venue due to his new job with the facilities company, it is unclear what horrors he wanted to unleash inside the stadium.

A 15-year-old Austrian with Turkish heritage has also been detained and is currently being questioned after police found that he had communicated with both suspects.

Beran A. had uploaded an oath of allegiance to the current leader of the Islamic State group (ISIS) to an internet account in early July, police said.

A video of this pledge of allegiance as well as a video confessing responsibility for the attack has been seized by police.

Authorities also found Islamic State group and al-Qaida material at the home of the second suspect, a 17-year-old Austrian.

He was employed a few days ago by a company providing services at the venue for the concerts, and was arrested by special police forces near the stadium.

The 17-year-old reportedly denies the terror accusations against him. He told police that him and Beran A. 'just wanted to drive around'.

He reportedly spoke to Beran A. on the phone for an hour on July 7 - 'but only because we were friends', not because they were planning a terror attack.

The teenager even stayed over at Beran A.'s house in Ternitz on August 2, according to Heute.

Law enforcement sources told ABC News information about the threat to the shows originated with U.S. intelligence and was passed to the Austrians and Europol on July 25.

Ruf said: 'The suspects were focused on the Taylor Swift concerts. We discovered that he was taking action to prepare for the attack. A clear threat has been averted.'

Officials said at a press conference that no other suspects are being sought after identifying the two teens aged 17 and 19.

Austria's chancellor Karl Nehammer declared on X following news of the arrests: 'Thanks to the intensive cooperation of our police and the newly established DSN (Directorate for Security and Intelligence) with foreign services, the threat was identified early on, combated, and a tragedy was prevented.'

Swift's concert promoter confirmed the cancellation in a post, citing public safety

The shows are expected to be attended by 65,000 concertgoers per day, with an additional 30,000 fans outside of the area, police said - Swift pictured performing in Amsterdam in July

Commending the police and intelligence services for preventing a potential attack on the Swift concerts, Nehammer said: 'We live in a time in which violent means are being used to attack our western way of life.

'Islamist terrorism threatens security and freedom in many western countries. This is precisely why we will not give up our values ​​​​such as freedom and democracy, but will defend them even more vehemently.

'These values ​​​​are the foundation of our society and make us resilient against extremism and terrorism. It is important to remain vigilant, stand together and take decisive action against Islamism.'

'The situation was serious, the situation is serious,' Austria's Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said at a press conference today.

He added: 'But we can also say that a tragedy could be prevented.'

'The danger posed by Islamist extremism significantly increased in Europe following the devastating terror attack by Hamas on Israel. [...] Austria was and is no exception here.

Karner said that the terror alert level in Austria had been raised to four since October 7, the second highest level.

'Large concerts are a preferred target for Islamist assassins,' he explained, referencing the attack in the Bataclan in Paris in 2015, the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester 2018 as well as the Moscow City Hall attack earlier this year.

British band Coldplay is due to play four shows in Vienna later this month from August 21 to August 25, but it is unclear whether these concerts will go ahead in light of the foiled terror attacks.

Swift's concert promoter Barracuda Music posted a statement which read: 'Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour Vienna Shows Cancelled Due to Government Officials Confirmation of Planned Terrorist Attack.

'With confirmation from government officials of a planned terrorist attack at Ernst Happel Stadium, we have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone's safety.

'All tickets will be automatically refunded within the next 10 business days.'

Ruf initially said that there would be a special focus on entry checks and concertgoers should plan to arrive in plenty of time.

The shows were expected to be attended by 65,000 concertgoers per day, with an additional 30,000 fans outside of the area, police said.

Swift is expected to perform at London's Wembley stadium in five concerts between August 15 and 20 to close the European leg of her record-setting Eras Tour.

Policing minister Diana Johnson said Scotland Yard will look at 'all the intelligence' ahead of Swift's UK shows."
"ISIS-inspired suspect planned suicide attack at Taylor Swift concert, Austrian authorities say.",https://www.sheppnews.com.au/aap-entertainment/isis-led-suspect-in-swift-plot-planned-suicide-attack/,"The 19-year-old man, who has North Macedonian roots, made a full confession in custody, Austria's general director for public security Franz Ruf told a news conference on Thursday.

He swore allegiance to the IS group's leader on the internet and had chemicals, machetes and technical devices at his home in the town of Ternitz in preparation for an attack, Ruf added.

The suspect was planning a lethal assault among the estimated 20,000 ""Swiftie"" fans set to gather outside Vienna's Ernst Happel Stadium, said national intelligence head Omar Haijawi-Pirchner. Two other Austrian youths aged 17 and 15 were detained on Wednesday over the reported plot.

""The main perpetrator has confessed that he was supposed to carry out a suicide attack with two accomplices,"" said Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer.

""The suspects actually had very specific and detailed plans ... to leave a bloodbath in their wake.""

Authorities painted a picture of the main suspect having self-radicalised, transforming his appearance and sharing Islamist propaganda online. He quit his job on July 25, telling people he had ""big plans"", Ruf said.

One neighbour told Austrian broadcaster Puls24 that the suspect had kept himself to himself and had grown a ""Taliban beard"".

The 17-year-old suspect had been given a job with a company a few days ago that was providing services at the stadium, according to security officials.

Event organiser Barracuda Music said it had cancelled Swift's three concerts in Vienna, due to start on Thursday for a sold-out 65,000 audience each, in coordination with the singer's management team.

Fans, many of whom had travelled a long way to Vienna, expressed both dismay and understanding.

""It's just heartbreaking, just frustrating. But at the end of the day I guess it's for everyone's safety,"" said Mark del Rosario, who had flown from the Philippines to see the wildly popular US singer.

US broadcaster ABC cited law enforcement and intelligence sources as saying Austrian authorities had received information about the Swift concert threat from US intelligence.

It quoted the sources as saying that at least one of the suspects had pledged allegiance to ISIS-K, a resurgent wing of IS, on Telegram in June, though the plot was IS-inspired rather than directed by the group's operatives.

Austrian Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said foreign intelligence agencies had helped with the investigation, as Austrian law does not allow monitoring of messenger apps.

Event organiser Live Nation urged fans of Coldplay, which is due to play at the same stadium on August 21, to stay calm and said it was in contact with authorities.

It did not comment on whether the show would take place.

British police said on Thursday there was nothing to indicate that the planned attack in Vienna would have an impact on Swift's shows at Wembley Stadium in London next week.

""Concerts are often a preferred target of Islamist attackers, large concerts,"" said Karner, listing the 2015 attack on the Bataclan venue in Paris and the 2017 bombing at England's Manchester Arena where US pop star Ariana Grande had played.

The plot in Austria also brought to mind a foiled plan by three IS-linked suspects to attack Vienna's gay pride parade last year.

Islamic State was largely crushed by a US-led coalition several years ago after establishing a ""caliphate"" in large areas of Iraq and Syria, but has still managed some major attacks while seeking to rebuild and reinvent itself.

This week's shows were to be part of the record-breaking Eras Tour by American singer-songwriter Swift which started on March 17, 2023, in Glendale, Arizona, and is set to conclude on December 8, 2024, in Vancouver, Canada.

Swift, 34, has not yet commented on the cancellations on her official Instagram account, which has 283 million followers.

Her fans were horrified at the threat, with some begging organisers to postpone the concert instead of cancelling it outright. Promoters have said they will pay back tickets.Â"
"ISIS-inspired suspect planned suicide attack at Taylor Swift concert, Austrian authorities say.",https://www.ibtimes.sg/taylor-swift-concert-terror-plot-teen-suspects-arrested-were-hired-stadium-security-had-planned-75611,"The teenage suspects arrested for planning an ISIS-inspired terror attack at one of Taylor Swift's Austrian concerts this week had planned to drive a bomb-laden car into the crowd to cause as many casualties as possible. Disturbingly, they had reportedly just been hired by the venue as security personnel.

Chilling new details of the thwarted attack emerged after authorities announced that two men, aged 19 and 17, were arrested in Vienna on Wednesday, leading to the cancellation of Swift's three sold-out Eras shows in the city. According to investigators, the suspects had been radicalized online by ISIS and allegedly planned to carry out the attack outside the Ernst Happel Stadium.

Chilling Plans of Mass Casualty

The two men allegedly were planning to kill fans with homemade explosives and machetes, security officials said on Thursday. The alleged mastermind, a 19-year-old Austrian with North Macedonian heritage, was found with chemical substances and technical devices hidden in his home when authorities raided it, officials reported.

He had reportedly made significant progress in making the bomb he planned to attach to the car, they added.

Meanwhile, the second suspect, a 17-year-old Austrian citizen of Turkish and Croatian origin, was arrested by special police forces near the stadium where the concerts were scheduled to take place this week.

Officials stated that the second suspect had only recently been hired by a company providing services at the venue during the concerts.

Sources told the German news outlet Kurier that he had been hired to work as security at the venue.

In the lead-up to their arrests, both suspects had shown noticeable changes in behavior, according to Franz Ruf, public security director at Austria's Interior Ministry.

The older teen had quit his job on July 25, telling others he had ""something big"" planned, while the 17-year-old had recently ended his relationship with his girlfriend, according to Ruf.

The two suspects had also been in contact with others who were apparently aware of their terror plot.

A 15-year-old boy was also brought in for questioning on Wednesday after the plot was uncovered, though it's unclear if he was arrested.

Both older suspects were already under surveillance by Austrian authorities and were considered known risks before their arrests, officials revealed.

During a raid on the second suspect's home, investigators found extensive materials related to ISIS and al Qaeda.

Meanwhile, the main suspect, who authorities say fully confessed to the attack plans after his arrest, had recently pledged allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State online, according to security officials.

Mass Murder Plans Thwarted

Officials stated that the older suspect was ""clearly radicalized towards the Islamic State and believes it is justified to kill infidels."" The names of the suspects have not been disclosed due to Austria's privacy laws.

Swift was scheduled to perform three sold-out shows, expected to attract 195,000 people, from Thursday through Saturday.

It remains unclear which specific concert the foiled attack was intended to target. ""The situation was serious, the situation is serious. But we can also say: A tragedy was prevented,"" Austria's Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said Thursday.

Event organizer Barracuda Music announced late Wednesday on Instagram that they ""have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone's safety,"" citing government officials' confirmation of the planned attack at the stadium.

The news of the terror threat and the subsequent cancellations left ""Swifties"" around the world heartbroken.

Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer expressed his regret on X, stating that ""the cancellation of the Taylor Swift concerts by the organizers is a bitter disappointment for all fans in Austria.""

""The situation surrounding the apparently planned terror attack in Vienna was very serious,"" he wrote, adding that, thanks to intensive cooperation between police and Austrian and foreign intelligence, ""the threat could be recognized early on, tackled and a tragedy prevented.""

Austria's Vice Chancellor Werner Kogler shared in a separate post: ""For many, a dream has been shattered today. On three evenings in Vienna, tens of thousands of #Swifties should have celebrated life together.

""I am very sorry that you were denied this. Swifties stick together, hate and terror can't destroy that,"" Kogler wrote."

Ruf said, “He declared his loyalty to the IS group, opened a new tab’s leader on the internet, and had weapons, machetes, and other technical equipment at his house in the town of Ternitz in case of an attack.”

According to national intelligence chief Omar Haijawi-Pirchner, the suspect was preparing a deadly attack on the 20,000 or more “Swiftie” fans expected to assemble outside Vienna’s Ernst Happel Stadium. Due to the alleged plot, two further Austrian adolescents, ages 17 and 15, were placed under arrest on Wednesday.

Chancellor Karl Nehammer of Austria stated, “The main perpetrator has confessed that he was supposed to carry out a suicide attack with two accomplices.”

“The suspects actually had very specific and detailed plans … to leave a bloodbath in their wake.” Authorities presented an image of the primary suspect as having become an Islamist propagandist online, changed his look, and become a self-radicalized individual. He told folks he had “big plans” when he resigned from his position on July 25, Ruf claimed.

A neighbor who talked to Austrian television Puls24 claimed that the suspect had developed a “Taliban beard” and remained reclusive.

The 17-year-old suspect, according to security officials, was employed a few days ago by a business that supplied services at the stadium.

Event planner Barracuda Music reported that it had canceled Swift’s three scheduled gigs in Vienna, which were set to start on Thursday and draw a total of 65,000 fans each, after consulting with the singer’s management team.

Supporters, many of whom had traveled far to Vienna, voiced their sympathy as well as their dismay.

It’s just irritating and depressing. Ultimately, though, I suppose it’s for everyone’s protection “said Mark del Rosario, who had traveled from the Philippines to witness the enormously well-liked American musician

American network ABC reported that Austrian authorities had been informed by U.S. intelligence about the Swift concert threat, citing law enforcement and intelligence sources.

Although the scheme was inspired by IS rather than carried out by the group’s agents, it was reported by the sources that at least one of the suspects had sworn allegiance to ISIS-K, a resurgent branch of IS, on Telegram in June.

Since Austrian legislation forbids the monitoring of chat apps, foreign intelligence organizations reportedly assisted with the probe, according to Austrian Interior Minister Gerhard Karner.

Coldplay is scheduled to perform at the same stadium on August 21. The event’s organizer, Live Nation, advised Coldplay supporters to remain composed and stated that it was in communication with the police.

Regarding whether the show would air, it remained silent.

Swift’s concerts at London’s Wembley Stadium next week are not expected to be impacted by the planned attack in Vienna, according to British police, who made this announcement on Thursday.

“Large concerts are often a preferred target of Islamist attackers,” Karner added, citing the bombing of England’s Manchester Arena in 2017 that took place just after American pop sensation Ariana Grande performed there and the 2015 attack on the Paris Bataclan venue.

The plot in Austria also reminded me of the attempted attack on Vienna’s gay pride march last year by three men connected to the Islamic State.

Although the Islamic State was substantially destroyed by a coalition led by the United States a few years ago after creating a “caliphate” over a sizable portion of both Iraq and Syria, the group has continued to launch significant attacks as it attempts to reorganize and reinvent itself.

The concerts this week were scheduled to be a part of American singer-songwriter Swift’s record-breaking Eras Tour, which began in Glendale, Arizona on March 17, 2023, and is scheduled to end in Vancouver, Canada on December 8, 2024.

With 283 million followers on her official Instagram account, Swift, 34, has not yet responded to the cancellations.

The threat infuriated her supporters, several of whom begged the concert’s organizers to reschedule rather than cancel it altogether. The ticket promoters have promised to reimburse the cost."
Muhammad Yunus takes oath as head of Bangladesh’s interim government.,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/8/muhammad-yunus-takes-oath-as-head-of-bangladeshs-interim-government,"The Nobel Peace laureate says he will perform his duties ‘sincerely’ as he is selected interim leader after Sheikh Hasina’s resignation.

The Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist Muhammad Yunus has been sworn in as the head of Bangladesh’s interim government, three days after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was forced to resign and flee to neighbouring India.

Yunus, 84, took the oath during a ceremony at the presidential palace in Dhaka on Thursday night that was attended by political leaders, civil society leaders, generals and diplomats.

“I will uphold, support and protect the constitution,” Yunus said as he was administered the oath by President Mohammed Shahabuddin, adding that he will perform his duties “sincerely”.

More than a dozen members of his cabinet, whose titles are advisers, not ministers, also took the oath as the caretaker government will now seek to restore peace and prepare for new elections.

They include Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud, top leaders of the Students Against Discrimination group, which led the weeks-long protests that ousted Hasina.

Others include Touhid Hossain, a former foreign secretary, and Hassan Ariff, a former attorney general. Syeda Rizwana Hasan, an award-winning environmental lawyer, and Asif Nazrul, a top law professor and writer, were also sworn in.

Adilur Rahman Khan, a prominent human rights activist who was sentenced to two years in jail by Hasina’s government, also took the oath as an adviser.

No representatives of Hasina’s Awami League party were present at the ceremony.

Hasina quit on Monday after nationwide protests that began in July against a quota system for government jobs that critics said favoured people with connections to her party.

But the demonstrations soon grew into a bigger challenge for Hasina’s 15-year rule as more than 300 people, including students, were killed during spiralling violence.

Yunus, who was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his work developing microcredit markets, was in the French capital for the 2024 Olympics when he was chosen for the interim role and returned home earlier on Thursday to tight security at the airport in Dhaka.

In his first comments after his arrival, he said at a news briefing that his priority would be to restore order. “Bangladesh is a family. We have to unite it,” Yunus said while flanked by student leaders. “It has immense possibility.”

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his “best wishes” to Yunus, saying New Delhi was “committed” to working with neighbouring Dhaka.

“My best wishes to Professor Muhammad Yunus on the assumption of his new responsibilities,” Modi wrote on the social media platform X. “India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfil the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development.”

The United States also welcomed the new interim government in Bangladesh, saying it hoped to work together to advance democracy.

“We welcome Dr Yunus’s call for an end to the recent violence and we stand ready to work with the interim government and Dr Yunus as it charts a democratic future for the people of Bangladesh,” State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.

He said that the highest-ranking US diplomat in Bangladesh, Helen LaFave, attended the inauguration ceremony and has been in touch with the interim government.

The US had a largely cooperative relationship with Hasina over her 15 years in power that had grown tense as she bristled over US criticism on her record on democracy.

Al Jazeera’s Tanvir Chowdury, reporting from Dhaka, said Yunus wants the people to feel secure and has asked people not to seek vengeance or reprisal.

“Most people say it would be good if the interim government stays for a long time to clean up the system,” he said.

Chowdury said the people want an independent judiciary and election commission to “depoliticise the system”.

“Because whenever there is a political government, there are a lot of people who are loyal to that government and given a higher position, and that whole system gets corrupted,” he said.

On Wednesday, a tribunal in Dhaka acquitted Yunus in a labour law violation case involving a telecommunications company he founded in which he was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail. He was out on bail in the case.

Yunus has been a longtime opponent of Hasina, who had called him a “bloodsucker” allegedly for using force to extract loan repayments from rural poor people, mainly women. Yunus has denied the allegations."
Muhammad Yunus takes oath as head of Bangladesh’s interim government.,https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-yunus-hasina-student-protests-8e72489d3f05ab50f1ea4564e5ad23aa,"DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took the oath of office as head of Bangladesh’s interim government Thursday after an uprising prompted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to step down and flee to India.

The key tasks for Yunus now are restoring peace in Bangladesh and preparing for new elections following weeks of violence in which student activists led an uprising against what was considered Hasina’s increasingly autocratic 15-year rule.

Bangladesh’s figurehead President Mohammed Shahabuddin administered the oath to Yunus for his role as chief advisor, which is the equivalent to a prime minister, in presence of foreign diplomats, civil society members, top businessmen and members of the former opposition party at the presidential palace in Dhaka. No representatives of Hasina’s party were present.

Sixteen other people have been included in the interim Cabinet with members drawn mainly from civil society and including two of the student protest leaders. The Cabinet members were chosen in discussions this week among student leaders, civil society representatives and the military.

Hasina quit on Monday after several chaotic weeks that began in July with protests against a quota system for government jobs that critics said favored people with connections to Hasina’s party. But the demonstrations soon grew into a bigger challenge for Hasina’s 15-year rule, as more than 300 people including students were killed amid spiraling violence.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent his best wishes to Yunus in a statement on social media platform X, and alluded to reports that Hindus in Muslim-majority Bangladesh had been targeted during the country’s unrest in recent days.

“We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities,” Modi said. “India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfill the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development.”

Yunus, who was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his work developing microcredit markets, was in the French capital for the 2024 Olympics when he was chosen for the interim role, and returned home earlier Thursday to tight security at the airport in Dhaka.

In his first comments after his arrival, he told a news briefing that his priority would be to restore order. “Bangladesh is a family. We have to unite it,” Yunus said, flanked by student leaders. “It has immense possibility.”

On Wednesday in Paris, Yunus had called for calm and an end to all partisan violence.

Hasina’s son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, who acts as an adviser to his mother, vowed Wednesday that his family and the Awami League party would continue to be engaged in Bangladesh’s politics — a reversal from what he’d said earlier in the week after Hasina stepped down Monday and fled to India.

The president had dissolved Parliament on Tuesday, clearing the path for the interim administration.

On Wednesday, a tribunal in Dhaka acquitted Yunus in a labor law violation case involving a telecommunication company he founded, in which he was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail. He had been released on bail in the case.

Yunus has been a longtime opponent of Hasina, who had called him a “bloodsucker” allegedly for using force to extract loan repayments from rural poor, mainly women. Yunus has denied the allegations.

The chaos on Bangladesh’s streets continued after Hasina’s resignation on Monday. Dozens of police officers were killed, prompting police to stop working across the country. They threatened not to return unless their safety is ensured. The looting of firearms also was reported in local media.

The unrest began in mid-July with protests over the quota system, but grew into a broader challenge over an administration that was marked by human rights abuses, corruption, allegations of rigged elections and a brutal crackdown on opponents.

Joy, Hasina’s son, said in a social media post on Wednesday that his family would return to politics despite what he said have been attacks on the Awami League party over the past week. Many observers see Joy as Hasina’s successor in a dynastic political culture that dominates the South Asian nation’s politics.

“If we want to build a new Bangladesh, it is not possible without the Awami League,” he said. “The Awami League is the oldest, democratic, and largest party in Bangladesh.”

Overnight into Thursday, residents across Dhaka carried sticks, iron rods and sharp weapons to guard their neighborhoods amid reports of robberies. Communities used loudspeakers in mosques to alert people that robberies were occurring, and police remained off duty. The military shared hotline numbers for people seeking help.

The quick move to select Yunus came when Hasina’s resignation created a power vacuum and left the future unclear for Bangladesh, which has a history of military rule, messy politics and myriad crises.

Many fear that Hasina’s departure could trigger even more instability in the densely populated nation of some 170 million people, which is already dealing with high unemployment, corruption and a complex strategic relationship with India, China and the United States.

Hasina, 76, was elected to a fourth consecutive term in January, in an election boycotted by her main opponents. Thousands of opposition members were jailed before the vote, and the U.S. and U.K. denounced the result as not credible."

Yunus, 84, landed at Dhaka’s Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on a flight from Paris and was welcomed by the country’s military chief, General Waker-Uz-Zaman, and other high-ranking military officers. He received a bouquet of flowers from supporters.

He was sworn in as head of the country’s interim government shortly after his return on Thursday. His oath was administered by President Mohammed Shahabuddin, declaring Yunus his chief adviser. The position is said to be equivalent to that of prime minister.

“Today is a glorious day for us,” Yunus told a news conference at the airport. “Bangladesh has created a new victory day. Bangladesh has got a second independence,” said Yunus, who was appointed by the military.

The unrest that led to Sheikh Hasina’s departure began with protests against a government job quota system and expanded into broader opposition to her long tenure, marked by allegations of human rights abuses and election rigging.

More than 300 people died in the initial weeks of the protests.

General Waker-Uz-Zaman said in a televised address Wednesday that those responsible for recent violence will be held accountable.

Yunus is tasked with restoring peace. At a news briefing, Yunus said he will focus on reestablishing order, asking for all violence to end.

""Violence is our enemy. Please don't create more enemies. Be calm and get ready to build the country,"" Yunus said.

Shahabuddin, who is currently a ceremonial leader, dissolved parliament on Tuesday. This move has paved the way for Yunus to lead the interim government, although the timing of new elections remains uncertain.

Yunus is an economist and banker who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his work with microcredit through Grameen Bank. He has been recognized for his efforts in reducing poverty through small loans.

Yunus was acquitted on Wednesday in a case regarding labor law violations where he was sentenced to jail for six months. The case involved a telecommunications company he founded

In his first statement since being appointed, Yunus praised the students for their role in recent protests and urged calm. He stressed the need to avoid further violence and focus on rebuilding the country.

As the country shifted to the interim government, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, or BNP, held a rally in Dhaka. The rally was led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, who was recently released from house arrest.

Zia, who served as prime minister from 2001 to 2006, was convicted of corruption in 2018 and sentenced to 17 years in prison. Her party claims the charges were politically motivated.

Supporters gathered for the BNP rally in Dhaka’s Naya Paltan area hours before it began, reflecting the evolving political situation.

Former Prime Minister Hasina, 76, was reelected for a fourth term in January, but the election faced criticism as flawed. The United States and United Kingdom condemned the results.

On Wednesday, Dhaka was relatively calm following recent violence. Student volunteers were seen cleaning streets and managing traffic, and the police presence was minimal.

Advisory Council

Mr Yunus has been sworn in as the chief adviser in the interim government, a position akin to that of prime minister, and a 16-member council of advisers will be assisting him. The advisers include Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud, two key leaders of the protests that led to Ms Hasina's ouster.

Among the other members of the council are Adilur Rahman Khan, a prominent rights activist who was sentenced to a two-year jail term under Ms Hasina; women's rights activist Farida Akhtar; Grameen Telecom trustee Nurjahan Begum; former foreign secretary Touhid Hossain; and AFM Khalid Hossain, deputy chief of right-wing party Hefazat-e-Islam.

Speaking before the swearing-in ceremony, Mr Yunus said, ""Today is a glorious day for us... Bangladesh has created a new victory day. Bangladesh has got a second independence.""

Urging a return to normalcy, he added, ""We cannot take a step forward unless we fix the law and order situation. My call to the people is that if you have trust in me, make sure there will be no attacks against anyone, anywhere in the country... We are one big family.""

Violent Protests

Trouble had been brewing in Bangladesh since before the January 7 elections, which was won by Sheikh Hasina's Awami League in a landslide, but the electoral exercise was widely seen as being far from free and fair.

A fresh wave of protests led by students began in June - in which over 450 people have been killed so far - after a Bangladeshi high court reinstated 30 per cent reservation in government jobs for family members of freedom fighters and veterans from Bangladesh's 1971 War of Independence. The quota was later scaled back by the country's Supreme Court but Ms Hasina's handling of the protests and her alleged use of an offensive label for the protesters infuriated students.

Protests continued with students demanding that Ms Hasina step down and clashes between agitators and the police left over 100 dead and dozens injured across the country on Sunday.

Monday saw lakhs of students flooding the streets and heading towards the prime minister's official residence, Ganabhaban, forcing Ms Hasina to resign and flee to India. Violence continued in some places even after Ms Hasina resigned and there have been reports of minorities, including Hindus, being targeted.

Muhammad Yunus arrives in Dhaka, Bangladesh as interim PM

Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has been sworn in as Bangladesh's interim leader, vowing to ""uphold, support and protect the constitution"". The 84-year-old took an oath at the presidential palace in Dhaka along with more than a dozen members of his new cabinet, vowing to perform his duties ""sincerely"". He flew into the capital, Dhaka, just days after Sheikh Hasina - the woman who ruled Bangladesh with an iron fist for 15 years - fled across the border to India. Ms Hasina resigned as prime minister after weeks of student-led protests - which left hundreds dead - escalated and culminated in calls for her to stand down.

The decision to name Prof Yunus as chief adviser of the interim government followed a meeting between President Mohammed Shahabuddin, military leaders and student leaders. The students had been clear they would not accept a military-led government, but wanted Prof Yunus to lead. Among his new cabinet are Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud, students who led the anti-government protests. The hope is Prof Yunus, the so-called banker for the poor, will bring democracy back to Bangladesh after years of autocratic rule. ""People are excited,"" the entrepreneur and economist told the BBC moments after arriving in Dhaka from France on Thursday. He later told reporters that Bangladesh ""has got a second independence"" as he called for the restoration of law and order in the nation of 170 million people. Following Prof Yunus's swearing in, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his ""best wishes"", writing on X/Twitter that his government was ""committed"" to working with its neighbour for ""peace, security and development"".

Prof Yunus paid tribute to those who died, saying they had ""protected the nation"" and given it ""new life"" after Ms Hasina's rule. She had begun that rule as a symbol of democracy but, by the time she fled, she was considered an autocrat who had sought to entrench her authority by silencing dissent. Prisons were filled with people who sought to speak out against her. Prof Yunus - lauded for his pioneering use of micro-loans - was one of those who found themselves in legal trouble during her tenure. Ms Hasina regarded him as a public enemy - he is currently on bail, appealing against a six-month jail term in what he has called a politically-motivated case. Speaking on Thursday, he called on the country's young people to help him rebuild the South Asian country. ""Bangladesh can be a beautiful country, but we destroyed the possibilities,"" he said. ""Now we have to build a seedbed again - the new seedbed will be built by them,"" he added, gesticulating towards the students who had arrived to greet him.

DHAKA, Bangladesh — Bangladesh’s next leader Muhammad Yunus arrived home Thursday from an overseas trip and will take office later in the day, as he looks to restore calm and rebuild the country following an uprising that ended the 15-year, increasingly autocratic rule of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.

Yunus landed at Dhaka’s Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Thursday afternoon and was welcomed by the country’s military chief, Gen. Waker-Uz-Zaman, who was flanked by navy and air force heads.

Some of the student leaders who led the uprising against Hasina were also present at the airport to welcome him. They had earlier proposed Yunus as interim leader to the country's figurehead president, who is currently acting as the chief executive under the constitution.

Security was tight at the airport to ensure Yunus’ safe arrival, as the country has experienced days of unrest following the downfall of Hasina on Monday. President Mohammed Shahabuddin will administer the oath-taking ceremony on Thursday night when Yunus is expected to announce his new Cabinet.

Before leaving Paris, where he was attending the Olympics, Yunus appealed for calm in Bangladesh amid tensions over the country's future.

Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, who acts as an adviser to his mother, vowed Wednesday that his family and the Awami League party would continue to be engaged in Bangladesh's politics — a reversal from what he'd said earlier in the week after Hasina stepped down Monday and fled to India.

Yunus was named as interim leader following talks among military officials, civic leaders and the student activists who led the uprising against Hasina. Yunus made his first public comments in the French capital on Wednesday before boarding a plane to return home.

Yunus congratulated the student protesters, saying they had made “our second Victory Day possible,” and he appealed to them and other stakeholders to remain peaceful, while condemning the violence that followed Hasina’s resignation.

“Violence is our enemy. Please don’t create more enemies. Be calm and get ready to build the country,” Yunus said.

Bangladesh’s military chief, Gen. Waker-Uz-Zaman, said in a televised address on Wednesday that he expected Yunus to usher in a “beautiful democratic” process.

Yunus, who was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his work developing microcredit markets, told reporters in Paris: “I’m looking forward to going back home and seeing what’s happening there, and how we can organize ourselves to get out of the trouble that we are in.″

Asked when elections would be held, he put his hands up as if to indicate it was too early to say.

“I’ll go and talk to them. I’m just fresh in this whole area,” he said.

A tribunal in Dhaka earlier on Wednesday acquitted Yunus in a labor law violation case involving a telecommunication company he founded, in which he was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail. He had been released on bail in the case.

The president had dissolved Parliament on Tuesday, clearing the path for an interim administration that is expected to schedule new elections.

Yunus has been a longtime opponent of Hasina, who had called him a “bloodsucker” allegedly for using force to extract loan repayments from rural poor, mainly women. Yunus has denied the allegations.

In a span of weeks since July 15, more than 300 people died in violence in Bangladesh. Rising tensions in the days surrounding Hasina’s resignation created chaos, with police leaving their posts after being attacked. Dozens of officers were killed, prompting police to stop working across the country. They threatened not to return unless their safety is ensured. The looting of firearms was also reported in local media.

The chaos began in July with protests against a quota system for government jobs that critics said favored people with connections to Hasina’s party. But the demonstrations soon grew into a broader challenge to Hasina’s 15-year rule, which was marked by human rights abuses, corruption, allegations of rigged elections and a brutal crackdown on her opponents.

Joy, Hasina's son, said in a social media post on Wednesday that his family would return to politics and not give up following attacks on the Awami League party's leaders and members. Many see Joy as Hasina's successor in a dynastic political culture that dominates the South Asian nation's politics.

On Monday, Joy had said Hasina would not return to politics after she stepped down. But in a video message posted on his Facebook page on Wednesday, he urged party activists to rise up.

“You are not alone. We are here. The family of Bangabandhu has not gone anywhere,” he said.

Hasina’s father, independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, is fondly referred to in Bangladesh as Bangabandhu, which means “friend of Bengal.”

“If we want to build a new Bangladesh, it is not possible without the Awami League,” he said.

“The Awami League is the oldest, democratic, and largest party in Bangladesh,"" Joy added. “The Awami League has not died ... It is not possible to eliminate the Awami League. We had said that our family would not engage in politics anymore. However, given the attacks on our leaders and activists, we cannot give up.”

Overnight into Thursday, residents across Dhaka carried sticks, iron rods and sharp weapons to guard their neighborhoods amid reports of robberies. Communities used loudspeakers in mosques to alert people that robberies were occurring, as police remained off duty. The military shared hotline numbers for people seeking help.

The quick move to select Yunus came when Hasina’s resignation created a power vacuum and left the future unclear for Bangladesh, which has a history of military rule, messy politics and myriad crises.

Many fear that Hasina’s departure could trigger even more instability in the densely populated nation of some 170 million people, which is already dealing with high unemployment, corruption and a complex strategic relationship with India, China and the United States.

Hasina, 76, was elected to a fourth consecutive term in January, in an election boycotted by her main opponents. Thousands of opposition members were jailed before the vote, and the U.S. and U.K. denounced the result as not credible."

Bangladesh crisis live updates - August 8, 2024

President Mohammad Shahabuddin administered the oath to the 84-year-old as the Chief Adviser of the interim government, and the Cabinet members at 9:20 p.m. local time at a ceremony held in Bangabhaban, the official residence of the President.

Military officers, Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) secretary-general Mirza Fakhrul Islam, Jamaat-e-Islami amir Shafiqur Rahman, Jatiya Party chairman Ghulam Muhammed Quader as well as foreign diplomats from the U.K., Japan, China, the Philippines, Iran, Argentina, Qatar, the UAE and the Netherlands were present at the ceremony.

No one from the Awami League, Ms. Hasina’s party, was seen at Bangabhaban.

After Mr. Yunus, 13 out of the 16 advisers of the interim government were sworn in. The Cabinet members are: Saleh Uddin Ahmed, Asif Nazrul, Adilur Rahman Khan, Hasan Arif, Tauhid Hossain, Syeda Rizwana Hasan, Brig. Gen. (Retd) M. Sakhawat Hossain, Supradip Chakma, Farida Akhtar, Bidhan Ranjan Roy, A.F.M. Khalid Hossain, Nurjahan Begum, Sharmin Murshid, Md. Nahid Islam (students’ representative), Asif Mahmud Sajib Bhuiyan (students’ representative) and Farooqui Azam.

As Gonobhaban, the Prime Minister’s Office and official residence, remains in shambles after protesters stormed it following the resignation of Ms. Hasina, the state guesthouse Jamuna will be the office and residence of the Chief Adviser.

Sources said a committee will be formed to assess the damage to these two important installations, and renovation will begin soon afterwards.

Earlier in the day, after landing in Dhaka from a trip to France, Mr. Yunus gave an emotional speech, recalling the sacrifices made by students who were met with a heavy-handed response from the Ms. Hasina-led government.

In his speech, he addressed the people of Bangladesh as “one big family” and said the young protesters had given them a “new birth”. However, he condemned the recent violence directed against the country’s religious minorities.

“My first word to you is to protect the country from disorder. Protect it from violence so we can follow the path our students have shown us,” he said.

Restoring stability and stopping anarchy have become immediate priorities as attacks, looting and destructive activities persisted on Thursday in many part of the country, in the absence of government and enforcement agencies.

However, the Bangladesh Army, alongside other law enforcement agencies, said they would take strict action to stop the ongoing attacks across the country.

Following the newly appointed Inspector-General of Police’s call to return to duty within 24 hours, some police personnel have started to report back, but many others are waiting for security assurances before returning to their posts. Many force members are fearful of further violent reprisals from the public after having opened fire on protesters and the general public under the Hasina regime.

Shamsus Sadat Selim, Additional Secretary at the Ministry of Public Administration, confirmed that all contractual appointments of officials made during the tenure of the recently ousted Awami League government are set to be cancelled. Also, there is a growing demand to remove other officials who benefited from the last government’s tenure from key positions.

Meanwhile, during a regular briefing in Washington on Wednesday, Matthew Miller, the U.S. State Department Spokesperson, said the U.S. believes the interim government should respect democratic principles, the rule of law, and the will of the Bangladeshi people. Mr. Miller also mentioned that they think the interim government will play a vital role in establishing long-term peace and political stability in Bangladesh."
Muhammad Yunus takes oath as head of Bangladesh’s interim government.,https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/08/muhammad-yunus-arrives-bangladesh-take-office-interim-leader,"Muhammad Yunus has been sworn in as head of a new caretaker government in Bangladesh in a ceremony that began with a minute’s silence to remember those who were killed in the recent protests.

The swearing-in, led by President Mohammed Shahabuddin, was attended by more than 1,500 guests including politicians, students, protest coordinators and representatives from the military and civil society. Other members of the interim government also took their oaths. Among them Adilur Rahman Khan, a prominent human rights activist who was imprisoned by the ousted regime, and two student leaders.

Earlier, the entrepreneur and Nobel laureate had given an emotional speech to waiting reporters at Dhaka airport on his arrival in the country to take up his position.

Yunus said he hoped to restore calm and rebuild Bangladesh after the uprising that ended the 15-year, increasingly autocratic rule of the former prime minister Sheikh Hasina.

Yunus landed at Dhaka’s Hazrat Shahjalal international airport on Thursday afternoon after a trip to France for medical treatment. He was welcomed by Bangladesh’s military chief, Gen Waker-Uz-Zaman, who was flanked by leaders of the navy and air force. Some of the student leaders who led the uprising against Hasina were also there. They had proposed him as interim leader to President Shahabuddin, who is acting as chief executive under the constitution.

Security was tight at the airport as Bangladesh continues to experience unrest after Hasina resigned and left the country on Monday. Shahabuddin will preside over the oath-taking ceremony on Thursday night, when Yunus is expected to announce his cabinet. In his speech, he addressed the people of Bangladesh as “one big family” and said the young protesters had given them a “new birth” but he condemned the last two days of violence directed against the country’s religious minorities.

“My first word to you is to protect the country from disorder. Protect it from violence so we can follow the path our students have shown us,” he said, before paying an emotional tribute to Abu Sayeed, a 25-year-old student who was shot dead by police during a protest in Rangpur on 16 July. Yunus fought back tears as he described Sayeed as “an incredibly brave young man”.

Hasina’s son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, who acts as an adviser to his mother, had vowed on Wednesday that his family and the Awami League party would continue to be engaged in Bangladesh’s politics – a reversal from what he had said earlier on Monday, when he called the students “very ungrateful”.

Yunus was named as interim leader after talks among military officials, civic leaders and the student activists who led the uprising against Hasina.

President Mohammad Shahabuddin administered the oath to Yunus and 13 additional advisers.

Three others -- Supradip Chakma, Bidhan Ranjan Roy, and Faruk-e-Azam -- also likely to be sworn in advisers to the government, were outside the capital and could not be sworn in today.

Speaking at the swearing-in event, Yunus said: ""I will uphold, support and protect the constitution and will perform my duties sincerely.""

The protests, primarily led by student groups, were triggered by a violent crackdown on demonstrations advocating for reforms in the public service quota system, resulting in over 400 deaths in recent weeks. Sunday saw the protests hitting the peak, prompting Hasina to quit as the PM and flee to India while the protesters stormed her official residence.

The announcement of Yunus's appointment was made after President Mohammed Shahabuddin held a meeting with the military leaders, and student representatives on Monday. The President emphasised the urgency of establishing an interim government to navigate the current crisis and suggested that the composition of the Advisory Council be finalised in consultation with political parties.

Yunus, who is 84 years old, is celebrated for his pioneering work in microfinance through the Grameen Bank, which earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006. His appointment is seen as a beacon of hope for restoring democratic governance in Bangladesh after years of authoritarian rule under Hasina. The student leaders who proposed his candidacy believe that Yunus's vision for a society free from poverty and unemployment aligns with the aspirations of the Bangladeshi populace.

As the new chief adviser, Yunus faces the daunting task of stabilising a nation in turmoil and addressing the demands for human rights and democratic reforms. His leadership will be crucial in guiding the interim government through this transitional period, as the country seeks to heal from the recent violence and political strife."

""I will uphold, support and protect the constitution,"" Yunus said during the swearing-in ceremony, adding that he would perform his duties ""sincerely"".

President Mohammed Shahabuddin administered the oath at the Durbar Hall of the Bangabhaban in a ceremony that started at 9 pm.

""Bangladesh has created a new victory day. Bangladesh has got a second independence.""

Yunus called for the restoration of law and order after weeks of violence that left at least 455 people dead.

""Law and order is our first task... We cannot take a step forward unless we fix the law and order situation,"" he said.

""My call to the people is if you have trust in me, then make sure there will be no attacks against anyone, anywhere in the country.""

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his ""best wishes"" to Yunus on Thursday, saying New Delhi was ""committed"" to working with neighbouring Dhaka.

India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfill the… — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) August 8, 2024 × Bangladesh has no prime minister or ministers. Here's why

After Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled to neighbouring India, Bangladesh had no elected government between August 5 to August 8. The interim government has no prime minister or ministers per se. An interim government, which in this case is led by Yunus, will lead the country for a certain period and oversee the election to transition power to an elected government.

Also watch | Bangladesh Crisis: Can Muhammad Yunus save Bangladesh? | Inside South Asia × Along with Yunus, more than a dozen members of his cabinet, who are titled advisers, not ministers, also took the oath.

They included top leaders of the Students Against Discrimination group that led the weeks-long protests, Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud.

Others included a former foreign secretary and a former attorney general, an environmental lawyer, and prominent rights activist Adilur Rahman Khan who was sentenced to two years in jail during Hasina's rule.

During Hasina's years in power, Yunus was hit with more than 100 criminal cases and a smear campaign by a state-led Islamic agency that accused him of promoting homosexuality.

Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman said Wednesday he supported Yunus.

""I am certain that he will be able to take us through a beautiful democratic process,"" Waker said.

Muhammad Yunus takes oath as head of Bangladesh’s interim government.,https://apnews.com/article/hasina-bangladesh-opposition-khaleda-quota-fd7db94ba0a66a12f7b61de3a1bb6730,"DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Bangladesh’s incoming interim leader Muhammad Yunus appealed for calm Wednesday and urged all parties to help the country rebuild after weeks of violence that killed hundreds and prompted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign and flee to India.

Yunus, a Nobel peace laureate, was in Paris for the Olympics when he was named interim leader following talks among military officials, civic leaders and the student activists who led the uprising against a prime minister seen as increasingly autocratic. Yunus made his first public comments in the French capital Wednesday before boarding a plane to return home.

He congratulated the student protesters, saying they had made “our second Victory Day possible,” and appealed to them and other stakeholders to remain peaceful, while condemning any violence since Hasina’s resignation Monday.

“Violence is our enemy. Please don’t create more enemies. Be calm and get ready to build the country,” Yunus said.

Bangladesh’s military chief, Gen. Waker-Uz-Zaman said in a televised address that Yunus would be sworn in Thursday night and that he expected him to usher in a “beautiful democratic” process. The military leader said that those responsible for violence since Hasina’s resignation would be brought to justice.

Yunus, who was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his work developing microcredit markets, told reporters in Paris: “I’m looking forward to going back home and seeing what’s happening there, and how we can organize ourselves to get out of the trouble that we are in.″

Asked when elections would be held, he put his hands up as if to indicate it was too early to say. ″I’ll go and talk to them. I’m just fresh in this whole area.″

A tribunal in Dhaka earlier on Wednesday acquitted Yunus in a labor law violation case, involving a telecommunication company he founded, in which he was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail. He had been released on bail in the case.

Ailing opposition leader and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia also urged calm on Wednesday, a day after the country’s figurehead president ordered her release from house arrest.

Zia urged her supporters not to follow a path of destruction, in an address at a rally via video link from her hospital bed. It was her first public speech since 2018, when she was convicted of corruption charges and jailed.

“No destruction, no anger, and no revenge, we need love and peace to rebuild our country,” she told members of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party.

Zia’s son and the acting head of the party, Tarique Rahman also addressed the crowd online from London, where he has been living in exile since 2008. Rahman faces several criminal cases and was convicted of corruption and a grenade attack, charges dismissed by supporters as politically motivated.

Zia, who ruled the country from 2001 to 2006, had been sentenced in 2018 to 17 years in prison. Her party said the case was aimed at keeipng her away from politics. Hasina’s then-government denied the allegation.

On Wednesday, the capital Dhaka was calm two days after violence gripped the country amid Hasina’s sudden departure. Students activists cleaned streets and managed traffic in parts of Dhaka, after police went on strike earlier in the week following violent attacks on police stations.

The country’s newly appointed police chief, Mainul Islam, ordered officers to return to work by Thursday evening.

Bangladesh’s President Mohammed Shahabuddin, a symbolic figure temporarily acting as the chief executive under the constitution, asked security officials on Wednesday to take stern action against any troublemakers.

The president had dissolved Parliament on Tuesday, clearing the path for an interim administration that is expected to schedule new elections, but it’s not clear when they will take place.

Shahabuddin named Yunus as the head of an interim government in consultation with the army, student leaders and other stakeholders. Yunus, an economist and banker, has been a longtime opponent of Hasina, who had called him a “bloodsucker” allegedly for using force to extract loan repayments from rural poor, mainly women. Yunus has denied the allegations.

Violence in days surrounding Hasina’s resignation killed at least 109 people — including 14 police officers, and left hundreds of others injured, according to media reports, which could not be independently confirmed. Reports said more attacks took place across the country also on Tuesday. The looting of firearms also was reported in local media.

In the southwestern district of Satkhira, 596 prisoners and detainees escaped from a jail after an attack on the facility Monday evening, the United News of Bangladesh agency reported.

Homes of former ministers and MPs belonging to Hasina’s party were looted, torched or vandalized. People were seen on social media taking valuables from the home of Hasina’s younger sister in Dhaka’s Gulshan area. Four separate neighbors confirmed the looting in comments to The Associated Press.

Local media also reported that ruling party officials were among the dead in this week’s violence, mostly outside Dhaka. There also were reports of violence against the Hindu community and other minorities, triggering condemnation from Human Rights Watch. Details of that violence could not be independently confirmed.

Opposition politicians have publicly called on people not to attack minority groups, while student leaders asked supporters to guard Hindu temples and other places of worship.

The unrest began in July with protests against a quota system for government jobs, which critics said favored people with connections to Hasina’s party. But they soon grew into a broader challenge to Hasina’s 15-year rule, which was marked by human rights abuses, corruption, allegations of rigged elections and a brutal crackdown on her opponents. More than 300 people died in just a few weeks.

The quick move to choose Yunus came when Hasina’s resignation created a power vacuum and left the future unclear for Bangladesh, which has a history of military rule, messy politics and myriad crises.

The military, which took temporary control until the interim government could be sworn in, wields significant influence in a country that has seen more than 20 coups or coup attempts since its independence from Pakistan in 1971.

Many fear that Hasina’s departure could trigger even more instability in the densely populated nation of some 170 million people, which is already dealing with high unemployment, corruption and a complex strategic relationship with India, China and the United States.

Hasina, 76, was elected to a fourth consecutive term in January, in an election boycotted by her main opponents. Thousands of opposition members were jailed before the vote, and the U.S. and U.K. denounced the result as not credible.

Muhammad Yunus takes oath as head of Bangladesh’s interim government.,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/8/muhammad-yunus-returns-to-bangladesh-to-lead-interim-government,"‘Bangladesh has got a second independence,’ Nobel laureate says before meeting army chief, president and his swearing-in ceremony.

Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist Muhammad Yunus has returned to Bangladesh to head an interim government after weeks of student-led protests forced Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign and flee to India.

“It’s good to be back home,” said the 84-year-old after touching down at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in the capital, Dhaka, on Thursday on a flight from Paris via Dubai.

Yunus was picked by President Mohammed Shahabuddin to lead an interim government, fulfilling a key demand of the student protest leaders.

Yunus was expected to head first to a meeting with the president and army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman before an oath-taking ceremony at 8.30pm (14:30 GMT), at which he is expected to announce his new Cabinet.

“Today is a glorious day for us,” Yunus told reporters at the airport. “Bangladesh has created a new victory day. Bangladesh has got a second independence.”

Yunus’s main objective was to hold elections as soon as possible, said Al Jazeera’s Tanvir Chowdhury, reporting from Dhaka. The poll should be held 90 days from the dissolving of the country’s Parliament, which occurred on Tuesday.

“[He] himself has said he doesn’t want to be a long-term caretaker government chief,” he said.

Students had taken to the streets last month over a controversial government job quota system, their protests escalating into a nationwide crisis following a harsh crackdown by authorities.

Nearly 300 people were killed within weeks in one of the most violent phases of Hasina’s 15-year rule.

Hasina, 76, was forced to step down and flee, with millions of Bangladeshis celebrating her political demise.

Yunus is an economist and banker who was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for founding Grameen Bank, which pioneered fighting poverty with microloans.

“The students wanted someone noncontroversial, nonpolitical, somebody who is neutral, who has global connections and can bring something to the table for Bangladesh at this moment which is in crisis,” said Chowdhury.

The veteran academic had travelled abroad this year while on bail after being sentenced to six months in jail on a charge condemned as politically motivated. He was acquitted on Wednesday by a Dhaka court.

During Hasina’s reign, Yunus was hit with more than 100 criminal cases and a smear campaign by a state-led agency that accused him of promoting homosexuality, with courts accused of rubber-stamping decisions by Hasina’s government.

Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman said he backed Yunus: “I am certain that he will be able to take us through a beautiful democratic process.”"
Muhammad Yunus takes oath as head of Bangladesh’s interim government.,https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2024/08/08/730979/Bangladesh-Muhammad-Yunus-oath-protests-Sheikh-Hasina,"Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus has been sworn in as head of Bangladesh's interim government, a few days after a weeks-long massive uprising forced former prime minister Sheikh Hasina to resign and flee to India.

Bangladesh’s figurehead President Mohammed Shahabuddin conducted the swearing-in ceremony of Yunus, 84, as chief advisor, which is the equivalent to a prime minister, at the presidential palace in the capital Dhaka on Thursday evening.

Foreign diplomats, civil society figures, prominent businessmen, and former opposition party members were present at the event but no representatives of Hasina’s party were in attendance.

“I will uphold, support and protect the constitution and will perform my duties sincerely,” Yunus said at the swearing-in event, which comes at a tumultuous time for the South Asian country, which experienced weeks of unrest that claimed the lives of at least 366 people.

The protests, mostly held by students, began in early July against a quota system that reserved over half of all government jobs for certain groups. The unrest later escalated into wider calls for the resignation of longtime premier Hasina, who finally stepped down and fled the country.

The Bangladeshi entrepreneur, banker, economist, civil society leader, and now the chief advisor of the country, has a bumpy road ahead with his key tasks being restoring peace in the crisis-hit country and preparing for new elections.

Earlier, Yunus had stressed that he wanted to hold elections “within a few” months.

Yunus had traveled abroad this year while on bail after being sentenced to six months in jail over charges of labor law violations, which he had rejected as politically motivated allegations. A Dhaka court on Wednesday acquitted him of all the charges.

“Be calm and get ready to build the country,” Yunus said on Wednesday in a statement before beginning his journey back home from the French capital, where he had been undergoing medical treatment. “If we take the path of violence, everything will be destroyed.”

Sixteen other people have been included in the interim Cabinet with members selected chiefly from civil society and including two of the student protest leaders.

Millions of Bangladeshis took to the streets of the capital on Monday to celebrate the resignation of Hasina. However, the festivities were marred by violence, with protesters carrying out revenge attacks on Hasina's allies, storming parliament and setting fire to multiple buildings, including television stations.

Bangladesh has a long history of political upheaval and coups.

In 2007, the military staged a coup after widespread political unrest and backed a caretaker government that ruled the country for two years until Hasina took power."

He was administered the oath of office by President Mohammed Shahabuddin at a ceremony held in presidential palace 'Bangabhaban'.

Yunus was appointed the head of the interim government after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned, ending her 15-year reign, and fled to India following violent protests that erupted across the country.

A 16-member council of advisers was announced to assist Yunus in running the state's affairs. Md. Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud, two key organisers of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement, were also part of the advisory council.

Women's rights activist Farida Akhtar, freedom fighter Sharmeen Murshid, former foreign secretary Touhid Hossain, and right-wing party Hefazat-e-Islam's deputy chief AFM Khalid Hossain were among the advisory council members.

The interim government will lead the country for a certain period and over the election to form the new government.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended best wishes to Yunus as he took oath. Modi said that he hoped for an early return of normalcy in the violence-hit country and ensuring the safety of Hindus and other minority communities in the country.

""My best wishes to Professor Muhammad Yunus on the assumption of his new responsibilities. We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities,"" said Modi.

""India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfill the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security, and development,"" he added.

Yunus promised to deliver a government that assures safety to its citizens and urged them to assist him in rebuilding the protest-torn country.

""Today is a day of our pride...We have got independence for the second time. We have to protect this independence,"" said Yunus while addressing a press conference at Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport.

""If you have faith in me and trust me, then ensure that there will be no attack anywhere in the country. This is our first responsibility,"" he added.

Over 500 people were killed in the violence that erupted across the country. Initially, the protests erupted in the country over the controversial quota system evolved into a mass movement demanding her ouster. Over 100 people died in the fresh clashes that erupted in Dhaka.

Several police stations and even Hasina's official residence were targeted by the protesters after her resignation.

The Army Chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman said that normalcy is expected within three to four days as the situation across the country is improving."

Nobel laureate Dr Muhammad Yunus was sworn in as Bangladesh’s chief adviser to the interim government at the oath-taking ceremony held in Bangabhaban. Bangladesh’s President Mohammed Shahabuddin administered the oath of office to the new government which came after the country’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned from her post and left Dhaka.

The resignation came amid nationwide anti-government protests that took Bangladesh by storm. Earlier today, Yunus said that there is “a lot of work to be done” as he arrived in the country. The decision to name Yunus as the head of the interim government was followed by a meeting between President Mohammed Shahabuddin, military leaders and student leaders.

No one from the Awami League attended the ceremony

According to Bangladeshi news outlet The Daily Star, no one from Awam League, i.e. Sheikh Hasina’s party was seen at the ceremony. After Hasina’s exit, the students who have been protesting in the country made it clear that they would not accept a military-led government, but wanted Prof Yunus to lead.

While addressing a gathering at the Dhaka airport, the Nobel laureate who is set to take charge as the head of the interim government said that his team will ensure that the newly reborn Bangladesh advances rapidly.

“Today is a day of pride for us. The revolution that has given birth to a new Victory Day for Bangladesh must be carried forward and strengthened. I extend my deepest appreciation and gratitude to the youth who made this possible. They stood by me, they have protected this country, and they have given it a rebirth,” he said on Thursday.

The proclamation from Yunus came during a press briefing at the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport after his arrival from the 2024 Paris Olympics in France. During the presser, the Bangladeshi Nobel Prize winner made it clear that restoring law and order is a priority. “I urge the people of the country to trust in me, to have faith in me, and that no harm will come to anyone in the country.”

He even became emotional during his address. “Today, I am reminded of Abu Sayed (a student from Begum Rokeya University in Rangpur who was killed in a shooting). He was an unbelievingly brave young man. Abu Sayed’s name is etched in the hearts of every person in this country. Through this incident, a second independence has come to the nation,” he recalled.

While Yunus’s interim administration will govern the country until the next government takes over the parliament, it is not clear how long he will stay in power. However, the current constitution of Bangladesh mandates an interim government to be dissolved within three months and be replaced with an elected government. However, reports are emerging that the deadline will be extended.

PM Modi congratulates Yunus

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, took to X, formerly known as Twitter to congratulate Yunus. “My best wishes to Professor Muhammad Yunus on the assumption of his new responsibilities. We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities,” the prime minister wrote on X.

In an interview to PTI, Jyotsna Puri, Associate Vice President (Strategy and Knowledge Department) at the Rome-based UN agency, also said it is important to recognise that agriculture can be a very ""important provider"" of income, and therefore of ""security and resilience"".

Asked what will be the immediate fall out of the crisis in the agriculture sector in Bangladesh, she said, ""Because of that turmoil, we are going to see increase in food prices, there will be disruptions, so local markets will be disrupted, because of impending sense of increased risks on local markets.""

""Hopefully not, but there is going to be an impact on perception of risks for, say, foreign direct investment, so, commercial investors who are coming to Bangladesh or other countries,"" Puri told PTI at the UN House here Tuesday evening.

Urges all to stop violence after uprising that ousted former PM

Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took the oath of office as head of Bangladesh's interim government Thursday after an uprising prompted former prime minister Sheikh Hasina to step down and flee to India.

The key tasks for Yunus now are restoring peace in Bangladesh and preparing for new elections following weeks of violence in which student activists led an uprising against what was considered Hasina's increasingly autocratic 15-year rule.

Bangladesh's figurehead President Mohammed Shahabuddin administered the oath to Yunus for his role as chief adviser, which is the equivalent to a prime minister, in the presence of foreign diplomats, civil society members, top businessmen and members of the former opposition party at the presidential palace in Dhaka.

No representatives of Hasina's party were present.

Yunus arrived home Thursday from an overseas trip, as he looks to restore calm and rebuild the country.

Yunus landed at Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Thursday afternoon and was welcomed by the country's military chief, Gen. Waker-Uz-Zaman, who was flanked by navy and air force heads.

Some of the student leaders who led the uprising against Hasina were also present at the airport to welcome him. They had earlier proposed Yunus as interim leader to the country's figurehead president, who is currently acting as the chief executive under the constitution.

In his first comments after his arrival, he told a news briefing that his priority would be to restore order.

'Bangladesh is a family'

""Bangladesh is a family. We have to unite it,"" Yunus said, flanked by the student leaders. ""It has immense possibility.""

He urged all to stop violence and promised not to resort to any repressive measures against anyone.

Security was tight at the airport to ensure Yunus's safe arrival, as the country has experienced days of unrest following the downfall of Hasina on Monday. President Mohammed Shahabuddin will administer the oath-taking ceremony on Thursday night when Yunus is expected to announce his new cabinet.

Before leaving Paris, where he was attending the Olympics, Yunus appealed for calm in Bangladesh amid tensions over the country's future.

Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, who acts as an adviser to his mother, vowed Wednesday that his family and the Awami League party would continue to be engaged in Bangladesh's politics — a reversal from what he'd said earlier in the week after Hasina stepped down Monday and fled to India.

Yunuswas named as interim leader following talks among military officials, civic leaders and the student activists who led the uprising against Hasina. Yunus made his first public comments in the French capital on Wednesday before boarding a plane to return home.

Yunus urges peace

Yunus congratulated the student protesters, saying they had made ""our second Victory Day possible,"" and he appealed to them and other stakeholders to remain peaceful, while condemning the violence that followed Hasina's resignation.

""Violence is our enemy. Please don't create more enemies. Be calm and get ready to build the country,"" Yunus said.

Bangladesh's military chief, Gen. Waker-Uz-Zaman, said in a televised address on Wednesday that he expected Yunus to usher in a ""beautiful democratic"" process.

Yunus, who was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his work developing microcredit markets, told reporters in Paris: ""I'm looking forward to going back home and seeing what's happening there, and how we can organize ourselves to get out of the trouble that we are in.""

Asked when elections would be held, he put his hands up as if to indicate it was too early to say.

""I'll go and talk to them. I'm just fresh in this whole area,"" he said.

300 deaths since mid-July

A tribunal in Dhaka earlier on Wednesday acquitted Yunus in a labour law violation case involving a telecommunication company he founded, in which he was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail. He had been released on bail in the case.

The president had dissolved Parliament on Tuesday, clearing the path for an interim administration that is expected to schedule new elections.

Yunus has been a longtime opponent of Hasina, who had called him a ""bloodsucker"" allegedly for using force to extract loan repayments from rural poor, mainly women. Yunus has denied the allegations.

In a span of weeks since July 15, more than 300 people died in violence in Bangladesh. Rising tensions in the days surrounding Hasina's resignation created chaos, with police leaving their posts after being attacked. Dozens of officers were killed, prompting police to stop working across the country. They threatened not to return unless their safety is ensured. The looting of firearms was also reported in local media.

The chaos began in July with protests against a quota system for government jobs that critics said favoured people with connections to Hasina's party. But the demonstrations soon grew into a broader challenge to Hasina's 15-year rule, which was marked by human rights abuses, corruption, allegations of rigged elections and a brutal crackdown on her opponents.

Joy, Hasina's son, said in a social media post on Wednesday that his family would return to politics and not give up following attacks on the Awami League party's leaders and members. Many see Joy as Hasina's successor in a dynastic political culture that dominates the South Asian nation's politics.

On Monday, Joy had said Hasina would not return to politics after she stepped down. But in a video message posted on his Facebook page on Wednesday, he urged party activists to rise up."

The decision was reached during a meeting involving President Mohammed Shahabuddin, the heads of the military branches, and student leaders. Yunus, who is currently in Europe, expressed his willingness to lead the interim government, saying, ""If action is needed in Bangladesh, for my country and for the courage of my people, then I will take it.""



In an article for The Economist, Yunus emphasised his desire to ""ensure a free and fair election is held within a few months"" and called for a new generation of leaders to emerge. He stressed the need for young people who are not preoccupied with settling scores, as he believes too many previous governments have been.



Hasina's resignation on Monday came after more than a month of unrest, which began as protests against a plan for quotas in government jobs but evolved into an anti-Hasina movement.



The 76-year-old leader, who had been in power since 2009, was accused of rigging the January elections and committing widespread human rights abuses. Despite deploying security forces to suppress the protests, resulting in hundreds of deaths, the military ultimately turned against Hasina, forcing her to flee to India.

Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took oath as the head of Bangladesh’s interim government on Thursday. This comes three days after former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country on August 5 amid violent protests. Yunus was administered the oath of office by President Mohammed Shahabuddin at a ceremony at the presidential palace 'Bangabhaban' in Dhaka.

84-year-old Yunus was recommended for the role by student protesters and returned to Dhaka earlier on Thursday from Paris, where he was undergoing medical treatment. According to the information, Yunus will be the chief adviser in the interim government tasked with holding fresh elections in the South Asian country of 170 million people. Sixteen other people have been included in the interim Cabinet with members drawn mainly from civil society and including two of the student protest leaders.

The key tasks for Yunus now are restoring peace in Bangladesh and preparing for new elections following weeks of violence in which student activists led an uprising against what was considered Hasina’s increasingly autocratic 15-year rule. The President had dissolved Parliament on Tuesday, clearing the path for the interim administration.

Who is Muhammad Yunus?

Yunus was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for pioneering microcredit to help impoverished people, especially women, while the Grameen Bank, which he had founded, also secured the prize on the same occasion. He faces over 150 other cases, including major corruption charges that could see him jailed for years if found guilty while the economist denies all wrongdoing. Yunus entered Bangladeshi politics in 2007 by forming his Nagorik Shakti (Citizen Power) party and planned to contest the upcoming election amid a state of emergency and severe conflict between Sheikh Hasina's Awami League and Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). He dropped his efforts to establish the party after a lack of support but has maintained his fierce criticism of Hasina's government.

Bangladesh protests

It should be mentioned here that Hasina quit earlier this week after several chaotic weeks that began in July with protests against a quota system for government jobs that critics said favoured people with connections to Hasina’s party. But the demonstrations soon grew into a bigger challenge for Hasina’s 15-year rule as more than 300 people including students were killed amid spiralling violence. Dozens of police officers were also killed, prompting police to stop working across the country.

President Mohammed Shahabuddin administered the oath at a ceremony held at the Presidential palace in the capital Dhaka.

“I will uphold, support and protect the constitution,” said Yunus, adding that he will perform his duties “sincerely”. He will now lead the caretaker government whose primary objective at the moment is to restore peace and order in a country that has been in turmoil since the start of July.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted on social media platform X congratulating Yunus. He wrote, “We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities. India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfill the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development.”

The Background

On July 2, Bangladeshi students began protests against the government’s policy of reserving 56% of the government jobs for certain groups, including the children and grandchildren of Bangladeshi war veterans. In the weeks that followed, the clashes between protesters and law enforcement authorities grew violent, resulting in the death of more than 300 people.

Finally, on August 5, thousands of protestors stormed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s residence. Hasina handed in her resignation to President Mohammed Shahabuddin and fled to neighboring India on the same day.

The student protestors called on 2006 Nobel Prize-winning economist Muhammad Younus to take charge of the interim government. Earlier this year, a Bangladesh court indicted Yunus – who pioneered microfinancing to uplift Bangladeshis from poverty – on embezzlement charges which Yunus denied.

On Thursday, he returned to Bangladesh from Paris, where he was traveling for the Olympics and took charge of Bangladesh’s interim government. “Today is a glorious day for us,” Yunus said to reporters upon arrival at the Dhaka airport. “Bangladesh has created a new victory day. Bangladesh has got a second independence.”"

President Mohammed Shahabuddin administered the oath to Yunus, 84, and his team at the presidential office in the national capital of Dhaka.

The position of the head of the transitional government is officially called ""chief adviser.""

Most members of the transitional government are technocrats. The team includes two members from the student group that led protests that forced Hasina to resign and flee Bangladesh on Monday.

Army chief Gen. Waker-Uz-Zaman had announced the formation of a transitional government after Hasina fled to India, where she is currently.

Yunus was in France when the announcement was made. He returned Thursday.

""Bangladesh has started a new victory day. We have to move on. We are thankful to those who did it, they (students) saved the country,” Yunus said after landing in Dhaka.

Bangladesh has witnessed large-scale student protests since July against controversial civil service job quotas that killed more than 400.

Shahabuddin dissolved parliament on Tuesday which was elected in January when Hasina was elected prime minister for a fourth time.

The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has demanded national elections within three months to hand over power to the people’s representatives."

Amid nationwide looting and violence, Bangladesh has finally entered the post-Sheik Hasina era.

Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took oath as the head of Bangladesh’s interim government on Thursday evening.

Yunus was selected by the Bangladeshi military and student groups’ leaders that waged the protests against Hasina. He will be joined by 16 more persons in the new de facto cabinet. None of the team-members is a politician even though some of them have served in the government before in executive role.

Following weeks of mass-movement against her 15-year rule which climaxed on Sunday in which nearly 100 people were killed, Hasina resigned on Monday and fled Bangladesh for her life. Shortly after she fled her official residence in Dhaka, mobs stormed it and plundered it.

Since Hasina’s flight from Dhaka, mobs have been running amok in Bangladesh and are going about attacking political rivals of her Bangladesh Awami League (BAL) party and Hindus among other religious minorities. Across the country, the mobs have been attacked homes of Hindus, including prominent public figures, and reports have also emerged of attacks on temples. At least two Hindu councillors have been killed.

The first and foremost challenge of Yunus will be to put a stop on such violence and re-establish order in the country.

Here’s Yunus’ 16-member team

Formally, Yunus holds the designation of Chief Advisor to the interim government and the 16 team-members hold the designation of Advisors.

Of the 16 advisors, only 13 took oath on Tuesday evening along with Yunus, according to Prothom Alo newspaper.

Three advisors could not take oath as they were not in Dhaka, said the newspaper, adding that the appointment of all 16 have, however, been formalised.

Here are the 16 advisors part of Yunus’ team, according to The Daily Star.

Elections to be held soon, said Yunus

Ahead of taking oath, Yunus had said that elections will be held in the coming months in Bangladesh.

Yunus had said that lasting peace in Bangladesh would only come from elections.

“I am honoured by the trust of the protesters who wish for me to lead the interim government. If action is needed in Bangladesh, for my country and for the courage of my people, then I will take it. The interim government is only the beginning. Lasting peace will only come with free elections. Without elections, there will be no change,” said Yunus to AFP."

Yunus was administered the oath of office by President Mohammed Shahabuddin, as the chief advisor with a team of 13 other advisors, at a ceremony at the presidential palace in Dhaka.

Yunus was appointed as the head of the interim government on Tuesday after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled to India following widespread protests against her government over a controversial quota system in jobs. Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his pioneering work on microlending.

‘New dawn’

While interacting with the media, Yunus said Bangladesh will create its “new dawn” of victory. “I want to express my gratitude and praise the youths who have made this possible. They have protected this country and given it a rebirth and we wish for this new Bangladesh to progress with speed,” he was quoted as saying by ANI.

“We have to protect this freedom – not just protect it, we have to ensure that it reaches every single household. Otherwise, the freedom will have no meaning… The entire Bangladesh is one big family and we want to progress together by removing all doubts and differences,” he added.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first leaders to wish Yunus after he took oath. “My best wishes to Professor Muhammad Yunus on the assumption of his new responsibilities. We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities. India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfill the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development,” PM Modi said in a post on X.

Emotional press conference

Yunus, who was in Paris for the Olympic Games, returned to the country via Dubai on Thursday on an Emirates flight. Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman, senior officials, student leaders and civil society members welcomed him at the airport. At an emotional press conference at Dhaka’s Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport after his arrival, Yunus described the change of regime in Bangladesh as the “second independence”.

“Today is a day of our pride,” he said. “We have got independence for the second time. We have to protect this independence.” He expressed gratitude to the youth who made the protest movement against Hasina successful and said he would like to stress first is to “save the country from violence so that we can move forward on the path that the students have shown us.” He urged people from all walks of life to listen to him and said he agreed to take charge of the interim administration responding to the call of the students and youths.

‘Have faith in me and trust me’

“If you have faith in me and trust me, then ensure that there will be no attack anywhere in the country. This is our first responsibility,” he said at the crowded press briefing. “If I can’t do it and you do not listen to me, I don’t have any utility here.” He termed the anarchic activities and attacks on minority communities as “part of a conspiracy”.

“We have to form a government which assures safety to its citizens,” he said. Yunus said the country was now in the hands of the young people. “The nation is in your hands now. Now you have to rebuild it as per your aspirations. You have to use your creativity to build the country. You have earned independence for the country,” he said. “We need to change our state structure and remove all elements of fear from it, so that people look at it and think that the state has been formed to safeguard them,” Yunus added.

Yunus-led interim government

The Yunus-led interim government will lead the country for a certain period and oversee the election to transition power to an elected government. The Army chief on Wednesday hinted that the interim government may have 15 members for now. He, however, did not disclose the possible tenure of the government. Gen Zaman hoped that normalcy would return within three to four days as the situation across the country is improving significantly.

Yunus, whose name was first proposed for the top job by the coordinators of the student movement that led to Hasina’s ouster, on Wednesday congratulated the “brave students” who took the lead in making, what he said, “our Second Victory Day possible”, and appealed to all students, political parties and non-political people to stay calm.

‘Violence is our enemy’

“Let us not miss the chance by going into any senseless violence. Violence is our enemy. Please don’t create more enemies. Be calm and get ready to build the country,” he said in a statement. “If we take the path of violence everything will be destroyed. Please stay calm. Help those around you to stay calm.” His successful anti-poverty campaign through the Grameen Bank became a model which was replicated across continents.

He had been in a protracted row with Hasina’s government due to obscure reasons while authorities initiated a series of investigations against him after she came to power in 2008. Bangladesh authorities launched a review of the statutory Grameen Bank’s activities in 2011 and fired Yunus as its founding managing director on charges of violating the government retirement regulation.

Yunus was charged under dozens of cases during Hasina’s regime. In January, a court sentenced Yunus to six months in jail on charges of labour law violation. Many people believe Hasina became enraged when Yunus announced that he would form a political party in 2007 when a military-backed government ran the country and Hasina was in prison.

After the storm, comes the calm. And that’s what Bangladesh — which has seen violence and protests, leading to the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina — is hoping from Muhammad Yunus as he takes the oath as the head of the interim government.

Known as the ‘banker of the poor’, 84-year-old Yunus, who also holds the honour of being the 2006 Nobel Peace winner, will aim to bring stability to the southeast Asian nation, which has been wracked by student anger.

Yunus being sworn in as head of the interim government comes after his name was first proposed for the top job by the coordinators of the student movement that led to Hasina’s ouster. But the question that many are asking is if 84-year-old Yunus is up for the challenge.

Scholar and academic

Born in 1940 in Chattogram, a seaport city in Bangladesh, Yunus was one of nine children in a family of merchants. At 25, he travelled to the United States to study under a Fulbright scholarship, received his PhD from Vanderbilt University in the United States and taught there briefly before returning to Bangladesh in 1971 — the same year the country won its independence from Pakistan in a brutal, bloody war.

On his return, he was elected to head Chittagong University’s economics department, and soon became passionately involved with combatting the famine that ravaged Bangladesh in the mid-70s.

“I became involved in the poverty issue not as a policymaker or a researcher,” he said in a 2005 lecture at the Commonwealth Institute in London. “I became involved because poverty was all around me. “I could not turn my eyes away from it… I wanted to do something immediate to help people around me.”

Microcredit and the Grameen Bank

It was under these conditions — the famine led to a high mortality rate in the country — that Yunus noted that banks were not giving loans to victims of the famine if they did not have any collateral damage. He then lent a loan of $27 to 42 families with the belief that such loans would greatly contribute to stimulation of businesses thus improving the financial conditions of the poor.

He held the opinion that the poor were not fundamentally unworthy of credit, reasoning that the poor were lacking in resources but not in trustworthiness or financial sensibility. He believed they would be able and inclined to honour loans, if only given a reasonable interest rate. This belief lay at the heart of the Grameen Bank’s business model.

Taking this belief forward, in 1983, he launched the Grameen Bank with the aim of providing small loans to those who would not normally qualify to receive them. As the Madras Courier writes in one report, the Grameen Bank’s philosophy of advancing credit was founded not on collateral but on the trust of the local community of borrowers.

Speaking on the same, Yunus once claimed that microcredits were both a human right and an effective means of emerging from poverty: “Lend the poor money in amounts which suit them, teach them a few basic financial principles, and they generally manage on their own.”

The Grameen Bank also adopted the model of solidarity group lending wherein a loan is divided among several recipients. Moreover, collective lending ensured that loans are being repaid on time.

Success of Yunus’ Grameen Bank

The Grameen Bank soon became a buzzword in Bangladesh. It also came up with the “16 Decision” — which was later updated to “18 Decisions” — in which borrowers vowed to follow certain codes on receiving a loan. For instance, a borrower vows to ensure the education of their children and follow a healthy lifestyle by drinking only tube well water.

The loans granted by Grameen Bank saw women becoming more empowered, primary school enrollments increasing, households maintaining better hygiene and sanitation and even infant mortality reducing.

The BBC notes that the Grameen Bank became so successful that even beggars had been able to borrow money under his scheme.

In 2006, the Nobel Peace Prize Committee also recognised the impact that Yunus’ Grameen Bank had on Bangladeshi society and awarded him and the institute the prestigious award that year.

Today, over 40 years since, the institute began, it has reached out to nearly 45 million people through its 10.6 million borrower members. Additionally, as of June 2024, it had disbursed loans worth $38 billion, maintaining a recovery rate of 96.3 per cent.

However, despite its success, the Grameen Bank is not without criticism. There are some who have criticised the concept of micro-financial institutions, saying they charge exorbitant interest rates and use coercive debt collection methods. On this, Yunus’ response has been that the Grameen Bank doesn’t aim to earn money but to help the poor and empower small businesses.

Yunus’ ouster from Grameen Bank

Interestingly, as the Grameen Bank’s reputation became stronger, it was Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina who fired Yunus as managing director saying that at 73, he had stayed on past the legal retirement age of 60.

She also accused the bank of “sucking blood of the poor” and claimed Yunus treated the institution as his “personal property.”

Inspiration for other institutions

The success of the Grameen Bank can also be gauged from the fact that several such micro-financing institutes (MFIs) have emerged across the world. The Centre for Development Policy and Practice notes that several MFIs have emerged in India. For instance, Bandhan in India was established in 2001 and started its operations in West Bengal as a non-profit organisation with the motive of providing women empowerment and financial inclusion. It became the largest microfinance institution in India by 2010 and it currently has more than 4,000 banking outlets and 1,000 branches across India.

Now, the question is: Will Yunus be able to steer Bangladesh as he did with the Grameen Bank? Only time will tell. But as a quote on his website states: “If you imagine, someday it will happen. If you don’t imagine, it will never happen.” May be it’s time for him and the people of Bangladesh to imagine better days.

DHAKA – Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took the oath of office as head of Bangladesh’s interim government Thursday after an uprising prompted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to step down and flee to India.

The key tasks for Yunus now are restoring peace in Bangladesh and preparing for new elections following weeks of violence in which student activists led an uprising against what was considered Hasina’s increasingly autocratic 15-year rule.

Bangladesh’s figurehead President Mohammed Shahabuddin administered the oath to Yunus for his role as chief advisor, which is the equivalent to a prime minister, in presence of foreign diplomats, civil society members, top businessmen and members of the former opposition party at the presidential palace in Dhaka. No representatives of Hasina's party were present.

Sixteen other people have been included in the interim Cabinet with members drawn mainly from civil society and including two of the student protest leaders. The Cabinet members were chosen in discussions this week among student leaders, civil society representatives and the military.

Hasina quit on Monday after several chaotic weeks that began in July with protests against a quota system for government jobs that critics said favored people with connections to Hasina’s party. But the demonstrations soon grew into a bigger challenge for Hasina’s 15-year rule, as more than 300 people including students were killed amid spiraling violence.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent his best wishes to Yunus in a statement on social media platform X, and alluded to reports that Hindus in Muslim-majority Bangladesh had been targeted during the country's unrest in recent days.

“We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities,” Modi said. “India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfill the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development.”

Yunus, who was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his work developing microcredit markets, was in the French capital for the 2024 Olympics when he was chosen for the interim role, and returned home earlier Thursday to tight security at the airport in Dhaka.

In his first comments after his arrival, he told a news briefing that his priority would be to restore order. “Bangladesh is a family. We have to unite it,” Yunus said, flanked by student leaders. “It has immense possibility.”

On Wednesday in Paris, Yunus had called for calm and an end to all partisan violence.

Hasina’s son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, who acts as an adviser to his mother, vowed Wednesday that his family and the Awami League party would continue to be engaged in Bangladesh’s politics — a reversal from what he’d said earlier in the week after Hasina stepped down Monday and fled to India.

The president had dissolved Parliament on Tuesday, clearing the path for the interim administration.

On Wednesday, a tribunal in Dhaka acquitted Yunus in a labor law violation case involving a telecommunication company he founded, in which he was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail. He had been released on bail in the case.

Yunus has been a longtime opponent of Hasina, who had called him a “bloodsucker” allegedly for using force to extract loan repayments from rural poor, mainly women. Yunus has denied the allegations.

The chaos on Bangladesh's streets continued after Hasina’s resignation on Monday. Dozens of police officers were killed, prompting police to stop working across the country. They threatened not to return unless their safety is ensured. The looting of firearms also was reported in local media.

The unrest began in mid-July with protests over the quota system, but grew into a broader challenge over an administration that was marked by human rights abuses, corruption, allegations of rigged elections and a brutal crackdown on opponents.

Joy, Hasina’s son, said in a social media post on Wednesday that his family would return to politics despite what he said have been attacks on the Awami League party over the past week. Many observers see Joy as Hasina’s successor in a dynastic political culture that dominates the South Asian nation’s politics.

“If we want to build a new Bangladesh, it is not possible without the Awami League,” he said. “The Awami League is the oldest, democratic, and largest party in Bangladesh.""

Overnight into Thursday, residents across Dhaka carried sticks, iron rods and sharp weapons to guard their neighborhoods amid reports of robberies. Communities used loudspeakers in mosques to alert people that robberies were occurring, and police remained off duty. The military shared hotline numbers for people seeking help.

The quick move to select Yunus came when Hasina’s resignation created a power vacuum and left the future unclear for Bangladesh, which has a history of military rule, messy politics and myriad crises.

Many fear that Hasina’s departure could trigger even more instability in the densely populated nation of some 170 million people, which is already dealing with high unemployment, corruption and a complex strategic relationship with India, China and the United States.

Hasina, 76, was elected to a fourth consecutive term in January, in an election boycotted by her main opponents. Thousands of opposition members were jailed before the vote, and the U.S. and U.K. denounced the result as not credible."

After weeks of student-led protests forced Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign and flee to India, Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus on Thursday returned to Bangladesh to head an interim government.

According to Al Jazeera, Yunus touched down at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka on a flight from Paris via Dubai.

Yunus is set to take oath as the head of Bangladesh’s interim government today. Earlier, he had made a fervent appeal to everyone to stay calm and “refrain from all kinds of violence” to make the best use of “our new victory”.

“It’s good to be back home,” Al Jazeera quoted the 84-year-old as saying.

Yunus was picked by President Mohammed Shahabuddin to lead an interim government, fulfilling a key demand of the student protest leaders.

According to Al Jazeera, Yunus was expected to head first to a meeting with the army chief and the president before being sworn in at 8 pm (14:00 GMT).

“Today is a glorious day for us,” Al Jazeera quoted Yunus telling reporters at the airport.

“Bangladesh has created a new victory day. Bangladesh has got a second independence,” said the Nobel Laureate.

Yunus said his main objective is to hold elections as soon as possible, likely 90 days from the dissolving of the country’s Parliament which took place on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, according to a Prothom Alo report, as many as 21 cars are kept in the parking zone of the Cabinet Division in the Secretariat, of which a BMW car is reserved for the Chief Advisor.

The secretariat said that these 21 vehicles will be sent this afternoon to the residence of the Chief Adviser and other advisers of the new interim government. They will go to Bangabhaban to take oath in these cars, added the report.

Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman had on Wednesday announced that the interim government will take oath around 8 pm on Thursday. He said the advisory council may have 15 members.

Students had taken to the streets last month over a controversial government job quota system, their protests escalating into a nationwide crisis following a harsh crackdown by authorities.

Nearly 300 people were killed within weeks in one of the most violent phases of Hasina’s 15-year rule.

Mr Yunus, 84, was administered the oath of office by President Mohammed Shahabuddin at a ceremony at the presidential palace “Bangabhaban”.

The economist-turned-politician was appointed as the head of the interim government on Tuesday after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled to India following widespread protests against her government over a controversial quota system for jobs.

Minutes after Mr Yunus was sworn-in, Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated him. He also strongly raised the need for the new interim government in Bangladesh to ensure the protection of minorities, including Hindus, in the strife-torn country.

Mr Modi said: ""India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfil the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development.""

The Prime Minister posted on X: ""My best wishes to Professor Muhammad Yunus on the assumption of his new responsibilities. We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities.""

Mr Modi's message to Dhaka signals that New Delhi is keen to continue its friendship with the people of Bangladesh, irrespective of the government in power there.

According to media reports from Dhaka, Mr Yunus oath-taking ceremony at the presidential palace in Dhaka was attended by political leaders, civil society leaders, Amry Generals and diplomats.

“I will uphold, support and protect the constitution,” Mr Yunus was quoted as saying while he was administered the oath by Mr Shahabuddin.

According to reports, more than a dozen members of his Cabinet, whose titles are advisers, not ministers, also took the oath, as the caretaker government will now seek to restore peace and prepare for new elections.

The new Cabinet reportedly includes Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud, top leaders of the Students Against Discrimination group, which led the weeks-long protests that ousted Ms Hasina. Others include former foreign secretary Touhid Hossain and former attorney-general Hassan Ariff.

Award-winning environmental lawyer Syeda Rizwana Hasan and top law professor and writer Syeda Rizwana Hasan were also reportedly sworn in. Adilur Rahman Khan, a prominent human rights activist who was sentenced to two years in jail by the Hasina government, also reportedly took the oath as an adviser.

Hours before taking charge as the head of Bangladesh's new interim government, Mr Yunus, who reached Dhaka from Paris on Thursday, said that restoration of law and order is the priority of the new government. He urged all to refrain from any violence amid reports of attacks on minorities and others in his country.

Mr Yunus also hailed the successful protests by students as a ""second independence"" for Bangladesh, which gained its freedom from Pakistan over half a century ago.

Amid efforts to form an interim government in Bangladesh, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, son of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled her country on Monday, told news agencies his mother will definitely return to her country once democracy is restored, either as a ""retired or active"" politician.

Speaking with PTI, Mr Joy said, “Yes, it is true that I had said she (Ms Hasina) wouldn’t return to Bangladesh. But a lot has changed in the last two days following continuous attacks on our leaders and party workers across the country. Now we are going to do whatever it takes to keep our people safe; we are not going to leave them alone.”

He added: ""The Awami League is the largest and oldest political party in Bangladesh, so we cannot just walk away from our people. She will definitely return to Bangladesh once democracy is restored.""

This comes amid uncertainty over the future plans of Ms Hasina, who fled to Delhi following her ouster from power after her country's Army refused to back her against protests from students and political groups demanding her removal.

Mr Yunus himself, a bitter critic of Sheikh Hasina and the new interim government, backed by students and anti-India political parties and groups such as the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Jamaat-e-Islami, may demand the extradition of Ms Hasina from India to stand trial in a probe on police firings during the recent protests that caused the death of scores of protesters including students.

There is also some unease in New Delhi that the interim government in Dhaka may not take kindly to any long-term presence of Ms Hasina on Indian soil. There have been reports that Ms Hasina is therefore considering a range of possible destinations in Europe or the Gulf where she can proceed from India to settle down.

While Ms Hasina has always been viewed as a friend of India, which is why she was permitted to land in Delhi, India is keen to avoid any major irritant with the new government in Dhaka. Whether New Delhi facilitates or lends its assistance for a swift and dignified exit for Ms Hasina to a safe destination abroad in Europe or the Gulf remains to be seen."

The new interim cabinet members will be finalised, and fresh general elections are expected to be held soon.

Bangladesh news: Here are some latest developments

-Muhammad Yunus reached Dhaka from Paris after completing a medical procedure. While praising students for their “bravery,” he has urged a nonviolent approach to prevent further destruction.

-After her release from prison, former Prime minister and head of Bangladesh National Party Khaleda Zia called for a “democratic Bangladesh where all religions are respected.” Her statement assumes significance amid reports of attacks allegedly targeting the country's Hindu minorities and Awami League members.

-The Indian High Commission in Dhaka said its mission will continue to remain functional. While all diplomats remain, New Delhi has recalled all non-essential staff and their family members voluntarily.

-Indian carriers Air India and IndiGo resumed services to Dhaka and operated special flights to repatriate over 400 people.

-Former Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina will continue to stay in India for some time. According to her son, she hasn't decided to seek asylum in a third country.

-India's Border Security Force prevented a large group of around 120-140 Bangladeshis from entering India via the West Bengal border. The agency clarified that these were due to fears of local unrest and that there was no large-scale infiltration attempt."
Muhammad Yunus takes oath as head of Bangladesh’s interim government.,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/bangladesh-interim-government-08072024214054.html,"Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus who was named head of the interim Bangladesh government, arrives at the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka on Aug. 8, 2024.

Bangladesh’s interim government will be formed and sworn in on Thursday evening, and its leader Muhammad Yunus will guide citizens through a “democratic process,” the country’s Army chief announced.

There was a flurry of activity on Wednesday, two days after the resignation of Sheikh Hasina as prime minister amid a mass movement blaming her for the more than 300 lives lost during protests since mid-July.

The home ministry announced a new chief of the controversial elite Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), a day after the chief of police was replaced. The country’s attorney general resigned. Central bank employees agitated against its allegedly corrupt governors. An appeals court made a significant acquittal.

And Yunus spoke publicly for the first time since he was named a day earlier to head the interim government, mainly calling for an end to fresh violence since Hasina fled to India.

“I congratulate the brave students who took the lead in making our Second Victory Day possible and to the people for giving your total support to them,” he said in a statement.

Citizens consider Dec. 16, 1971, Victory Day to mark the official surrender by the Pakistani army during Bangladesh’s war for independence.

“Let us not let this slip away because of our mistakes. I fervently appeal to everybody to stay calm. Please refrain from all kinds of violence. … This is our beautiful country with lots of exciting possibilities,” Yunus appealed.

“Violence is our enemy. Please don’t create more enemies. Be calm and get ready to build the country.”

Gen. Waker-uz-Zaman, the Army chief, said on Wednesday that Yunus would return from Paris in time for the interim government’s members to take the oath.

“The swearing-in ceremony is expected to be held at Bangabhaban at 8 p.m. tomorrow, Thursday,” Waker told reporters. Bangabhaban is the president’s official residence.

He added that Yunus was “very eager” to begin work in the interim government.

“I am certain that he will be able to take us through a beautiful democratic process and that we will benefit from this,” Gen. Waker said.

Yunus won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for helping lift millions out of poverty by lending them small sums to start businesses and increase earnings.

University students who spearheaded a protest movement demanding more access to government jobs had proposed that Yunus head the interim government.

An appellate tribunal, meanwhile, cleared the decks for Yunus to assume leadership of the new administration by acquitting him in a labor laws violation case a day before the swearing-in ceremony.

He had been convicted and sentenced to six months in prison in the case, a ruling he had appealed. He was out on bail pending the verdict on the appeal, delivered Wednesday.

Yunus is stepping into the shoes of Hasina, who seemed to loathe him.

She believed he had blocked a global lending institution from financing a mega project in Bangladesh. He was subsequently barraged with a slew of legal cases that his supporters claimed were politically motivated.

‘Leadership failure’

Meanwhile, members of the police force abandoned their posts for the second consecutive day, fearing for their lives. Mobs attacked police stations after Hasina quit and decamped on Monday, when a fresh round of violence claimed at least 108 lives.

Protesters say that police and supporters of Hasina’s Awami League party were directly responsible for earlier deadly violence.

One of the first officials to be fired after Hasina fled was the country’s police chief, who was replaced on Tuesday.

Newly appointed Inspector General of Police Moinul Islam on Wednesday apologized for the police actions in recent weeks.

He said at a press conference that the “ambition” of some unprofessional members of the force led to the violent clashes.

Police officers violated human rights, “and leadership failure caused the death, injury and assault of many,” he said.

The new police chief promised an investigation and justice.

“We are committed to conducting a fair and impartial investigation into every recent killing of students, common people, and the police,” he said.

Moinul said he had instructed all members of the police force to rejoin their respective posts across the country by Thursday evening.

His predecessor, Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, was said to be partisan and a supporter of Hasina’s Awami League, observers said. He used to serve in the elite police unit Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and was one of six current or former officers the United States sanctioned in December 2021 for gross human rights violations.

The U.S. had imposed financial sanctions on RAB as well, for “undermining the rule of law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the economic prosperity of the people of Bangladesh.”

Critics said that Hasina politicized state institutions and security forces, making them agents of her ambition to stay in power and crush dissent.

Others who resigned or were fired on Wednesday included the PM’s chief secretary, the attorney general, and, according to media reports, four deputy governors of Bangladesh’s central bank.

Around 200 employees of the bank, which is called Bangladesh Bank, stormed its premises, demanding the resignation of the central bank governor, four deputy governors, advisers and the head of the financial intelligence unit, alleging they were responsible for corruption in the banking sector.

The road ahead

Analysts told BenarNews that the interim government has to depoliticize the security forces, judiciary and all state institutions, because only then can a free, fair and credible election be held.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters on Tuesday that this new administration needs to listen to the Bangladeshi people.

“[A]ny decisions that the interim government makes need to respect democratic principles, need to uphold the rule of law, need to reflect the will of the people,” he said.

The International Crisis Group, an independent organization that is committed to preventing war and conflict, on Wednesday said Bangladesh’s interim government will have the tasks of maintaining order and running the country until new national elections can be held.

“The [Bangladesh] constitution states that a general election should take place within 90 days of parliament being dissolved,” the group said in a statement on Wednesday.

“So far at least, neither Waker nor any other army officer seems eager to hold power for longer than necessary.”

The makeup of the interim government is still unknown, and may only be revealed during the oath-taking Thursday evening.

For ICG, this issue is vital to Bangladesh’s immediate future.

“The key will be to ensure that the protest movement is capably represented,” ICG’s statement said.

“If calm is to be restored, those who risked and sacrificed the most to compel Hasina to resign – namely, the students who initiated the protest movement – should have a meaningful voice in the government’s counsels, rather than find themselves sidelined by conservative generals and opportunistic politicians.”

New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first leaders to extend best wishes to Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus on taking oath as head of Bangladesh's interim government and said that India is hoping for an 'early return to normalcy' in the country, which would also ensure the safety and protection of all Hindus and other minority communities.

The Prime Minister emphasised India's commitment to collaborating with Bangladesh to achieve the shared aspirations of both nations for peace, security, and development. ""My best wishes to Professor Muhammad Yunus on the assumption of his new responsibilities. We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities. India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfill the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development,"" PM Modi wrote on X.

Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus takes oath

Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took oath as the head of Bangladesh’s interim government on Thursday. This comes three after former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country on August 5 amid violent protests. He was administered the oath of office by President Muhammed Shahabuddin at a ceremony at the presidential palace 'Bangabhaban'.

84-year-old Yunus was recommended for the role by student protesters and returned to Dhaka earlier on Thursday from Paris, where he was undergoing medical treatment. According to the information, Yunus will be the chief adviser in the interim government tasked with holding fresh elections in the South Asian country of 170 million people. Sixteen other people have been included in the interim Cabinet with members drawn mainly from civil society and including two of the student protest leaders.

Who is Muhammad Yunus?

Yunus was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for pioneering microcredit to help impoverished people, especially women, while the Grameen Bank, which he had founded, also secured the prize on the same occasion. He faces over 150 other cases, including major corruption charges that could see him jailed for years if found guilty while the economist denies all wrongdoing. Yunus entered Bangladeshi politics in 2007 by forming his Nagorik Shakti (Citizen Power) party and planned to contest the upcoming election amid a state of emergency and severe conflict between Sheikh Hasina's Awami League and Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). He dropped his efforts to establish the party after a lack of support but has maintained his fierce criticism of Hasina's government.

Bangladesh protests

It should be mentioned here that Hasina quit earlier this week after several chaotic weeks that began in July with protests against a quota system for government jobs that critics said favoured people with connections to Hasina’s party. But the demonstrations soon grew into a bigger challenge for Hasina’s 15-year rule as more than 300 people including students were killed amid spiralling violence. Dozens of police officers were also killed, prompting police to stop working across the country.

Yunus, 84, was administered the oath of office by President Mohammed Shahabuddin at a ceremony at the presidential palace ‘Bangabhaban’.

A 16-member council of advisers was announced to assist Yunus in running the state’s affairs. Md. Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud, two key organisers of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement, were also part of the advisory council.

Women’s rights activist Farida Akhtar, right-wing party Hefazat-e-Islam’s deputy chief AFM Khalid Hossain, Grameen Telecom trustee Nurjahan Begum, freedom fighter Sharmeen Murshid, chairman of Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Board Supradip Chakma, Prof Bidhan Ranjan Roy and former foreign secretary Touhid Hossain are among the advisory council members.

Yunus was sworn in as the chief advisor - a position equivalent to prime minister.

Leaders of political parties, judges, representatives of various organisations, chiefs of the three services, inspector general of police, senior military and civil officers, diplomats, freedom fighters, senior journalists and other dignitaries were present at the ceremony.

Roy, Chakma and Bir Pratik Faruk-e-Azam could not take the oath as they were outside Dhaka.

The interim government will lead the country for a certain period and oversee the election to transition power to an elected government.

Ahead of taking the oath, Yunus promised to deliver a government which assures safety to its citizens and urged them to assist him in rebuilding the protest-torn country, as he described the ouster of Hasina as the country’s “second independence”.

Bangladesh witnessed deadly unrest in recent weeks. Over 500 people, including police personnel, were killed in the violence centring the students’ movement. Many of those killed died after the Supreme Court backed student demands and largely scrapped the quota system last month.

The Army chief, who first announced the formation of an interim government, did not disclose the possible tenure of the government.

New Delhi: Muhammad Yunus the Nobel Peace laureate, is set to lead an interim government in Bangladesh, aiming to restore calm amidst political turmoil.

President Mohammed Shahabuddin’s decision to appoint Yunus follows the demands of student demonstrators, leading to the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.

Yunus, aged 84, is tasked with steering the country through this transitional period.

“Let us make the best use of our new victory,” he said in a statement to Reuters before leaving from Paris, where he had been receiving medical treatment while out on bail from criminal cases brought under Hasina.

“I fervently appeal to everybody to stay calm. Please refrain from all kinds of violence,” he said.

Who Is Muhammad Yunus?

Muhammad Yunus, born on 28 June 1940, is a Bangladeshi entrepreneur, banker, and economist, who is currently interim leader of Bangladesh. Yunus was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for founding the Grameen Bank and pioneering the concepts of microcredit and microfinance.

Yunus has received several other national and international honours, including from the USA. He received the United States Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009, and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2010.

Yunus is one of just seven individuals who have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, the United States Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the United States Congressional Gold Medal.

Yunus, 84, was administered the oath of office by President Mohammed Shahabuddin at a ceremony at the presidential palace 'Bangabhaban'. A 16-member council of advisers was announced to assist Yunus in running the state's affairs. Md. Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud, two key organisers of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement, were also part of the advisory council.

Signalling the beginning of a new era after 15 years of Sheikh Hasina's regime, Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus took oath as the head of the interim government in Bangladesh on Thursday.

""I will uphold, support and protect the constitution and will perform my duties sincerely,"" Yunus said at the swearing-in event.

The 84-year-old, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for pioneering microcredit and microfinance, which he put into action through the Grameen Bank, was sworn in hours after he returned to Dhaka from Paris, where he had been undergoing medical treatment.

The oath was administered by President Mohammed Shahabuddin at his official residence, Bangabhaban.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended his best wishes to Yunus and said India is hoping for an early return to normalcy in Bangladesh, which would also ensure the safety of Hindus and other minorities.

""My best wishes to Professor Muhammad Yunus on the assumption of his new responsibilities. We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities. India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfill the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development,"" PM Modi wrote on X.

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took the oath of office as head of Bangladesh’s interim government Thursday after an uprising prompted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to step down and flee to India.

The key tasks for Yunus now are restoring peace in Bangladesh and preparing for new elections following weeks of violence in which student activists led an uprising against what was considered Hasina’s increasingly autocratic 15-year rule.

Bangladesh’s figurehead President Mohammed Shahabuddin administered the oath to Yunus for his role as chief advisor, which is the equivalent to a prime minister, in presence of foreign diplomats, civil society members, top businessmen and members of the former opposition party at the presidential palace in Dhaka. No representatives of Hasina's party were present.

Sixteen other people have been included in the interim Cabinet with members drawn mainly from civil society and including two of the student protest leaders. The Cabinet members were chosen in discussions this week among student leaders, civil society representatives and the military.

Hasina quit on Monday after several chaotic weeks that began in July with protests against a quota system for government jobs that critics said favored people with connections to Hasina’s party. But the demonstrations soon grew into a bigger challenge for Hasina’s 15-year rule, as more than 300 people including students were killed amid spiraling violence.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent his best wishes to Yunus in a statement on social media platform X, and alluded to reports that Hindus in Muslim-majority Bangladesh had been targeted during the country's unrest in recent days.

“We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities,” Modi said. “India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfill the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development.”

Yunus, who was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his work developing microcredit markets, was in the French capital for the 2024 Olympics when he was chosen for the interim role, and returned home earlier Thursday to tight security at the airport in Dhaka.

In his first comments after his arrival, he told a news briefing that his priority would be to restore order. “Bangladesh is a family. We have to unite it,” Yunus said, flanked by student leaders. “It has immense possibility.”

On Wednesday in Paris, Yunus had called for calm and an end to all partisan violence.

Hasina’s son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, who acts as an adviser to his mother, vowed Wednesday that his family and the Awami League party would continue to be engaged in Bangladesh’s politics — a reversal from what he’d said earlier in the week after Hasina stepped down Monday and fled to India.

The president had dissolved Parliament on Tuesday, clearing the path for the interim administration.

On Wednesday, a tribunal in Dhaka acquitted Yunus in a labor law violation case involving a telecommunication company he founded, in which he was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail. He had been released on bail in the case.

Yunus has been a longtime opponent of Hasina, who had called him a “bloodsucker” allegedly for using force to extract loan repayments from rural poor, mainly women. Yunus has denied the allegations.

The chaos on Bangladesh's streets continued after Hasina’s resignation on Monday. Dozens of police officers were killed, prompting police to stop working across the country. They threatened not to return unless their safety is ensured. The looting of firearms also was reported in local media.

The unrest began in mid-July with protests over the quota system, but grew into a broader challenge over an administration that was marked by human rights abuses, corruption, allegations of rigged elections and a brutal crackdown on opponents.

Joy, Hasina’s son, said in a social media post on Wednesday that his family would return to politics despite what he said have been attacks on the Awami League party over the past week. Many observers see Joy as Hasina’s successor in a dynastic political culture that dominates the South Asian nation’s politics.

“If we want to build a new Bangladesh, it is not possible without the Awami League,” he said. “The Awami League is the oldest, democratic, and largest party in Bangladesh.""

Overnight into Thursday, residents across Dhaka carried sticks, iron rods and sharp weapons to guard their neighborhoods amid reports of robberies. Communities used loudspeakers in mosques to alert people that robberies were occurring, and police remained off duty. The military shared hotline numbers for people seeking help.

The quick move to select Yunus came when Hasina’s resignation created a power vacuum and left the future unclear for Bangladesh, which has a history of military rule, messy politics and myriad crises.

Many fear that Hasina’s departure could trigger even more instability in the densely populated nation of some 170 million people, which is already dealing with high unemployment, corruption and a complex strategic relationship with India, China and the United States.

Hasina, 76, was elected to a fourth consecutive term in January, in an election boycotted by her main opponents. Thousands of opposition members were jailed before the vote, and the U.S. and U.K. denounced the result as not credible.

Lester B Pearson (1897-1972)

Pearson was the Canadian prime minister from 1963 to 1968, and a leader of the Liberal Party. Despite running a minority government, he introduced a national pension plan, a family assistance program, broadened old-age security benefits, and laid the groundwork for universal healthcare in Canada. Pearson won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1957, for his role in resolving the Suez Crisis.

On July 26, 1956, Egypt President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalised the Suez canal, which had till then been under the French and British-owned Suez Canal Company. Given the canal’s strategic importance as a connection between Europe and Asia, Nasser’s decision sparked international tensions, with Britain, France, and Israel eventually launching a military response to secure the canal.

A career diplomat, Pearson was Canada’s foreign minister and headed the country’s delegation to the United Nations when the crisis broke out. Initially, he worked towards a diplomatic solution to resolve the issue, but after hostilities commenced in October, he came up with the idea of the UN’s first large-scale peacekeeping force. After US pressure forced a ceasefire in November, Pearson’s solution allowed the aggressors to withdraw their forces appearing to have been defeated. Pearson’s Nobel selection committee credited him for “saving the world”."

Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus was sworned-in as the chief adviser of the interim Bangladeshi government on Thursday.

Bangladesh was thrown into a turmoil after massive protests by students forced Sheikh Hasina to resign as the Prime Minister and flee the country. She is currently in India.

There was widespread demand by protesters and student leaders to make Yunus the figurehead of the government.

On Thursday, Yunus promised to deliver a government which assures safety to its citizens.

The Nobel laureate earlier returned to the protest-torn Bangladesh from Paris to take oath. Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman, senior officials, student leaders and civil society members welcomed him at the airport.

At an emotional press conference at the airport, Yunus expressed gratitude to the youth who made the protest movement against Hasina successful. ""The nation is in your hands now. Now you have to rebuild it as per your aspirations. You have to use your creativity to build the country. You have earned independence for the country,"" he said."

Yunus takes Bangladesh's charge after Hasina's ouster.

President administers oath of office to Yunus and 13 advisers.

Whatever path students show us, we will move ahead with it: Yunus

DHAKA: Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus has taken charge of Bangladesh's caretaker government, with hopes of healing the country convulsed by weeks of violence that forced ex-prime minister Sheikh Hasina to resign and flee to neighbouring India.



Known as the ""banker to the poor"", Yunus is the pioneer of the global microcredit movement. The Grameen Bank he founded won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for helping lift millions from poverty by providing tiny loans to the rural poor who are too impoverished to gain attention from traditional banks.

As chief adviser of the caretaker government, he is, however, tasked with bringing stability back to the country which witnessed some of its worst violence in decades and then hold fresh parliamentary elections.

""The country has the possibility of becoming a very beautiful nation,"" Yunus earlier told reporters when he arrived in Dhaka following medical treatment in Paris, after protesters backed him for the role in a caretaker set up.

The student protesters had saved the country, he said, adding: ""Whatever path our students show us, we will move ahead with that.""

A harsh critic of Hasina, Yunus became emotional and seemed to hold his tears back as he referred to a student he said had been shot during the protests and that sacrifice could not be forgotten.

""Now again we have to rise up. To the government officials here and defence chiefs — we are a family, we should move ahead together,"" he said.

Hasina's flight from the country she ruled for 20 of the last 30 years after winning a fourth term in January triggered jubilation and violence as crowds stormed and ransacked her official residence.

Many Hindu homes, temples and businesses were vandalised after Hasina's departure, and hundreds in the minority community have tried unsuccessfully to flee to India this week. The Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council said a school teacher was killed and 45 other people hurt.

Many Hindus have traditionally supported Hasina's Awami League party, which identifies as secular.

Power vacuum

Yunus' swearing-in plugged the power vacuum in the South Asian country of 170 million people with the fourth-largest Muslim population in the world, created after Hasina resigned and flew to India on Monday.

President Mohammed Shahabuddin administered the oath of office to Yunus and 13 advisers who will help him govern, at a brief ceremony in the official presidential residence.

Three more advisers will be sworn in at a later date, officials said. Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud, two student leaders who are both in their mid-20s and led the protests, were among the 13 who joined the caretaker government.

The ceremony started with a minute's silence as a mark of respect to the hundreds who were killed in the protests and clashes that erupted in July.

The army played a critical role towards the end of the crisis, conveying to Hasina that troops would not open fire on civilians to enforce a curfew declared on Sunday, sealing her fate, Reuters reported.

Hasina's Awami League party does not figure in the interim government. In a Facebook post, her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy said the party had not given up, and was ready to hold talks with opponents and the interim government.

The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) boycotted two national elections after the arrest of its leaders and has demanded fresh elections in three months.

Protect Hindus, urges India

Hasina is sheltering in the New Delhi area, a development that Yunus said caused anger at India among some Bangladeshis. India's foreign ministry said it had no update on Hasina's travel plans and it was up to her to ""take things forward"".

The neighbours have longstanding cultural and business ties.

India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Yunus and said New Delhi was committed to working with Dhaka to fulfill the ""shared aspirations"" of the people of both countries for ""peace, security and development"".

""We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities,"" he said.

The student-led movement that ousted Hasina grew out of protests against quotas in government jobs that spiralled in July, provoking a violent crackdown that drew global criticism, though the government denied using excessive force.

The protests were fuelled also by harsh economic conditions and political repression. The COVID-19 pandemic damaged the $450 billion economy after years of strong growth, leading to high inflation, unemployment and shrinking reserves.

It pushed the Hasina-led government to seek a $4.7 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund."

Muhammad Yunus takes oath as head of Bangladesh’s interim government.,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/dr-muhammad-yunus-the-poors-banker-who-fought-hasina/article68501449.ece,"Filling the leadership vacuum in Bangladesh, albeit temporarily, Nobel Laureate and economist Muhammad Yunus has taken oath as head of the interim government. The 84-year-old microfinance pioneer will head the government until fresh polls are held. The parliament has already been dissolved by the nation’s president Mohammed Shahabuddin.

“If action is needed in Bangladesh, for my country and for the courage of my people, then I will take it,” Mr.Yunus said on Tuesday, a day after Ms. Hasina resigned and left the country. He was called on by student coordinators of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement to head the interim government.

Banker to the poor

“In Dr. Yunus, we trust,” wrote Asif Mahmud, a key leader of the Students Against Discrimination (SAD) group, in a Facebook post, echoing the widespread acceptability Mr. Yunus has in Bangladesh’s fractious polity.

Born on June 28, 1940, in Chittagong, East Bengal (now Bangladesh), Muhammad Yunus, the third of nine children, completed his primary education at Lamabazar Primary School and then studied at the Chittagong Collegiate School. After completing both a B.A. and an M.A. in Economics from Dhaka University, he started his teaching career as a lecturer in the same university in 1961. Obtaining a PhD in economics from Vanderbilt University, Dr. Yunus began his tenure as an assistant professor of economics at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro, U.S., in 1969.

As war ravaged his homeland, as it struggled for liberation from Pakistan, Dr. Yunus lobbied the U.S. Congress to stop military aid to Pakistan. He also helped raise support for the Liberation movement by running a Bangladesh Information Center in Washington D.C, and a Citizen’s Committee in Nashville, Tenessee, along with publishing the Bangladesh Newsletter.

With the birth of Bangladesh, he returned home, joining the Economics Department of the University of Chittagong in 1972. As the newly-separated Bangladesh suffered a famine in 1974, he forayed into rural economics, introducing the Nabajug Tebhaga Khamar to study economic aspects of poverty, and urged his students to lend a hand to farmers in fields. In his visits to farming households in Chittagong’s Jobra region, he realised the necessity and effectiveness of small loans to women bamboo furniture makers, freeing them from claws of loan sharks. Initiating the first ‘small loan’, Dr. Yunus lent $27 to 42 families in Jobra to manufacture their items for sale.

This idea gave rise to microfinance in 1976, where Dr. Yunus offered himself as the guarantor and secured a credit line from Janata Bank to lend small loans to Jobra residents. In 1983, the Grameen Bank was established, specialising in small loans and playing a pivotal role in eradicating poverty via micro-credit requiring no collateral. Over 100 nations, including India, have replicated this model. As of 2024, Grameen Bank has 2,568 branches across 81,678 villages with 10.61 million borrowers.

Dr. Yunus’ pioneering work in microfinance won him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for lending a social conscience to capitalism and “their efforts to create economic and social development from below” in Bangladesh. However, it also attracted legal trouble in Bangladesh.

Brief political foray

Ahead of the 2006 polls, the Bangladesh National Party (BNP) and Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League (AL) failed to agree on a candidate to head the caretaker government, leading to the imposition of a state of emergency in Bangladesh. With both Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina incarcerated by the military-backed government on extortion charges, Mr. Yunus announced that he would contest in the next polls by forming the Nagorik Shakti party in February 2007. However, he dropped the plans within months due to lack of public support.

Clash with Hasina government

On coming to power in 2009, Ms. Hasina’s government began scrutinising Mr. Yunus and Grameen Bank. In 2011, he was removed as managing director of the microlending bank, as he had passed the retirement age of 60. While he challenged his ouster, he lost the court battle accusing Ms. Hasina of targetting him. On multiple occasions, Ms. Hasina has accused Mr. Yunus for influencing the World Bank, which cancelled a $1.2 billion credit for the Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project in 2012 – a charge which he has refuted. Over 150 cases have been filed against Mr. Yunus by the Hasina government as of 2023.

The micro-financing model itself came under the scanner after Mr. Yunus admitted that some organisations may have abused the system for profit. The lack of collateral in such loans have attracted high interest rates by some banks, leading to borrowers falling into more debt. In 2019, an arrest warrant was issued against Mr. Yunus for three alleged breaches under the Labour Act.

In May 2023, Bangladesh’s Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) accused Mr. Yunus and several others of misusing the workers’ welfare fund of Grameen Bank and regularising 101 staff members. After a lengthy trial, Mr. Yunus and his colleagues were convicted in January this year, mere days after Ms. Hasina began her fourth consecutive term as Prime minister.

“We have incurred the annoyance of someone because of chasing the three zero dream (zero poverty, zero unemployment and zero net carbon emissions),” said Dr. Yunus after his conviction, as thousands pleaded with the then-PM to pardon him.

Within six months, chaos and violence was unleashed in Bangladesh due to anti-quota protests, leading to a stringent crackdown by police. As student protestors sought one single demand – the resignation of Sheikh Hasina, the 78-year-old politician fled to India, ending her 15-year reign. Now Ms. Hasina, whose government sought to incarcerate him, is out of power and out of the country, while Mr. Yunus is heading an interim government, tasked with overseeing an orderly political transition."

Bangladesh’s military chief said Wednesday that an interim government headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus would be sworn in on Thursday night as he returns from Paris to take over the administration and try to restore stability in the country, after an uprising forced former prime minister Sheikh Hasina to step down and flee to neighboring India.

Gen. Waker-Uz-Zaman said in a televised address late Wednesday afternoon that the responsible for the violence since Hasina's resignation would be brought to justice.

The military chief, flanked by the chiefs of navy and air force, said that he spoke to Yunus and would receive him at the airport on Thursday.

Zaman said he was hopeful that Yunus would take the situation to a “beautiful democratic” process.

Speaking to reporters in Paris, Yunus said “I’m looking forward to going back home and seeing what’s happening there, and how we can organize ourselves to get out of the trouble that we are in.″

Asked when elections would be held, he put his hands up as if to indicate it was too early to say. ″I’ll go and talk to them. I’m just fresh in this whole area.″

Earlier on Wednesday, ailing opposition leader and former prime minister Khaleda Zia urged all not to follow the path of destruction in Bangladesh as she addressed her supporters from a hospital bed at a rally in Dhaka. It was her first public speech since 2018, when she was convicted of corruption charges and jailed.

“No destruction, no anger, and no revenge, we need love and peace to rebuild our country,” she said using a video link.

“I have been released now. I want to thank the brave people who were in a do-or-die struggle to make possible the impossible,” she said. “This victory brings us a new possibility to come back from the debris of plunder, corruption and ill-politics. We need to reform this country as a prosperous one.”

The development came as Bangladesh was preparing to form an interim government after a mass uprising that left hundreds of people dead and hundreds of others injured.

The student leaders, who organized the weeks of mass protests, said they would unveil a full list of the new Cabinet on Wednesday. The streets of Bangladesh were calm after reports of violence against supporters of Hasina, police and minority communities which followed soon after she fled to India.

The rally by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party came a day after her release from house arrest, amid a new political environment in the country.

Zia’s freedom is largely symbolic as the ailing leader has been staying outside the prison under an executive order of the former government but was not allowed to travel abroad. Her son and the acting head of the party, Tarique Rahman also addressed the crowd online from London, where he has been living in exile since 2008.

Rahman faces several criminal cases and was convicted of corruption and a grenade attack, charges dismissed by supporters as politically motivated.

Zia, who ruled the country from 2001 to 2006, was convicted on corruption charges in 2018 and sentenced to 17 years in prison. Her party said the charges were designed to keep her away from politics.

Bangladesh's President Mohammed Shahabuddin, a symbolic figure who is acting as the chief executive now under the constitution, dissolved Parliament on Tuesday, clearing the path for an interim administration that is expected to schedule new elections but it's not clear when those elections will take place.

Shahabuddin named Yunus as the head of an interim government, in consultation with the army and student leaders. He has been a longtime opponent of Hasina.

An economist and banker, Yunus was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his work developing microcredit markets. He has been hailed for bringing thousands out of poverty through Grameen Bank, which he founded in 1983, and which makes small loans to businesspeople who wouldn’t qualify for regular bank loans.

In his first statement since he was named as the head of an interim government, Yunus on Wednesday congratulated the students for “taking the lead in making our Second Victory Day possible.” He also appealed to them, members of political parties and other people to stay calm.

Referring to acts of violence that happened after Hasina's resignation, Yunus said, “Violence is our enemy. Please don’t create more enemies. Be calm and get ready to build the country.""

On Wednesday, the streets of Dhaka, the capital, were calm two days after violence gripped the country amid Hasina’s sudden departure. The students were seen cleaning streets and managing traffic in parts of Dhaka as police including traffic police disappeared amid violent attacks on police stations in Dhaka and elsewhere in the country.

The looting of the firearms was also reported in local media. Reports of robberies in parts of Dhaka came in the absence of police.

The Bangladesh Police Association went on strike after police stations and security officials were attacked across the country Monday. The association said “many” officers had been killed but gave no number.

Violence in days surrounding Hasina’s resignation killed at least 109 people — including 14 police officers, and left hundreds of others injured, according to media reports, which could not be independently confirmed. Reports said more attacks took place across the country also on Tuesday.

In the southwestern district of Satkhira, 596 prisoners and detainees escaped from a jail after an attack on the facility Monday evening, the United News of Bangladesh agency reported.

Many of the homes of the ministers and MPs for the ruling party were looted, torched or vandalized. People were seen on social media taking valuables from the home of Hasina’s younger sister in Dhaka’s Gulshan area. Four separate neighbors told The Associated Press that the lootings took place at her home.

Elsewhere in Dhaka, charred bodies were recovered from a museum, which was used by Hasina’s father before he was assassinated along with most of his family in 1975, media reports said.

Local media also reported that many of the dead in two days of violence since her resignation included ruling party officials, mostly outside Dhaka. Those details could not be independently confirmed.

There are growing fears among the country’s Hindu minority, which has been targeted in the past during political unrest and which has long been seen as pro-Hasina, that they could again face attacks. Local reports of violence against Hindu leaders and other minorities could not be confirmed.

In one case in Dhaka, the home of a popular Hindu musician was attacked and some 3,000 musical instruments were destroyed by the attackers, the family said.

Opposition politicians have publicly called on people not to attack minority groups, while student leaders asked supporters to guard Hindu temples and other places of worship.

The unrest began in July with protests against a quota system for government jobs, which critics said favored people with connections to her party. But they soon grew into a broader challenge to Hasina’s 15-year rule, which was marked by human rights abuses, corruption, allegations of rigged elections and a brutal crackdown on her opponents. More than 300 people died in just a few weeks.

The quick move to choose Yunus came after Hasina’s resignation created a power vacuum and left the future unclear for Bangladesh, which has a history of military rule, messy politics and myriad crises.

The military wields significant influence in a country that has seen more than 20 coups or coup attempts since its independence from Pakistan in 1971. Military chief Gen. Waker-uz-Zaman said Monday he had taken temporary control while a new government is formed.

Many fear that Hasina’s departure could trigger even more instability in the densely populated nation of some 170 million people, which is already dealing with high unemployment, corruption and climate change.

Hasina, 76, was elected to a fourth consecutive term in January, an election boycotted by her main opponents. Thousands of opposition members were jailed before the vote, and the United States and the United Kingdom denounced the result as not credible.

Muhammad Yunus takes oath as head of Bangladesh’s interim government.,https://theprint.in/world/bangladesh-muhammad-yunus-takes-oath-as-head-of-interim-government/2215084/,"Dhaka [Bangladesh], August 8 (ANI): Nobel laureate economist Muhammad Yunus has been sworn in as the head of Bangladesh’s interim government, three days after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was forced to quit and flee the country amid massive unrest in the country , Al Jazeera reported.

The country has been marred with violence after protests, led majorly by students demanding an end to a quota system for government jobs, took the shape of anti-government protests.

The key tasks for Yunus will now be to restore peace in Bangladesh and prepare for the new elections.

Bangladesh’s figurehead President Mohammed Shahabuddin administered the oath to Yunus for his role as chief advisor, which is the equivalent to a prime minister, as per Al Jazeera.

The ceremony was held in the presence of foreign diplomats, civil society members, top businessmen and members of the former opposition party at the presidential palace in Dhaka.

However, no representatives of Sheikh Hasina’s party, Awami League were present.

Muhammad Yunus is a Bangladeshi social entrepreneur and founder of Grameen Bank, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his efforts to create economic and social development through microcredit.

Upon arriving in Bangladesh earlier in the day, the Nobel laureate made a heartfelt appeal to his supporters and urged the people of Bangladesh to maintain calm and end chaos, stressing that it is the “first responsibility” to ensure that no attack is carried out against anyone in the country, Daily Star reported.

He further stressed that Bangladesh has tremendous potential but the first priority is to save the country from chaos so that the country can proceed on the “path shown by students.”

“If you have faith in me and trust me, then ensure that there will be no attack anywhere in the country. This is our first responsibility,” Yunus told a crowded press briefing at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport upon his arrival on Thursday.

“What I would like to stress first is to save the country from chaos. Save the country from violence so that we can move forward on the path that the students have shown us,” he added.

Bangladesh is facing a fluid political situation with Sheikh Hasina, tendering her resignation from her post on August 5 in the wake of mounting protests. The protests, led majorly by students demanding an end to a quota system for government jobs, took the shape of anti-government protests.

Following her fleeing from the country, the situation in Bangladesh has been volatile, with reports showing Awami League offices, members and people of minority communities being targeted by extremist groups. Several cases of killings and arson have also been reported. (ANI)

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Bangladesh’s incoming interim leader Muhammad Yunus appealed for calm Wednesday and urged all parties to help the country rebuild after weeks of violence that killed hundreds and prompted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign and flee to India.

Yunus, a Nobel peace laureate, was in Paris for the Olympics when he was named interim leader following talks among military officials, civic leaders and the student activists who led the uprising against a prime minister seen as increasingly autocratic. Yunus made his first public comments in the French capital Wednesday before boarding a plane to return home.

He congratulated the student protesters, saying they had made “our second Victory Day possible,” and appealed to them and other stakeholders to remain peaceful, while condemning any violence since Hasina’s resignation Monday.

“Violence is our enemy. Please don’t create more enemies. Be calm and get ready to build the country,” Yunus said.

Bangladesh’s military chief, Gen. Waker-Uz-Zaman said in a televised address that Yunus would be sworn in Thursday night and that he expected him to usher in a “beautiful democratic” process. The military leader said that those responsible for violence since Hasina’s resignation would be brought to justice.

Yunus, who was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his work developing microcredit markets, told reporters in Paris: “I’m looking forward to going back home and seeing what’s happening there, and how we can organize ourselves to get out of the trouble that we are in.″

Asked when elections would be held, he put his hands up as if to indicate it was too early to say. ″I’ll go and talk to them. I’m just fresh in this whole area.″

A tribunal in Dhaka earlier on Wednesday acquitted Yunus in a labor law violation case, involving a telecommunication company he founded, in which he was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail. He had been released on bail in the case.

Ailing opposition leader and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia also urged calm on Wednesday, a day after the country’s figurehead president ordered her release from house arrest.

Zia urged her supporters not to follow a path of destruction, in an address at a rally via video link from her hospital bed. It was her first public speech since 2018, when she was convicted of corruption charges and jailed.

“No destruction, no anger, and no revenge, we need love and peace to rebuild our country,” she told members of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party.

Zia’s son and the acting head of the party, Tarique Rahman also addressed the crowd online from London, where he has been living in exile since 2008. Rahman faces several criminal cases and was convicted of corruption and a grenade attack, charges dismissed by supporters as politically motivated.

Zia, who ruled the country from 2001 to 2006, had been sentenced in 2018 to 17 years in prison. Her party said the case was aimed at keeipng her away from politics. Hasina’s then-government denied the allegation.

On Wednesday, the capital Dhaka was calm two days after violence gripped the country amid Hasina’s sudden departure. Students activists cleaned streets and managed traffic in parts of Dhaka, after police went on strike earlier in the week following violent attacks on police stations.

The country’s newly appointed police chief, Mainul Islam, ordered officers to return to work by Thursday evening.

Bangladesh’s President Mohammed Shahabuddin, a symbolic figure temporarily acting as the chief executive under the constitution, asked security officials on Wednesday to take stern action against any troublemakers.

The president had dissolved Parliament on Tuesday, clearing the path for an interim administration that is expected to schedule new elections, but it’s not clear when they will take place.

Shahabuddin named Yunus as the head of an interim government in consultation with the army, student leaders and other stakeholders. Yunus, an economist and banker, has been a longtime opponent of Hasina, who had called him a “bloodsucker” allegedly for using force to extract loan repayments from rural poor, mainly women. Yunus has denied the allegations.

Violence in days surrounding Hasina’s resignation killed at least 109 people — including 14 police officers, and left hundreds of others injured, according to media reports, which could not be independently confirmed. Reports said more attacks took place across the country also on Tuesday. The looting of firearms also was reported in local media.

Local media also reported that ruling party officials were among the dead in this week’s violence, mostly outside Dhaka. There also were reports of violence against the Hindu community and other minorities, triggering condemnation from Human Rights Watch. Details of that violence could not be independently confirmed.

The military, which took temporary control until the interim government could be sworn in, wields significant influence in a country that has seen more than 20 coups or coup attempts since its independence from Pakistan in 1971.

Many fear that Hasina’s departure could trigger even more instability in the densely populated nation of some 170 million people, which is already dealing with high unemployment, corruption and a complex strategic relationship with India, China and the United States.

Hasina, 76, was elected to a fourth consecutive term in January, in an election boycotted by her main opponents. Thousands of opposition members were jailed before the vote, and the U.S. and U.K. denounced the result as not credible.

Muhammad Yunus takes oath as head of Bangladesh’s interim government.,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/nobel-winner-yunus-sworn-lead-bangladesh-interim-government-4536441,"DHAKA: Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus was sworn into office Thursday (Aug 8), vowing to lead Bangladesh back to democracy after a student-led uprising ended the 15-year rule of Sheikh Hasina.



Yunus, who earlier on Thursday had hailed the overthrow of Hasina as Bangladesh's ""second independence"", swore to ""uphold, support and protect the constitution"", in front of political and civil society leaders, generals and diplomats at the presidential palace.



""Today is a glorious day for us,"" Yunus, 84, told reporters hours earlier when he returned to Dhaka from Europe.



""Bangladesh has created a new victory day. Bangladesh has got a second independence.""



Yunus called for the restoration of order after weeks of violence that left at least 455 people dead, calling on citizens to guard each other, including minorities who came under attack.



""Law and order is our first task ... We cannot take a step forward unless we fix the law and order situation,"" he said.



""My call to the people is if you have trust in me, then make sure there will be no attacks against anyone, anywhere in the country.""

The position is equivalent to the prime minister. The oath was administered by President Mohammed Shahabuddin.

On Monday, Sheikh Hasina resigned as the country’s prime minister and fled to India amid widespread protests against her Awami League-led government.

Bangladesh Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman had announced the formation of an interim government on Monday. Organisers of the student protests had proposed to appoint Yunus as the head of the interim government.

Yunus, 84, accepted the proposal and arrived in capital Dhaka on Thursday from Paris. He was welcomed by Waker-Uz-Zaman, the student protest leaders and senior officials, among others.

At a press conference at the airport, Yunus expressed gratitude to the country’s youth who made the agitation against Hasina successful, PTI reported.

Yunus said that the collapse of Hasina’s government was the country’s “second independence”.

“We have got independence for the second time,” he said. “We have to protect this independence.”

Yunus, an entrepreneur and economist, said that the priority of the interim government will be to restore law and order and stop attacks against minority communities, Prothom Alo reported.

“It is our duty to protect all,” he was quoted as saying. “Everyone is our brother and sister. Disorder is our big enemy.”

The country has reported incidents of violence ahead of the formation of an interim government.

Dhaka: Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus on Thursday took oath as the head of Bangladesh 's interim government. He was administered the oath by President Mohammed Shahabuddin at a ceremony at the presidential palace 'Bangabhaban'. Yunus was sworn in as the chief advisor, a position equivalent to prime minister.

A 16-member council of advisers was announced to assist Yunus in running the state's affairs. Md. Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud, two key organisers of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement, were also part of the advisory council.

Muhammad Yunus was appointed as the head of the interim government after the Bangladesh President dissolved Parliament on Tuesday following Sheikh Hasina's ouster. The interim government will lead the country for a certain period and oversee the election to transition power to an elected government.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned from her post on Monday and fled the country in a military helicopter amid growing pressure from the anti-quota protestors and the country's army. Yunus, a harsh critic of Hasina, is known as the 'banker to the poor' and was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for founding a bank that pioneered fighting poverty with small loans to needy borrowers.

Following his appointment, Muhammad Yunus promised to deliver a government which assures safety to its citizens and urged them to assist him in rebuilding Bangladesh. Yunus was in Paris for the Olympic Games as an advisor and returned to Bangladesh via Dubai on Thursday afternoon.

An Emirates flight (EK-582) carrying Yunus landed at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport at 2:10 pm local time. Yunus was welcomed by Bangladesh Army Chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman, senior officials and student leaders.

Bangladesh witnessed deadly unrest in recent weeks. Over 500 people, including police personnel, were killed in the violence centring the students' movement. After Hasina's resignation, the leaders of the student movement proposed the name of Muhammad Yunus as the chief advisor of the interim government. Yunus congratulated the ""brave students"" who took the lead in making, what he said, ""our Second Victory Day possible""."

Mr. Modi’s message came soon after Dr Yunus took oath to office in Dhaka which has been without a steady government since Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled the country in a dramatic turn of events on Sunday (August 4, 2024). The Ministry of External Affairs on Thursday informed that officials are in touch with the post-Hasina administration to ensure safety for remaining officials in its missions and citizens who are scattered across Bangladesh, said a senior official on Thursday.

‘Protect all citizens’

“My best wishes to Professor Mohammad Yunus on the assumption of his new responsibilities. We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities. India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfil the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development,” said Prime Minister Modi in a message to Prof Yunus. Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge and the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi also congratulated Prof Yunus.

Expressing cautious optimism for the newly appointed government led by Dr. Mohammad Yunus, Randhir Jaiswal, Official Spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs said the wishes of the people of Bangladesh are paramount and took note of the attacks on the minority communities reminding Dhaka that it is the task of “every government” of Bangladesh to protect all its citizens.

“India has taken note of the steps by various groups in Bangladesh for protection of minorities in Bangladesh but remains deeply concerned about the situation. Every government is responsible for the well being of its citizens,” Mr. Jaiswal.

Evacuating Indians

Concerns about attacks against workers of the Awami League, led by the deposed Bangladeshi PM, as well as against various minority communities were raised at the MEA’s media interaction, which also dealt with the lack of security for the Indian High Commission and the Assistant High Commissions that are now left with a skeletal staff after all ‘non-essential staff’ were evacuated by a commercial flight on Wednesday (August 7, 2024).

The official briefing came two-three days after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina left the capital Dhaka and was flown to Hindon airbase near here. Ever since the High Commission of India in Dhaka has been operating emergency helpline services to evacuate Indian nationals who want to leave in view of the unstable situation, including some Indians working on various projects. Sources said that it was necessary to evacuate some Indian personnel across the land border as “some of these situations were life threatening”. Some of those evacuated were working with IRCON Khulna, L&T, RITES, Tata Projects, Afcons, and Transrail Sirajganj.

Mr. Jaiswal further confirmed the visa service in the Indian High Commission is currently paused in view of the prevailing situation and expressed hope that the newly appointed government led by Prof. Mohammed Yunus will act on containing the law and order situation fast.

Hasina’s asylum plans

One of the major issues since Sunday’s dramatic developments in Dhaka has been the evacuation of Ms. Hasina into India which is expected to become an issue as the new government under Prof. Yunus took charge on Thursday. Ms Hasina had lodged several cases against Dr. Yunus that were quashed ultimately.

The Hindu had earlier reported that Ms. Hasina had been trying to obtain asylum in the United Kingdom, even as speculation continued about the duration of her stay in India. Mr. Jaiswal declined to comment about how many days Ms. Hasina would spend in the country, maintaining that “it is for her to take things forward.”

External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar had earlier informed both the houses of the Parliament that Ms. Hasina had requested “approval to come for the moment to India.” Mr. Jaishankar spoke with his UK counterpart David Lammy on Thursday (August 8, 2024), when he discussed the tense situation emerging between Iran and Israel as well as the political instability in Bangladesh. Authorities declined to comment on whether the issue of granting political asylum to Ms. Hasina featured in the telephone conversation.

Unable to meet daughter

Ms. Hasina’s daughter Saima Wazed — who is the Delhi-based regional director of the World Health Organisation for southeast Asia — said that she was “heartbroken” with the developments back home, and because she could not meet her mother. Indicating that any meeting would be detrimental to her mother’s security, she said, “I don’t want to compromise her whereabouts in any way.”

India has remained cautious about the swearing-in of the new interim government and Mr. Jaiswal indicated that officials of the Indian High Commission were expected to be among the foreign diplomats witnessing the event."

President Mohammed Shahabuddin administered the oath to him at the Durbar Hall of Bangabhaban.



Prof Yunus took charge of the interim government after Sheikh Hasina resigned as prime minister and fled the country on Aug 5 following widespread protests against her regime.



Yunus, 84, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his pioneering work in microcredit, was appointed as the head of the interim government after President Shahabuddin dissolved parliament on Tuesday.



Later, the President also administered the oath of office to the 13 advisers through a function held at his official residence.



However, three advisors were unable to take the oath as they are currently outside the capital, Dhaka, Daily Sun reported.



Advisers of the interim government are former governor of Bangladesh Bank Dr Salehuddin Ahmed; Prof of Dhaka University Law Department Dr Asif Nazrul; rights activist Adilur Rahman Khan; former attorney general AF Hassan Arif; former foreign secretary M Touhid Hossain; Chief Executive of the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (BELA) Syeda Rizwana Hasan; Chief Executive Officer of Brotee and freedom fighter Sharmeen Murshid; Faruq-e-Azam, Bir Protik, former Election Commissioner Brig Gen (retd) M Sakhawat Hossain; chairman of Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Board (CHTDB) Supradip Chakma; Director cum Professor, Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health & Hospital Prof Dr Bidhan Ranjan Roy; Hefazat-e-Islam’s Nayeb-e-Ameer and Islami Andolan Bangladesh adviser A F M Khalid Hossain; women’s rights activist Farida Akhter; Grameen Telecom trustee Nurjahan Begum; student coordinators M Nahid Islam; Asif Mahmud Sajeeb Bhuiyan.



Among them, Prof Dr Bidhan Ranjan Roy, Faruq-e-Azam and Supradip Chakma could not attend the swearing-in ceremony as they are outside Dhaka. They will take the oath of office later, said the Cabinet Secretary.



Chiefs of the Bangladesh Army, Navy and Air Force, BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, senior BNP leader Dr Moyeen Khan, Jatiya Party Chief GM Quader and other political leaders except of the Awami League, civil society members and journalists, among others, were present at the swearing-in ceremony that began with the national anthem at just after 9 pm.



A one-minute silence was observed as tribute to those who died during the anti-discrimination students’ movement.



Cabinet Secretary Md Mahbub Hossain conducted the ceremony.



Right after landing in Dhaka amidst a warm welcome, surrounded by students, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus on Thursday said restoring law and order in the country would be his first task.



“If you have faith in me, if you have confidence in me, make sure nobody will be attacked. That would be our first task. If I cannot do this, if you don’t listen to me, I don’t need to be here. You must demonstrate that you are listening to me. Rescue the country from disorder and violence,” said Yunus.



He referred to the attacks, violence, destruction of properties, including attacks on minorities, and said these are part of a conspiracy. He said their job is to protect everyone.



“Violence and disorder are the biggest enemies towards progress. It is the biggest enemy of our journey that has just begun. Restoring law and order is our priority. Until law and order are restored, we cannot take steps to proceed,” he said.



Yunus said the revolution through which Bangladesh created a “second Victory Day” should be kept in front and strengthened while moving forward.



“This freedom has to reach every home, otherwise this freedom has no meaning; being free means change for everyone,” Yunus said.



He said the interim government’s job is to carry out what the people have achieved. “People do not trust the government, seeing it as an instrument of repression—something to be manipulated. The government cannot be like this, it must be something that will make people’s hearts swell and be a place of trust.”



Talking about attackers, he said, “Let these enemies understand, hand them over to law, they have to be punished—not beaten. You have to bring that trust.”



Army Chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman, Air Chief Marshal Hasan Mahmood Khan and Chief of Naval Staff Admiral M Nazmul Hassan welcomed Yunus upon his arrival at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport.



Before leaving Paris, where he had been attending the Olympics, Yunus appealed for calm in Bangladesh amid tensions over the country’s future.



Yunus was named as interim leader following talks among military officials, civic leaders and the student activists who led the uprising against Sheikh Hasina.



The Nobel laureate known as the “banker to the poor” urged the people of the country to get ready to build the country, shunning any violence which he considers as an enemy.



“This is our beautiful country with lots of exciting possibilities. We must protect and make it a wonderful country for us and for our future generations,” he said in a statement on Wednesday, a day before his arrival in Dhaka.



Yunus appealed for calm and urged all parties to help the country rebuild after weeks of violence that killed over 300 people and prompted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign and flee to India.

No leader from the Awami League was spotted at the oath-taking ceremony. Diplomats from China, Iran, Argentina, Japan, UK, UAE, Qatar, and The Netherlands were present at the ceremony, The Daily Star reported.

The two key organisers of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement, which eventually led to Sheikh Hasina's ouster, Md. Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud, are also part of the advisory council.

Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (Bela) Chief Executive Syeda Rizwana Hasan, women's rights activist Farida Akhtar, right-wing party Hefazat-e-Islam's deputy chief AFM Khalid Hossain, chairman of Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Board Supradip Chakma, Grameen Telecom trustee Nurjahan Begum, freedom fighter Sharmeen Murshid, Prof Bidhan Ranjan Roy, and former foreign secretary Touhid Hossain are also among Yunu's advisory council members.

The 84-year-old professor had flown in from Paris to Dhaka on Thursday to be sworn-in as the interim government's head, which had to be formed following the resignation of former PM Sheikh Hasina amid massive protests against her government. Hasina fled Bangladesh after tendering her resignation."
Muhammad Yunus takes oath as head of Bangladesh’s interim government.,https://www.etvbharat.com/en/!international/nobel-laureate-muhammad-yunus-takes-oath-as-head-of-bangladeshs-interim-government-enn24080807392,"Dhaka: Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took the oath of office as head of Bangladesh’s interim government Thursday after an uprising prompted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to step down and flee to India.

The key tasks for Yunus now are restoring peace in Bangladesh and preparing for new elections following weeks of violence in which student activists led an uprising against what was considered Hasina’s increasingly autocratic 15-year rule. Bangladesh’s figurehead President Mohammed Shahabuddin administered the oath to Yunus for his role as chief advisor, which is the equivalent to a prime minister, in the presence of foreign diplomats, civil society members, top businessmen and members of the former opposition party at the presidential palace in Dhaka.

No representatives of Hasina's party were present. Sixteen other people have been included in the interim Cabinet with members drawn mainly from civil society and including two of the student protest leaders. The Cabinet members Yunus as interim leader were chosen in discussions this week among student leaders, civil society representatives and the military.

Hasina quit on Monday after several chaotic weeks that began in July with protests against a quota system for government jobs that critics said favored people with connections to Hasina’s party. But the demonstrations soon grew into a bigger challenge for Hasina’s 15-year rule as more than 300 people including students were killed amid spiralling violence.

Yunus, who was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his work developing microcredit markets, was in the French capital for the 2024 Olympics when he was chosen for the interim role, and returned home earlier Thursday to tight security at the airport in Dhaka. In his first comments after his arrival, he told a news briefing that his priority would be to restore order. “Bangladesh is a family. We have to unite it,” Yunus said, flanked by student leaders. “It has immense possibility.”

On Wednesday in Paris, Yunus had called for calm and an end to all partisan violence. Hasina’s son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, who acts as an adviser to his mother, vowed Wednesday that his family and the Awami League party would continue to be engaged in Bangladesh’s politics — a reversal from what he’d said earlier in the week after Hasina stepped down Monday and fled to India. The president had dissolved Parliament on Tuesday, clearing the path for the interim administration.

On Wednesday, a tribunal in Dhaka acquitted Yunus in a labour law violation case involving a telecommunication company he founded, in which he was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail. He had been released on bail in the case. Yunus has been a longtime opponent of Hasina, who had called him a “bloodsucker” allegedly for using force to extract loan repayments from rural poor, mainly women. Yunus has denied the allegations. The chaos on Bangladesh's streets continued after Hasina’s resignation on Monday.

Dozens of police officers were killed, prompting police to stop working across the country. They threatened not to return unless their safety was ensured. The looting of firearms also was reported in local media. The unrest began in mid-July with protests over the quota system but grew into a broader challenge over an administration that was marked by human rights abuses, corruption, allegations of rigged elections and a brutal crackdown on her opponents."

“I will uphold, support and protect the constitution,” Yunus said during the swearing-in ceremony, adding that he would perform his duties “sincerely”.

Yunus took the oath at the presidential palace in the capital Dhaka in front of political leaders, civil society leaders, generals and diplomats.

More than a dozen members of his cabinet, who are titled advisers, not ministers, also took the oath.

They included top leaders of the Students Against Discrimination group that led the weeks-long protests, Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud.

Others included Touhid Hossain, a former foreign secretary, and Hassan Ariff, a former attorney general.

Syeda Rizwana Hasan, an award-winning environmental lawyer, and Asif Nazrul, a top law professor and writer, also were sworn in.

Adilur Rahman Khan, a prominent human rights activist who was sentenced to two years in jail by Hasina’s government, also took the oath as an adviser.

Almost unimaginable

Yunus touched down in Dhaka on a flight from Paris via Dubai shortly after 2pm (0800 GMT). The prospect of Yunus standing alongside military leaders was almost unimaginable a week ago, when security forces were shooting dead protesters who had taken to the streets demanding that Hasina resign.

But the military on the weekend turned on Hasina, and she was forced to flee to neighbouring India as millions of Bangladeshis celebrated her demise.

The military then agreed to students' demands that Yunus, who won the Nobel in 2006 for his pioneering microfinancing work, lead an interim government.

""I'm looking forward to going back home, see what's happening and how we can organise ourselves to get out of the trouble we are in,"" Yunus told reporters in Paris' airport on Wednesday.

Yunus had travelled abroad this year while on bail after being sentenced to six months in jail on a charge condemned as politically motivated, and which a Dhaka court on Wednesday acquitted him of.

""Be calm and get ready to build the country,"" Yunus said Wednesday in a statement before beginning his journey back home.

""If we take the path of violence everything will be destroyed.""

Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman said Wednesday that he hoped to swear in the interim government on Thursday evening and that he backed Yunus.

""I am certain that he will be able to take us through a beautiful democratic process,"" Waker said.

Yunus said he wanted to hold elections ""within a few"" months.

Beautiful way

Few other details about the planned government have been released, including the role of the military.

But Bangladeshis voiced hope as they joined a rally in Dhaka on Wednesday of the former opposition Bangladesh National Party.

""I expect that a national government will be formed with everyone's consent in a beautiful way,"" Moynul Islam Pintu told AFP.

""I expect that the country is run in a nice way, and the police force is reformed so that they can't harass people.""

Hasina, 76, who had been in power since 2009, quit on Monday as hundreds of thousands of people flooded the streets of Dhaka.

Jubilant crowds later stormed and looted her palace.

Monday's events were the culmination of more than a month of unrest, which began as protests against a plan for quotas in government jobs but morphed into an anti-Hasina movement.

Hasina, who was accused of rigging January elections and widespread human rights abuses, deployed security forces to quash the protests.

At least 455 people were killed in the unrest, according to an AFP tally based on police, government officials and hospital doctors.

Military move

The military's switching of allegiances was the decisive factor in her demise.

It has since acceded to a range of other demands from the student leaders.

The president dissolved parliament on Tuesday, a key demand of the students and the BNP.

The head of the police force, which protesters have blamed for leading Hasina's crackdown, was sacked on Tuesday.

The new chief, Md. Mainul Islam, offered an apology on Wednesday for the conduct of officers and vowed a ""fair and impartial investigation"" into the killings of ""students, common people and the police"".

Ex-prime minister and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, 78, was also released from years of house arrest, while some political prisoners were freed.

The military has demoted some generals seen as close to Hasina and sacked Ziaul Ahsan, a commander of the feared Rapid Action Battalion paramilitary force.

Police said mobs had launched revenge attacks on Hasina's allies and their own officers, and also freed more than 500 inmates from a prison.

Protesters broke into parliament and torched TV stations. Others smashed statues of Hasina's father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's independence hero."

Muhammad Yunus First Statement on Minorities Being Attack in Bangladesh

Nobel laureate Yunus took oath as head of an interim government in Bangladesh. Yunus, 84, was administered the oath of office by President Mohammed Shahabud."
Muhammad Yunus takes oath as head of Bangladesh’s interim government.,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/change-in-bangladesh-the-challenges-for-india/article68502224.ece,"With events in Bangladesh unfolding at a rapid pace, this writer recalls the events of February 2009 when (now former) Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina faced a major crisis within two months of her taking over. The mutiny of the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR), a paramilitary force, where the rebels took over the BDR’s headquarters in Dhaka, left 74 dead, out of whom 57 were army officers.

The unrest spread to 12 other towns and cities and posed a direct threat to the fledgling democratically elected government of Sheikh Hasina.

Indian Foreign Secretary Shivshankar Menon was called back from Colombo by the then External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee, where this writer was also present, being the Head of Division for Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and the Maldives. We took the only available flight, late at night, to Mumbai and then to Delhi to reach early the next morning. Within two hours, the Foreign Secretary began meeting Ambassadors of important countries to convey India’s concern about the unfolding crisis and seeking their understanding in case the situation got worse.

The mutiny failed. It was bound to fail since Ms. Hasina had just come to power riding on “clean” elections with huge backing from women and youth, and without the army’s interference. But in the 15 years of her tenure, all this seems to have been squandered.

A growing disconnect

The recent elections in 2024 were least inclusive with the Opposition’s boycott, dwindling democratic space, an erosion of human rights, a severe economic downturn and, even more significantly, high levels of unemployment among the youth — a segment of support which had earlier benefited from the sustained economic growth under Ms. Hasina. And when the students’ protests broke out, led by the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement, the fact that it was handled in a ham-handed manner — almost as if they were the enemies of the state, and which saw the use of violence — sealed Ms. Hasina’s fate.

Factoring in public opinion, challenges

However, Bangladesh Army chief, General Waker-uz-Zaman, has stepped into a situation that is quite different from what existed when Gen. Moeen U. Ahmed took over in 2007 in a coup. In 2007, one needed the army to bring the anarchy and the violence that was unleashed by both the major political parties under control, restore governance and facilitate elections. The situation demanded a strong man at the top. In 2024, the army is seen more as facilitating the will of the people by driving out a beleaguered Prime Minister and restoring the democratic process. This has also made the army more vulnerable and, therefore, more responsive to public opinion.

Editorial | From hope to despair: On Bangladesh after Sheikh Hasina

A sign of this vulnerability is the acceptance of the students’ choice of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus as the head of the interim government. Normally, coup leaders nominate lacklustre technocrats to run the country under their tight supervision, and not accept a popular leader who commands widespread respect, internally and externally. But then, the army’s vulnerability may well be the silver lining which Bangladesh is looking for. Mr. Yunus is seen as a passionate supporter of democratic values and the rule of law. He is a known Hasina-baiter, on account of how she treated him. While he did nurse political ambitions and wanted to start his own political party, he is not seen to be close to the two main parties, the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Could this be the springboard he needs to launch a third force in Bangladesh?

However, selecting the interim government is not the only task right now. There is an equally serious issue — of the students’ agitation being hijacked by those suppressed under the earlier regime or who had boycotted the elections or supported from outside the country. They include not only the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the opposition but also the banned Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami which had unleashed Islamic jihadist violence in 2006-07. Violence against Awami League sympathisers and their properties continue, symbols of Bangladesh liberation including the statues of Sheikh Mujibur Rehman are being demolished, and the Hindu minority community is under attack. Accommodating such polarised forces in the interim government will weaken both Mr. Yunus and the army and, inevitably, give a fillip to anti-India forces. Will a weak army leadership be able to control these forces?

While India was the first country to flag “contemporary forms of religiophobia against non-Abrahamic religions” in the United Nations Security Council in 2021 and in the UN General Assembly in 2022, it has demurred, raising this more forcefully with its neighbours and the West, apart from the usual expression of concern. Recent events in Bangladesh have shown, yet again, that if India does not, nobody will.

Mirroring Myanmar and the Maldives

The situation in Bangladesh is akin to events unfolding in Myanmar rather than Sri Lanka. After three consecutive elections in Myanmar, the coup leaders are finding it difficult to retain control over the people and ethnic groups and may well collapse sooner rather than later. After four consecutive elections in Bangladesh, where peoples’ democratic aspirations have been raised, the military will find its role considerably circumscribed.

For India, the situation seems similar to what happened in the Maldives where it, inter alia, propped up President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih without building bridges to the other side and facing a backlash when the opposition came to power.

What is in its favour though, whether in the Maldives or Afghanistan or Sri Lanka, or now in Bangladesh, is the strong development partnership and projects it has built for the benefit of their peoples. India’s best bet is to work closely with Mr. Yunus and the army, and with the people.

Muhammad Yunus takes oath as head of Bangladesh’s interim government.,https://www.thenationalnews.com/news/asia/2024/08/08/muhammad-yunus-bangladesh/,"Muhammad Yunus was sworn in on Thursday as the head of Bangladesh’s interim government, days after the country's longest-serving prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s administration was ousted following protests in which more than 450 people died.

Dr Yunus, 84, is a social reformer, economist and the founder of Grameen Bank, which grants small loans mostly to poor farmers and for which he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006.

He was appointed during a meeting of President Mohammed Shahabuddin, military leaders and the heads of the Students Against Discrimination group after parliament was dissolved following Ms Hasina's departure.

Army Chief Gen Waker-Uz-Zaman, former bureaucrats and Nahid Islam, the key co-ordinator of the student movement, were among those present at the swearing-in.

The oath-taking ceremony took place amid reports of violence against allies of the deposed 76-year-old leader, who has taken refuge in India following her dramatic escape from the official residence in Dhaka, as tens of thousands of protesters stormed the fortified palace in the Bangladeshi capital.

Dr Yunus arrived in Dhaka from Paris on Thursday and was received by Gen Waker and members of the student protest groups, along with his supporters.

“Bangladesh has got a second independence,” Dr Yunis told reporters at the airport, flanked by the army chief and student leaders.

He reiterated his call for peace and an end to violence amid reports of attacks on the members of the previous regime and minorities, including the Hindus and members of Ms Hasina's Awami League party.

At least 29 bodies of the leaders of her party and their family members were found across Bangladesh on Tuesday.

“If you have trust in me, then make sure there will be no attacks against anyone, anywhere in the country,” Dr Yunis said.

“Every person is our brother … our task is to protect them,” he said, adding that “the whole of Bangladesh is one big family”.

New future

Dr Yunus’s appointment has brought a sense of jubilation and optimism in a country that commentators and rights groups say was marred by systematic corruption, inflation, unemployment and human rights violations under the authoritarian rule of Ms Hasina, who was the world’s longest-serving female head of a government.

The daughter of the founding father and first prime minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who led its fight for independence from Pakistan in 1971, Ms Hasina came to power in a landslide victory in 2009.

She won again with a thumping majority in 2014. However, in the past decade, she emerged as an authoritarian who fought elections without an opposition.

She was accused of human rights violations, clampdowns on free speech and suppression of dissent.

She jailed thousands of leaders from opposition parties, writers, activists and intellectuals, or anyone who expressed dissent.

Her exit came after thousands of people stormed her residence in Dhaka following mass protests against government job quotas.

Dr Yunus had a fractious relationship with Ms Hasina, who accused him of “sucking blood from the poor”.

He too was slapped with over 100 charges and was convicted in a labour laws case but was acquitted by a court on Wednesday after he was appointed to lead the government.

“He is not only a Nobel laureate, but also because of his international acceptance and the acceptance he has received by the civilians and the elites of Bangladesh … he's one of the best people for this job,” Dr Ishrat Hossain, a Bangladeshi researcher on politics and international relations at Oxford University, told The National.

WHY AAYAN IS 'PERFECT EXAMPLE' David White might be new to the country, but he has clearly already built up an affinity with the place.



After the UAE shocked Pakistan in the semi-final of the Under 19 Asia Cup last month, White was hugged on the field by Aayan Khan, the team’s captain.



White suggests that was more a sign of Aayan’s amiability than anything else. But he believes the young all-rounder, who was part of the winning Gulf Giants team last year, is just the sort of player the country should be seeking to produce via the ILT20.



“He is a delightful young man,” White said. “He played in the competition last year at 17, and look at his development from there till now, and where he is representing the UAE.



“He was influential in the U19 team which beat Pakistan. He is the perfect example of what we are all trying to achieve here.



“It is about the development of players who are going to represent the UAE and go on to help make UAE a force in world cricket.”

Muhammad Yunus takes oath as head of Bangladesh’s interim government.,https://thesun.my/world/nobel-laureate-yunus-makes-emotional-return-to-bangladesh-to-lead-caretaker-government-AI12836226,"DHAKA: Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus made an emotional return home to Bangladesh on Thursday to lead a new interim government after weeks of student protests forced Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign and flee to neighbouring India.

A harsh critic of Hasina, Yunus, 84, arrived in Dhaka following medical treatment in Paris after protesters backed him for the role in a caretaker government tasked with holding elections for a new leader.

“The country has the possibility of becoming a very beautiful nation,“ Yunus told reporters at the airport, where he was greeted by senior military officers and student leaders.

The student protesters had saved the country, he said, adding: “Whatever path our students show us, we will move ahead with that.”

Yunus became emotional, choked and seemed to hold his tears back as he referred to a student he said had been shot during the protests and that sacrifice could not be forgotten.

“Now again we have to rise up. To the government officials here and defence chiefs - we are a family, we should move ahead together,“ he said.

The economist, known as the “banker to the poor”, received the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for founding a bank that pioneered the fight against poverty through small loans to needy borrowers.

Yunus is set to be sworn in as chief of a team of advisers at 1430 GMT at the official residence of President Mohammed Shahabuddin.

Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud, two student leaders who are both in their mid-20s and led the protests, will join the caretaker government, local media reported.

Hasina’s Awami League party does not figure in the interim government after she resigned on Monday following weeks of violence that killed about 300 people and injured thousands.

In a Facebook post, her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy said the party had not given up, however, and was ready to hold talks with opponents and the interim government.

“I had said my family will no longer be involved in politics but the way our party leaders and workers are being attacked, we cannot give up,“ he said on Wednesday.

INDIA CONCERNED ABOUT PEACE IN BANGLADESH

Hasina’s flight from the country she ruled for 20 of the last 30 years after winning a fourth straight term in January, triggered jubilation and violence as crowds stormed and ransacked her official residence.

She is sheltering in the New Delhi area, a development that Yunus said caused anger at India among some Bangladeshis.

The neighbours have longstanding cultural and business ties and New Delhi played a key role in the 1971 war with Pakistan which led to the creation of Bangladesh.

India’s foreign ministry said it had no update on Hasina’s travel plans and it was upto her to “take things forward”.

Indian media has reported that Hasina, who has good relations with New Delhi, may travel to Britain. Reuters could not confirm her plans and Britain has declined to comment.

Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said British Foreign Secretary David Lammy called him on Thursday and the two discussed the situation in Bangladesh, but he did not elaborate.

Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said the interests of the people of Bangladesh was “foremost in our mind” and stability there was crucial for peace in the region.

Hundreds of Bangladeshi Hindus have tried unsuccessfully to flee to India this week after many homes and businesses of the minority community were vandalised after Hasina’s departure.

The student-led movement that ousted Hasina grew out of protests against quotas in government jobs that spiralled in July, provoking a violent crackdown that drew global criticism, though the government denied using excessive force.

The protests were fuelled also by harsh economic conditions and political repression in the country.

The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) boycotted two national elections after the arrest of its leaders, while the COVID-19 pandemic damaged the $450 billion economy after years of strong growth, leading to high inflation, unemployment and shrinking reserves.

It pushed the Hasina government to seek a $4.7 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund.

Hasina’s arch rival and BNP leader Khaleda Zia, 78, called for calm and an end to violence in a video address from her hospital bed to hundreds of supporters at a rally on Wednesday after her release from house arrest.

“No destruction, revenge or vengeance,“ she said as the BNP demanded elections in three months.

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Bangladesh’s incoming interim leader Muhammad Yunus appealed for calm Wednesday and urged all parties to help the country rebuild after weeks of violence that killed hundreds and prompted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign and flee to India.

Yunus, a Nobel peace laureate, was in Paris for the Olympics when he was named interim leader following talks among military officials, civic leaders and the student activists who led the uprising against a prime minister seen as increasingly autocratic. Yunus made his first public comments in the French capital Wednesday before boarding a plane to return home.

He congratulated the student protesters, saying they had made “our second Victory Day possible,” and appealed to them and other stakeholders to remain peaceful, while condemning any violence since Hasina’s resignation Monday.

“Violence is our enemy. Please don’t create more enemies. Be calm and get ready to build the country,” Yunus said.

Bangladesh’s military chief, Gen. Waker-Uz-Zaman said in a televised address that Yunus would be sworn in Thursday night and that he expected him to usher in a “beautiful democratic” process. The military leader said that those responsible for violence since Hasina’s resignation would be brought to justice.

Yunus, who was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his work developing microcredit markets, told reporters in Paris: “I’m looking forward to going back home and seeing what’s happening there, and how we can organize ourselves to get out of the trouble that we are in.″

Asked when elections would be held, he put his hands up as if to indicate it was too early to say. ″I’ll go and talk to them. I’m just fresh in this whole area.″

A tribunal in Dhaka earlier on Wednesday acquitted Yunus in a labor law violation case, involving a telecommunication company he founded, in which he was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail. He had been released on bail in the case.

Ailing opposition leader and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia also urged calm on Wednesday, a day after the country’s figurehead president ordered her release from house arrest.

Zia urged her supporters not to follow a path of destruction, in an address at a rally via video link from her hospital bed. It was her first public speech since 2018, when she was convicted of corruption charges and jailed.

“No destruction, no anger, and no revenge, we need love and peace to rebuild our country,” she told members of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party.

Zia’s son and the acting head of the party, Tarique Rahman also addressed the crowd online from London, where he has been living in exile since 2008. Rahman faces several criminal cases and was convicted of corruption and a grenade attack, charges dismissed by supporters as politically motivated.

Zia, who ruled the country from 2001 to 2006, had been sentenced in 2018 to 17 years in prison. Her party said the case was aimed at keeipng her away from politics. Hasina’s then-government denied the allegation.

On Wednesday, the capital Dhaka was calm two days after violence gripped the country amid Hasina’s sudden departure. Students activists cleaned streets and managed traffic in parts of Dhaka, after police went on strike earlier in the week following violent attacks on police stations.

The country’s newly appointed police chief, Mainul Islam, ordered officers to return to work by Thursday evening.

Bangladesh’s President Mohammed Shahabuddin, a symbolic figure temporarily acting as the chief executive under the constitution, asked security officials on Wednesday to take stern action against any troublemakers.

The president had dissolved Parliament on Tuesday, clearing the path for an interim administration that is expected to schedule new elections, but it’s not clear when they will take place.

Shahabuddin named Yunus as the head of an interim government in consultation with the army, student leaders and other stakeholders. Yunus, an economist and banker, has been a longtime opponent of Hasina, who had called him a “bloodsucker” allegedly for using force to extract loan repayments from rural poor, mainly women. Yunus has denied the allegations.

Violence in days surrounding Hasina’s resignation killed at least 109 people — including 14 police officers, and left hundreds of others injured, according to media reports, which could not be independently confirmed. Reports said more attacks took place across the country also on Tuesday. The looting of firearms also was reported in local media.

In the southwestern district of Satkhira, 596 prisoners and detainees escaped from a jail after an attack on the facility Monday evening, the United News of Bangladesh agency reported.

Homes of former ministers and MPs belonging to Hasina’s party were looted, torched or vandalized. People were seen on social media taking valuables from the home of Hasina’s younger sister in Dhaka’s Gulshan area. Four separate neighbors confirmed the looting in comments to The Associated Press.

Local media also reported that ruling party officials were among the dead in this week’s violence, mostly outside Dhaka. There also were reports of violence against the Hindu community and other minorities, triggering condemnation from Human Rights Watch. Details of that violence could not be independently confirmed.

Opposition politicians have publicly called on people not to attack minority groups, while student leaders asked supporters to guard Hindu temples and other places of worship.

The unrest began in July with protests against a quota system for government jobs, which critics said favored people with connections to Hasina’s party. But they soon grew into a broader challenge to Hasina’s 15-year rule, which was marked by human rights abuses, corruption, allegations of rigged elections and a brutal crackdown on her opponents. More than 300 people died in just a few weeks.

The quick move to choose Yunus came when Hasina’s resignation created a power vacuum and left the future unclear for Bangladesh, which has a history of military rule, messy politics and myriad crises.

The military, which took temporary control until the interim government could be sworn in, wields significant influence in a country that has seen more than 20 coups or coup attempts since its independence from Pakistan in 1971.

Many fear that Hasina’s departure could trigger even more instability in the densely populated nation of some 170 million people, which is already dealing with high unemployment, corruption and a complex strategic relationship with India, China and the United States.

Hasina, 76, was elected to a fourth consecutive term in January, in an election boycotted by her main opponents. Thousands of opposition members were jailed before the vote, and the U.S. and U.K. denounced the result as not credible.

Muhammad Yunus takes oath as head of Bangladesh’s interim government.,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/modi-congratulates-muhammad-yunus-oath-chief-adviser-bangladesh-interim-government-9503388/,"As Nobel laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus was sworn in as the head of the interim government in Bangladesh Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended his best wishes to Yunus and urged him to ensure “the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities” who have come under attack following the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on August 5.

This direct reference to the safety of Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh underlines Delhi’s expectations from the new players in Dhaka.

In a post on X, Modi said, “My best wishes to Professor Muhammad Yunus on the assumption of his new responsibilities. We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities.”

“India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfil the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development,” he said.

Yunus, 84, returned to Dhaka Thursday afternoon and was received at the airport by Bangladesh Army chief General Waker-uz-Zaman. Yunus called for an end to attacks, saying his task is to restore law and order.

Earlier in the day, Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs, said, “Regarding attacks and minorities’ situation, this particular issue was also addressed by External Affairs Minister (S Jaishankar) in his suo motu statement (in Parliament). We are also monitoring the situation… with regard to the status of minorities. There are also reports that various initiatives have been taken by groups and organisations to ensure the protection and well-being of the minorities. I would like to reiterate what the External Affairs Minister had said in Parliament. We welcome these steps but will naturally remain deeply concerned till law and order is visibly restored.”

“We also want to make it clear that it is the responsibility of every government to ensure the well-being of all its citizens. We hope for early restoration of law and order in Bangladesh. This is both in the interest of the country itself and for the region as a whole or the larger region as a whole,” Jaiswal said.

He said “the aspirations and interests of the people there are foremost for us, for both India and its people. We will work with this objective in mind.”

Responding to a question on the possible involvement of foreign powers and governments, the MEA spokesperson said, “We are closely analysing all aspects of recent developments in Bangladesh.”

He said India is in touch with authorities in Bangladesh to ensure the safety and security of Indian missions, the personnel working there and Indians residing in that country.

The Indian High Commission has temporarily suspended visa operations until the law and order situation improves.

It is learnt that the Indian High Commission, in coordination with Bangladesh Army and authorities, has facilitated safe passage of Indian nationals to the border. The Indian mission has advised on transport and movement issues and also coordinated with airport and airlines for flights, and the mission control room has attended to over 350 calls in the past two days.

It has also facilitated movement of Indian nationals including project personnel across the land borders. Some of these situations were life-threatening. They facilitated travel of members of IRCON Khulna, L&T, RITES, Tata Projects, Afcons and Transrail Sirajganj via land borders.

On Thursday, three days after the ousted Sheikh Hasina reached India with plans to travel to the UK that have since run into a technical roadblock, Jaishankar discussed the unfolding situation in Bangladesh with British Foreign Secretary David Lammy.

In a post on X, Jaishankar said he “received a call” from Lammy and they “discussed the situation in Bangladesh and West Asia”.

Advertisement

The phone call between Jaishankar and Lammy took place amid the complication regarding Hasina’s plan to seek asylum in the UK.

Hasina was planning to travel to London. Her sister Sheikh Rehana’s daughter Tulip Siddiq is a member of the British Parliament. Tulip is Economic Secretary to the Treasury and Labour MP for Hampstead and Highgate.

The “technical” challenge emanates from UK’s Immigration rules which have no provision for someone to be allowed to travel to the country to seek asylum or temporary refuge.

It is not possible to apply for asylum from outside the UK. Once in the UK, a person can seek asylum. But since she doesn’t have a valid visa – she doesn’t have a diplomatic or an official passport anymore – Hasina needs a visa to enter the UK, and then seek asylum.

Once an asylum request is made, each asylum claim is carefully considered on its individual merits on a case-by-case basis.

Hasina wants to seek asylum or temporary refuge as she wants protection from political persecution. She fears she will be called in as part of investigations against her by the rivals in the new government in Dhaka.

For the time being, her best bet is that she stays in India where she is “safe”.

Asked when Hasina would leave India, MEA spokesperson Jaiswal said: “We don’t have an update on her plans. It is for her to take things forward. As far as other members that you talked about, of course they have their own…They are responsible for themselves and I also again don’t have an update on their plans. It is for them to take forward what they think is in their best interest.”"

Following his appointment, Yunus had promised to deliver a government to assure the safety of its citizens and urged them to assist him in rebuilding Bangladesh. Yunus was in Paris for the Olympic Games as an advisor and returned to Bangladesh via Dubai on Thursday afternoon.

Sheikh Hasina resigned from the PM's post on Monday and fled the country in a military helicopter amid growing pressure from the anti-quota protestors and the country's army. Hasina laded at India's Hindon Airbase on Monday evening.

The protests, which started last month initially with a demand to end the quota system that reserved 30 per cent of government jobs for the families of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence against Pakistan, later turned into anti-government demonstrations."

The interim government has been tasked with holding fresh elections in Bangladesh, a country home to 170 million people.

The 84-year-old economist received the backing for the role from student protesters and returned to Dhaka on Thursday from Paris, where he was undergoing medical treatment.

""The country has the possibility of becoming a very beautiful nation. Whatever path our students show us, we will move ahead with that"", Yunus told reporters at the airport.

In his speech, after being received by protesting students, Yunus said that the country has the possibility of becoming a very beautiful nation.

The student protesters had saved the country and that freedom had to be protected, he said, adding that he will move ahead with whatever path the students would show.

""We had ended those possibilities, now again we have to rise up. To the government officials here and defence chiefs - we are a family, we should move ahead together,"" the economist said.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Muhammad Yunus for his appointment as the chief advisor of Bangladesh's interim government.

Yunus, known as the ""banker to the poor"", received the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for founding a bank that pioneered the fight against poverty through small loans to needy borrowers.

Meanwhile, the mystery around Sheikh Hasina, who resigned as the ousted Bangladesh Prime Minister and escaped to India with her sister, prevails as she hides at an unspecified location. The Indian government is working on securing asylum for the Awami League Party chief in a European nation, sources told India Today TV.

The student-led movement that ousted Hasina stemmed out of protests against quotas in government jobs that spiralled in July, provoking a violent crackdown that drew global criticism, although the government denied using excessive force.

The protests were fuelled, also, by harsh economic conditions like low wages and growing unemployment in the country.

toggle caption Joan Mateu/AP

BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Police launched a manhunt in Barcelona on Thursday for ex-Catalonia leader and fugitive Carles Puigdemont, a celebrated campaigner for Catalan independence who made a sensational return to Spain and an equally sensational getaway from a speech in the city with the alleged help of local police officers.

The events took place nearly seven years after Puigdemont fled Spain after a failed independence bid, with an outstanding arrest warrant pending against him.

Puigdemont had previously announced his intention to be in Spain on a day that Catalonia's parliament is due to swear in a new president. The 61-year-old initially lived in Belgium after bolting from Spain in 2017, but his latest place of residence wasn't known.

Puigdemont kept his travel plans secret before setting out to the wealthy Catalan region in northeastern Spain. He gave a speech in front of a large crowd of supporters in central Barcelona under the noses of police officers, who made no attempt to detain him.

After his speech, in a cloak-and-dagger moment, Puigdemont went into an adjacent marquee tent. There, he hurried out of an exit and jumped into a waiting car that sped away, according to an Associated Press photographer who witnessed his departure.

Catalan police arrested two of their own officers on the suspicion of aiding Puigdemont's getaway, suspecting the former leader of Catalonia used the private car of one of them, the force's press office told The Associated Press. No further details were available.

About three hours after Puigdemont vanished, Catalan police — called Mossos d'Esquadra — called off traffic checks without saying why, but later said they resumed them after a couple of hours.

Officers initially held back from swooping to arrest Puigdemont out of concern the move might ""cause public disorder,"" a police statement said. Officers tried to stop the fleeing vehicle, but were unable to do so, it said, though it added that further arrests were expected. The statement didn't elaborate.

The Catalan police force operates separately from Spain's Policía Nacional. At the time of the 2017 ballot, the Spanish government suspended the Mossos' chief and placed the force under investigation for failing to stop the vote. The chief and his staff were eventually exonerated.

Authorities had set up a police cordon at the nearby regional parliament where Puigdemont was expected to go after his speech.

Once Puigdemont had slipped away, roadside police units checked vehicles across the city of around 1.6 million people in an effort to nab him. The checks snarled city traffic. Police also checked vehicles heading on highways to neighboring France.

Puigdemont faces charges of embezzlement for his part in an attempt to break Catalonia away from the rest of Spain in 2017. As regional president and separatist party leader at the time, he was a key player in the independence referendum that was outlawed by the central government but went ahead anyway.

Those events triggered a political crisis that roiled Spain for months.

Puigdemont's appearance in Barcelona, Catalonia's capital, and his game of cat-and-mouse with police, stole the show on a day when a new government was being sworn in at the regional parliament.

Local police were deployed in a security ring around a section of the park where Catalonia's parliament building is located behind walls. Meanwhile, Puigdemont, wearing a dark suit, white shirt and tie, walked with supporters to the nearby stage where he gave his speech.

Addressing the crowd in the park and at times pumping his fist, Puigdemont accused Spanish authorities of ""a crackdown"" on the Catalan separatist movement.

""For the last seven years we have been persecuted because we wanted to hear the voice of the Catalan people,"" Puigdemont said. ""They have made being Catalan into something suspicious.""

toggle caption Emilio Morenatti/AP

He added: ""All people have the right to self-determination.""

The gripping turn of events, broadcast live on Spanish television channels, was likely to bring political recriminations.

The leader of the Popular Party, the main opposition to Spain's left-of-center coalition government which has long rebuffed Catalonia's independence movement, condemned Puigdemont's return. Alberto Núñez Feijóo posted on X that Puigdemont's reappearance was an ""unbearable humiliation"" that damaged Spain's reputation.

Spain's government encouraged a deal brokered after months of deadlock between Salvador Illa's Catalan Socialist Party (PSC) and the other main Catalan separatist party and left-wing Esquerra Republicana (ERC). That deal had ensured just enough support in Catalonia's parliament for Illa to become the next regional president in a vote later Thursday.

Speaking to Catalan lawmakers before the vote, Illa called for reconciliation and respect for Spain's controversial amnesty bill. He vowed to govern for all Catalans after years of bitter divisions between those in favor of independence and those against it.

Puigdemont has dedicated his career to the goal of carving out a new country in northeast Spain — a struggle which is decades-old and has often thumbed his nose at authorities. His largely uncompromising approach has brought political conflict with other separatist parties as well as with Spain's central government.

A contentious amnesty bill, crafted by Spain's Socialist-led coalition government, could potentially clear Puigdemont and hundreds of other supporters of Catalan independence of any wrongdoing in the 2017 ballot. Spain's central government and the Constitutional Court declared at the time that the referendum was illegal.

But the bill, approved by Spain's parliament earlier this year, is being challenged by the Supreme Court, which argues the pardon doesn't apply to embezzlement, unlike other crimes that Puigdemont had previously been charged with.

Puigdemont could be placed in pretrial detention if he is arrested.

Police in Barcelona are hunting for the separatist former leader of Catalonia, Carles Puigdemont, who made a dramatic return to Spain after a seven-year exile despite facing an outstanding arrest warrant.

The Mossos d'Esquadra - Catalan police - set up roadblocks within Barcelona and leading out of the city as part of Operation Jaula - or ""cage"" - aimed at finding Mr Puigdemont, who was seen leaving a rally this morning in a car.

The operation was reportedly ended a few hours later, although Mr Puigdemont does not appear to have been located yet.

For much of the past several years he has lived in Brussels, after police indicted him on charges linked to a failed bid for Catalan independence in 2017.

At the time, Catalonia's pro-independence leaders including Mr Puigdemont organised a referendum - which was ruled illegal by Spain's constitutional court - and later declared independence for the region. Madrid imposed direct rule on the region shortly after and Mr Puigdemont fled to Belgium.

On Thursday morning, Mr Puigdemont briefly addressed hundreds of supporters who gathered near the Catalan parliament in Barcelona, shortly ahead of the expected investiture of a new head of the Catalan government.

He shouted ""Long live a free Catalonia!"" before saying he had returned ""to remind you that we are still here"".

""Holding a referendum is not and will never be a crime,"" he added.

Mr Puigdemont then disappeared.

Many were expecting him to turn up inside the parliament building in time for the investiture ceremony at 10:00 (08:00 GMT), but he was nowhere to be seen.

A Catalan police officer was detained on suspicion of helping Mr Puigdemont flee, a spokesperson for the Mossos d’Esquadra said.

The officer allegedly owns a car in which Mr Puigdemont escaped after making his address, Spanish media said.

Roadblocks were set up around Barcelona for a time on Thursday morning and Spanish TV also showed images from La Jonquera, a municipality bordering France, where police could be seen stopping cars and checking the boots.

Puigdemont ally Aleix Sarri criticised the police operation on X, saying: ""Hundreds of policemen encircle Barcelona to arrest President Puigdemont. A hunt paid with public money to please the powers in Madrid. This is not what a democracy does."""

Catalan secessionist leader Carles Puigdemont has returned to Spain after seven years of self-imposed exile and despite a pending warrant for his arrest.

He appeared before a throng of supporters in Barcelona on Thursday, pumping his fist as he climbed onto a stage surrounded by officials of his hardline party, Junts, at the Arc de Triomf monument located near the Catalan Parliament.

“I’ve come today to remind you that we’re still here,” Puigdemont told thousands of cheering supporters. “Long live Catalonia!”

Many in the crowd waved red, yellow and blue flags and chanted slogans demanding Catalonia’s secession from Spain.

Puigdemont, 61, fled Spain over his role in a failed 2017 independence bid for the wealthy region.

After his brief address, Puigdemont was set to head to the regional parliament for the investiture vote to elect a new leader, but then disappeared, prompting a frantic search by police to apprehend him.

The vote went ahead without him.

It was not immediately clear where Puigdemont was. Police set up roadblocks within Barcelona and leading out of the city, an interior department spokesperson said, according to the Reuters news agency.

A spokesperson for the regional police, known as the Mossos d’Esquadra, said one of its officers had been arrested “as part of the investigation into Puigdemont’s whereabouts”.

The officer allegedly owns the car in which Puigdemont left the scene, according to Spanish media reports.

His potential arrest and imprisonment could unleash new turmoil in Catalonia.

Two national police unions criticised the failure to arrest Puigdemont.

“Where are the Mossos? The best-paid police force in Spain incapable of doing their job, of arresting the coup-monger and fugitive from justice Puigdemont,” police union Jusapol said on X.

The building in central Barcelona housing the regional parliament was fenced off and surrounded by police.

His arrest could delay the swearing-in of a Socialist government in Catalonia and jeopardise the national government’s fragile alliance with Junts, on which it relies for legislative support.

Socialist Salvador Illa, who is backed by the left-wing secessionist ERC party after a bilateral deal last week, is expected to be voted as leader.

The Socialists hope taking control in Catalonia after a decade of secessionist rule will turn the page on the independence drive, which has been losing support in recent years.

The Socialists won the most seats in the regional election in May but failed to get a majority and the support of the ERC is crucial. If a new Catalan regional government is not formed by August 26, a new election will be held in October.

Meanwhile, far-right party Vox was set to hold a counterprotest outside Parliament. Its secretary-general, Ignacio Garriga, said on X that “we will not tolerate the humiliation of seeing a criminal and fugitive from justice enter parliament”.

The Spanish parliament passed an amnesty law in May pardoning those involved in the failed 2017 secession bid, but the Supreme Court upheld arrest warrants for Puigdemont and two others who were also charged with embezzlement, ruling that the amnesty law does not apply to them.

Puigdemont says the referendum was not illegal and so the charges linked to it have no basis.

“Things are complicated in the sense that there’s this interest in stopping him. But at the end of the day, he’s a member of parliament. He’s a former president. So if he is arrested, this would be against the immunity of the members of parliament,” Mar Aquilera Varques, a constitutional law professor at Barcelona University, told Al Jazeera.

“There are some people who are tired of this political crisis. But many people in Catalonia still want independence,” she added."

Police launched a manhunt Thursday for Carles Puigdemont -- the Catalonia leader who fled over his role in a failed 2017 independence bid -- after he returned to Spain to address supporters before vanishing into the crowd.

His party unsuccessfully requested the postponement of a vote in the regional parliament, but Salvador Illa of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's Socialists was elected as Catalonia's first head not from the pro-independence movement since 2010.

Roadblocks were set up in Barcelona and across Catalonia to find the 61-year-old, for whom there is still an arrest warrant, after he delivered a short speech to thousands gathered near the Catalan regional parliament in Barcelona.

""Long live a free Catalonia!"" he shouted after climbing onto the stage, under the watch of dozens of police officers who made no attempt to detain him.

""I have come here to remind you that we are still here,"" he said as many in the crowd waved red, yellow and blue Catalan independence flags.

He then disappeared.

Puigdemont had been expected to try to enter the parliament building for the investiture vote, which began without him.

Catalonia's regional police said it had arrested one officer who owns the car used by Puigdemont to leave the scene. It later confirmed a second officer had been detained.

In a statement, the force denied there had been ""any agreement or previous conversation"" with Puigdemont's entourage. Officers had planned to arrest him ""at the most opportune time so as not to generate public disorder"", it added.

Around 3,500 people turned out to hear Puigdemont speak, according to Barcelona city hall.

""He is a very noble person,"" Nuria Pujol, a woman in her 50s who came from the Alt Penedes region for the event, told AFP. ""The only one who believes in independence -- and has not stopped believing.""

- 'Problem with democracy' -

Police scuffled with a small group of people who tried to force their way into the regional parliament, using pepper spray to disperse them. Catalan police said they had arrested two people and filed charges against 15 others.

Puigdemont's return came just days after Spain's governing Socialists struck a deal with the moderate Catalan separatist ERC party to make Illa the next head of the Catalan regional government.

ERC is a political rival of Puigdemont's more hardline separatist JxCAT party.

The Socialists won the most seats in the Catalan regional election in May but failed to get an overall majority.

The support of the ERC was crucial to secure 68 votes in the 135-seat parliament -- the minimum required for a majority -- and avoid the prospect of a fresh election in October.

Puigdemont led the regional government in 2017, when it pushed ahead with an independence referendum despite a court ban, followed by a short-lived declaration of independence.

He fled Spain shortly after the independence bid to avoid prosecution and has since lived in Belgium and more recently France.

Spain's parliament passed an amnesty law in May for those involved in the failed secession bid, but the Supreme Court ruled on July 1 that the measure would not fully apply to Puigdemont.

""A country that has an amnesty law and does not apply it, has a problem with democracy,"" Puigdemont said in his speech.

- 'Unbearable humiliation' -

The leader of the main opposition Popular Party, Alberto Nunez Feijoo, called Puigdemont's return to Spain an ""unbearable humiliation"" that damages the country's image.

Prime Minister Sanchez agreed to the amnesty in exchange for JxCAT's crucial support in the national parliament for his fragile minority government.

The move sparked huge street protests that were organised by the right wing.

Sanchez is now facing opposition from parts of his own Socialist party as well as the right over a proposal to give Catalonia full control of taxes collected in the region.

The measure was promised to the ERC in exchange for the party's support for Illa in the investiture vote.

The proposal has for decades been one of the main demands of Catalan independence parties but critics argue it would deprive the central state of substantial revenue.

It must still be approved by Spain's national parliament.

'Problem with democracy'

Puigdemont's dramatic return came just days after Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's Socialists struck a deal with moderate Catalan separatist party ERC – which competes with Puigdemont's more hardline JxCAT – to make the Socialist candidate, Salvador Illa, the next head of the Catalan regional government.

The Socialists won the most seats in a regional election in May but failed to get a majority and the support of the ERC is crucial.

He fled Spain shortly after the independence bid to avoid prosecution and has since lived in Belgium and more recently France.

""A country that has an amnesty law and does not apply it, has a problem with democracy,"" he said in his speech.

Path to independence?

Sanchez agreed to the amnesty law in exchange for JxCAT's crucial support in Spain's parliament for his fragile minority government, sparking huge street protests that were organized by the right wing.

He is now facing opposition from parts of his own Socialist party as well as the right over a proposal to give Catalonia full control of the taxes collected in the region.

The proposal has for decades been one of the main demands of Catalan independence parties but critics argue it would deprive the central state of a substantial source of revenue.

It must still be approved by Spain's national parliament.

A similar system already exists in Spain's northern Basque Country, which also has an active independence movement.

If Illa passes Thursday's investiture vote, he will be the first head of Catalonia's regional government since 2010 who does not come from the separatist camp.

The former health minister has defended the tax agreement made with the ERC, saying it was ""favorable for all Catalans.""

""They are agreements designed to improve our finances without harming anyone and whilst respecting the principles of (fiscal) solidarity,"" he said after securing the ERC's support.

But former Socialist deputy prime minister Alfonso Guerra has said the tax agreement opens ""a path towards a federal system and the independence of Catalonia."""

President Carles Puigdemont has not been arrested. He has fulfilled his duty, he appeared at the Arc de Triomf in Barcelona, ​​he gave a speech in front of some 5000 people, and then he disappeared.

Nobody knows how, but he got into a white Honda vehicle and, after making several passes around the Parliament, where he was detected by the Mossos d'Esquadra, he disappeared.

Nobody knows how, but the vehicle in which President Puigdemont was travelling has vanished in front of a Mossos d'Esquadra force of more than 300 police officers, with a helicopter and drones activated.

The Mossos d'Esquadra had sealed off the entrances to the Parc de la Ciutadella, and one could only enter through two doors, which were completely sealed off by the Mossos. The Catalan police had predicted that when Carles Puigdemont wanted to enter the Parliament, with the president of the Parliament, Josep Rull , and the other Junts deputies, he would be intercepted, identified and arrested.

The deputies have entered the Parliament and have been checked one by one to prevent the president from entering. In addition, the vehicles entering the Parliament were inspected and their windows were lowered, but there was no sign of the president. Puigdemont's legal team, led by Gonzalo Boye, has entered the Parliament grounds, in the Parc de la Ciutadella, a fact that has made the Mossos imagine that the arrest would be imminent, but nothing. Everything was prepared, but something, which still no one can explain, has failed. The white vehicle has made another turn and they have lost sight of it.

Nerves have taken hold at the Mossos headquarters. The regional and general police commanders, who were in the Coordination Centre (CECOR) and in the same building of the Parliament, have seen that the script was not going as they had thought - that not agreed, Puigdemont's defence did not accept the president's surrender - and other resources have been activated to try to catch him. They knew what car he had used to leave the event and it was decided to activate, first in Barcelona, ​​and then throughout the country, a device reserved for serious crimes, such as shootings or murders, to find him, the so-called Jaula device, road controls at various points to close the perimeter of the city of Barcelona and be able to intercept him; so far, without luck.

With the Jaula in motion, with road controls in progress, with vehicle inspections in various parts of the country looking for a man, the nerves were growing in the top of the Mossos, who had lost the objective and who, even now, do not know where he may be. The Mossos Information Services expected the president to be inside the Parliament building, to appear when it was Junts' turn to respond to Illa, but it was the Vallense spokesman, Albert Batet, who replied to the candidate for president, and that was when it was confirmed that Puigdemont is not inside the Parliament either.

All the sources consulted by ElNacional.cat, both police and Junts, admit that they have no idea where President Puigdemont is.

He has escaped from a maximum-scale Mossos operation, with more than 300 police officers , and with controls also from the air, and right now no one knows where he is, or how he got to the Arc de Triomf.

Carles Puigdemont speaks in Barcelona (Image: AP)

The Junts deputies assure that it is not over and that not everything is yet written about this return and disappearance of President Puigdemont on this hot August 8, 2024. Within the Mossos, however, no one dares, yet, to make assessments. Something has failed and we will have to find out what.

Carles Puigdemont, 61, who had been in self-imposed exile since leaving the country in 2017, had previously said he would be in Spain on the day Catalonia's parliament was due to swear in a new president.

He arrived in Barcelona on Thursday morning, despite an outstanding arrest warrant, and headed on foot to Ciutadella Park, where he told a crowd of several thousand separatist supporters ""all people have the right to self-determination"".

He accused Spanish authorities of ""a crackdown"" on the Catalan separatist movement and said: ""For the last seven years we have been persecuted because we wanted to hear the voice of the Catalan people. They have made being Catalan into something suspicious.""

Watching police made no attempt to arrest him, perhaps planning to wait until his expected arrival at the nearby regional parliament, presumably to avoid confrontation with the crowd, some of whom clashed with officers.

But, instead of heading for the building, Mr Puigdemont went into an adjacent marquee after his speech, then dashed out and jumped into a waiting car that sped away, an Associated Press photographer who witnessed his departure, said.

Police, who had set up a cordon at the nearby regional parliament where Mr Puigdemont had been expected to go afterwards, soon realised he had slipped away.

Officers started stopping traffic and checking vehicles across the city to search for him, including some of those using highways to head to neighbouring France.

Mr Puigdemont faces charges of alleged embezzlement for his part in an attempt to break Catalonia away from the rest of Spain in 2017.

As regional president and leader of the Junts separatist party at the time, he was a key player in an independence referendum that was outlawed by the central government but went ahead anyway.

Those events triggered a political crisis that unsettled Spain for months.

The former president of Catalonia – who had been in self-imposed exile in Belgium – made a dramatic reappearance in Barcelona on Thursday morning (8 August) after seven years on the run from charges in Spain linked to the illegal independence movement of 2017.

Carles Puigdemont spoke in front of a crowd of some 3,500 followers at the doors of the Catalan parliament building before vanishing again, “Houdini-style” according to commentators, as a police operation to capture him swung into place.

His arrival back in Spain had been widely anticipated to coincide with the investiture debate of the likely new president of Catalonia, Salvador Illa of the Catalan Socialist party. Illa came first in May’s regional election but without an overall majority. In recent days he had secured the support of left-wing separatist ERC’s regional MPs in a controversial political deal in order for him to become Catalan Leader.

Puigdemont addressed supporters just before he disappeared. EFE

Puigdemont, leader of the rival main independence party to ERC in Catalonia, right-of-centre Junts per Si, won a seat in the May election despite living outside Spain. He had long promised to return as a regional MP for the investiture debate despite an arrest warrant still being active for him in Spain. The Supreme Court has said that the national government’s recent amnesty law for those involved in the illegal Catalan independence process does not apply to charges against Puigdemont for embezzlement.

How Puigdemont was going to manage to attend the investiture debate on Thursday without being arrested was the main topic of conversation nationally this week. If police had tried to hold him inside the regional parliament in Barcelona, the speaker of the parliament, who is from the same party as Puigdemont, had promised to suspend the investiture debate.

In the end, Puigdemont opted for a high-profile speech outside while police stood by before disappearing again. Police then launched an operation to find him looking for a white car in which he was believed to be travelling with others. The investiture debate to begin to choose Salvador Illa as regional president began with Puigdemont’s seat empty in the chamber.

In his five-minute speech outside earlier just after 9am and surrounded by high profile members of Catalan pro-independence movement, Puigdemont said, “We are here because we have no right to give up,"" adding in a reference to Spanish authorities. “Although we have seen the face of repressors, I have come to remind them that we are still here.”

The investiture debate inside was still continuing inside on Thursday."

Former Catalan separatist leader Carles Puigdemont defied an arrest warrant to appear at a rally in Barcelona on Thursday after seven years of self-imposed exile, before reportedly fleeing the scene with a car belonging to a regional police officer.

Amid a heavy police presence, Puigdemont had told a crowd of thousands of followers in the Catalan capital he aimed to revive the independence drive that plunged Spain into political crisis in 2017.

“They thought they’d be celebrating my arrest and they thought that this punishment would dissuade us,” he said. “Well, they are wrong.”

Authorities suspect that, when he had finished speaking, Puigdemont got into a white car belonging to a police officer and left the vicinity, a Catalan interior department spokesperson said, sparking a frantic search by authorities.

The regional police, known as the Mossos d’Esquadra, said two of its officers had been arrested as part of their investigation into Puigdemont’s whereabouts, including the owner of the car.

The separatist leader, 61, fled to Belgium seven years ago after a failed secession bid and has been living in exile ever since.

He faces an arrest warrant for alleged embezzlement related to a 2017 independence referendum ruled illegal by the Spanish courts. Puigdemont says the vote was legal and therefore the charges linked to it have no basis.

A Mossos spokesman said there was no prior arrangement with Puigdemont for his arrest and the force had decided the detention should be made “at the most appropriate time so as not to generate public disorder.”

Puigdemont ally Laura Borras described the arrested officer on X as “a patriot and exemplary Mosso.”

The hunt for Puigdemont created traffic chaos in Barcelona and near the border with France as police set up roadblocks and searched car trunks.

In Barcelona, several Puigdemont supporters clashed with police in a bid to breach the cordon surrounding the park housing the regional parliament building. Officers clad in riot gear used batons and pepper spray to deter them.

Reacting to news that Puigdemont had again absconded from under the noses of a large police deployment, a Supreme Court source said a judge had been clear in his instructions that the former Catalan president was to be arrested.

“The Mossos know that they have a detention order... they had the obligation to detain him and bring him before the courts,” the source said.

Two national police unions also criticized the failure to arrest Puigdemont.

“Where are the Mossos? The best-paid police force in Spain incapable of doing their job, of arresting the coup-monger and fugitive from justice Puigdemont,” police union Jusapol said on X.

Two sources with links to the Catalan government said it had identified a problem with some rogue Mossos, who appear to be loyal to Puigdemont.

A government spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Puigdemont´s lawyer.

His arrest could jeopardize the Socialist-led national government´s fragile alliance with Puigdemont’s Junts party, on which it relies for legislative support.

Catalonia’s parliament on Thursday afternoon confirmed Salvador Illa, an ally of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, as head of the Catalan government.

“I will govern for everyone having into account the plurality and diversity of Catalonia,” Illa said.

The Socialists hope taking control in Catalonia after a decade of separatist rule will turn the page on the independence drive.

The Spanish parliament passed an amnesty law in May pardoning those involved in the failed 2017 secession bid, but the Supreme Court upheld arrest warrants for Puigdemont and two others who were also charged with embezzlement, ruling that the amnesty law does not apply to them.

The crowd of thousands, who had gathered near the parliament to welcome him, hoped his return would help build momentum toward independence, which has lost support in recent years.

“It represents the return of a symbol,” said Xavier Vizcaino, 63, who was wrapped in an independence flag.

No-one had expected him to disappear again.

Former Barcelona Mayor Xavier Trias, who was present at the rally, marvelled at Puigdemont’s flight.

“It was magic,” he told Reuters."

On Wednesday, Puigdemont announced that he intended to be present at the investiture ceremony of the new president at the Parliament of Catalonia in Barcelona on Thursday.

This is despite the fact that an outstanding warrant for his arrest remains active.

Last year, Spain’s parliament passed an amnesty law for those charged with crimes relating to the 2017 Catalan independence referendum.

However, the country’s Supreme Court has refused to apply the law to Puigdemont.

Still, on Thursday morning Puigdemont defiantly appeared in Barcelona and was greeted by large crowds after travelling from Belgium.

Several thousand pro-independence supporters had gathered in a central park in Barcelona to welcome Puigdemont, who punched the air to rapturous applause and stated: ""Holding a referendum is not and will never be a crime.""

But Puigdemont disappeared soon after the appearance, with Spanish media reporting that police have launched an operation to locate and arrest the politician.

It is unclear how authorities would proceed if Puigdemont is arrested given the ongoing dispute about the application of the amnesty law between the Spanish parliament and the Supreme Court.

A security ring has been placed around the Parliament of Catalonia, with police reportedly searching sewers and basements ahead of the swearing in of Salvador Illa of the Socialists’ Party of Catalonia, who eventually emerged victorious after May’s elections which led to months of deadlock between Illa’s party and Esquerra Republicana."

Catalan independence leader Carles Puigdemont made a surprise appearance in Barcelona.

Police have launched a manhunt in Barcelona for ex-Catalonia leader and fugitive Carles Puigdemont, a campaigner for Catalan independence who made a sensational return to Spain and an equally sensational getaway from a speech with the alleged help of a local police officer.

The events on Thursday took place nearly seven years after Puigdemont fled Spain after a failed independence bid, with an outstanding arrest warrant pending against him.

Puigdemont had previously announced his intention to be in Spain on a day that Catalonia’s parliament is due to swear in a new president.

The 61-year-old initially lived in Belgium after bolting from Spain in 2017, but his latest place of residence was not known.

Puigdemont kept his travel plans secret before setting out to the Catalan region in northeastern Spain.

He gave a speech in front of a large crowd of supporters in central Barcelona under the noses of police officers, who made no attempt to detain him.

After his speech, in a cloak-and-dagger moment, Puigdemont went into an adjacent marquee tent, then hurried out of an exit and jumped into a waiting car that sped away, according to an Associated Press photographer who witnessed his departure.

Catalan police arrested one of their own officers on charges of aiding Puigdemont’s getaway, the force’s media office said, but gave no further details.

About three hours after Puigdemont vanished, Catalan police – who operate separately from Spain’s police – called off the manhunt without saying why.

Authorities, who may have wanted to avoid confrontation with the crowd of several thousand separatist supporters, had set up a police cordon at the nearby regional parliament where Puigdemont was expected to go afterward.

Once Puigdemont had slipped away, roadside police units checked vehicles across the city of 1.6 million people in an effort to nab him.

Puigdemont faces charges of embezzlement for his part in an attempt to break Catalonia away from the rest of Spain in 2017.

As regional president and separatist party leader, he was a key player in an independence referendum that was outlawed by the central government but went ahead anyway.

Those events triggered a political crisis that roiled Spain for months.

Puigdemont’s appearance in Barcelona, Catalonia’s capital, and his game of cat-and-mouse with police, stole the show on a day when a new government was being sworn in at the regional parliament.

Addressing the crowd, Puigdemont accused Spanish authorities of “a crackdown” on the Catalan separatist movement.

“For the last seven years we have been persecuted because we wanted to hear the voice of the Catalan people,” Puigdemont said.

“They have made being Catalan into something suspicious.

“All people have the right to self-determination.”

The gripping turn of events was likely to bring political recriminations.

The leader of the Popular Party, the main opposition to Spain’s Socialist-led coalition government that has long rebuffed Catalonia’s independence movement, condemned Puigdemont’s return.

Alberto Nunez Feijoo posted on X that Puigdemont’s reappearance was an “unbearable humiliation” that damaged Spain’s reputation.

Puigdemont has dedicated his career to the goal of carving out a new country in northeast Spain – a struggle that is decades old.

His largely uncompromising approach has brought political conflict with other separatist parties as well as with Spain’s central government.

A contentious amnesty bill could potentially clear Puigdemont and hundreds of other supporters of Catalan independence of any wrongdoing in the 2017 ballot.

Spain’s central government and the Constitutional Court declared at the time that the referendum was illegal.

But the bill, approved by Spain’s parliament earlier in 2024, is being challenged by the Supreme Court, which argues the pardon does not apply to embezzlement, unlike other crimes that Puigdemont had previously been charged with."

Residents of a frontline Israeli city feel Hezbollah’s war ‘getting closer’.,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/08/middleeast/israel-north-nahariya-lebanon-hezbollah-conflict-intl/index.html,"Nahariya, Israel CNN —

In Israel’s northern city of Nahariya, a sense of anxiety lingers among residents as they struggle to maintain daily life with the threat of war with Lebanon’s Hezbollah edging closer to their doorsteps.

The coastal city of 77,000 residents sits just 6 miles (10 kilometers) from the border with Lebanon, where the Israeli army and Hezbollah fighters have been exchanging fire for nearly 10 months.

Unlike many other communities at the Israel-Lebanon border that have become ghost towns since October, Nahariya stands out as one of the cities that has not been depopulated as it doesn’t fall within the evacuation zone.

Almost 62,000 residents of border communities have been displaced since Hezbollah and Israel started exchanging fire in October after Israel launched its war in Gaza. Forty-three Israelis have been killed and another 250 injured, according to the Israeli prime minister’s Office.

Across the border in Lebanon, at least 400 people have been killed since October 8 and more than 94,000 have been displaced, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health.

Though life continues in Nahariya, streets are less busy than usual, locals told CNN. While pedestrians and motorists are present, the atmosphere contrasts sharply with Tel Aviv 80 miles down the coast, where bars, beaches and restaurants remain bustling.

Tommy Lowenstein, 67, said the situation is “tense” in the north. “We feel it. We see it in the streets, we see less people.”

Nahariya has declared a state of emergency, according to an official at the city’s municipality. Residents can hear everything from outgoing artillery fire over the border to rockets that land nearby on a daily basis, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak to the media.

The sound of rockets that fall in nearby towns and kibbutzim (agricultural communes) are regularly heard in Nahariya.

On Tuesday, an Israeli interceptor missile malfunctioned amid a Hezbollah drone attack, causing an impact on the Route 4 highway near Nahariya. Several people were injured, according to the IDF.

While the city’s residents have been accustomed to cross-border attacks, the conflict has escalated in recent days after Israel assassinated Hezbollah’s top military commander Fu’ad Shukr on July 30.

The next day, former Palestinian prime minister and Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Tehran in an attack Iran blamed on Israel. Israel hasn’t confirmed or denied involvement.

Israel has been anticipating a retaliatory attack from Iran and its regional proxies. But two sources familiar with the intelligence told CNN on Wednesday that it looks increasingly likely that Hezbollah may strike Israel independently of Iran.

Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said Tuesday that the group will attack Israel but is keeping the country waiting as “part of the punishment.”

Feels like war is ‘getting closer to us’

Liz Levy, 40, lives in Nahariya with her three children and says the war is taking a mental toll on her family.

“Two days ago, I had a panic attack,” she told CNN. “Every three days, there’s a siren. It’s very scary.”

Levy said she worries about bringing up her children in a climate of war, adding that her children cry whenever they hear blaring sirens warning of incoming rockets.

“My daughter, she is 7 years old, and she also had a panic attack,” she said.

Residents of the north say their experience with the conflict in the north is very different from other population centers that have been largely spared. While those living in Tel Aviv experience sporadic attacks, in the north that’s a daily occurrence, they say.

“We’re on the frontline. They (Hezbollah) are pointing at us,” Shira Jorno, 23, told CNN. “We feel it getting closer to us.”

The Nahariya municipality has added more than 40 new shelters in the city since the war began and has conducted multiple training sessions to prepare medics and emergency workers for an attack, the municipal official said.

Asked whether the city will have to evacuate if the conflict escalates, the official said there is nowhere to move such a large population.

“Nahariya has not been evacuated as a decision that was taken together with the army because there is nowhere to go,” the official told CNN, adding that as the conflict zone expands in the north, it is difficult to keep moving people south. “Now they (Hezbollah) say Haifa (will be attacked), after Haifa it will be Tel Aviv. Where do we go? To the Negev?” he said, referring to the desert region in the south of the country."
Japan issues first ‘megaquake’ warning for Nankai Trough.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/08/08/japan-tsunami-earthquake-miyazaki-kyushu/,"TOKYO — A 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Miyazaki prefecture on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu on Thursday, the Japan Meteorological Agency said, prompting it to issue a tsunami alert as well as its first-ever warning for a “megaquake” from a nearby submarine trough that is a hotbed of geological tension.

Although the expected height of the tsunami is only 1 meter (about 3.3 feet), the waves can grow exponentially very quickly, the JMA said. The quake hit at a depth of 30 kilometers (18.6 miles), the agency said.

Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said at a news conference that there have been no reports of abnormalities at nuclear power plants after the quake and that the government is assessing for casualties and damage. Japan Rail suspended bullet train services as a precaution, state broadcaster NHK reported. No casualties or major damage were immediately reported after the quake.

The JMA issued its first public warning for a “Nankai Trough megaquake” after an investigation into the Thursday quake’s links to the submarine trough. The agency said the chance of a major earthquake there that could trigger powerful tsunamis is “relatively higher than usual for the next week.”

Earthquakes typically occur in the Nankai Trough every 100 to 150 years, according to the JMA. The most recent was in December 1946, when a quake of around 8.1 in magnitude killed more than 1,300 people. The U.S. Geological Survey notes that with more than 36,000 houses were destroyed or severely damaged and another 2,100 homes were washed away by a tsunami that reached heights of 5 to 6 meters (16 to 20 feet).

In January, Japan’s Earthquake Research Committee predicted a 70 to 80 percent chance of an earthquake between 8.0 and 9.0 in magnitude striking near the Nankai Trough within the next three decades.

While Japan is familiar with earthquakes — the country sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire — large tremors on the coast cause particular alarm because of their propensity to cause tsunamis. Japan experiences about 1,500 earthquakes annually that can be felt by people, with some kind of seismic activity recorded once every five minutes.

Memories of the 9.0-magnitude earthquake that struck the Tohoku region on Japan’s east coast in 2011, causing a devastating tsunami that claimed almost 20,000 lives, remain raw in Japan. The quake and tsunami also caused the meltdown of three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant."
Japan issues first ‘megaquake’ warning for Nankai Trough.,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/japan-earthquake-tsunami-advisory-rcna165728,"TOKYO — Japan issued its first warning Thursday about the possibility of a long-feared ""megaquake"" after a powerful 7.1-magnitude temblor struck off its southern coast, sparking a tsunami advisory but no immediate reports of serious damage or injuries.

The earthquake occurred off the coast of Miyazaki Prefecture on the main island of Kyushu at 4:42 p.m. local time (3:42 a.m. ET), at a depth of about 18 miles, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency.

Three people were reported injured, Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said, although he added that there had been no blackouts or damage to the water or communications systems reported in the region. Police in Miyazaki Prefecture said there had been 10 reports of damage. Hayashi urged residents to stay away from the coastline.

Seismologists held an emergency meeting to analyze whether the quake had affected the nearby Nankai Trough — the source of past devastating earthquakes. The meteorological agency ultimately issued what it called a ""mega earthquake caution,"" assessing that the possibility of a large quake was relatively higher than usual but not that one would definitely occur in the near future.

It urged the country's residents to practice increased vigilance for the next week.

""We ask all citizens to carefully check every new information issued by the government, reconfirm their daily earthquake preparedness, and be ready to evacuate immediately in the event of an earthquake,"" Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told a news briefing.

Earlier, officials issued a tsunami advisory following Thursday morning's quake, warning residents to immediately leave coastal areas of Kochi and Miyazaki prefectures until the warning is lifted. Advisories are issued when the waves are not expected to exceed 1 meter (3.3 feet).

Tsunami waves of up to 1.6 feet were detected along parts of Kyushu’s southern coast and the nearby island of Shikoku about a half hour after the quake struck. Japanese broadcaster NHK said Miyazaki Port had reported a surge of 20 inches.

That said, most of the damage so far has been relatively light. Police in Miyazaki Prefecture said there have been some reports of landslides and some traffic lights have stopped working. NHK said some windows were broken at the prefecture's airport and that the runway had been temporarily closed for checks.

Meanwhile, in neighboring Kagoshima Prefecture, concrete walls collapsed and a wooden house was damaged.

Of the people injured across the two prefectures, two are reported to be older women, who were taken to hospital after falling, while another was a female factory worker struck in the back by a falling object.

The Nuclear Regulation Authority said all 12 nuclear reactors on Kyushu and Shikoku remain safe. Earthquakes in areas with nuclear power plants have been a major concern since a massive 9.0-magnitude earthquake and ensuing tsunami triggered the Fukushima nuclear disaster in March 2011.

Japan sits on the Pacific 'Ring of Fire' — a line of seismic faults encircling the Pacific Ocean — and is one of the world’s most earthquake-prone countries. A temblor there Jan. 1 in Japan’s north-central region of Noto left more than 240 people dead.

Japan issues first ‘megaquake’ warning for Nankai Trough.,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/08/08/japan/nankai-earthquake-alert/,"The Meteorological Agency on Thursday issued its first-ever alert warning about a possible megaquake around the Nankai Trough, following a magnitude 7.1 quake that struck earlier in the day off the coast of Kyushu.

It is believed that the chance of a major earthquake occurring in the Nankai Trough is relatively higher than usual, according to the agency, but it added that this does not mean an earthquake will necessarily occur within a specific timeframe. The warning is expected to be in place for a week, but officials said residents should not let their guard down even after it is lifted.

The JMA issues such warnings when abnormal phenomena are observed along the Nankai Trough, or when the possibility of an earthquake is believed to have increased, according to the Cabinet Office.

Information from the agency on Nankai Trough megaquakes is delivered at two levels — an alert and a higher warning. The weather agency issued the lower level alert on Thursday, urging people to be prepared for cases requiring evacuation. No evacuations are required for the alert level.

A warning means people would need to be on higher alert, and officials would urge those who wouldn’t be able to evacuate quickly to do so before any large quake occurs.

After initial alerts are issued, an expert committee of the weather agency meets to evaluate the situation and update the alert level based conditions such as the magnitude of the earthquake that happened at the plate boundary.

Thursday’s quake met the condition of being magnitude 7 or higher, leading to the lower alert level. A quake of magnitude 8 or higher would trigger the higher level warning.

Even before Thursday, it wouldn’t have been surprising for a large quake to occur at any time in the Nankai Trough, an official from the Meteorological Agency said, but the likelihood has now increased even further.

From a seismological perspective, the probability of a large quake in the Nankai Trough has become several times higher, the agency said. Such quakes happen roughly once every 100 years, but the exact timing cannot be predicted. The most recent one took place on Dec. 21, 1946, which was measured between 8.1 and 8.4 on the moment magnitude scale.

Large earthquakes can occur without much warning, and people need to incorporate preparedness into their daily lives, the agency said, adding that steps like suspending train services, closing schools, and shutting down businesses in anticipation of an imminent major earthquake are often seen as difficult to implement effectively.

In the event of a major earthquake in the Nankai Trough, intense shaking is expected over a wide area from the Kanto region to Kyushu, and high tsunami waves are anticipated along the Pacific coast from the Kanto region to Okinawa, the agency said in a statement.

If an earthquake with a magnitude of 9.0 struck in the Nankai Trough, the shaking in the Kanto region could be around a lower or upper 5 on the Japanese seismic intensity scale, similar to the tremors the region experienced during the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011.

Large quakes in the Nankai Trough have historically caused severe damage, originating from the plate boundary region stretching from Suruga Bay to offshore Hyuganada, according to the Cabinet Office.

According to the government’s damage assessments published in 2012, a tsunami caused by a Nankai Trough megaquake could result in up to 224,000 deaths, which can be reduced by roughly 80% with sufficient evacuation efforts immediately after the earthquake.

Thursday’s alert has already prompted some precautionary measures. Central Japan Railways, which operates the bullet train line that connects Tokyo and Osaka, announced Thursday evening that it would operate trains at reduced speed between Mishima and Mikawa-Anjo stations, resulting in at least 10-minute delays until the alert is lifted."

Watch: Rocks fall and cameras shake as quake hits southern Japan

But experts were put on heightened alert because of where the epicentre sat - at the edge of the Nankai Trough, an area of seismic activity which stretches along Japan's Pacific coast.

It came hours after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake occurred off the southern island of Kyushu, which reportedly caused no major damage.

The advisory was issued on Thursday night local time, telling people to be alert but not to evacuate. It also stressed that the warning did not mean a large earthquake was imminent, but that the probability was higher than usual.

Japan has - for the first time - issued a warning about an increased risk of a ""major earthquake"" striking in the near future.

The plate boundary sits between Suruga Bay in central Japan, and the Hyuganada Sea in Kyushu to the south.

Previous Nankai Trough earthquakes have left thousands dead. These megaquakes have been recorded once every 90 to 200 years, with the last one occurring in 1946.

Experts say there is a 70% to 80% chance of a magnitude 8 or 9 quake striking somewhere along the trough in the next 30 years, according to the Kyodo News agency. Worst-case estimates suggest more than 200,000 people could be killed in the earthquake and potential subsequent tsunami.

However, at a press conference on Thursday, Japanese Meteorological Agency official Shinya Tsukada emphasised that while ""there is a relatively higher chance of another major earthquake compared to normal times"" they were not saying it would definitely happen ""in a certain period of time"".

This current advisory - the lower of two types of alerts at officials' disposal - will be in place for a week.

It asks residents to be on higher alert in the coming days, and for those who cannot evacuate quickly to consider doing so voluntarily, according to Japan's NHK broadcaster.

Officials have also told people be cautious but carry on with their everyday lives, while checking evacuation routes where needed and that households have enough supplies."

The alert signifies an increased likelihood of a major earthquake, urging residents to stay vigilant and prepared for potential evacuations.

Key Takeaways

Japan’s Meteorological Agency issued its first-ever alert for a potential Nankai Trough megaquake.

The alert follows a magnitude 7.1 earthquake off the coast of Kyushu.

Residents are urged to stay vigilant and prepared for potential evacuations.

The Initial Quake

On Thursday, a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Miyazaki Prefecture on Kyushu, Japan’s southernmost main island. The quake occurred at a depth of 30 kilometers (18.6 miles), prompting a tsunami advisory. Although the expected tsunami height was only 1 meter (about 3.3 feet), the waves can grow exponentially very quickly.

The Alert System

The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) has a two-tier alert system for Nankai Trough megaquakes: an alert and a higher warning. The current alert is the lower level, urging people to be prepared for possible evacuations. A higher warning would necessitate immediate evacuation for those unable to do so quickly.

Historical Context

The Nankai Trough is a submarine trench that has historically been the source of devastating earthquakes. The most recent significant quake in this region occurred in December 1946, measuring between 8.1 and 8.4 on the moment magnitude scale. Such quakes typically occur every 100-150 years.

Government and Expert Reactions

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi have urged the public to review their earthquake preparedness plans. Naoshi Hirata, an emeritus professor at the University of Tokyo, stated that the probability of a major earthquake has increased several times compared to usual.

Potential Impact

A major earthquake in the Nankai Trough could cause intense shaking from the Kanto region to Kyushu and generate high tsunami waves along the Pacific coast. Government estimates suggest that a Nankai Trough megaquake could result in up to 224,000 deaths, which could be reduced by 80% with timely evacuation.

Precautionary Measures

In response to the alert, Central Japan Railways has announced reduced train speeds between Mishima and Mikawa-Anjo stations, causing delays. Residents are advised to stay away from coastal areas and to be prepared for potential evacuations.

Conclusion

While the alert does not guarantee an imminent earthquake, it serves as a crucial reminder for residents to stay prepared. The JMA will continue to monitor the situation and update the public as necessary."
Japan issues first ‘megaquake’ warning for Nankai Trough.,https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2024/08/2d60a6f3600d-urgent-m71-quake-hits-southwestern-japan-tsunami-advisories-issued.html,"KYODO NEWS - 9 hours ago - 22:23 | All, Japan

An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 hit southwestern Japan on Thursday and tsunami advisories were issued for the Pacific coast extending to the western part of the country, sparking concerns that a megaquake may occur in the near future.

The Japan Meteorological Agency issued an urgent advisory on the trench-type megaquake for the first time, warning the possibility of the quake happening along the Nankai Trough, stretching from off southwestern to central Japan, is relatively higher than usual.

In consideration of the advisory, Central Japan Railway Co. said it will run the Tokaido Shinkansen Line at a slower pace than usual for about one week, while suspending operations of some expresses in the western part of the nation.

The 4:43 p.m. quake occurred at a depth of around 30 kilometers off Miyazaki Prefecture and registered lower 6 on the Japanese seismic intensity scale of 7 in the city of Nichinan in the southern part of the prefecture, the weather agency said.

Shortly afterward, the agency began its first investigation into whether there is any link between the temblor and a potential Nankai Trough earthquake. The system has been in operation since 2017.

Around a dozen injuries were reported and several buildings were damaged, according to disaster management minister Yoshifumi Matsumura.

When an earthquake with a lower 6 seismic intensity happens, ""It becomes difficult to remain standing. Doors may not open. Wall tiles and window glass may be damaged and fall,"" the agency said.

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called on the public to ""prepare to evacuate immediately if an earthquake occurs,"" telling reporters in Tokyo, ""To avoid unnecessary confusion, please absolutely refrain from spreading so-called false information"" through social media.

Tsunami advisories were issued for Kochi, Ehime, Oita, Miyazaki and Kagoshima prefectures, but the weather agency lifted them all by 10 p.m.

Tsunami with heights of around 50 centimeters and 20 cm were observed in Miyazaki and southwestern Kochi, respectively, the agency said.

No abnormalities were found at the Ikata and Sendai nuclear power plants in Ehime and Kagoshima prefectures, nor in the environmental radioactivity levels in the surrounding areas, the Nuclear Regulation Authority said.

The powerful temblor also disrupted transportation services around Miyazaki Prefecture in Kyushu, one of the country's four main islands. Some flights connecting Miyazaki airport with Osaka, as well as Tokyo's Haneda, were canceled.

Services of the Kyushu and Nishi Kyushu shinkansen bullet trains were temporarily suspended due to the quake, the operator said. A ferry from Miyazaki to Kobe in western Japan was canceled.

Japanese meatpacking firm NH Foods Ltd. briefly suspended operations at the plants of its three subsidiaries in Miyazaki Prefecture for checkups.

The agency, which initially estimated the quake's magnitude at 6.9, warned that quakes with a seismic intensity of around lower 6 could occur for about a week.

As of January, the government's Earthquake Research Committee forecasted a 70 to 80 percent likelihood that a quake with a magnitude of 8.0 to 9.0 will occur near the Nankai Trough within the next 30 years.

In 2012, the government estimated that up to 323,000 people could die in the megaquake.

Japan issues first ‘megaquake’ warning for Nankai Trough.,https://japan-forward.com/jma-issues-first-ever-nankai-trough-megaquake-alert-miyazaki-earthquake/,"On August 8, at around 4:43 PM, a magnitude 7.1 earthquake was detected in Miyazaki Prefecture, southeastern Kyushu. In response, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) issued an alert on the same day, warning about a possible large earthquake around the Nankai Trough. This alert, called the ""Nankai Trough Earthquake Extra Information,"" was issued for the first time since the system began in May 2019.

At 5:30 PM that same day, the JMA convened to assess the risks of a Nankai Trough earthquake. The agency urged residents in areas likely to be affected to take appropriate safety measures based on their individual circumstances.

A Nankai Trough megaquake refers to a potentially massive earthquake that could occur along the Nankai Trough, where an underlying fault system has historically caused catastrophic earthquakes.

The Nankai Trough is a shallow ocean trench extending from the Tokai region to Kyushu along the Pacific coast. It is where the Philippine Sea Plate subducts beneath the continental plate on which the Japanese archipelago lies. The boundary between these two plates has repeatedly slipped, causing megaquakes of M8.0 or greater.

The Megaquake Alert System

In the ""Nankai Trough Earthquake Extra Information"" alert system, the JMA issues the first ""extra information"" alert when an earthquake of M6.8 or greater is detected along the Nankai Trough. This alert is also triggered when anomalies requiring evaluation are detected by crustal deformation monitoring equipment.

Following this initial alert, the JMA convenes a meeting of experts to assess the situation. Based on this evaluation, the JMA issues one of the following emergency information statuses.

""Megathurst Earthquake Alert"" for an earthquake of roughly M8.0 or greater.

""Megathurst Earthquake Attention"" for an earthquake of M7.0 or greater, or when an unusual ""slow slip"" (a gradual movement at the plate boundary that doesn't cause noticeable shaking) is detected.

""Analysis Complete"" if no further action is needed.

The M7.1 Miyazaki Earthquake

Regarding the Miyazaki earthquake, the JMA issued a ""Megathurst Earthquake Attention"" after the preliminary alert. This advisory urges the public to review their evacuation preparations and be ready to evacuate immediately if necessary, although it does not yet mandate evacuation. This system is particularly intended to help vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and disabled, evacuate to safer locations in advance.

According to the JMA, this earthquake's epicenter was in the Hyuga-nada region, an area of the Pacific Ocean off the eastern coast of Kyushu. The quake originated at a depth of approximately 30 kilometers.

Future Risks

The Japanese government predicts a 70–80% probability of a Nankai Trough megaquake occurring within the next 30 years, based on historical intervals. Estimates under a worst-case scenario suggest a megaquake could result in as many as 323,000 deaths and missing persons.

Japan issues first ‘megaquake’ warning for Nankai Trough.,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13724853/japan-earthquake-megaquake-warning.html,"Japan has issued its first ever megaquake warning following tremors earlier today in the same area 'one of the world's deadliest earthquakes' hit almost 80 years ago.

The 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Japan's southern island of Kyushu, close to the city of Nichinan, at 4.43pm local time.

Japan's Meteorological Agency issued a tsunami warning following the powerful quake. They also took the unprecedented decision to issue a formal warning about a potential 'megaquake.'

The agency said that submarines in the Nankai Trough, where part of the Eurasian tectonic plate meets with the Philippine tectonic plate, found that the chances of a major earthquake in the region was 'relatively higher than usual for the next week.'

Earthquakes in the Nankai Trough typically occur every 100 to 150 years. The most recent quake to hit the area was 78 years ago in December 1946.

That earthquake measured a magnitude of 8.1 and killed 1,300 people.

The Washington Post reported that the tsunami wave is expected to reach a height of just one metre but this could grow exponentially very quickly. Following the violent quake bullet trains have been halted in the area while the Japanese government assess the casualties and damage.

'First time in my life I've felt shaking like this,' one resident of Kyushu said as homes and power lines began to shake.

'Normally I barely feel it when I'm outside or in a car, but it shook to the point that even when I'm standing, there was a fluttering feeling.'

The quake most strongly shook Nichinan city and nearby areas in Miyazaki prefecture on Kyushu island.

Footage from Japan showed light fixtures and wall decorations swinging as the earthquakes hit today.

Broadcaster NHK showed footage of traffic lights shaking violently in Miyazaki on Kyushu's southeast coast.

'The surface of the sea is wavering. I felt an intense jolt when the quake happened which lasted for between 30 seconds and a minute,' one local official told NHK.

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida wrote on Twitter/X that he had issued instructions in response, and that authorities were collecting information on damage. 'Please continue to be on the lookout for strong shaking and take action to protect your lives,' he wrote

The broadcaster also reported that three people were hurt in Miyazaki but gave no indication of the extent of their injuries.

Japan's meteorological society predicted waves of up to 1 meter (3.3 feet) along the southern coast of Kyushu and Shikoku.

The United States Geological Survey initially reported that the first quake was followed by another 7.1 magnitude tremor.

However this was later deemed an error, the agency confirming there had only been one tremor.

'This error has been fixed. There was one event,' the USGS said.

The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) also reported a single quake.

NHK reported that there were no abnormalities detected at Japan's Sendai nuclear power plant in Kagoshima, harking back to the devastating Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011 as power supplies were knocked offline by an earthquake.

The Nuclear Regulation Authority said all 12 nuclear reactors, including three which are currently operating, on Kyushu and Shikoku remained safe.

The Japanese government has set up a special task force in response to the quakes, the USGS reported.

Seismologists were also holding an emergency meeting to analyse whether the quake had affected the nearby Nankai Trough, the source of past devastating earthquakes.

Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said officials were assessing possible injuries or serious damage, though none were immediately reported.

He urged residents of the affected region to stay away from the coastline.

'Please continue to be on the lookout for strong shaking and take action to protect your lives,' he wrote.

On New Year's Day, at least 260 people died after a massive earthquake hit the peninsula, including 30 'quake-linked' deaths as well as those killed directly in the disaster.

The January 1 quake and its aftershocks toppled buildings, caused fires and knocked out infrastructure at a time when families were celebrating the new year.

Sitting along along the western edge of the Pacific 'Ring of Fire',Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries.

More than 15,000 people were killed in a magnitude 9 quake in 2011 that triggered a devastating tsunami and triple reactor meltdowns at a nuclear power plant in Fukushima."

A seismic intensity of lower 6 was recorded on the plains of southern Miyazaki Prefecture, while an upper 5 was felt in Miyazaki’s mountainous region and in the Osumi area of Kagoshima Prefecture.

The plains in northern Miyazaki Prefecture and the Satsuma area of Kagoshima Prefecture both experienced a seismic intensity of lower 5.

The earthquake caused a tsunami with a height of 50cm to reach Miyazaki Port in Miyazaki at 5.14pm, according to the JMA.

A 40cm-high tsunami was recorded in the prefecture’s Nichinan at 5.23pm. In addition, 30cm-high tsunamis were recorded in Tosashimizu, Kochi Prefecture, at around 5.46pm. Tsunamis of 10cm in height reached Miyazaki’s Hyuga at 5.13pm.

The JMA warned people not to approach the coasts, in order to avoid tsunamis.

“Tsunami have been observed and coastal areas are dangerous,” a JMA official said at a press conference on Thursday.

Emergency response office set up

The Government set up an emergency response office on Thursday. The office is operating under the crisis control centre of the Prime Minister’s Office.

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Thursday ordered that measures be taken to respond to the strong earthquake.

Such measures include providing the public with accurate information on tsunami and evacuation in a timely manner, and making thorough efforts to prevent damage.

The extent of the damage was to be immediately assessed, and relevant parties were to work closely with local governments and do all they could to implement emergency disaster response measures while prioritising the protection of human lives.

Kyushu Electric Power Co said its Sendai nuclear power plant in Kagoshima Prefecture and Genkai nuclear power plant in Saga Prefecture were operating normally.

Shikoku Electric Power Co also said its Ikata nuclear power plant in Ehime Prefecture was operating normally.

Japan issues first ‘megaquake’ warning for Nankai Trough.,https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Natural-disasters/Japan-issues-advisory-over-possible-Nankai-Trough-megaquake,"TOKYO -- Japan on Thursday said the possibility of a huge earthquake over a wide swath of central and western parts of the country has increased relative to normal conditions following a magnitude 7.1 temblor off Miyazaki prefecture on the southern island of Kyushu earlier in the day.

Following the afternoon quake, the Japan Meteorological Agency launched investigations into its possible relationship to a potential Nankai Trough earthquake, which experts have warned for years could cause huge loss of life and property across a wide stretch of central and western Japan. The trough is a marine trench running along part of the south of the Japanese archipelago.

The agency issued its Nankai Trough Earthquake Extra Information for the first time ever on Thursday evening. An accompanying government advisory said the ""possibility of a large-scale earthquake is considered to be relatively higher than under normal conditions."" According to the agency, the large earthquakes have taken place every 100 to 150 years in central and western areas of the country.

The government has previously said there is a 70% chance of such an earthquake within 30 years. And while Naoshi Hirata, an earthquake expert and emeritus professor at the University of Tokyo, said at an agency news conference that ""the probability is multiple times higher than usual"" after the Miyazaki earthquake, it remains ""an event of one in a multiple hundred times."" Still, he urged people to be prepared.

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida also called on the public to check their earthquake preparations and ""be ready to evacuate immediately if an earthquake occurs.""

There have been no reports so far of major damage from Thursday's 7.1-magnitude quake and the small tsunamis it generated. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said the government ""has not received any reports of abnormalities"" at nuclear plants and related facilities in the region.

The agency urged caution for a week, with the probability of large earthquakes being higher just after the Miyazaki quake. But its representatives repeatedly emphasized that such large earthquakes could happen anytime, even beyond a certain period.

Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations because of its location on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of volcanoes and fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin. Japan was struck by a triple disaster in March 2011, when a magnitude-9 earthquake off the northeast coast triggered a deadly tsunami, leading to three meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant.

The agency said a Nankai Trough earthquake may be limited to the vicinity of Thursday's quake or extend over the ""entire Nankai Trough.""

Experts say a Nankai Trough earthquake could span areas ranging from the islands of Kyushu, Shikoku and parts of Honshu including Aichi and other prefectures to areas farther east closer to Tokyo such as Shizuoka prefecture -- simultaneously or in succession at a magnitude of up to 9.

Such a quake could also lead to a tsunami of over 30 meters and together cause up to 320,000 deaths and economic losses of 220 trillion yen ($1.5 trillion), according to a government estimate in 2012.

It has been over 70 years since the last major earthquake disaster in the region, which experts say makes such an event ever more likely.

Kishida is scheduled to travel to the city of Nagasaki on the island of Kyushu to participate in annual commemorations of the 1945 U.S. atomic bombing of the city on Friday, and also depart for Kazakhstan later in the day for a summit with Central Asian nations. He is also slated to visit Uzbekistan and Mongolia. It was not immediately clear if the heightened Nankai Trough earthquake risk would impact his plans.

He said the government will ""make appropriate decisions"" based on information it is collecting."

Japan issues first ‘megaquake’ warning for Nankai Trough.,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/08/08/japan/japan-kyushu-quake/,"A magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck off the coast of Miyazaki Prefecture on Thursday, initially prompting a tsunami advisory for parts of the coast of Kyushu and Shikoku and for the Meteorological Agency to issue an alert warning of a further possible megaquake along the Nankai Trough area, off the east coast of Japan, for the first time.

Thursday’s earthquake registered a lower 6 on the seven-point Japanese seismic intensity scale, occurring at 4:43 p.m. at a depth of 30 kilometers, with its epicenter in the Hyuganada sea off the coast of Miyazaki Prefecture.

A total of nine people were reported to have been injured in Kyushu’s Miyazaki and Kagoshima prefectures as of 7:30 p.m., according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency. Among those, seven suffered minor injuries while the extent of injuries for the other two remains unclear.

Speaking at an emergency news conference, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said a landslide had been reported in the city of Shibushi in Kagoshima Prefecture.

At its own news conference following the quake, the Meteorological Agency cautioned that people in the affected areas should be on alert for earthquakes measuring up to lower 6 for the next week, especially over the next two or three days. In areas where tremors were strongly felt, the risk of buildings collapsing and of landslides had increased, the agency added, warning people to stay vigilant surrounding quake activity and rainfall.

Small waves were recorded in some areas. A 50-centimeter tsunami was recorded at Miyazaki Port at 5:14 p.m., a 40-cm wave reached Aburatsu Port on the Nichinan coast in Miyazaki at 5:23 p.m., and a 30-cm wave reached Tosashimizu in Kochi at 5:46 p.m. All tsunami advisories were lifted at 10 p.m.

After the earthquake, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida instructed authorities to share accurate information about the tsunami warning and any damage, urging residents to take necessary precautions to find shelter.

The government set up a task force under the helm of disaster management minister Yoshifumi Matsumura, Kishida told reporters Thursday evening.

Kyushu Electric Power said there was no impact from the earthquake on its Sendai and Genkai nuclear plants, which are located in the city of Satsumasendai in Kagoshima Prefecture and the Higashimatsuura district in Saga Prefecture, respectively.

Shikoku Electric Power said no shaking was detected at its Ikata Nuclear Power Plant in Ehime Prefecture — the only nuclear plant on Shikoku Island — adding that the plant’s Unit 3 has been shut down for routine inspections.

Several domestic flights scheduled to depart Miyazaki Airport after 5:30 p.m. were canceled. “The shaking was quite intense and lasted around 30 seconds,” a clerk at the airport told NHK. “We were told that some windows have shattered.”

As of shortly before 8 p.m., several local train lines across Kyushu were still suspended because of the earthquake.

JR Kyushu reported suspension of some train services on the Nippo Line, the Miyazaki-Airport Line, the Nichinan Line, the Hisatsu Line and the Kitto Line as well as delays elsewhere on those lines. It also noted ongoing delays on the Kagoshima Line and the Kyushu Shinkansen. The Kyushu Shinkansen and Minami Kyushu Shinkansen lines had resumed operations following the earthquake at around 5:25 p.m., media reported.

The Meteorological Agency’s alert warning about a possible large earthquake around the seismically significant Nankai Trough area, issued later Thursday, was its first ever. It is believed that the chance of a major earthquake occurring in the Nankai Trough is relatively higher than usual, according to the agency.

“I urge everyone to check information from the government, go back to basic disaster preparedness and get ready to evacuate immediately in the event of an earthquake,” Kishida said in reference to the risk of a Nankai Trough earthquake, urging people to refrain from spreading misinformation.

On Friday, Kishida is scheduled to fly to Nagasaki to attend a ceremony to commemorate the 79th anniversary of the atomic bombing, and from there to head directly to Kazakhstan for a four-day tour of Central Asia. Kishida said he will decide whether to cancel these engagements or take further measures according to the developments of the next few hours.

Japan issues first ‘megaquake’ warning for Nankai Trough.,https://japan-forward.com/editorial-take-latest-covid-wave-seriously-before-obon-holidays/,"A new wave of the COVID is sweeping across the nation.

Cases of infection by the virus tend to rise markedly in summer and winter. This version is the 11th wave of infection following the one seen in January-February 2024.

Travel to out-of-the-way places increases significantly during the August Obon holiday season. Therefore, it is important to take preventive measures. Those who are not feeling well should consider refraining from returning to their family hometowns or traveling for pleasure.

According to reports by around 5,000 designated medical institutions throughout Japan, in the week ending on July 21, the average number of infected patients seen jumped to more than 13. That marked the 11th consecutive week in which the case numbers had increased. Kyushu and Okinawa experienced especially pronounced rises.

In May 2023, the status of COVID-19 under the Infectious Diseases Control Act was downgraded to Class 5. Nevertheless, precautions continue to be needed among the elderly and people with preexisting conditions.

In response to the rapid spread of COVID-19 and other viruses, on July 22 the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare held a meeting in Tokyo to query experts about the current situation and countermeasures. (©Sankei by Mie Oh)

Daily Precautions Help

This is the time of year when the hot weather takes a physical toll on us. As always, it is important to maintain basic physical strength by getting enough sleep, adequate hydration, and nutrition.

""KP-3"" is the type of Omicron virus that is currently prevalent. Reports say the severity of the disease it causes is on par with previous types, but immunity acquired through vaccines and other means is proving less effective. Moreover, it is highly contagious. So we cannot afford to become complacent.

One reason for the spread of infections during summer is the fact that people tend to spend more time indoors in closed spaces to escape the heat. Air conditioning is of course essential to prevent heatstroke. But, at the same time, frequent ventilation is also necessary. There is no latitude to become lax in our daily countermeasures against infection, including wearing a face mask in congested locations, or washing and disinfecting our hands.

High-Risk Populations

Nursing homes with many elderly persons need to be especially attentive as far as preventing infection is concerned. Cluster infections can do enormous damage. These facilities also need to receive regular guidance from medical institutions and establish a system for medical personnel to make house calls in a COVID outbreak.

Starting this spring, medical institutions and nursing care facilities qualify for generous compensation if they build such partnerships. However, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare should not just set the compensation amount and leave it at that. It must also check with the prefectures regarding the progress made in this kind of collaboration.

Combatting Increased Disease Outbreaks

This current COVID outbreak is not the only pressing problem we face. Hand, foot, and mouth disease, a typical form of summer cold among young children, is at its highest rate in the past 10 years. Similarly, viral infections of herpangina and pharyngoconjunctival fever are also spreading.

Alcohol-based disinfectants are not very effective, but washing your hands with soap is. There have even been cases in which an adult has become seriously ill after contracting an infection from a child. Hygienic measures to avoid spreading infections at home, such as not sharing towels, should also be adopted.

Japan issues first ‘megaquake’ warning for Nankai Trough.,https://www.recentlyheard.com/japan-issues-nankai-trough-megaquake-warning-after-7-1-magnitude-temblor/,"TOKYO — Japan issued its first warning Thursday about the potential for a long-feared “megaquake” after a strong 7.1-magnitude temblor struck off its southern coast, sparking a tsunami advisory however no instant reviews of great harm or accidents.

Google Maps

The earthquake occurred off the coast of Miyazaki Prefecture on the principle island of Kyushu at 4:42 p.m. native time (3:42 a.m. ET), at a depth of about 18 miles, in response to the Japan Meteorological Company.

Three individuals have been reported injured, Japan’s Chief Cupboard Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi mentioned, though he added that there had been no blackouts or harm to the water or communications programs reported within the area. Police in Miyazaki Prefecture mentioned there had been 10 reviews of injury. Hayashi urged residents to avoid the shoreline.

Seismologists held an emergency assembly to investigate whether or not the quake had affected the close by Nankai Trough — the supply of previous devastating earthquakes. The meteorological company in the end issued what it known as a “mega earthquake warning,” assessing that the potential for a big quake was comparatively larger than standard however not that one would undoubtedly happen within the close to future.

It urged the nation’s residents to follow elevated vigilance for the subsequent week.

“We ask all residents to rigorously examine each new data issued by the federal government, reconfirm their day by day earthquake preparedness, and be able to evacuate instantly within the occasion of an earthquake,” Prime Minister Fumio Kishida instructed a information briefing.

Earlier, officers issued a tsunami advisory following Thursday morning’s quake, warning residents to right away depart coastal areas of Kochi and Miyazaki prefectures till the warning is lifted. Advisories are issued when the waves are usually not anticipated to exceed 1 meter (3.3 toes).

Tsunami waves of as much as 1.6 toes have been detected alongside components of Kyushu’s southern coast and the close by island of Shikoku a couple of half hour after the quake struck. Japanese broadcaster NHK mentioned Miyazaki Port had reported a surge of 20 inches.

That mentioned, a lot of the harm to date has been comparatively mild. Police in Miyazaki Prefecture mentioned there have been some reviews of landslides and a few visitors lights have stopped working. NHK mentioned some home windows have been damaged on the prefecture’s airport and that the runway had been briefly closed for checks.

In the meantime, in neighboring Kagoshima Prefecture, concrete partitions collapsed and a picket home was broken.

Of the individuals injured throughout the 2 prefectures, two are reported to be older girls, who have been taken to hospital after falling, whereas one other was a feminine manufacturing facility employee struck within the again by a falling object.

The Nuclear Regulation Authority mentioned all 12 nuclear reactors on Kyushu and Shikoku stay secure. Earthquakes in areas with nuclear energy crops have been a serious concern since an enormous 9.0-magnitude earthquake and ensuing tsunami triggered the Fukushima nuclear catastrophe in March 2011.

Japan sits on the Pacific ‘Ring of Hearth’ — a line of seismic faults encircling the Pacific Ocean — and is likely one of the world’s most earthquake-prone international locations. A temblor there Jan. 1 in Japan’s north-central area of Noto left greater than 240 individuals useless.

Japan issued its first-ever warning about the potential for a ""megaquake"" after a powerful 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck off its southern coast on Thursday. The temblor, which hit the coast of Miyazaki Prefecture on the main island of Kyushu at 4:42 p.m. local time, triggered a tsunami advisory and sparked immediate emergency responses across the region.

According to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), the earthquake occurred at a depth of approximately 18 miles. While there were no immediate reports of serious damage or widespread injuries, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi confirmed that three people had been injured. These injuries included two older women who fell and a female factory worker struck by a falling object.

Hayashi also noted that the region had not experienced any blackouts or significant disruptions to water or communication systems. ""There have been 10 reports of damage, but we urge residents to stay away from the coastline as a precaution,"" he said.

In an emergency meeting, seismologists analyzed whether the quake had affected the nearby Nankai Trough, a source of past devastating earthquakes. The JMA subsequently issued a ""mega earthquake caution,"" indicating a relatively higher likelihood of a large quake in the near future, though not guaranteeing one.

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida emphasized the need for vigilance. ""We ask all citizens to carefully check every new information issued by the government, reconfirm their daily earthquake preparedness, and be ready to evacuate immediately in the event of an earthquake,"" Kishida stated at a news briefing.

Earlier, officials had issued a tsunami advisory for the coastal areas of Kochi and Miyazaki prefectures, urging residents to evacuate until the advisory was lifted. Tsunami waves of up to 1.6 feet were detected along parts of Kyushu's southern coast and the nearby island of Shikoku about half an hour after the quake.

The immediate physical impact of the earthquake appeared to be relatively minor. Police in Miyazaki Prefecture reported some landslides and malfunctioning traffic lights, while NHK reported broken windows at Miyazaki Airport, which temporarily closed its runway for inspections. In neighboring Kagoshima Prefecture, concrete walls collapsed and a wooden house was damaged.

The Nuclear Regulation Authority confirmed that all 12 nuclear reactors on Kyushu and Shikoku remained safe. This reassurance comes amidst ongoing concerns about nuclear safety in the earthquake-prone region, a sensitivity heightened since the Fukushima disaster in 2011.

Japan's position on the Pacific 'Ring of Fire' makes it one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world. Historical context adds gravity to any seismic activity; a 9.0-magnitude earthquake in 2011 led to a devastating tsunami and the Fukushima nuclear disaster, resulting in more than 15,000 deaths. Another significant earthquake in the north-central region of Noto earlier this year left over 240 people dead.

In the wake of Thursday's quake, Japanese authorities are on high alert. The JMA's advisory of a heightened risk for a larger earthquake near the Pacific coast has prompted renewed emphasis on preparedness. ""We must be prepared for the possibility of another significant earthquake,"" Hayashi stressed.

Prime Minister Kishida's travel plans are under review in light of the earthquake. He was scheduled to visit Nagasaki to mark the 79th anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombing, followed by visits to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Mongolia. ""I will decide on my travel plans based on the situation,"" Kishida remarked.

As Japan navigates the aftermath of the quake, the government's response underscores the critical balance between immediate action and long-term vigilance. With the memory of past disasters ever-present, Japan continues to enhance its preparedness for future seismic events."
There’s a Big Reason Things Haven’t Escalated Between Iran and Iran.,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/08/iran-israel-is-middle-east-about-to-explode.html,"A week and a day have passed since an Israeli bomb killed Hamas’ political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, as he lay sleeping in an Iranian government guesthouse in Tehran. Soon after, Ayatollah Ali Khameini vowed “harsh punishment” against Israel, declaring it his “duty” to “avenge” the martyr’s blood.

Yet at least so far, nothing has happened. There’s a simmering tension between conflicting pressures—at once political, diplomatic, pragmatic, and ideological—to escalate the conflict or to cool it down.

It is a widely held view that Iran has to take some action in response. The killing took place on Iranian territory. Haniyeh had just attended the inauguration of Iran’s new president, as had leaders from Iran’s other allies—members of the “axis of resistance”—who must have wondered, in the wake of the attack, how capable Tehran would be at protecting them.

U.S. diplomats have called all their intermediaries with Tehran, urging that the ayatollah—the country’s real decisionmaker (he isn’t called the Supreme Leader for nothing)—keep any armed response restricted to military targets, not many, and to avoid killing Israeli citizens.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned that if Iran did kill any civilians, he would strike back “disproportionately.” Some have hinted that Israel would respond by destroying Iran’s nuclear facility—a mission Israeli missiles and fighter jets have the range and firepower to accomplish and that, in fact, its crews have rehearsed.

President Joe Biden’s national security spokesman, John Kirby, has said that the United States would help defend Israel from any Iranian attack. In April, U.S., British, French, and Jordanian air-defense crews helped Israel repel a massive, multipronged Iranian attack—consisting of more than 300 missiles and drones, including 110 ballistic missiles—shooting down almost all of the projectiles that didn’t crash along the way.

However, there are a few new wrinkles in this buildup to a possible attack. On the one hand, Jordan’s leaders, who were heavily criticized by their Palestinian citizens for helping out Israel four months ago, say that if Iran mounts an attack this time, they won’t allow Israel or its defenders to use Jordanian air space—meaning Iran’s missiles and drones would have to be intercepted over Israeli territory, making it much harder to shoot down all of them.

Advertisement

On the other hand, Iran International, a U.K.-based news agency, reported that the new Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, asked Khameini to refrain from attacking Israel, warning that an Israeli counterstrike could have dire economic consequences for Iran.

This news agency is of uneven reliability, so who knows if the story is true. However, the new president, who is a surgeon and former reformist politician, is relatively moderate. He ran for office, and won, on a platform of reengaging with the West. He has appointed Mohammad Javad Zarif, who was foreign minister when Iran signed the nuclear deal with the U.S. and five other Western nations, as his vice president for strategic affairs. He has also named Ali Bagheri Kani, Iran’s chief negotiator on the nuclear deal, as his foreign minister.

In other words, whether or not the Iran International story is true, it is plausible that the new president would be lobbying for a light response to Israel’s killing. It is now clear, though, how much influence he has over the Supreme Leader.

Another report (again of unknown reliability) suggests that Iran might respond with moderation, if at all, because it is now clear—this part is absolutely certain—that Haniyeh was killed by a remote-control bomb that was placed under the bed in the guesthouse where he usually stays at least two months ago by an officer with the Revolutionary Guard Corps—Iran’s elite service—who had been recruited by Israel’s Mossad. In other words, Iran’s own lax security was partly responsible for the assassination.

Finally, there is another angle to consider: Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia that controls southern Lebanon, might go rogue. The group and Israeli forces have lobbed rockets back and forth for many years. The lobbing intensified, in frequency and explosive power, after Hamas’ murderous invasion of Israel on Oct. 7 and the ensuing war in Gaza. (Many have speculated that Hamas’ leaders expected Hezbollah to join in, attacking Israel from the north as they assaulted from the south. They were overly optimistic.) Last month, a Hezbollah rocket hit a soccer field in the Israel-controlled Golan Heights, killing 12 children. Israel retaliated with an airstrike in Beirut, killing Fouad Shukur, Hezbollah’s top military commander. (This occurred just hours before the assassination of the Hamas chief in Tehran. Few voiced outrage over the former; many, including Israeli officers, feared the latter might have crossed some line of provocation.)

With all this in mind, some—in the U.S., Israel, elsewhere in the Middle East, possibly even in Iran—worry that Hezbollah might step up its rocket attacks on its own, without authorization from the mullahs in Tehran.

Meanwhile, the fact that Iran hasn’t struck back eight days after Haniyeh’s killing is not necessarily a sign of restraint. Iran’s massive missile and drone strike against Israel earlier this year took place on April 13. That was 12 days after an Israeli airstrike on Iran’s consulate in Syria that killed seven senior officers of the Revolutionary Guard Corps.

It could be the Iranians are still plotting their next move. And so, we all wait."

I still can’t believe that it’s over—but as I nurse my gymnastics hangover and Simone Biles babysits her (mild spoiler alert) four new medals, let us review the most defining moments of these Games’ only sport. Wait, what? Really? Sorry, ahem, one of these Games’ best sports.

Women’s Gymnastics Is for Grown-Ups!

The first thing you might notice about the five-woman team the U.S. program sent to Paris this year is that four of those five women (and one of their alternates!) had been to the Olympics before. Multiple unusual circumstances, including several unfortunate injuries at Olympic trials, had to align in order to send Jordan Chiles, Jade Carey, and Suni Lee back to the Olympics alongside a mentally and physically top-tier Simone Biles. But what resulted, a team with an average age of 22 (the oldest the U.S. has fielded in modern history!), was actually reflective of a broader trend in the sport toward careers with more longevity. Gone, mostly, are the days of bird-bodied homeschool freshmen, starved and berated and treated as if they are disposable. Why? Well, it’s complicated.

Simone Biles Competed Injured

So much for the pitiful chorus of (mostly) male four-year gymnastics experts who called Biles a “quitter” in Tokyo when she wisely withdrew from several competitions after suffering from the gymnastics version of vertigo. “Maybe if my ankle was fractured,” Biles told the Netflix camera crew in her recent documentary, “I would have still [competed], but that wasn’t the case.” Because Biles suffered from an injury nobody could see, a small but loud-and-wrong minority crowed about her “quitting on her team” until the moment she took the floor in qualifications in Paris—whereupon she promptly injured her calf warming up for floor exercise. There was a point in the competition when the GOAT gave the entire gymnastics world heart palpitations as she literally crawled down the vault runway. But then YOU’LL NEVER GUESS WHAT HAPPENED.

The U.S. Men Finally Won a Medal, and a Bespectacled New Star Was Born

Every Olympics, a few surprise heroes emerge for reasons nobody can predict, and Paris was no exception. All at once, the people of this great nation remembered that men’s gymnastics exists, thanks to the last-minute hit from a mild-mannered Rubik’s Cube ace whose dual diagnoses of coloboma and strabismus mean he doesn’t see very well without his glasses—but, like many athletes, he removes them to compete. In Stephen Nedoroscik’s case, his competition placement—last to go on the Americans’ final event, the dread pommel horse, which has claimed the dreams of many a man—combined with his unmistakable Clark Kent vibes, meant that Pommel Horse Guy will go down in history as a star. But how exactly did he find himself in this position, and what exactly is so maddening about the pommel horse? I’m so glad you asked.

The American Women Got Their Redemption! But Was There an Asterisk?

It was on vault, the first event in Tokyo team finals, where Biles suffered the rapid-onset “twisties” in midair and wisely withdrew from most of the rest of the Olympics for the deeply selfish reason of not wanting to break her neck on live international television. So the pressure was on even more than usual when Biles took to the runway three years later, in the Paris women’s team final. And then (mild spoiler) she killed it! And so did her teammates! Boy did the American women win. They won all over the place! They called these Games their “redemption tour,” but as the newly monikered “Golden Girls” proceeded directly from the medal stand to TikTok, one question kept nagging at me. What if the Russians had been there? Was this 1984 all over again? The question nagged at me so incessantly that I did math to find out.

Biles Faced Down Some Actual Competition for the First Time in Her Entire Career

For the overwhelming majority of the decade that I have spent beholding the greatness of Simone Biles, the only actual competition she’s had has been … Simone Biles. She won the all-around in Rio in 2016 by 2 full points; she took the 2018 World Championships by almost 2 points (with two falls and a kidney stone); she destroyed 2019 Worlds, again, by more than 2 points. In every major international competition until very recently, Biles’ margin of error was so great that losing required the possibility (and sometimes reality!) of multiple falls; she threw her stratospherically difficult skills—including five eponymous elements—literally just because she could. And then came Rebeca Andrade. Could Brazil’s superstar actually beat the greatest to ever do it in the individual all-around final? It was possible, and I explained how. And indeed, the GOAT’s margin of error shrank to the point that for a second, I thought it had disappeared—then, on the last day of event finals, well …

Apparatus Finals Ended In an Iconic Moment of Sportsmanship and Joy

On the final day of the gymnastics competition’s grueling six-meet schedule, the athletes’ exhaustion gunned for a gold medal of its own, flinging otherwise-brilliant gymnasts off their signature apparatus left, right, and center. The balance beam and men’s high bar were both obviously jinxed (there is no other explanation), and in the Games’ last gymnastics meet, the floor exercise final, it came down to one question: Can Simone Biles stay in bounds? That question was answered by what turned out to be the most iconic image of the Games: Biles and teammate Jordan Chiles bowing down to their new queen.

The News Cycle Missed Some Stellar Moments, but I Didn’t

With all the excitement of the Biles-led redemption tour and Pommel Horse Guy and a podium moment worthy of the Louvre itself—not to mention, you know, attention drawn to the bonkers U.S. presidential race and a continuing deluge of harrowing news from around the world—there were more than a few gymnastics moments that just didn’t fit into the timeline. Well, I made room in the timeline to give the unsung heroes of Bercy Arena the shine they deserved—and to hazard a guess at the one question Simone Biles correctly refuses to answer: What’s next for gymnastics?

Simone Biles Is Tired but Possibly Not Retired

Biles is sure of only two things right now: that she’s going to savor this moment, and that she is never competing the double pike vault again. (In the Netflix documentary, she revealed that she is afraid she might die literally every time she throws that skill!) And while 27 is by no means old in any universe, for an Olympic champion gymnast it is old enough that Biles is not sure she’ll ever compete again at all. She did, however, refuse to shut the door entirely on the possibility of a home-country comeback. So, not unlike Tokyo, we leave gymnastics in the Paris Olympics on an uncertain note. However, very much unlike Tokyo, that uncertainty brings with it a deep sense of vindication, satisfaction, and relief. And if that isn’t worthy of a rest—whether that nap lasts an hour, four years, or forever—I don’t know what is."
There’s a Big Reason Things Haven’t Escalated Between Iran and Iran.,https://slate.com/advice/2024/08/mil-property-behavior-care-and-feeding.html,"Slate Plus members get more Care and Feeding every week. Have a question about kids, parenting, or family life? Submit it here!

Dear Care and Feeding,

My mother-in-law and my husband jointly own a property with two houses. MIL lives in the smaller house, and me, my husband and our 9-month-old baby live in the larger house. MIL helps watch the baby regularly, which is great. We have put in more boundaries about her coming over unannounced since I moved in a few years ago. But she is still over about five days a week to see us and the baby (which is more than I want, but my husband likes it). What I’m struggling with is a strange behavior that she’s started exhibiting recently.

She has a serious inability or unwillingness to join us for group functions at our place! She is often hours late to an event or leaves just as it is time to sit down and eat. For example, we had dinner for a major holiday for us, my MIL, and my parents. We gave her a 30-minute warning before the food would be ready, but she was still 45 minutes late and managed to miss everyone eating together. Another example: MIL, husband and his friend were over and we ordered takeout for everyone. Once the food arrived, she just left, no explanation or excuse offered. Another time, I invited MIL and our neighbor (who MIL loves) over to watch fireworks. MIL was about two hours late for this small gathering, which I thought would only last for about two hours. I don’t think she’s trying to be rude, but I find it rude and frustrating and think it sets a bad example. As our child grows up, I would like to have MIL be on time for events and have her sit down with us for a family meal on occasion. My husband says she has social anxiety, but these are small gatherings with people she sees all the time. How can I get her to show up on time for events and actually sit down with us for a meal?

—Want Structured Time

Dear Want Structured Time,

I get why you’re frustrated by your mother-in-law’s lateness. But I don’t see a way to force someone to be punctual when they’re not. And if your mother-in-law does experience anxiety when socializing or dining with others, consider that what feels like a small, low-stress gathering to you might be more overwhelming for her.

I have a close friend who is socially anxious, though I didn’t realize it for years because we’d mostly done things 1:1 or with our families. I started inviting them to hang out with me and another friend or a group of friends and assumed they’d be fine with that, but then they let me know that those situations are difficult for them, particularly on short notice. So now I mention it ahead of time if I’m thinking of inviting another friend or a whole group of people—sometimes they tell me that’s fine and they’ll be there; sometimes they say they’d rather not. They get to decide whether they’re up for a larger group thing, and either way, I know that they value our friendship and I’ll get to see them soon.

You aren’t wrong to keep inviting your mother-in-law to these gatherings—it wouldn’t be kind to stop inviting her altogether—but I think you (or better yet, your husband) can say something like, “We’d really like you to join us for this holiday dinner. We’ve invited [names of other people] over. But if it’s easier or better for you to celebrate with us separately, with just our family, that’s ok too.” It could also be worth one of you asking her, in a nonjudgmental way, what obstacles exist—since right now, all you have are guesses—and whether there is any way you you’re your spouse could address those in order to spend more time with her socially.

If your mother-in-law’s social anxiety is responsible for her behavior with you, and she feels like it’s interfering with her life in some way she doesn’t like, it’s up to her to decide to seek support or treatment. In the meantime, I think you can try to be as understanding as possible, let her know you’d like to see her for events if she’s willing, and meet her where she is, not expect her to always socialize with you exactly when you want on your terms.

I brought up the subject of a vasectomy a few months ago, and my husband was OK with the idea and asked me to get some recommendations. I did—I found a doctor for him in our area who people swear by—and gave him the brochure. He said he’d make an appointment that week. Now it’s been three months. The topic comes up every once in a while, and he always says, “Oh yeah, I still need to schedule that so we can have sex more.” Then he doesn’t do it…"
There’s a Big Reason Things Haven’t Escalated Between Iran and Iran.,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/08/kamala-harris-gaza-israel-protest-reaction.html,"“If you want Donald Trump to win, say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking.”

So said Vice President Kamala Harris at her rally in Michigan on Wednesday night after being interrupted for the second time by pro-Palestinian protesters (and after meeting with leaders of the “uncommitted” movement, which withheld support from President Joe Biden in the primary to signify dissatisfaction with U.S. policy toward Israel, before the rally).

Harris’ shutdown of the protesters played well in the rally: People enthusiastically cheered. And being heckled is frustrating: I have never run for president, but once, while giving a toast at my father’s birthday, I was heckled by his friend. It’s been more than a decade, and I’m still annoyed about it (John). But moving forward, perhaps the question for the campaign, which has, over the past few weeks, effectively crafted and stuck to a message on basically everything else, is: What is the message that they want to get out about Israel and Gaza? What will excite voters? What will keep people engaged? What will keep the largest coalition possible, including and especially in important swing states like Michigan, on board?

This will hardly be the last time Harris faces protesters at her rallies. In these moments, is her best option to shut down protesters—or to acknowledge why they’re there and reiterate a commitment to working toward a cease-fire and related, shared goals?

Some argued that this approach did not work for Biden. The journalist Yair Rosenberg, for example, noted on social media, “Biden did exactly this, it did not work. Harris was there and saw it happen. As the saying goes, she didn’t just fall out of a coconut tree. … In general, if you want to influence a politician, you have to bargain and give them a little space, not just make constant demands, or they will determine that you can’t be appeased and aren’t worth it.”

Leaving aside the differences between Biden and Harris—he is the president and effectively in charge of American foreign policy, and she is not; he was apparently holding smaller events to avoid protesters, which she is obviously not—it is true that there is no single message or combination of words that will “mollify” protesters, at least as long as the war goes on. But it is also true that this is not only a conversation between Harris and protesters. It’s between Harris and American voters, in Michigan and beyond.

Generally speaking, Americans do not like protesters and protests. But also, generally speaking, Americans do want a cease-fire, and have for some time, though they overwhelmingly reject a cease-fire deal that does not include a return of the hostages held in Gaza since Hamas’ attack on Oct. 7. This is what distinguishes pro-Palestinian protesters from, say, anti-abortion hecklers: Though people may disagree with them on specifics and on tactics, Americans who are considering coming out to vote for Harris broadly agree with them that the war in Gaza should stop.

Advertisement

Harris can’t, at present, stop the war, and she can’t make protests stop or go away. But, at the risk of sounding like a political Pollyanna, she can try to take these moments when they happen—which, again, they will—to keep her campaign on message: to keep it about freedom, joy, human dignity, and empathy.

Advertisement

She has a way to do this. She can acknowledge her own disappointments with the war’s length and brutality, while noting the things she has done: She told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that it’s time to end the war and has met with stakeholders from across the political spectrum, including with the “uncommitted” activists.

Advertisement

That’s not a substitute for a policy position paper on Gaza, and Harris should expect to continue to be asked how she would bring about a cease-fire. She should anticipate that, regardless of how she responds at a rally, she will be pushed on things like the arms embargo that, on Thursday, a top Harris aide said she is against.

Advertisement

And again, some might argue that this still would not “shut down” or “satisfy” the protesters. But why would it? Nothing anyone says can stop these protests—the protesters are not angry about language, but about action. The point of the protests is to keep the issue of Gaza at the fore and ideally and eventually try to change policy. They will not stop until the war ends. (Given that many activists have also become passionately opposed to, for example, Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and treatment of Palestinians more generally, they might not even stop then.) Harris’ goal, in responding to them, should not be to just shut them down or shut them up, but to respond accurately with what she thinks about their concerns, in a way that serves her own campaign and its message.

I cannot say for certain how reiterating that she would work toward a cease-fire and ending suffering for Palestinians (and the families of Israeli hostages) if elected would have gone over at the rally, or what it would have meant for follow-on stories from Michigan. But clearly stating her commitments and values around this issue would probably have been more effective—as a campaign message to all voters—than putting out a statement to that same effect after the rally.

Trump would almost certainly be worse, from a human rights perspective, on issues related to Israel, much as he would almost certainly be worse, from a human rights perspective, on every other issue. We know this because of his record in his first term and also because, during this campaign, he has criticized the Biden administration for holding Netanyahu back and has taken to using “Palestinian” as a racist slur.

Advertisement

But we also know that “not Trump” cannot be counted on as a reason for people to go to the polls. And we know, based on the past 10 months, that Israel’s war against Hamas and in Gaza is a potentially significantly divisive issue for the Democratic Party. And we know that as the war—which most Americans do want to see come to an end—is not over, pro-Palestinian protests are not going away.

Politicians hold rallies to get out their message and excite voters. Those rallies will be interrupted by protesters from time to time. And in those moments, it’s one thing to regain control of the rally and continue speaking. It’s another to consider—as a politician and as a person—what it is, in these moments, that you want to say."
There’s a Big Reason Things Haven’t Escalated Between Iran and Iran.,https://slate.com/culture/2024/08/olympics-paris-los-angeles-2028-summer-games-takeaways-car-free-economy-infrastructure.html,"This is part of Slate’s 2024 Olympics coverage. Read more here. If you’re enjoying our coverage from Paris, join Slate Plus to support our work.

With just 72 hours of the Olympic Games remaining, Paris officials are finally beginning to relax. The finish line is in sight. The haters have been defeated by what all the papers are calling the national parenthèse enchantée [a magic break?] of Olympic pride. The mayor even used the word fuck a bunch of times in a French-language interview with Le Monde.

For some visitors in Paris, though, the stress is just beginning. These are the officials from Los Angeles, including City Council President Paul Krekorian, who have been enrolled in “classes” every day to learn how to do an Olympics. At Sunday night’s closing ceremony, L.A. Mayor Karen Bass will accept the Olympic Flag, and with it, the burden of planning this expensive, complicated, and highly scrutinized spectacle.

To understand the challenges facing Los Angeles, which was awarded the 2028 Games at the same time that Paris won the 2024 Games, I spoke to journalist Alissa Walker. Walker is chronicling the road to the Los Angeles Olympics in her excellent newsletter, Torched. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

You took the best Olympic blog title, Torched. Congrats! But the subtitle is: “So L.A. doesn’t get burned.” Can you expand on that?

Alissa Walker: The name has a dual meaning. Obviously, we don’t want to shoulder these catastrophic financial burdens and infrastructural crises that other cities have. But then we’ve also been communicated to by the organizing committee and city leaders that this won’t happen to us. We’re the exception. Everything is different in L.A., and we’ve done this before, and we turn a profit, and we don’t build venues, and we didn’t even have traffic [during the previous Los Angeles Olympics] in 1984, apparently.

The other meaning is that it’s going to be really hot. And my biggest concern is that we will literally be getting burned four years from now, in a city that has done next to nothing to mitigate the effects of extreme heat. I’m terrified for people, millions more people, moving around this city and trying to get places in July and August. Our tree canopy is desolate, and part of that is because of the legacy of previous Olympics. The 1932 Olympics planted tens of thousands of palm trees. So we really set ourselves up for that.

Tree planting legacy: good. Type of tree you planted: not so good. I’ve heard these are going to be a car-free Games, how realistic is that?

Advertisement

I’m worried the language is starting to shift, and I’m actually a little bit upset if they start to roll back the “car-free games” promise, because I think it was appropriately shocking to people. It might have gotten our brains really wrapped around what’s possible, not just for the Olympics, but for a city that also has some of the worst air in the country and skyrocketing rates of traffic deaths. It’s always in quotes, which is really funny, like we couldn’t possibly do it.

Advertisement

It’ll be a similar thing to Paris, where we’ll have these new security perimeters that are going to go up around all the events, and it’s going to be very hard for people to get there in cars. We are building a lot of transit. We’re building more rail than any U.S. city, for sure, maybe even any North American city. We’re putting in dedicated bus lanes to have buses go faster than cars on any given day, and then we’ll have this supplemental bus system that will help move athletes and spectators around the city.

Advertisement

Advertisement

What we don’t have, and what we have no real plans for, are the kind of connective tissues that are going to get people to the buses, to the trains, without cars. It’s more like a park-and-ride Olympics.

That just doesn’t sound as good, does it? The other component that echoes what’s going on in Paris is the “no-build Olympics.”

In the same way that I’ve started to notice a language shift from “car-free” games to “transit-first” games, I recently got a press release from L.A. ’28 that called it the “no new permanent venues” plan. A slight shifting of the goalposts.

Advertisement

Advertisement

For example, we have this convention center downtown. Part of it is from the ’70s and part of it is from the ’90s, and you can tell. This discussion has been going on for decades about a true plan to modernize the convention center.

Advertisement

Now, what they proposed to do before the Olympics is stitch it together with a new addition. This will be the most expensive table tennis venue in history, because we are going to be spending billions of dollars to expand our convention center in a very short timeframe.

Advertisement

Advertisement

Advertisement

Is this an example of using the Olympics to push forward infrastructure that the city kind of needed to build anyway?

By picking the quick-build in four years, we are completely ignoring the fact that what we need to do is tear the whole thing down and build a brand-new convention center that actually fits our needs.

Well, are there infrastructure projects that should be happening in the region anyway that are being accomplished for the Olympics? I know there’s this “Twenty-eight by ’28” vision of accomplishing important transit projects (Paris had made some deadlines, and missed some); there’s the perennial dream of fixing the Los Angeles River (as Paris shows, it’s not so easy); high-speed rail to San Francisco?

Advertisement

Twenty-eight by ’28: This was a proposal to speed up 28 projects ahead of the Games. It wasn’t a capital improvements list. It was a “We’re aiming for the dream, we don’t have enough money, and we don’t really have a plan to get it” list. So I think we’ll end up getting maybe like six or seven of those.

The subway going to Westwood, where the athletes will be staying in UCLA dorms, is scheduled to be finished in 2027. This is the Purple Line, or D Line, coming from downtown. That’s going to be a real nailbiter, because we aren’t quite delivering our transit on time.

Advertisement

Advertisement

Then you have really exciting projects that we definitely can get done in time. They want to put a really nice bus rapid-transit line that goes down Vermont Avenue, one of the highest transit-ridership corridors in the region. That would be a really transformative project, and something I’m really cheering for.

Advertisement

How about this Festival Trail idea—this greenway cutting across the whole city?

Advertisement

We have no real regional vision, from the top down, for how to move people around beyond the trains and buses. So you have these grassroots concepts that are really starting to take hold. The Festival Trail would be this 22-mile, nonvehicular, linear park, a walking and biking corridor that would connect most of the major venues, similar to the way Paris put in this amazing network of dedicated lanes connecting a lot of the venues.

It’s not an official project, though.

But it’s got a huge list of supporters, so you’re delivering a pretty good idea directly to the mayor or L.A. ’28 and saying, “Hey, just put your name on this. This would be a great way for you to cut down on traffic and tell people how easy it is to get around to these Games that you’re planning.”

You know how they pass those Olympic laws where the Coca-Cola Company can arrest you for saying “Free Tibet,” or whatever? Maybe you could just slip a little rider in there that says the city can just build a big bike lane and nobody can stop them.

A lot of other cities [in the region] are hosting events, and some are actually doing such a good job at planning for this very basic pedestrian, bike, urban-greening infrastructure. Long Beach, for example, which is hosting a bunch of events, passed this huge plan, Elevate 2028.

They’ve gone through the whole city and said, Where are visitors going to be? Where do we need to widen sidewalks? Where do we need to widen bike lanes? Where do we need to plant trees? Looking at things like parks and libraries and fire stations, all these ways that they can really use the Games to create that legacy infrastructure. And we aren’t seeing the same thing from the city of L.A.

Advertisement

Advertisement

It’s like we promised we wouldn’t do anything to change the city, so we’re really not going to change it at all.

Taking no-build to its logical conclusion. One of the other concerns people raise about the Olympics is the one-way ratchet of policing and security, and the expulsion of the homeless.

Advertisement

Advertisement

We’re already under this federal security designation. Basically, the Secret Service is in charge of everything (I’ve heard they’ve been in the news lately) four years out from the Games, the longest in advance it’s ever been done. It’s a wild thought: We might already be seeing the effects of the overpolicing and surveillance.

When you look at what happened in ’84, there was federal money coming into local law enforcement for what they called “sanitizing downtown,” moving people around. Now people in L.A. County cities are talking about that after [the Supreme Court’s ruling in] Grants Pass. Our mayor [Karen Bass] has said we’re not going to criminalize homelessness, but other mayors in L.A. County, and our Gov. Gavin Newsom, are all saying: “It’s OK to move people, we’re done pretending we’re going to offer shelter.” And we aren’t building enough housing still and it doesn’t look like we plan to. So you do worry these types of schemes are going to accelerate.

Advertisement

I could believe it, but I find it inconceivable—even putting the ethics aside, just logistically—that L.A. could put Skid Row somewhere else in four years.

Our mayor has tried valiantly for a different approach, and it might be working: Unsheltered homeless numbers have decreased. Maybe more of a New York City future [where most homeless people sleep in shelters] for us. But permanent housing needs to be part of this Olympic legacy. There is a new philanthropic group [Bass] started, LA4LA, tapping wealthy people to give money for housing solutions. The real legacy needs to be more housing, and we need to build a lot of it by 2028. That’s the legacy, even if we’re a no-build Olympics. That will help us solve our problems.

I saw Los Angeles City Council President Paul Krekorian here in Paris. He said he’s been learning from the city of Paris. What’s one lesson you hope he takes away from his time here?

I saw an interview with him where he said a “car-free” Games is not reasonable because in L.A “you need a car.” I would challenge Paul Krekorian, who is also on the [regional transit agency] L.A. Metro board, to use his time in Paris to see how easy it is to get around without a car, and then hopefully bring those ideas back here and start to figure out how to implement them, so that in four years, nobody would say that about this city.

There’s a Big Reason Things Haven’t Escalated Between Iran and Iran.,https://slate.com/life/2024/08/jd-vance-tim-walz-trump-kamala-religion.html,"In 2021, when J.D. Vance was asked at a conference why he had converted to Catholicism just two years earlier, he had a fairly simple answer.

“I really liked that the Catholic Church was just really old,” he said.

This anti-modern worldview is key to understanding Vance. In a party long dominated by anti-intellectual evangelical Christians with a hearty distrust of institutions, Vance stands out among its leaders for having embraced a church with a complex social doctrine built off the work of ancient philosophers. His enthusiasm for a particular and relatively obscure kind of contemporary Catholic political thought shows up in his politics—his longing for Americans to build robust nuclear families, his comments about banning porn, his scorn for childless cat ladies. It’s tempting to see these stances as old ones from the Christian right, familiar to anyone who has followed the evolution of the GOP in the past couple of decades, but Vance’s past comments indicate that they’re motivated by something newer, and more radical, than that.

Vance wasn’t always so unusual among his fellow Republicans: He grew up loosely evangelical Christian; he writes in Hillbilly Elegy that his commitment to his father’s church was strong but short-lived. As a young man, he identified for a while as an atheist. Then, as he recounted in a 2020 essay about his conversion for the Catholic magazine the Lamp, he reconnected with Christianity when he was searching for greater meaning in his life during law school. He began to feel drawn to Catholicism in particular after reading up on Catholic moral philosophers and discussing theology with conservative Dominican friars he knew.

Advertisement

After he officially converted in 2019, Vance explained in an interview with his friend Rod Dreher—a conservative writer and Catholic convert who later went on to convert, again, to Orthodox Christianity—that he had come to Catholicism in part because of the writings of Saint Augustine. “Augustine gave me a way to understand Christian faith in a strongly intellectual way,” Vance said. “As someone who spent a lot of his life buying into the lie that you had to be stupid to be a Christian, Augustine really demonstrated in a moving way that that’s not true.”

Advertisement

Advertisement

Advertisement

This approach generally made sense for Vance, a man who, despite his boasts of blue-collar roots, clearly considers himself a serious intellectual.

Advertisement

But as Vance would explain at that 2021 conference (held by the Napa Institute, a conservative Catholic organization), he was also drawn to Catholicism for its rules and relative stability over centuries. “I felt like the modern world was constantly in flux,” Vance said. “The things you believed 10 years ago were no longer acceptable to believe 10 years later.”

In the past few weeks, Vance has come under fire for resurfaced comments attacking “childless cat ladies” as “miserable” and bad for society; claiming that childless people tend to be “deranged” and “psychotic”; and proposing giving extra voting power to parents with young children.

“We have, I believe, a civilizational crisis in this country,” Vance said at the 2021 Napa Institute event. “Even among healthy, intact families, they’re not having enough kids such that we’re going to have a long-term future in this country.” For his Senate campaign, also in 2021, Vance praised Hungarian strongman Viktor Orbán for policies that incentivized marriage and children. Orbán’s government had offered loans to married couples that were forgiven if the couple stayed together and had three children. (Orbán is not himself Catholic but has privileged Christianity in a country dominated by Catholicism.) “Why can’t we do that here?” Vance asked. “Why can’t we actually promote family formation?”

Advertisement

These anti-modern comments fit with a certain kind of worldview that prizes a traditional and family-oriented society above individual liberties—and even democracy. It’s a guiding philosophy of a new faction of the conservative movement that pulls from elements of both the left and far right, that champions populist economics and radically conservative social policies, and that promises a revolution in the entire political order: the postliberal right.

In recent years, a sect of the Republican Party has boomeranged away from libertarianism and toward Big Government. A set of young legislators, including Vance, Marco Rubio, Tom Cotton, and Josh Hawley, is snubbing the party’s policies favoring tech companies and big business, instead infusing the GOP with populist energy—and, in some cases, disdain for the liberal political order. (Liberalism here refers to the dominant political order of the modern world, with its emphasis on equality, personal liberty, and individual rights.) Those legislators who identify with the postliberal right advocate for state authority in order to build the kind of society they want to live in. They aim to control women’s reproductive choices and individual freedoms concerning gender, sexuality, and identity; they prefer isolationist economic policies; they support unions and labor protections and oppose immigration; and they seek to elevate religious organizations’ place in their schools and civic institutions.

A significant number of these legislators are influenced by Christian nationalism or philosophies that mirror the aims of Christian nationalism: to reclaim society and reorder it according to Christian values. The idea is to use soft power to gain control of the major secular institutions to align them with Christian aims, without too much concern for democratic processes.

At a practical level, we’ve seen this in the efforts in state legislatures to have schools display the Ten Commandments; in certain policy groups coming out to oppose no-fault divorce; in Florida’s restrictions on health care for transgender adults; in Project 2025’s plan to criminalize porn (or other materials deemed indecent that can be categorized as porn); in legal challenges to get prayer in public schools; and in Hawley’s proudly pronouncing himself to be “calling America a Christian nation.”

There’s a term for intellectual Catholics with a similar worldview: integralists. There’s no universally accepted platform uniting integralists; it’s more of an intellectual framework built around the idea that Catholic moral theology should govern society. Mat Schmalz, a religious studies professor at College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, defined it simply as the idea of “integrating spiritual and worldly, or integrating church and state.” In other words: church before state.

Vance gave the keynote address at a 2022 conference organized by Sohrab Ahmari, another Catholic convert and conservative intellectual, at Franciscan University of Steubenville, in Ohio. The conference gathered integralist and so-called postliberal Catholic thinkers to discuss policies and tactics to bring the country in harmony with their understanding of Christian values. (Extreme proposals, such as a ban on commerce on Sundays, were floated alongside ideas often associated with the left, such as paid parental leave and antitrust action.) Ahmari has written two books laying out the case for his postliberal ideas. His particular vision of society would place a check on the destructive nature of modern capitalism and build a strong social safety net with financial support for struggling parents and people with disabilities and mental health struggles—but also banish abortion, porn, same-sex marriage, divorce, and drugs. Autonomy and individual liberty would be de-emphasized, meaning that people with addiction and mentally ill unhoused people would be given institutional care even if they didn’t want it.

That wasn’t an isolated incident for Vance: At a 2023 speech at the Catholic University of America by the postliberal scholar Patrick Deneen, Vance “strode into the room, made a bee-line for Deneen and wrapped him in an enthusiastic hug,” according to Politico. Deneen and Ahmari are two of the leading voices in a small group of Catholic scholars who frequently discuss and co-write treatises on integralist and postliberal ideas. Another, Harvard Law professor Adrian Vermeule (another Catholic convert), spoke at Ahmari’s 2022 conference that Vance attended.

Vance does not claim to be an integralist. We don’t know if he wants to put church over state or enmesh the two. But Schmalz thinks that Vance’s views, particularly around policing gender expression, indicate that he is at least “pulling from a Catholic integralist strain.”

At the Catholic University of America event, Politico reported, Vance identified as “a member of the ‘postliberal right.’ ” More recently, in the foreword he wrote for a book by Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts, another Catholic, recently republished by the New Republic, Vance praised Roberts for “articulating a fundamentally Christian view of culture and economics” that recognizes “that virtue and material progress go hand in hand.”

“Roberts sees a conservatism that is focused on the family,” Vance wrote about the architect of Project 2025. “In this, he borrows from the old American Right that recognized—correctly, in my view—that cultural norms and attitudes matter.”

Setting aside political debates among Catholic intellectuals, the Catholic Church itself is technically aligned with Vance’s stances. The church under Pope Francis certainly encourages a less individualistic outlook. And it shares Vance’s ideas about gender and family, as seen in its official ban on birth control—in practice ignored by the vast majority of Catholics—and in Francis’ declaration that it is “selfish” to have pets instead of children. (These men often, however, express dismay at Francis’ leadership, given the ways he has curtailed certain traditional worship practices and emphasized tolerance and compassion over policing sexual morality.)

The idea of forcing those values onto all of American society, through governmental policy, is what sets integralists apart from other traditionalist Catholics.

“It’s an idealization of the Middle Ages,” said Steven Millies, a professor of public theology at Catholic Theological Union in Chicago. As Millies sees it, the efforts among conservatives to push “classical education” in schools and the efforts by traditionalist Catholics to worship with Latin masses, in the style of 16th-century Catholics, come from the same impulse. “All these things are selective rereading of the past.”

This longing for an imagined simple past, Millies said, is something that has drawn cultural reactionaries to the faith for decades. “You gaze at stained-glass windows and Gothic architecture and you look at the orderliness of a 2,000-year-old tradition, and it looks like a rock to cling to in the torrents of modern life,” he said. “The present is disturbing to people. They feel unprepared for it, overwhelmed by it.”

In Millies’ view, though, it doesn’t matter if Vance has a coherent articulation of some kind of postliberal political theology. Vance, he argues, isn’t so much buying into a niche Catholic ideology as advocating for collapsing the walls between church and state—perhaps in an effort to cope with the discomfort of the modern world—with some vaguely Christian reasoning built around that impulse. What matters more, Millies says, is that Vance is expressing a vision for taking us back in time to an imagined past. “It reflects a desire to regain control,” Millies said.

Vance, it seems, is optimistic the country is headed that way. As he said at the Napa conference: “I believe, I really do, that the next 30 years in this country is going to be really exciting, really prosperous, and really good for Christian virtue and the values that we care about.”"

There’s a Big Reason Things Haven’t Escalated Between Iran and Iran.,https://www.jpost.com/health-and-wellness/article-813699,"As Israelis await the threatened attack from Iran and its proxies in retaliation for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, many worry about American military support.

Still, a whole lot of Israeli women are concerned about a very different kind of support and wonder: Should they wear their bras to sleep?

For those who haven’t had the experience of running to a bomb shelter at a moment’s notice when a siren sounds, announcing that missiles or rockets from an enemy are headed your way, it’s essential to understand that here in Israel, you have between 15 to 90 seconds to make it to safety, depending on where you live. There’s not a lot of time to get yourself looking presentable.

Some Israelis have a safe room right in their apartments, so for them, it is not an issue, but those in older buildings tend to have to flee to a communal building bomb shelter or take cover on the stairs. In these cases, you come face to face with all your neighbors, and you may not want to let it all hang out with the people you see in the corridor daily.

The subject has been much discussed on social media, with typical Israeli black humor. A recent report on Channel 12 News about Israeli preparedness for the war referenced a Facebook debate in which one Tel Aviv woman posted a photo of IDF spokesman R.-Adm. Daniel Hagari with the words, “A full briefing by the IDF spokesman and he didn’t say the most important thing: Yes bra or no bra?” Dozens responded, with one expressing the general sentiment, which was overwhelmingly anti-bra: “If I’m going to die, I’ll die the way I was born.” White brassiere. (credit: Wikimedia Commons)

In another Tel Aviv Facebook group, a post headlined, “Ladies, put your bras on,” after the Haniyeh killing, drew responses such as, “I’m not putting on a bra for any man; I’ll go out to the stairwell in my Felix the Cat pajamas.” Tel Aviv being Tel Aviv, one man said he had many bras that he had saved for a “festive occasion” and offered to provide them to his bra-less single female friends; a debate ensued over whether he was a cross-dresser, and he promised to answer the question, but only in a private message. Another guy plunged into the discussion, saying he had a safe room in his apartment and offering it to his lady Facebook friends, telling them, “No bra, no problem.”

Bra-wearing during attacks

But as with so many Israeli issues, there is a secular-religious divide, and while residents of largely secular Tel Aviv may be content to let their girls go free, in Jerusalem, the atmosphere is a bit different. “On October 7, I was fast asleep when the first siren sounded, and I just jumped up and ran to the shelter wearing what I was wearing,” said one Jerusalem woman.

Jerusalem has had relatively few missile attacks during the war, just about 15 compared with hundreds or thousands in the rest of the country, but there were five or six the day the war broke out. And let’s not forget the April 14 attack from Iran, which targeted Jerusalem heavily. “So there I was, wearing a tank top, a skinny tank top, and sweatpants, she recalled. “And there were all my neighbors; about half are religious. It was Simchat Torah, the men were in the white shirts and black pants. And they were all staring at the floor.” She is now in the “be-prepared” category. “Since then, I always wear a bra to sleep.”

In some of the recent social-media discussions about attack attire, it turned out that there are products available that might help the situation. Among them is a whole category of what is called “sleep bras,” created for well-endowed women and nursing mothers but which presumably could fit the bill when the hills are alive with the sound of missiles. Women asked where they could be purchased and shared links to websites selling them.

While those selling home generators, flashlights, and bottled water are doing brisk business lately, don’t be surprised if business is also booming at your local lingerie store."
There’s a Big Reason Things Haven’t Escalated Between Iran and Iran.,https://slate.com/life/2024/08/tim-walz-vance-harris-service-military-guns.html,"Earlier this week, newly internet-beloved Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz was wearing a camo hat when he accepted Kamala Harris’ phone call asking him to join her on the presidential ticket. On Wednesday, the Harris campaign said that $1 million worth of “Harris/Walz”–logoed camo hats—looking very similar to a “Midwest Princess” cap sold by singer Chappell Roan—had been purchased. The popularity of the hat gestures toward Walz’s image as a Guy Who Shoots Guns. In her introduction of her running mate, Harris mentioned that Walz repeatedly won the congressional sharpshooting contest; he’s taken a dig at the Republican VP candidate, J.D. Vance, in a quip that doubles as a reminder that Walz routinely goes pheasant hunting in the state where he serves as governor.

For onlookers not as familiar with the internal politics of gun ownership, who hear that the governor served more than two decades in the National Guard, “Walz is a gun guy” may seem like an obvious bona fide to add to his list of Midwestern dad attributes (hot dish fan, turkey observer, state fair attendee). But as demonstrated by Vance’s new “stolen valor” line of attack against Walz, debuted on Wednesday, the GOP will try to poke holes in this image any way it can. At the time of this writing, these holes appear to be small at best, but we are in the early days of a fight that could be as protracted as the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth campaign targeting John Kerry’s record in 2004.

If the “stolen valor” attack is familiar, there’s another epithet that’s a little less so. The idea that Walz is a gun poser is apparent in a tweet from former National Rifle Association spokesperson Dana Loesch, who accused Harris of “trying to burnish Walz’s Fudd credentials.” For those who aren’t hip-deep in American gun culture, those words might as well be in another language. What was Loesch on about? What is a “Fudd,” why did the post that Loesch quote-tweeted include that weird web comic, and why might Harris think putting a Fudd on the ticket would help win voters?

As a proud Fudd, I’m excited to see this word front and center in the national conversation. The term comes from the almost 90-year-old Looney Tunes cartoon character Elmer Fudd, a bumbling hunter constantly outwitted by his prey—from Bugs Bunny to Daffy Duck to his own backside. Operative here is that Elmer Fudd winds up shooting himself in the foot (a perennial outcome of the Looney Tunes episodes in which he appears) not because his quarry is particularly clever but rather because he is utterly incompetent.

The term Fudd appeared in Urban Dictionary as early as 2007, as an epithet slung by those at the 2A (short for Second Amendment, or gun enthusiast) community’s fringe in the direction of those of us who own one or two guns and enjoy hunting and shooting but don’t engage in competition shooting, don’t own a Liberty Safe with 57 firearms in it, and certainly see no need to acquire an AR-15. Fudds are far more likely to support the kinds of gun control legislation Walz advocates for, like universal background checks and red-flag laws. Many of us, myself included, are veterans of law enforcement or the military. Some of us have been to war or been hurt on jobs where we carried weapons professionally.

All that is irrelevant to the likes of Loesch. In the manner of the identitarian essentialism that defines almost all discourse in 2024, we are Fudds, root and branch. Quarterly range time for cops and the military is not enough to qualify as a “gun person” in the anti-Fudd world—an attitude summarized by this delightful comment on a Reddit post: “Your typical infantry meatbag spends more time shooting into a sock than they do on a range.” In the our-tribe-or-the-enemy world of public politics, you’re in the Boogaloo or you’re the incarnation of an incompetent cartoon character, more likely to hurt yourself with your firearm than the deer you’re futilely stalking.

So why would the Harris campaign pick Walz, a veteran, hunter, and lifelong gun owner who used to get the NRA’s coveted “A” rating for gun-policy positions before dramatically altering his stance after the 2017 Harvest music festival mass shooting in Las Vegas, then the Parkland school shooting the following year? Loesch is right that Walz is a classic Fudd—a commonsense shooter who is adamantly pro-2A but sees no reason for the average citizen to carry the same small arms he did in the National Guard. The Firearms Policy Coalition, which emerged in 2013 as an alternative that the anti–gun control fringe hoped might be more effective and less baggage-laden than the NRA, has already trotted out on X a cartoon of Walz as Elmer Fudd, mock-lamenting that it is “gonna get a lot of work” out of the image “over the next few months.” If, in choosing Walz, Harris wants to show America’s gun-owning public that she will meet them halfway, why would she do it with a Fudd? Is her campaign, as many in Loesch and the FPC’s camp seem to believe, utterly out of touch with regular folk outside big liberal cities?

I don’t think so. In picking Walz, the Harris team’s gun policy wonks are likely making a bet on something I have long suspected: that despite the shrieking of 2A’s lunatic fringe, most gun owners in America are Fudds. No study exists (indeed, the criteria haven’t been established) to grade America’s gun enthusiasts from 1 to 10 on a scientific Fudd scale. But there are hints that Fudds of Walz’s stripe form a group evocative of Nixon’s “silent majority”—we’re here, there’s a lot of us, and we don’t sound off on social media because it’s exhausting and occasionally dangerous.

There’s the famous 2017 Harvard and Northeastern study showing that 3 percent of the people own 50 percent of the nation’s guns, with half of gun owners owning only one or two. Further, the juxtaposition of rising rates of gun ownership with declining rates of background checks also suggests that fewer and fewer people own more and more guns. It’s important to note that the 2017 study is disputed and that although this data suggests a correlation, it is not causal proof; however, it certainly mirrors my experience of the majority of shooters in my rural New York town—people I encounter at the range or at events at the gun club, where many of my fellow firefighters shoot and socialize.

Most are staunch 2A advocates who regularly shoot and hunt and also keep guns for home defense. (Many, like me, own shotguns for this purpose—I keep a single Winchester pump-action SXP Defender because I’d far rather scare someone off by loudly racking the slide than actually having to pull the trigger.) Most are on the political right, many vote Trump, and all dig in hard at the thought of an America with European-style restrictions on firearm ownership and access. But they are a far cry from the likes of Loesch and former longtime CEO of the NRA Wayne LaPierre, and because, like me, they own only one or two guns for hunting, sporting, or home defense, support modest gun control legislation, and aren’t really interested in getting into military-grade weapons, they would certainly be decried as Fudds by many on 2A’s more vocal fringe.

Personally, I doubt any of the people I’m describing will be swayed into the Harris camp by Walz’s presence on the ticket, but Harris doesn’t need more voters in solidly blue New York. She needs swing voters in places like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, and Wisconsin. Harris is likely betting that when it comes to gun policy, many of them will be persuaded by seeing a fellow Fudd at the Democratic nominee’s elbow. And when it comes to service, they will note Walz’s years in the National Guard and his advocacy for veterans in Congress and appreciate it. In Walz they may see a member of their own silent majority—responsible gun owners who don’t shout online, threaten civil war, deride armed professionals for a lack of firearm-related enthusiasm, or envision the United States as a future Mogadishu, where only recently the government was forced to ban citizens from carrying military-grade weaponry in the streets. We, the Fudds, are relentlessly committed to what we view as reasonable compromises that could reduce the horrific number of American gun deaths, unparalleled elsewhere in the developed world. Is Tim Walz the guy to win our votes? And will those votes be enough to put Kamala Harris in the White House? Only time will tell."
There’s a Big Reason Things Haven’t Escalated Between Iran and Iran.,https://slate.com/technology/2024/08/harris-walz-internet-memes-grassroots-donors-fundraising-camo-hats.html,"When President Joe Biden announced he would step down and make way for Kamala Harris’ ascension to the Democratic nomination, the pent-up energies of liberals, progressives, and even never-Trump moderates flooded the race and boosted Harris to something Democrats had been missing: electoral viability. (She’s now statistically tied with Trump, according to FiveThirtyEight’s polling averages.)

The internet was clearly ready for something different. Armed with Brat memes, coconut emojis, Veep videos, and old videos of Harris speaking like a Chardonnay-addled mom at happy hour, social media users of all shades of blue turned Harris into someone infinitely cooler and more fun than she is in real life. The Harris of the campaign trail is still the same smooth-talking former prosecutor, with plenty of bona fides that should attract voters, but what resonates with Gen Z and millennial voters on Instagram and TikTok, and even cringier Resistance Liberals on Facebook and X, is different. They need a political superhero with catchphrases and signature moves—and that’s what the KHive, now enveloped by the wider internet-using Democratic Party, transformed her into. That’s what the Biden campaign team wanted when they bolstered the once sprightly Joe into a Ray-Banned, ice cream munching, no-malarkey-taking caricature—and then something more sardonic with the Dark Brandon meme.

Even if Harris was handed her nomination, even if her campaign staffers have deftly groomed this persona, even if Harris has been wise enough not to turn her good vibes into something cringe by outwardly playing into the online vibes, she still had the difficult task of picking a running mate that would boost her stature on the campaign trail and online. Or, at least, one who wouldn’t cramp her style. And that’s easier said than done when your cornucopia of options has the demographic makeup of a Wilco concert.

But Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz proved himself as the internet’s favorite white dad with a simple and surprisingly innovative strategy: calling Republicans “weird.” Walz’s Midwestern charm and straight-talking quickly transformed him from someone many Democrats had never heard of into a leading communications strategist—with candidates up and down the ballot following his lead. As it turns out, calling a weird dude like J.D. Vance “weird” is rather effective, and has caused Vance and his party-mates to contort themselves to prove he’s not, in fact, weird. (He is weird.) Now, there’s a simple word that Democrats are using to describe Trump, Vance, and the Republican Party’s fondness for controlling women’s bodies, dreaming up conspiracy theories, and, uh, whatever Trump is talking about with his references to the “late, great Hannibal Lecter.”

Walz ascended to the ticket not by hailing from the most purple of purple swing states—as Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shaprio would have—but by creating a political meme of his own, and one of the most effective ones in recent memory at that. Vance’s favorability has only plummeted since voters have gotten to hear more from him, a trend perhaps aided by the simple word for what he is: weird.

On Tuesday, after Walz was announced as Harris’ vice presidential pick, X was full of memes. “You think you just waltzed out of a coconut tree?” one user wrote. The phrase “Balls to the Walz” was everywhere, as were pictures of the Minnesota governor nestling a piglet in his arms with a beaming smile. Republicans had no response.

And while Harris is steering away from embracing her newfound online persona, Walz is already making references to J.D. Vance and couches, an obviously made-up internet joke that’s stuck to Vance. And the campaign itself is meme-ing Walz, too: It quickly sold $1 million of Harris-Walz camo hats, an attempt to reclaim the middle-of-the-country aesthetic that’s been co-opted by the Republican Party for years. Walz is an avid hunter, after all, and he’s quickly becoming the internet’s all-American dad.

Walz the meme-maker might soon be Walz the vice president. The high school football coach turned politician might have just accomplished his greatest feat yet by listening to the voters and putting their feelings into words. That’s what great politicians do."

There’s a Big Reason Things Haven’t Escalated Between Iran and Iran.,https://slate.com/life/2024/08/oklahoma-classroom-bible-plan-legal.html,"Like the award-winning teacher he once was, the Oklahoma state superintendent of public instruction, Ryan Walters, arrived at his presentation with props in tow. Speaking to the Oklahoma Board of Education on June 27, Walters announced his controversial mandate requiring the Bible in public schools while posing with a stack of five books. Among them? A brand-new copy of Martin Luther King Jr.’s Our God Is Marching On. A copy of The U.S. Constitution: A Reader, a collection compiled by Hillsdale College professors that represents the separation of church and state as a “popular misunderstanding.” And finally, three Bibles, including a copy of The Founders’ Bible, which interleaves the religious text with Christian nationalist writings by discredited “historian” David Barton. As visual aids to Walters’ announcement, these volumes spoke volumes.

At the June Board of Education meeting, Walters justified his decision by describing the Bible as a “necessary historical document” that has inspired American leaders such as Dr. King, whose legacy conservative politicians have increasingly manipulated to their advantage. Going beyond the text of his written memorandum, which states simply that Oklahoma schools must “incorporate the Bible … as an instructional support,” Walters announced that effective this fall, “every teacher, every classroom in the state, will have a Bible in the classroom and will be teaching from the Bible.” In late July, he doubled down, issuing a set of instructional support guidelines that decree that “a physical copy of the Bible, the United States Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and the Ten Commandments [must be provided] as resources in every classroom.”

Walters has leaned heavily on historically inaccurate claims that the Bible is, as he stated at the June meeting, “one of the most foundational documents used for the Constitution.” Yet Walters’ repeated insistence on a Bible in “every classroom” shows that his ideological roots lie not with 18th-century framers like Thomas Jefferson—who placed a library, not a church, at the center of his University of Virginia—but rather with evangelical mass media organizations formed during the 19th century. Like once influential publishers including the American Bible Society and the American Sunday-School Union, Walters understands that the power of print has as much to do with the physical presence of books as it does with the intellectual work of reading.

Advertisement

The American Bible Society was founded in 1816 as a national organization with a single goal: distributing the Bible. Early adoption of cutting-edge printing technologies enabled the society to produce its own inexpensive Bibles on an unprecedented scale. Buoyed by its rapid progress, in 1829 the group launched a campaign to provide a Bible to every American family that needed one—a plan the organization dubbed “General Supply.”

Two other national evangelical publishing organizations—the American Sunday-School Union and the American Tract Society—soon followed suit with similar projects. As media historian David Paul Nord has documented, combined general supply efforts of the 1830s alone resulted in the publication of approximately 1 million Bibles, 15 million religious tracts, and more than 500,000 Sunday school books.

By attempting to circulate publications “in every part of the land,” including regions where print was scarce, general supply programs provided Americans with inexpensive reading materials and contributed to the increase of national literacy rates. But 19th-century evangelical publishers also had another, less generous goal in birthing American mass media: ousting books they didn’t like from readers’ hands.

Advertisement

All three national organizations hoped that mass supply of religious print would stimulate new demand. They also solicited support for their activities by fueling 19th-century fears about the mental and physical effects of reading “improper books.”

At the forefront of this anxious politics was the Sunday-School Union, which argued that secular books including “novels” were “sweet poison” for children. For the union, whose leaders viewed the Bible as “essential to the proper training of the young,” the solution lay in publishing vast quantities of religious children’s texts and introducing them into schools—including schools unaffiliated with the organization. By doing so, union leaders believed they could “force out of circulation those [books] which tend to mislead the mind.”

Advertisement

Such statements advance a logic of physical replacement as much as they insist on the persuasive power of God’s word. If you could just get the right books in the same room as young readers, the Sunday-School Union reasoned, “good little books” would take up space, money, and attention that might otherwise go toward “bad books.”

This 19th-century history raises questions about what, exactly, Walters hopes to achieve by requiring a Bible in “every” Oklahoma classroom. Because by “every classroom,” he really means every classroom.

Although Walters’ July guidelines detail only how the Bible might be incorporated into humanities instruction, he has stated in interviews that the Bible will also be integrated into the study of math and science. Walters has argued that the Bible should be taught to explain its influence on Western civilization and the history of the United States—a proposal, it’s worth noting, that mistakes the text for its reception history. But his insistence on placing physical copies of the Bible in “every classroom” indicates that the intended scope of his program is much broader, even as he has insisted that classroom Bibles are “not to be used for religious purposes such as … proselytizing.” As 19th-century religious organizations well knew, getting religious books in as many places as possible is itself a form of evangelical activity. By implementing his 21st-century version of general supply, Walters promises to use the Bible to occupy both valuable instructional time and the public school classroom as site.

Like the paper-obsessed Donald Trump, who inspired the June mandate and has himself published a Bible better suited for display than reading, Walters understands that books make good props for the art of hijacking attention. That he wants Bibles in the “classroom” rather than a more obvious place for books—the school library—also channels the desire of his evangelical forebears to control what children read.

If 19th-century language about “vice-engendering, lust-influencing, and soul-destroying literature” sounds oddly familiar, you’re not wrong. In Oklahoma, Walters has joined efforts to ban LGTBQ+ children’s books and campaigned for the removal of “pornographic” material from school libraries. Walters’ Bible mandate may appear to divert attention from the state Supreme Court’s late-June rejection of a proposed Catholic charter school supported by taxpayers—an initiative that Walters supported. But the Bible mandate also follows an equally important Oklahoma Supreme Court decision made earlier in June, which checked Walters’ authority over school libraries by determining that decisions about library book selection should remain with local school boards. Although the court shot down Walters’ attempts to wrest control over school libraries, by demanding the inclusion of the Bible in the “classroom” it seems that Walters has found a way to bypass librarians—and put children in the same room as his preferred reading—after all.

As the school year approaches, Walters has yet to answer questions about which Bible edition he would require should his plan be allowed to proceed. Hopefully it’s not The Founders’ Bible, which Barton peppers with out-of-context quotes from historical figures including Thomas Paine, a Deist who once described the Bible as a “book of lies.” Obvious legal questions aside, the presence of Barton’s Christian nationalist book at the Board of Education meeting sends a damning message about Walters’ ability and willingness to uphold basic educational standards. This message has not been lost on Oklahoma school districts, several of which have stated publicly that they will not change their curricula despite the July guidelines. In a subtle clapback to Walters, Jenks Public Schools in suburban Tulsa have insisted they will use only “approved resources aligned to the Oklahoma Academic Standards” in their classrooms.

In the wake of Walters’ mandate, advocacy organizations have stressed that “public schools are not Sunday schools.” But Walters would do well to take a cue from the American Sunday-School Union, which, for all its flaws, valued children’s “desire for knowledge” and believed, without a doubt, that free access to school libraries was of “vital importance” to the next generation’s future."

Tim Walz has been on fire lately. Two weeks after his quip that Donald Trump and J.D. Vance are “just weird” went viral, he has been launched onto the national stage as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate. But Walz’s former students at Mankato West High School, where he taught geography for over 10 years, aren’t all that surprised that he has become an overnight sensation.

Hours after Harris officially announced she had selected Walz as her vice president, I called up Noah Hobbs, a former student at Mankato West, who earlier this week wrote a series of posts on X about his old teacher. “I’m just incredibly proud of him and the way … he conducts himself and how he’s maintained being an authentic, genuine, caring human being in positions that seem to not attract that type of person or those qualities in people,” Hobbs told Slate.

Hobbs graduated high school in 2007 but still vividly remembers Mr. Walz (pronounced “Walls,” despite what Vance might say). On the first day of Hobbs’ sophomore year, as he scanned his new class schedule, a friend told him, “Hopefully you got Mr. Walz for global geography. If not, try to change out and get into that class.” Luckily, Hobbs had been placed in Walz’s class, and he credits that for helping him turn his academic career around. He was a “C-ish student” in high school, but Walz cared deeply about making sure Hobbs was successful, not just in global geography but in every one of his classes. “He made learning exciting,” Hobbs said.

Walz brought an infectious energy to his classroom that, as Hobbs put it, stayed with him throughout the rest of the school day, “like a sugar high that you can’t just stop once you leave the classroom doors.” That energy gave him something to look forward to every day and motivated him to continue coming to school: “OK, I’m going to go. I got Walz at 4. That at least will be a fun class. I will learn something. I will feel like I’m contributing to my academic endeavor,” Hobbs said.

That energy wasn’t limited just to academics either: Walz lit up Mankato West by dressing up as Santa Claus. “He would do fun stuff like this all the time—it’s just who he was,” Tara Borowski, who graduated in 1999, told Slate. She remembers Walz as having lots of school spirit and getting involved in every school function, from prom to sports.

Borowski had Walz as her teacher in 1997 and said he was the guy “everybody seemed to trust and wanted to have, no matter where you were, what clique you were in.” Walz would ask his students to bring in newspaper clippings of the latest news stories, an exercise Borowski said opened her eyes to the wider world beyond her hometown. “He was the first person to get me interested in the news that way and to have that dialogue at that age,” she said.

Walz also organized trips to China for his students, leveraging connections he had established while teaching English there in 1989. Kristina Backman, Mankato West class of 1998, went on one of those nearly three-week-long trips, during which they visited the Great Wall, Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City, and Hong Kong. “When we would eat, he would not tell us what we were eating until we tried everything, because he didn’t want us to say, ‘Oh, that sounds gross!’ ” said Backman. “I appreciated that, because if I had known, there was probably no way I ever would have tried it. It was just such a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I would love to be able to take my kids there someday.”

Kent Wawrzynaik, Borowski’s brother, had Walz not only as a teacher but as a football coach and fondly remembered him as his favorite—a “real good leader.” Ten years after graduating from high school, Wawrzynaik ran into Walz at a local Great Clips, where he was getting a haircut. By this point, Walz had stopped teaching and had become a congressman—and to Wawrzynaik’s surprise, Walz still remembered him. “He’s sincere, he’s really easy to talk to and he’s very knowledgeable,” Wawrzynaik said. “He knows what he’s talking about when he talks, and if he doesn’t, he finds out.”

Throughout each of these conversations, it was obvious that Walz’s students had fond memories of their former high school teacher and were excited for the rest of the world to get a taste of the same kindness and charisma they got to experience firsthand. Especially Hobbs, who kept in touch with Walz well beyond his high school years, as he went on to become a councilman for the city of Duluth. Hobbs launched “100 Cups of Coffee,” an initiative to get his city’s constituents to chat with their local officials in an organic way and have their questions answered. Right as Hobbs was closing in on his goal of having 100 conversations, he got a phone call from his old high school geography teacher. “He was my 100th cup. Came up from the city to a local shop in Duluth, and we spent an hour together reminiscing, talking about old Mankato West and the current state of politics,” Hobbs said.

He’s excited for Walz to bring this sensibility to the presidential race. “Everything that he does is a breath of fresh air and is needed,” said Hobbs. “In the political sphere, I think the way that he’s truly an authentic and genuine human being and truly cares about folks that he interacts with is really important.”"
There’s a Big Reason Things Haven’t Escalated Between Iran and Iran.,https://slate.com/life/2024/08/taylor-swift-eras-tour-kamala-harris-2024.html,"Look, everyone is pretty excited right now. Kamala Harris’ upstart campaign is surging in the polls and her selection of Tim Walz—a favorite of young lefty internet-dwellers—has juiced the vibes to near-2008 levels of hopeful enthusiasm. The race is still tight and it probably will be until November, but I understand why Democrat partisans are eager to keep the party going—even if it means completely fabricating a story in which Taylor Swift has endorsed Kamala Harris through a coded message baked into an Instagram post.

Swift is playing shows in central Europe right now, which I imagine is the, I don’t know, 43rd leg of her never-ending “Eras” tour. Yesterday she uploaded a few snapshots from the show in Warsaw, adopting the usual contractually obligated geniality she tends to offer her fans. (Seriously how can every show you play be the best show ever? We already know that’s not the case!) Anyways, a psychotic contingent of Taylor fans scrolled through the Rolodex of post-show photos and identified a photo where, deep in the background behind Swift and her pink acoustic guitar, you can see an “Eras” tour cast member who looks vaguely like Kamala Harris with her back turned to the crowd. This was all the evidence they needed that their favorite singer had finally—and cryptically—endorsed the presumptive Democratic nominee. Swifties went wild.

“BREAKING NEWS: Taylor Swift is about to reportedly endorse Kamala Harris, she just uploaded this photo to Instagram which appears to have Harris in the background,” someone tweeted breathlessly. “It really feels like it should be a bigger deal that Taylor Swift left a shadow of Kamala on her Instagram post but I don’t really see anyone talking about it,” added another.

I don’t think you need me to tell you that this photo is … not a political endorsement. Swift is almost constantly on stage with backup dancers, and you’d need to blow past several thousand plausible explanations for the identity of the woman—and the framing of the photograph—before settling on the idea that she’s layering her Instagram with subliminal Democratic propaganda. I mean, nobody should be surprised that Swifties went this far out on a limb—that’s kind of the job description—but still, what? Also, why on Earth would Swift come out for Kamala in a way that only a small number of the most brainsick individuals on the planet would notice? It’s not like her political leanings are a secret! Swift supported Joe Biden in 2020 and is a consistent proponent of both abortion access and LGBTQ+ rights. An eventual Harris-Walz endorsement seems inevitable, and I guarantee that she’s not going to make a secret of it.

I suppose this is all evidence for the outsize impact a potential Swift endorsement could carry. She has had 59 Top 10 hits, and the “Eras” tour is capable of generating legitimate economic windfalls in the cities it rolls through. As such, people have been pushing her to come out strongly for Biden (and then Kamala) since 2023—to the point that entire news stories have been written about the absence of her public statements. But come on guys. Let’s be real: A Swift endorsement—while the responsible thing to do and an adroit leveraging of her fame—probably won’t amount to much in November. Celebrity co-signs have to be the most overrated pieces of political capital in the nation: LeBron James endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016. The same year he brought an NBA title to Cleveland. Hillary went on to lose the state by 8 percentage points. And for what it’s worth, I don’t think Hulk Hogan’s appearance at the Republican National Convention is going to amount to much, either.

But again, Kamala partisans want to keep reveling in the good vibes, and a Swift/Kamala/Walz collaboration would certainly give them more to celebrate. (Maybe a special fundraiser concert in her native West Reading, Pennsylvania? A boy can dream.) Or maybe, instead, Swift could do the funniest thing ever and endorse RFK. Now that would be a story."
There’s a Big Reason Things Haven’t Escalated Between Iran and Iran.,https://slate.com/advice/2024/08/boyfriend-naked-oral-looking-sex-advice.html,"How to Do It is Slate’s sex advice column. Have a question? Send it to Jessica and Rich here. It’s anonymous!

Dear How to Do It,

My partner “Chuck” (M 26) and I (F 26) have been together for six years, living together for four. He’s my favorite person on the planet. I trust him completely. We have an active sex life in which I am a very willing and enthusiastic…pillow princess. I’d really like to be more than that! I just feel so stuck.

The situation is one of many nevers: (1) I’ve never been able to suck his dick, probably because (2) despite plenty of nights spent laying awake wishing we’d have sex, I never initiate (let alone lead) our sexual encounters, and also because (3) I never look at us—him?—while we’re naked, so despite five-plus years of pretty frequent sex, I’ve never really seen his dick.

I grew up very touch-phobic for sensory/anxiety reasons. I’ve also always been a bit “innocent.” Practice has made me better, and I now love hugging, cuddling, and having sex with Chuck. But that took a long time. The first few months entailed a lot of him snuggling me while I stayed stock-still. As for kissing, there were several sweet (failed) attempts by him plus ample conversation, but in the end, it took six months, the death of my dad, a lot of alcohol, and his profession of love to get me to stay still and let him kiss me. (We still don’t kiss very much, in or outside of sex. Unless I’m drunk, it sort of squicks me out. I suspect it’s more mental than anything else since he’s a good kisser.)

Advertisement

The point is that if he didn’t initiate and lead the show, nothing was happening, and when he did initiate, I’d spend a lot of time staying very still. Then eventually I’d become comfortable enough to loosen up and engage, meaning I’d willingly move to wherever he guided me. This is still how sex goes now: He guides, I go. That doesn’t work for blow jobs! Conversations about this never went anywhere, save for a few failed attempts in the early years. We’ve hardly discussed it in years. He’s never brought it up, but I feel bad! Plus, who knows—maybe I’d like it. Compounding all this is that my eyes are shut for pretty much the entirety of the bangin’, which means I never see his dick. I’m not even sure I really know what his dick looks like. He did comment on this once, so I know he notices my lack of noticing, which makes me feel bad since he deserves to be seen and appreciated.

Advertisement

All that said: I’d like to be more confident and present in bed. I’d like to reciprocate. Chuck does 100 percent of the heavy lifting, and while he reportedly enjoys the heck out of everything we do, I’m sure he would enjoy more participation on my end. Plus, I suspect I’d enjoy being more active and engaged in our sex life. I mean, it would probably lead to more and better sex. I just don’t know how to make any progress, especially after all this time. Any advice would be much appreciated.

—Does This Count as Oral Fixation?

Dear Does This Count,

Throughout your letter, it sounds like you’re really putting a lot of pressure on yourself to give Chuck what you think he deserves. You say, “You’re sure he would enjoy more participation.” Where’s that coming from—a conversation? What has he said to you about his preferences and desires? Has he told you he’s missing anything? Have you asked? And, crucially, are you able to believe him when he tells you he’s enjoying what you two have going on? If you haven’t talked to him about how you’re feeling yet, start there.

Advertisement

Once you’ve got communication flowing, you could start at any end of this tangle. You might turn the lights down really low before you take your first look at his penis. You might keep them off entirely but try a taste. You can try to spontaneously do a thing he usually guides you into—or guide his hand somewhere you’d like it to go. You might mix things up and go straight for something that really works for you before trying kissing. You’ve got a ton of options, but sometimes that can be overwhelming.

If you’re still stuck, a sex-positive couples counselor or a sex coach might be able to better provide support as you move through this process. I’d recommend working together as a couple over individual appointments to start with, as your letter left me with the impression that you two don’t yet have robust and open communication about your sex lives.

How to Get Advice From How to Do It

Have a nagging (or totally inconsequential) question about sex? It’s fun to see your words in this column! Send it in now.

Dear How to Do It,

How are you supposed to bring up STIs and testing with new people you’re sleeping with? I (F) just got out of a long-term relationship with a boyfriend of 10 years so I really haven’t dated in a long while, and when we first met I was young and stupid so I never asked anyone about any kind of testing before I slept with them. If we had a condom, I figured I was fine. I feel like I should be more responsible now as a grown adult! But how do Responsible Adults go about this? Do I ask about their last test? Do we swap results or do I trust them at their word? And how often should I be getting tested for this stuff?

—Newbie

Dear Newbie,

Advertisement

Advertisement

There’s no one way people have conversations about STIs, and since a conversation is a two or more-person endeavor you’ll find yourself having the talk a bit differently every time you do it.

Advertisement

Yes, ask potential partners when their last test was and how often they get tested. You can get a sense of how often they hook up with new people, which can also be accomplished by directly asking them. Whether you trust people at their word or require seeing their paperwork is up to you, but I personally wouldn’t go to a private place to have sex with someone who I didn’t trust to be honest about their sexual health practices, you know?

Advertisement

How often you should be getting tested, and for what potential infections, is also on a case-by-case basis. Your cadence of testing will depend on how many new partners you’re engaging with and how many partners those partners tend to have. What you need to be tested for will vary based on the populations you’re engaging in sex with and the regions you live in. So your first step is to have a Responsible Adult Conversation with your primary care physician or gynecologist about this stuff.

It might seem daunting at first, but as you get used to having these talks they’ll get easier. You’ll also likely find that you have an easier time discussing other aspects of sexuality along with it. So you get to be responsible and also probably get a skills boost that’ll help you better ask for what you want and listen to what other people want—a win-win.

Dear How to Do It,

I don’t mind giving my boyfriend blow jobs (they’re not my favorite) but I’ve really come to absolutely dread deep-throating. He loves it. He’ll often ask during if I’m enjoying it, and what am I supposed to do except give a mild stifled uh huh of encouragement? I do enjoy how much he enjoys himself when we do it though! So I’m worried about telling him that deep-throating is off the table entirely because then he might not have as much fun. Is there a way to make it better or build up your tolerance at all? If I do put my foot down, how do I even tell him without negating all the times I did pretend to be enjoying myself?

—Throated

Dear Throated,

Advertisement

I mean, you’ve put yourself in this corner by claiming to enjoy something you in fact don’t. There are definitely ways to potentially—possibly, maybe—make deep-throating more enjoyable, but you didn’t give me any data on what exactly you dread about it so I’m feeling around in the dark here. You might get more comfortable with the risk of throwing up, and mitigate that by throwing a towel down or moving to the shower. Maybe sticking your tongue out like you’re waiting for a throat exam helps ease discomfort. Changing the angle might help as well—if you’re usually doing it with him standing, you might try it with him lying on the bed, or even dangling your head off the bed and lying essentially upside down. Also, simply remembering to breathe through your nose can help.

If none of that is working and you have to come clean, being direct and kind in your approach is the way to go.

Dear How to Do It,

I’m a woman in my early 30s, with a long-term partner. In the past three years, I gained weight through a combination of my choices, hormonal changes, and stress. It’s made a huge impact on my sex life—I feel really uncomfortable being seen and grossed out by the idea that my partner could be attracted to me. When we do have sex, I find myself focusing on my stretch marks, the size of my thighs, or the way my belly lies, instead of thinking about my pleasure. Basically, the only sex I can stomach these days if it’s entirely focused on my partner. I don’t really liked to be touched at all.

Advertisement

I know on paper that my body is fine: My doctor swears my blood work and numbers are good, and I’m physically very strong. I bike long distances, carry heavy objects, and haul all my own gear into remote job sites in extreme weather. I can peg my partner for a long time without getting out of breath and recently learned how to do inversions on the pole.

Advertisement

But also, my thighs touch when I walk, I’m two dress sizes bigger than I was, and nothing seems to shift the weight long-term. I’ve noticed a definite difference in how strangers treat me in public, and my parents keep making “gentle” suggestions about dieting, even though I already have been for 18 months. I know my partner is attracted to me: They explicitly say so, and all their celebrity crushes and exes are like me but bigger. But I’m not attracted to me, and it feels like my sex life is spiraling away. What can I do, if I can’t lose the weight?

—Changes

Dear Changes,

Advertisement

It sounds like this is a holistic body image problem that is affecting your sex life more than a real sex problem. The answer to your question is: Accept your body as it is and appreciate it for what it can do for you. In practice, it isn’t that simple. Usually, I’d suggest that you start making lists of things you appreciate about your body, and engage in acts that connect you to your body such as dancing, self-care, and masturbation, but this seems like a more significant issue.

Advertisement

Why do the comments of other people matter? Are you sure strangers are treating you differently in public—over a difference of two dress sizes, no less—or is there maybe something happening with your perception of how they’re treating you? Do you think most people’s thighs don’t touch when they walk? (That’s far from the case.) You’re in good physical shape—by metrics ranging from blood work and cardio capacity to your ability to lift and carry heavy things.

Advertisement

This is about your internalized beauty standards, and you’re not going to feel better about your body until you do some work to uproot those and debunk them. If that feels daunting, get a therapist to help. In the meantime, you might find inspiration in some of the many plus-sized content creators who support themselves by providing spicy content to fans and often provide body positivity content on their social media channels. Gwen Adora and Leila Lewis are two of my favorites. You’ve got this.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer sounded the note of caution after a week of anti-immigrant violence that has scarred communities from Northern Ireland to the south coast of England. Starmer spoke to reporters at a mosque in Solihull, near Birmingham, where demonstrators shut down a shopping center on Sunday.

VIOLENT UK PROTESTS CONTINUE FOR 7TH DAY IN RESPONSE TO DEATHS OF 3 YOUNG GIRLS

""It’s important that we don’t let up here,"" Starmer said. ""And that’s why later on today I’ll have another (emergency) meeting with law enforcement, with senior police officers to make sure that we reflect on last night but also plan for the coming days.""

Police across the U.K. had braced for widespread disorder on Wednesday night after far-right activists circulated a list of more than 100 sites they planned to target, including the offices of immigration lawyers and others offering services to migrants.

But those demonstrations failed to materialize as police and counter-protesters filled the streets.

Carrying signs saying ""Refugees Welcome"" and chanting ""Whose streets? Our streets,"" people turned out in force to protect asylum service centers and the offices of immigration attorneys.

The government also declared a national critical incident, putting 6,000 specially trained police on standby to respond to any disorder. Police said that protests and counter-protests were largely peaceful, though a small number of arrests were made.

""The show of force from the police and, frankly, the show of unity from communities together defeated the challenges that we faced,"" said Commissioner Mark Rowley, the head of London’s Metropolitan Police Service. ""It went off very peacefully last night, and the fears of extreme right disorder were abated.""

But tensions remain high after right-wing agitators fueled the violence by circulating misinformation about the identity of the suspect in a knife attack that killed three young girls in the English seaside town of Southport on July 29. The last child hospitalized in the stabbing has been released, police said Thursday.

Nearly 500 people have been arrested around the country after anti-immigrant mobs clashed with police, attacked mosques and overran two hotels housing asylum-seekers.

Among those arrested was a man in his 50s on suspicion of ""encouraging murder."" The arrest came after a local Labour councilor allegedly called for far-right protesters’ throats to be ""cut.''

The Labour Party suspended Ricky Jones, who is alleged to have made the remark at a London demonstration Wednesday.

The government has pledged to track down and prosecute those responsible for the disorder, including people who incite violence online.

In an effort to dissuade people from taking part in future unrest by showing that rioters will face swift justice, TV cameras were allowed into Liverpool Crown Court on Thursday as Judge Andrew Menary sentenced two men to 32 months in jail.

During the hearing, prosecutors played video of rioters pelting police with bricks and setting garbage cans on fire. One of the suspects was in the middle of a group that ripped the bumper off a police vehicle and threw it at officers as onlookers cheered.

""It seems to me there were hundreds of people observing, as if this was some sort of Tuesday night entertainment,"" Menary said. ""All of them should be frankly ashamed of themselves.""

Northern Ireland’s regional legislative assembly held a special sitting Thursday to respond to the unrest. Minister for Justice Naomi Long said the violence and racist attacks in recent days were ""not reflective"" of the people of Northern Ireland.

""We need to call it for what it is. It is racism, it is Islamophobia, it is xenophobia,″ she said. ""If we’re going to deal with it, we need to name it for what it is, and we need to challenge it.″

The government is also considering imposing sanctions other than jail time, including banning rioters from soccer matches. Home Office minister Diana Johnson told LBC Radio that there should be consequences for those implicated in disorder.

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — The last time anyone heard from Edni López was Sunday. The 33-year-old political science professor and award-winning poet was preparing to board a flight to Argentina to visit a friend when she texted from the airport that something was wrong with her passport.

“Migration took my passport because it’s showing up as expired,” she wrote her boyfriend in the message shared with The Associated Press. “I pray to God I don’t get screwed because of a system error.”

What happened next remains a mystery — one contributing to the climate of fear and repression that has engulfed Venezuela following its disputed presidential election, the most serious wave of human rights abuses since Latin America’s military dictatorships in the 1970s.

When López’s mother, Ninoska Barrios, and her friends learned she didn’t board the flight, they started frantically combing detention centers. Finally, on Tuesday — more than 48 hours later — they learned she was being held, incommunicado, by Venezuela’s feared military intelligence police on unknown criminal charges, unable to see an attorney or speak with her family.

“Please, give back my daughter,” a sobbing Barrios pleaded Tuesday outside Venezuela’s top human rights office in a video that went viral on social media. “It’s not right that a Venezuelan mother has to go through all this.”

López’s arrest isn’t unique. Since the July 28 presidential election, security forces have rounded up more than 2,000 people for demonstrating against President Nicolás Maduro or casting doubt on his claim he won a third term despite strong evidence he lost the vote by a more than 2-to-1 margin. Another 24 have been killed, according to local human rights group Provea.

The spree of detentions — urged on by Maduro himself — is unprecedented, and puts Venezuela on pace to easily exceed those jailed during three previous crackdowns against Maduro’s opponents.

Those arrested include journalists, political leaders, campaign staffers and an attorney defending protesters. Others have had their Venezuelan passports annulled trying to leave the country. One local activist even livestreamed her arrest by military intelligence officers as they broke into her home with a crowbar.

“You’re entering my home arbitrarily, without any search warrant,” Maria Oropeza, an opposition campaign leader in rural Portuguesa state, says in the livestream that abruptly ends after three minutes. “I’m not a delinquent. I’m just an average citizen who wants a different country.”

The repression, much of it seemingly random and arbitrary, is having a chilling effect, said Phil Gunson, a Caracas-based analyst for the International Crisis Group.

“It’s not just discouraging protests. People are scared to go on the streets, period,” said Gunson, adding that parents of teenage boys are especially worried. “There’s a sense that police have a quota to fill and anyone can be stopped and carted away as a suspected subversive.”

The threats start at the top.

“They’re hiding rats but we’re going to grab them,” ruling socialist party boss Diosdado Cabello said about several prominent opponents in an address to the Maduro-controlled legislature a day after the election.

Meanwhile, Maduro has called on Venezuelans to denounce election doubters via a government-run app originally created to report power outages and complaints about state-provided services. He also said the government was refurbishing two gang-dominated prisons to accommodate an expected surge of jailed guarimberos — his dismissive term for middle-class protesters who barricaded themselves in the streets for weeks in 2014 and 2017.

“There will be no mercy,” Maduro said on state TV.

But complicating efforts to crush dissent is the changing face of the government’s opponents.

While demonstrations have been far smaller and tamer than during past bouts of unrest, they’re now more spontaneous, often leaderless and made up of youth — some barely teenagers — from Caracas’ hillside slums who have traditionally been a rock solid base of support for the government.

“I don’t care how many people have to die,” Cleiver Acuna, a 21-year-old tattoo artist, said at one recent grassroots march where protesters climbed up lampposts to tear down Maduro campaign posters.

“What I want is my freedom. My homeland. I want to live in the Venezuela my grandparents once told me about.”

Maria Corina Machado, the opposition powerhouse who rallied Venezuelans behind a last-minute stand-in candidate after she was barred from running against Maduro, has also urged restraint, reflecting the fear many feel.

“There are times to go out, times to meet, and demonstrate all our strength and determination and embrace each other, just as there are times to prepare, to organize, to communicate and to consult with our allies around the world, which are many,” she said in a recorded message posted online Tuesday.

“An operational pause is sometimes necessary.”

But the swiftness of the government’s clampdown does seem to be working. In just 10 days, security forces have rounded up nearly the same number of people as they did over five months in 2017, according to Provea.

“Operation Knock-Knock is a prime tool of state terrorism,” said Oscar Murillo, the head of Provea, referring to the surprise, middle-of-the-night detentions touted as a scare tactic by Cabello and others.

In the low-income Caracas neighborhood of Catia, once a ruling party stronghold, no one talks politics these days. One woman closed her business when protests began nearby and ran home. Videos of the demonstration flooded her phone over the next several hours, but she deleted them for fear the government was tracking social media posts to identify critics.

“I could get arrested just for having them,” she said.

The sudden silence is a sharp break from the hopeful mood preceding the election as emboldened opposition supporters confronted security forces who attempted to block anti-Maduro rallies. They served food, lent vehicles to opposition leader and opened their businesses to them despite knowing they would suffer retaliation from the police or have their businesses shut down.

Even before the current unrest, Venezuela’s human rights record was under intense scrutiny. Maduro is the target of an investigation by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity allegedly committed in the past.

Maduro’s tactics have been likened to those in Central and South America in the 1970s when military dictatorships rounded up opponents and sometimes innocent bystanders. Many were killed, and in Argentina, some even drugged and dropped from airplanes into the ocean, with no trace of ever having been detained.

Maduro’s alleged abuses have little in common with those “Dirty War” campaigns by state security forces.

But the goal of instilling fear is the same, said Santiago Canton, an Argentine lawyer and secretary general of the Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists, a watchdog group.

Canton said López’s case reminded him of the disappearance in Argentina in 1977 of a female activist pulled off a plane bound for Venezuela and never seen again. At the time, oil-rich Venezuela was the wealthiest country in South America and a democratic refuge for exiles fleeing military regimes across the region.

“What happened 50 years ago is unlikely to occur again,” said Canton, who previously led the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. “But social media is a multiplier factor that didn’t exist before so you can be more selective with the use of force and achieve the same results.”

Machado tried Thursday to pressure other nations to help end the oppression. “I feel that there has been a lack of firmness from all governments, from all sectors, to demand an immediate end to the madness that is happening,” she told reporters.

Meanwhile, López’s friends and family are at a loss to explain why she was targeted.

Since 2020, she’s been carrying out relief work in poor communities, for which she was honored as one of Venezuela’s “100 Protagonist Women” by the Netherlands’ Embassy in Caracas. The work is strictly humanitarian, and López doesn’t belong to any political movement.

Her social media profile is void of any anti-government content, consisting mainly of whimsical drawings of butterflies, poems she penned and pictures of beaches and sand dunes from her travels across Venezuela.

Cristina Ramirez, who moved to Argentina from Caracas eight years ago, joining over 7.7 million Venezuelans who’ve fled the country, said she bought a ticket for López in May so her friend could enjoy a much-deserved vacation.

The two were looking forward to catching up after a long separation and a difficult year for López, whose family is struggling financially. She worries that her friend, who takes medicine for diabetes, is suffering in prison without knowing what led to the nightmare.

“It was going to be her first trip outside Venezuela,” Ramirez said in a phone interview. “I’m still waiting for her.”

Here are some of the takeaways from the AP’s exclusive report on López's arrest and President Nicolás Maduro’s efforts to crush dissent.

How bad is the crackdown?

López's arrest isn’t unique. Since the July 28 presidential election, security forces have rounded up more than 2,000 people for demonstrating against Maduro or casting doubt on his claims that he won a third term despite strong evidence he lost the vote by a more than 2-to-1 margin.

“It’s not just discouraging protests. People are scared to go on the streets period,” he said. “There’s a sense that police have a quota to fill and anyone can be stopped and carted away as a suspected subversive.”

What does Maduro say?

The threats start at the top. Maduro has called on Venezuelans to denounce election doubters via a government-run app originally created to report power outages. He also said the government was refurbishing two gang-dominated prisons to accommodate an expected surge in jailing of opponents.

“There will be no mercy,” Maduro said on state TV.

But complicating efforts to crush dissent is the changing face of the government’s opponents.

While demonstrations have been far smaller and tamer than past bouts of unrest, they’re now more spontaneous, often leaderless and made up of youth — some barely teenagers — from Caracas’ hillside slums who have traditionally been a rock solid base of support for the government.

Is the repression succeeding?

The swiftness of the government’s clampdown is staggering. In just 10 days, security forces have rounded up nearly the same number of people as they did over five months in 2017, according to Provea, a local human rights watchdog.

“Operation Knock-Knock is a prime tool of state terrorism,” said Oscar Murillo, the head of Provea, referring to the middle-of-the-night detentions touted as a scare tactic by officials.

In the low-income Caracas neighborhood of Catia, once a ruling party stronghold, residents are even deleting videos of the demonstrations from their smartphones for fear the government is tracking social media posts to identify critics.

The sudden silence is a sharp break from the hopeful mood preceding the election when emboldened opposition supporters confronted security forces at anti-Maduro rallies. They served food, lent their vehicles and opened their businesses to opposition leaders knowing they would suffer retaliation from the police or see their businesses shut down.

What is Venezuela's human rights record?

Even before the current wave of unrest, Venezuela’s human rights record was under intense scrutiny. Maduro is himself the target of an investigation by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity allegedly committed in the past.

Maduro’s tactics have been likened to those used in Central and South America in the 1970s by military dictatorships that forcibly disappeared opponents and sometimes innocent bystanders. Many were killed, and in Argentina, some even drugged and dropped from airplanes into the ocean, with no trace of ever having been detained.

Maduro’s alleged abuses have little in common with those “Dirty War” campaigns carried out by state security forces.

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — The last time anyone heard from Edni López was Sunday. The 33-year-old political science professor and award-winning poet was preparing to board a flight to Argentina to visit a friend when she texted from the airport that something was wrong with her passport.

An aid worker's airport disappearance stirs fear of repression following disputed Venezuela election.,https://www.inkl.com/news/a-climate-of-terror-maduro-cracks-down-on-venezuelans-protesting-contested-election-win,"Police in front of a mural of Simón Bolívar as supporters of Venezuela's president Nicolás Maduro march to defend election results in Caracas, Venezuela, on 30 July 2024.

Cristina Ramírez was readying her sofa bed in Buenos Aires for the arrival of her friend visiting from Venezuela when she received a text message suggesting Edni López could be delayed. Officials in Caracas airport had stopped her, apparently over an issue with her passport.

Four days later, López remains under the detention of the Venezuelan authorities and her family grows increasingly worried by the minute that the university professor could be caught up in a brutal crackdown on protests over Nicolás Maduro’s apparent efforts to steal the presidential election.

“We know almost nothing. We have not been permitted to get Edni a lawyer and we still do not even know what she has been charged with,” said Ramírez, her voice cracking with anxiety. “The uncertainty is hard to describe. We just hope she can be freed soon.”

After a wave of public unrest following the disputed election, Maduro promised to “pulverize” the popular movement against him, dispatching security forces to round up opposition activists in the so-called “Operation knock-knock”.

More than 1,100 people so far have been rounded up since the election, according to Caracas-based rights watchdog, Foro Penal.

Prominent political figures have been seized, including Freddy Superlano, the national coordinator of the opposition Voluntad Popular party, who was dragged from his home by masked men.

Venezuela’s attorney general, a Maduro loyalist, announced on Tuesday that opposition leaders María Corina Machado and Edmundo González would be investigated for “incitement to insurrection” after they called on security forces to “side with the people” instead of repressing protests.

María Oropeza, a campaign co-ordinator for the opposition Vente party in the state of Portuguesa, livestreamed her own arrest late on Tuesday.

“Help me,” she pleaded live on Instagram as intelligence officers battered the lock off her front door. “I did nothing wrong, I am not a criminal. I am just another citizen who wants a different country”.

Oropeza had spoken out against the mass detentions just hours before she herself was detained.

But others with no political affiliation have also been caught up in Maduro’s dragnet, said Rafael Uzcategui, co-director of rights NGO Laboratorio de Paz, who suggested the operation was intended to terrify Venezuelans into submission.

“There were rumours that Maduro was targeting electoral observers but we investigated the arrests and they are too massive to see any real pattern. Many of those detained have no political affiliation and have not even participated in the protests. What we are seeing is simply an effort to sew a climate of terror,” he said.

Chile’s president, Gabriel Boric, condemned Maduro for committing “serious human rights violations” on Wednesday and joined the likes of Guatemala, Argentina and Peru in rejecting Maduro’s “self-proclaimed” victory.

The US – as well as other governments more sympathetic to Maduro, including Brazil, Mexico and Colombia – have called on the Venezuelan leader to publish a breakdown of the vote count, which he has so far refused.

“I have no doubt that the Maduro regime has tried to commit fraud,” Boric told reporters.

In his appearance on state television, a defiant Maduro has decried an international “fascist” conspiracy to overthrow him and accused WhatsApp of “spying” on Venezuela.

The former bus driver has shown clips of protesters in the mass demonstrations followed by their alleged confessions, promising he is “willing to do anything” to stay in power.

Many ordinary Venezuelans have deleted messaging apps on their mobile phones for fear that security forces could use their chat history for proof of dissent.

Edni López’s family say they have received information that the 33-year-old has been taken to another facility from her detention center three times, possibly for questioning, but they still have no idea what she is accused of.

López teaches management classes at the Central university of Venezuela and consults humanitarian organisations, Ramírez said, adding she has no political affiliation and did not participate in the recent protests.

“She is very empathetic, philosophic and competent, which is why she brought all these things together to help people through her work,” Ramirez said.

“Edni’s case is emblematic of what’s new about the repression that we’re seeing in post-election Venezuela,” said Adam Isacson, a director at the Washington Office on Latin America. “Usually in the past, the regime was hiding its illegitimate detentions under a veneer of legality, going through legal proceedings and allowing access to defense attorneys, for example. Now, even basic habeas corpus rights are being routinely violated.”"
An aid worker's airport disappearance stirs fear of repression following disputed Venezuela election.,https://www.kurv.com/venezuelan-opposition-candidate-gonzalez-wont-appear-before-court-and-questions-election-audit/,"(AP) — Venezuelan opposition candidate Edmundo González will not appear before the country’s high court Wednesday for a hearing related to an election audit requested by President Nicolás Maduro, his campaign confirmed to The Associated Press.

Venezuela’s Supreme Tribunal of Justice on Monday ordered González — the candidate of the opposition coalition — Maduro and the other eight candidates in the July 28 presidential election to attend hearings scheduled through Friday.

The hearings follow days of global criticism of Maduro and his loyal National Electoral Council over the election results. Electoral authorities declared Maduro the winner but have yet to produce voting tallies. Meanwhile, the opposition claims to have collected records from more than 80% of the 30,000 electronic voting machines nationwide showing he lost.

González was first on the list, but in a statement posted on social media, he questioned the legality of the proceedings and expressed serious concerns over his safety.

“I will put at risk not only my freedom but, more importantly, the will of the Venezuelan people expressed on July 28, 2024 and the gigantic effort of the Venezuelans who have participated in this process so that we could obtain evidence of the vote validly cast by the citizens,” he said."

Israel has revoked the diplomatic status of several Norwegian diplomats, further straining the relationship between the two countries, which has been deteriorating since Norway recognized the state of Palestine in May.

On Thursday, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said on X that he revoked the accreditation of eight Norwegian diplomats who had been working in Norway’s representative office to the Palestinian Authority.

“This is an extreme act that primarily affects our ability to help the Palestinian population,” Norway’s Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eid said in a statement. “It shows once again that the Netanyahu government actively opposes the work for a two-state solution.”"
Crocodile expert Adam Britton was jailed for a decade for sexually abusing dozens of people.,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/adam-britton-jailed-crimes-dogs/,"Renowned British-born crocodile expert Adam Britton was sentenced Thursday to more than 10 years and five months in jail in Australia over dozens of cases of sexually abusing dogs.

Britton, who worked with outlets like the BBC and National Geographic, pleaded guilty to 56 charges relating to bestiality and animal cruelty, CBS News partner network BBC News reported.

Britton also admitted to four counts of accessing child abuse material, according to the BBC.

Chief Justice Michael Grant warned the court that the details of Britton's crimes were so ""grotesque,"" that when they were read aloud they could cause ""nervous shock.""

As they were read out, some people rushed out of the room. Others watching from the gallery mouthed insults at Britton or cried, the BBC reported.

Britton ""was sadistic as a child to animals, but I had repressed it. In the last few years I let it out again, and now I can't stop. I don't want to. :),"" he wrote in one message in an online chat room that was introduced in court.

He would manipulate his own pets, but ""only badly mistreat other dogs... I have no emotional bond to them, they are toys pure and simple. And [there are] plenty more where they came from,"" he said, according to the BBC.

According to court documents seen by the BBC, in the 18 months before his arrest, Britton tortured 42 dogs and killed 39 of them. He would find animals on the website Gumtree Australia, where many families were often searching for new homes for their pets if they had to move.

Britton would then abuse the animals in a specially designed shipping container fitted with recording equipment on his property. He would upload the material to the internet and was caught because in one clip — where he tortured eight dogs, including seven puppies — an identifying dog leash was visible, and someone turned the clip over to police, the BBC reported.

Britton was arrested in April 2022. Police seized his recording materials and found 15 files containing child abuse material.

""Once respected and esteemed, you're now a disgrace to the scientific community,"" said activist Natalie Carey said, addressing the zoologist directly outside the court. ""No one will ever look at you with admiration again."""

A renowned British crocodile expert has been jailed for 10 years and five months in Australia, after admitting to sexually abusing dozens of dogs, in a case which horrified the nation.

Abuse spans decades

Born in West Yorkshire, Britton grew up in the UK before moving to Australia more than 20 years ago to work with crocodiles. With a PhD in zoology, he had built a global reputation for his expertise, even hosting Sir David Attenborough while the veteran broadcaster filmed part of the Life in Cold Blood docuseries on his property.

Britton, a leading zoologist featured on BBC and National Geographic, pleaded guilty to 56 charges of bestiality and animal cruelty, along with four counts of accessing child abuse material. The 53-year-old filmed himself torturing the animals, resulting in the deaths of nearly all, and shared the videos online under pseudonyms.

Britton’s abuse remained undetected for years until a clue in one of his videos led to his arrest in April 2022. A search of his rural Darwin property uncovered child abuse material on his laptop. The Northern Territory (NT) Supreme Court heard details of his crimes, which were so graphic that the judge warned attendees to leave the courtroom at times. “Your depravity falls outside any ordinary human conception,” Chief Justice Michael Grant stated.

Including time served, Britton could be eligible for parole in April 2028 and is banned from owning any mammals for life. His lawyer argued that Britton’s actions were driven by a rare disorder causing intense, atypical sexual interests.

Britton, originally from West Yorkshire, moved to Australia over 20 years ago to work with crocodiles. Despite his global reputation and a PhD in zoology, court documents revealed his “sadistic sexual interest” in animals, which he had harbored since childhood. For at least the past decade, Britton exploited his own pets and manipulated others into giving him their dogs.

Using Gumtree Australia, Britton found people reluctantly giving away their pets and built a rapport to take custody of the animals. He then abused them in a shipping container on his property, fitted with recording equipment, which he called his “torture room.” Britton shared footage of his crimes online and coached others on how to emulate his behavior.

Britton was finally caught after uploading a video torturing at least eight dogs, which an anonymous tipster forwarded to NT police. In the video, a bright orange City of Darwin dog leash was visible, leading to his arrest. Police seized recording devices, animal remains, and a laptop containing child abuse material during their search of his property.

Crocodile expert Adam Britton was jailed for a decade for sexually abusing dozens of people.,https://inews.co.uk/news/world/british-crocodile-expert-adam-britton-jailed-3215924,"Content warning: This story contains graphic and distressing details of animal cruelty and references to child abuse

A prominent British crocodile expert has been jailed for torturing and sexually abusing dogs.

Adam Britton, 52, was jailed for 10 years and five months on Thursday after pleading guilty to the charges of bestiality and animal cruelty at the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory (NT) in September last year.

Britton also pleaded guilty to four charges of accessing and transmitting child abuse material. He was also barred for life from purchasing animals and having them on his property alongside a non-parole period of six years, ABC News reports.

The 52-year-old was arrested in April 2022 and has been on remand at the Darwin Correctional Centre since his arrest.

During sentencing, chief justice Michael Grant described Britton’s “grotesque” and “unspeakable” crimes against animals.

He added: “Although I’m loathe to do so, given the gross depravity and perversity of your actions, it is necessary for the purpose of sentencing you to provide some generally representative detail and description of the offending conduct.”

Britton’s crimes involved the torture of some 42 dogs, and the deaths of 39 in a shipping container on his property where he filmed his crimes.

The court heard that Britton had sourced the dogs online between 2020 and 2022. Many of the owners thought the dogs had been given to a new home and reluctantly gave them up due to work or travel commitments.

“You took photographs of the dogs prior to torturing and killing them, and subsequently sent those photographs to the former owners as part of communicating false narratives that the dogs were thriving in their new environment,” the judge added.

Britton would also discuss his acts and upload videos on Telegram.

A suppression order that had concealed his identity since his arrest was later lifted, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.

In a letter read out on behalf of the 52-year-old, his lawyer said he took “full responsibility for the demeaning crimes” he inflicted on the dogs.

“I deeply regret the pain and trauma that I caused innocent families and consequently to my family, friends and members of the community affected,” he wrote.

Britton lived in Darwin in Australia’s Northern Territory, but was born in West Yorkshire and studied zoology at the University of Leeds before studying for a PhD in biological science at the University of Bristol, his Facebook page says.

He moved to Australia more than 20 years ago to work with crocodiles, the BBC reported.

The 52-year-old also worked on BBC and National Geographic productions."

But he was harbouring a ""sadistic sexual interest"" in them, court documents say. Exchanges with ""like-minded"" people in secret online chatrooms detail how Britton began molesting horses at the age of 13.

""I was sadistic as a child to animals, but I had repressed it. In the last few years I let it out again, and now I can't stop. I don't want to. :),"" he wrote in one message tendered to the court.

For at least the past decade, Britton had exploited his own pets and manipulated other dog owners into giving him theirs.

""My own dogs are family and I have limits,"" he explained in a Telegram chat entered into evidence.

""I only badly mistreat other dogs... I have no emotional bond to them, they are toys pure and simple. And [there are] plenty more where they came from.""

He tortured at least 42 dogs, killing 39 of them, according to court documents seen by the BBC. The files only detail his crimes over the 18 months before his arrest, but still fill more than 90 pages.

Using online marketplace Gumtree Australia, Britton would find people who were often reluctantly giving their pets away due to travel or work commitments. He would build a ""rapport"" with them to negotiate taking custody of the animals and if they reached out for updates on their old pets, the court heard he would tell them ""false narratives"" and send them old photos.

In reality, he was abusing the animals in a shipping container on his property that had been fitted out with recording equipment - which he called his ""torture room"" - before sharing footage of his crimes online using aliases.

Britton would also coach others on how to copy his behaviour and get rid of the evidence.

Asked how to dispose of the dogs' remains, Britton - who shared his sprawling property on the outskirts of Darwin with eight crocodiles - said ""some I feed to other animals"".

He was only caught after uploading a clip in which he tortured at least eight dogs - all except one were puppies - which was passed on to NT police in an anonymous tip-off.

Britton usually went to great lengths to avoid identifying himself or his location in his videos, but in this one a bright orange City of Darwin dog leash could be seen in the background.

Within weeks, in April 2022, police swooped on his property and arrested Britton, who has been remanded in custody ever since.

They seized recording devices, animal remains and a laptop on which they also located 15 files containing child abuse material.

Animal advocates say the case shows the need for stronger animal cruelty penalties.

Speaking outside court, many who had travelled from all over the country for the hearing expressed disappointment at the sentence, but said it offered some solace to the owners of the pets Britton abused.

Addressing the zoologist directly, one activist told Britton he was ""right where you should be - locked up.""

""Once respected and esteemed, you're now a disgrace to the scientific community,"" said Natalie Carey. ""No one will ever look at you with admiration again."""

A British zoologist has been jailed in Australia, after pleading guilty to raping and torturing dozens of dogs in abuse that spanned decades.

Adam Britton, who grew up in West Yorkshire before moving to Australia, pleaded guilty to 56 charges relating to bestiality and animal cruelty.

The 53-year-old also admitted to four counts of accessing child abuse material.

‘Your depravity falls outside any ordinary human conception,’ chief justice Michael Grant told him, after asking the public to leave the court because of how ‘graphic’ the details of his atrocities are, according to the Australian Associated Press.

was sentenced to 10 years and five months in prison today

A crocodile expert and former BBC zoologist who filmed himself raping and torturing dogs has been jailed for more than 10 years in Australia for what a judge condemned as 'inconceivable depravity'.

Adam Robert Corden Britton was sentenced in Darwin Supreme Court on Thursday having pleaded guilty to 56 offences related to the torture and sexual exploitation of more than 42 dogs on his rural property.

The 53-year-old, who was born in West Yorkshire and earned a PhD in zoology from Bristol University before emigrating to Australia, was sentenced to 10 years and five months with a non-parole period of six years, backdated to his April 2022 arrest.

Chief Justice Michael Grant also ordered that the once-respected academic be banned from owning or having on his property mammal-type animals for the term of his natural life.

Before delivering the sentence, Justice Grant warned the public gallery that he would have to describe details of Britton's offences that included 'grotesque cruelty toward animals' and told the British-born academic: 'Your depravity falls outside any ordinary human conception'.

Britton (pictured) told a stranger on Telegram that he stopped trying to suppress his violent urges

Members of the public gallery sobbed and gasped as the details of Britton's extensive and violent offending, resulting in the deaths of 39 dogs, including nine puppies, were read out.

Britton stood in the dock wearing a black suit with grey shirt and did not visibly react to Justice Grant's sentencing remarks.

Britton began offending in 2014, sexually abusing his own pet dogs - Swiss Shepherds Ursa and Bolt - in a secret 'torture room' constructed on his rural property in McMinns Lagoon near the city of Darwin.

He continued until his arrest in April 2022 after a video of his vile acts, which he had shared online, was provided to Australia's Northern Territory animal welfare authorities.

An anonymous internet user noticed a female dog in one of his horrific videos was wearing an orange City of Darwin leash with the slogan, 'great pets start with you'.

That tip-off enabled investigators to track down where the dog was adopted from - and by whom.

The agreed facts stated Britton extensively filmed his offending in his so-called 'torture room' and shared videos online under pseudonyms while encouraging others to commit similar offences and offering 'how to' advice.

'Your sheer and unalloyed pleasure is sickeningly evident from the recorded material,' Justice Grant said.

As well as torturing his dogs that he had raised, Britton bought sought canines featured in Gumtree Australia 'free to good home' adverts from unsuspecting owners in the Darwin region.

Britton was also sentenced for possessing and transmitting 'the worst category' of child sexual abuse material.

The British citizen was a prominent crocodile expert and a senior researcher at Charles Darwin University - a post which afforded him the opportunity to host the likes of world-famous broadcaster and biologist David Attenborough while he filmed the BBC's Life in Cold Blood docuseries.

None of his offending is alleged to have been against the reptiles.

The zoologist kept his twisted double life and depraved fantasies from his wife Erin for years.

Erin, a wildlife ranger who once met Prince Harry and helped him catch a crocodile, has reportedly changed her surname since learning of her husband's crimes.

Britton not only tortured and sexually abused his own pets Ursa and Bolt (pictured together), who he created an Instagram page for, but also dogs from pet owners he had lured into his trap through the online marketplace platform Gumtree Australia

In 2016, Britton uploaded a photo of one of his dogs, Bolt, as a puppy (pictured)

The court heard Britton started abusing his dogs, Ursa and Bolt (pictured), in 2014

During Britton's trial, prosecutors told the court he maintained several accounts on the Telegram messaging app - one which he used to engage with 'like-minded people', and another which was used to disseminate images and recordings of the abuse.

'Using these applications, the offender discussed his ''kill count'',' the prosecutor told the court. His account had 114 threads where he described how he acquired the pets and how he abused them.

The court learned how Britton once told a Telegram user of his violent compulsions: 'I had repressed it. In the last few years I let it out again, and now I can't stop. I don't want to.'

Britton sourced other dogs from Gumtree Australia from unsuspecting owners in the Darwin region.

The court previously heard he built rapport with the owners and negotiated taking custody of their pets, many of whom reluctantly gave their pets away due to travel or work commitments.

He would tell pet owners on Gumtree that his old dog had died of cancer and he wanted a 'new family member' in order to make them have pity on him and sell them their dog, the court heard.

If the pet owners reached out and asked Britton how their old dog was doing, he would spin a 'false narrative' to say they were healthy and even send them old photos - when in reality their pet was already dead.

In one scenario, Britton sent a message to the owners of a large brown dog named Wolfe to reassure them the animal was 'settling in well'. The prosecutor told the court that dog Wolfe had already been 'sexually exploited, tortured and killed'.

Following his arrest in 2022, police seized 44 items including computers, mobile telephones, cameras, external hard drives, tools and weapons during a raid of his home. They also found 15 child abuse material files on his laptop.

But Britton's sentence was met with outrage by animal rights activists in Australia.

Emma Hurst, who is an MP for the Animal Justice Party in New South Wales, slammed the sentence as 'pathetically weak'.

'These were horrific acts of animal cruelty,' Ms Hurst said.

'There is a well-researched link between violence towards animals and violence towards people.

'This man is a danger to other animals and the community. I am relieved to hear his sentence includes time behind bars - that's where a man like this belongs – but it is not long enough.'

Britton's barrister, who has asked not to be named because she has been subject to personal abuse and threats for representing him, had argued a lifetime ban on all animal ownership was an 'extreme measure'.

She argued Britton should be allowed to own or live with any creatures other than 'mammals' and the ban should not last a lifetime because of the 'reasonable prospects of rehabilitation'.

But she also read the court an apology that she claimed had been penned by her client.

'I take full responsibility for the demeaning crimes that I perpetrated on dogs,' Britton said.

'I deeply regret the pain and trauma that I caused to innocent animals and consequently to my family, friends and members of the community that I affected, I let you all down and I'm truly sorry.

'I now acknowledge that I've been fighting a rare paraphilic disorder for much of my life and that shame and fear prevented me from seeking the proper help I needed.'

Britton said 'no amount of words can convey how sorry and ashamed I am, nor undo what I did' but he was 'determined to prove I am better than this'.

'I will seek long-term treatment and find a path towards redemption,' his letter read.

'Please give my family the space they deserve to heal, they were not aware or involved in any way.'

The agreed facts stated Britton extensively filmed his offending in his so-called 'torture room' and shared videos online under pseudonyms while encouraging others to commit similar offences and offering 'how to' advice.

The vile acts took place within a shipping container on Britton's home as well as at 'secluded' locations throughout Darwin's outer suburbs.

Much of the abuse was filmed by Britton on mobile phones and on cameras placed on tripods, with the video later edited to 'black out' identifying features.

From 2020 until his arrest in 2022, Britton used the encrypted social media service Telegram to connect with 'like-minded' animal abusers.

A second account, known as Cerberus, was used to upload and disseminate videos made by Britton in which he discussed his 'kill count'.

The videos were saved on to Britton's devices under names relating to the location, breed or name of the animal, including 'Mastiff1', 'Pit1' and 'NewBlue1'.

According to the facts, Britton would refer to the cruelty as 'ZooSadism' and posted to Telegram groups such as 'New Wicked Kennel', which had 15 users.

In an online chat, Britton referred to his 'torture room' and what implements he would use, including a bread knife, before adding that: 'I can't stop myself hurting dogs.

'I am going to get another dog to kill tomorrow. I plan to hurt it, a lot. I am ridiculously excited about it,' he said.

As well as torturing his dogs that he had raised, Britton bought sought canines featured in Gumtree Australia 'free to good home' adverts from unsuspecting owners in the Darwin region.

The once-respected academic, who was born in the UK and has worked for the BBC and National Geographic, sourced about 42 dogs over a two-year period for the sole purpose of torturing the animals to death on camera.

He would contact families who reluctantly gave their dogs up due to work or health issues, and would then send false updates to reassure the former owners their pets were 'happy' and 'doing well'.

According to court documents, the pets were usually dead by the time these updates were sent. Most of the dogs he acquired were horrifically abused and murdered within a few days of him gaining ownership.

Britton's online activity first raised the attention of police following a report by the Northern Territory (NT) Animal Welfare Branch in 2022.

The agency had reported a video made by Britton and posted to a 'gore website' that depicted him sexually abusing, torturing and killing one dog and eight puppies.

The female dog in the video was wearing a Darwin City Council 'great pets start with you' collar, prompting an investigation by NT Police.

In April 2022, NT Police and AFP officers raided Britton's home and seized 44 items, including computers, cameras, hard drives, weapons and sex toys.

Police also located severed dog limbs in a freezer, a decomposing puppy in a filtration pond and a severed dog head in a neighbouring property in the search.

Britton was also sentenced for possessing and transmitting 'the worst category' of child sexual abuse material.

His ex-wife Erin formally dropped his surname just two months after his arrest in 2022.

Britton extensively filmed his offending in his so-called 'torture room' and shared videos online under pseudonyms while encouraging others to commit similar offences and offering 'how to' advice

Britton grew up in England and received his Ph.D. in Zoology at the University of Bristol before moving to Australia after 1996 to pursue his fascination with crocodiles.

He met his future wife and they set up a consultancy company, Big Gecko, which sold footage of crocodiles to television and film directors.

Their saltwater crocodile, Smaug, became something of a celebrity in his field and appeared in two horror films.

Britton and Erin also hosted Sir David Attenborough while he was filming the BBC's Life in Cold Blood docuseries.

She was a biologist and wildlife ranger who has assisted in a range of projects on sea turtles and counting crocodiles.

Adam Britton (pictured with his wife) was married for about 15 years. She formally dropped his surname two months after he was charged

They were married for about 15 years, but she was often away for work and there is no suggestion that she knew about his dark secret.

None of his offending was against the reptiles.

Earlier Britton's barrister read the court an apology penned by her client.

'I take full responsibility for the demeaning crimes that I perpetrated on dogs,' Britton said.

Paraphilia is defined as having persistent and recurrent sexual interests, urges, fantasies, or behaviors of marked intensity involving objects, activities, or even situations that are atypical in nature.

Crown prosecutor Marty Aust argued for a lifetime ban on mammal ownership saying Britton's paraphilia 'appears to be treatable but ever present'.

'We would submit that your honour would be satisfied that really there is an ever present risk in this case for this offender,' he said.

Britton's sentence was met with outrage by animal advocates.

Emma Hurst, an MP for the Animal Justice Party in NSW, slammed the sentence as 'pathetically weak'.

'These were horrific acts of animal cruelty,' Ms Hurst said.

'There is a well-researched link between violence towards animals and violence towards people.

'This man is a danger to other animals and the community. I am relieved to hear his sentence includes time behind bars - that's where a man like this belongs – but it is not long enough.'"
Crocodile expert Adam Britton was jailed for a decade for sexually abusing dozens of people.,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/british-crocodile-expert-jailed-sexually-092759880.html,"A renowned British zoologist has been sentenced to 10 years and five months in prison in Australia after admitting to a series of shocking crimes involving the sexual abuse and torture of dozens of dogs.

Adam Britton, 53, a prominent crocodile expert who has worked on productions for the BBC and National Geographic, pleaded guilty to 56 charges related to bestiality and animal cruelty. He also admitted to four counts of accessing child abuse material.

The Northern Territory Supreme Court heard that Britton filmed himself torturing the animals, most of which died as a result, and shared the videos online using pseudonyms.

His crimes went undetected for years until investigators uncovered a clue in one of his videos.

Britton was arrested in April 2022 following a search of his rural property near Darwin, which also led to the discovery of child abuse material on his laptop.

The details of Britton's offences were deemed so graphic that Chief Justice Michael Grant warned the courtroom they could cause ""nervous shock"".

As the facts were read aloud, some members of the public left the courtroom, while others wept and directed insults at the defendant.

In his ruling, Justice Grant condemned Britton's actions as ""devious"" and noted that the ""unalloyed pleasure"" he took in torturing the animals was ""sickeningly evident"".

""[Your] depravity falls entirely outside any ordinary human conception,"" the judge stated.

Britton could be eligible for parole in September 2028, taking into account time already served. He has been banned from owning mammals for life.

The defence argued that Britton's crimes were driven by a rare disorder causing intense, atypical sexual interests. In court, a letter from Britton was read out, in which he apologised for his ""demeaning crimes"".

""I deeply regret the pain and trauma that I caused to innocent animals and consequently to my family, friends and members of the community,"" the letter said.

Britton also emphasised that his family was not aware of or involved in his actions, adding, ""I will seek long term treatment and... I will find a path towards redemption.""

Britton, originally from West Yorkshire, spent his formative years in the UK before relocating to Australia over two decades ago to pursue his work with crocodiles.

A highly qualified zoologist with a PhD, Britton had established himself as a globally recognised expert in his field.

His reputation was such that he even hosted the esteemed naturalist Sir David Attenborough at his property during the filming of part of the acclaimed Life in Cold Blood documentary series."

Adam Britton, a zoologist based in Darwin, Australia, pleaded guilty to 56 charges of bestiality and animal cruelty at the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory (NT) in September last year.

He also pleaded guilty to four counts of accessing and transmitting child abuse material.

Britton, 52, whose sentencing suffered a series of delays, was on Thursday also banned for life from purchasing animals and having them on his property, Australian media reports.

His offending involved the torture and exploitation of 42 dogs, and the deaths of 39, in a shipping container on his property - which he used to film many of his crimes.

Britton will not be eligible for parole for six years, according to ABC.

Chief Justice Michael Grant described Britton's ""grotesque"" and ""unspeakable"" crimes against animals as he sentenced him.

The judge excused court officers during his sentencing remarks, as he warned the gallery that details of the offences could cause a ""nervous shock or some other adverse psychological reactions"".

He said: ""Although I'm loathe to do so, given the gross depravity and perversity of your actions, it is necessary for the purpose of sentencing you to provide some generally representative detail and description of the offending conduct.""

The court previously heard Britton had a ""sadistic sexual interest"" in animals, and in particular dogs.

As well as torturing his own dogs, he also sourced animals from unsuspecting pet owners in the Darwin region.

""He often built a rapport with the dog owners in negotiating taking custody of their animals, many of whom had to reluctantly give their pets away due to travel or work commitments,"" prosecutor Marty Aust told the court back in September.

According to case details, Britton acquired 42 dogs online between 2020 and 2022, promising their owners a ""good home"". He subjected these animals to torture and abuse, filming his crimes in a shipping container on his property. At least 39 of the dogs died from the torture.

Britton subsequently shared these videos on the messaging app Telegram. The probe also found that he discussed his kill count under the pseudonyms 'Monster' and 'Cerberus.'

Chief Justice Michael Grant of the Northern Territory Supreme Court described the offences as ""grotesque"" and ""unspeakable"". In addition to the prison term, Britton was issued a lifetime ban on owning or purchasing any animals.

""You took photographs of the dogs prior to torturing and killing them, and subsequently sent those photographs to the former owners as part of communicating false narratives that the dogs were thriving in their new environment,"" Australian broadcaster ABC News quoted Justice Grant as saying.

The court observed that the scale of cruelty he engaged in falls entirely outside any ordinary human conception and comprehension.

UK-born Britton, once a respected figure in the field of wildlife conservation, was arrested in 2022. Police found computers, cameras, weapons, sex toys, dog heads, and the decomposing corpses of puppies at his rural property.

The case has sparked widespread outrage and prompted calls for stricter regulations and background checks for individuals working with animals.

Meanwhile, animal rights activists argue that the sentence does not adequately reflect the magnitude of the suffering inflicted upon the innocent victims."

Disgraced crocodile expert Adam Britton has been sentenced to 10 years and five months in prison after being found guilty of the rape and torture of dozens of dogs, along with the possession of child abuse material. His horrific actions were described by a judge as “grotesque” and “unspeakable”.

The 51-year-old former zoologist was sentenced today in the Northern Territory Supreme Court, after pleading guilty to 60 charges of bestiality, animal cruelty, and possessing child abuse material.

Britton was arrested in April 2022 when the Northern Territory Police became aware of his sickening online activity. The NT Animal Welfare Branch alerted police of a video Britton posted to a “gore website” in which he sexually abused, tortured, and killed a dog and eight puppies.

His criminal trial revealed that between 2020 and 2022, Britton had tortured, sexually abused, and killed 42 dogs. He also filmed himself committing the obscene acts inside of a shipping container he called his “torture room” at his rural Darwin property.

Britton told the court how he would purchase dogs from unsuspecting people on GumTree, convince them that the dog had gone to a better home, and then commit the vile acts — often posting the footage to various online platforms for “like-minded” individuals.

Texts from Telegram group chats that Adam Britton was active in revealed how he would share that he was “ridiculously excited” about killing dogs.

“I can’t stop myself hurting dogs. I am going to get another dog to kill tomorrow. I plan to hurt it, a lot,” one horrific text read.

He also texted other users with advice on purchasing dogs from owners, and discussed his “kill count”.

“Any kill is a good day,” read another chilling message from Britton.

After multiple delays to his sentencing, Chief Justice Michael Grant handed down the punishment on Thursday. The judge did not hold back from sharing his disgust at Britton’s actions either.

“Your conduct on each of those occasions involved a degree of depravity and reprehensibility which falls entirely outside any ordinary human conception and comprehension,” said Justice Grant.

“Your motivations were of the basest and most perverse kind.

“Each instance is an offence with the maximum penalty.

“I am unable to conceive of anything worse.

“Your depravity falls outside any ordinary human conception.”

As well as the 10 years imprisonment with six years no parole, Justice Grant included that Britton was banned from owning any mammal-type animals for the rest of his life.

His sentence was backdated to his 2022 arrest, with animal rights activists slamming the sentence as not harsh enough for the perversity of his crimes.

Adam Britton’s lawyer shared a written statement from the serial animal abuser where he apologised to his family and community, and took “full responsibility for the demeaning crimes.”

“Society views violence and cruelty to animals as an abhorrent crime towards a powerless and innocent victim. There is legitimate disgust and condemnation,” the judge said.

Britton, a senior research associate at Charles Darwin University, began his abuse in 2014 — and only stopped when he was arrested in April 2022 after authorities were sent a video he had shared online of himself committing the abuse.

The British-born zoologist — who worked with David Attenborough on the BBC — had earlier pleaded guilty to 56 charges related to the torture and sexual exploitation of more than 42 dogs on his rural property. At least 39 were killed, according to news.com.au.

His sentence includes a ban from owning — or even having on his property — mammal-type animals for the rest of his life.

The torture sessions were planned and filmed and would not have stopped if he had not been arrested, the judge said during sentencing for the “grotesque” abuse.

“The suffering of these animals was indescribable,” Grant said.

Animal advocates demonstrated outside the court, holding signs calling Britton a “zoosadist,” while members of the gallery at times sobbed over the excruciatingly graphic details of the abuse.

As well as pleading guilty, Britton wrote a letter to the court apologizing for the abuse. “No amount of words can convey how sorry and ashamed I am, nor undo what I did,” he wrote.

Emma Hurst, a member of parliament for Australia’s Animal Justice Party, ripped the punishment as “pathetically weak.”

“These were horrific acts of animal cruelty … This man is a danger to other animals and the community.”

Britton extensively filmed his abuse and shared some of the videos on online forums to teach and encourage others to commit similar acts, officials previously said. While psychiatrists found Britton had a paraphilic disorder, they determined he knew his actions were wrong."

The 53-year-old leading British crocodile expert confessed to bestiality and a plethora of animal sexual abuse charges filed against him in Australia in September last year.

Warning that some of the details of Britton’s crimes were too graphic to be published, Chief Justice Michael Grant suggested members of the public leave the courtroom at the Northern Territory Supreme Court.

""Your depravity falls outside any ordinary human conception,"" the chief justice told Britton, according to the Australian Associated Press.

The popular zoologist who has worked on BBC and National Geographic productions pleaded guilty to 56 charges relating to bestiality and animal cruelty.

The court observed that the British zoologist had filmed himself torturing the animals until almost all died. He also uploaded the videos online under pseudonyms.

Members sitting in the public gallery were seen sobbing and gasping as the details of Britton’s violence and extensive offences were being read out. At least 39 dogs, including nine puppies, died as a result of the abuse by the Charles Darwin University academic.

Britton both tortured his own dogs and managed to source other canines from unsuspecting owners from Gumtree Australia in the Darwin region.

He encouraged others online to commit similar offences and shared advice on carrying out bestiality, according to the agreed facts of the case read out in court.

Justice Grant remarked: “Your sheer and unalloyed pleasure is sickeningly evident from the recorded material.”

Britton has also been sentenced for possessing and transmitting ""the worst category"" of child sexual abuse material.

Britton did not visibly react to the sentencing remarks by Justice Grant as he stood in the dock in a black suit and grey shirt.

In his sentencing, Justice Grant said Britton was banned from owning any mammal species of animal, or having them on his property, for the duration of his natural life.

The court recorded Britton’s offences to have begun in 2014 until his arrest in April 2022. They first came to light when a video of his offences reached the Northern Territory animal welfare authorities anonymously.

Outside the court where hearing was underway, animal right advocates labelled Britton as a “zoosadist” and said he deserved the death penalty. Capital punishment has been outlawed throughout Australia since 1985.

Britton has also pleaded guilty to four counts of accessing and transmitting child abuse material.

“I was talking with someone else about why I love to hurt dogs,” he wrote in a secret chat group. “I wasn’t sure at first, but now I live for it. I can’t stop myself hurting dogs.

“I was sadistic as a child to animals, but I had repressed it. In the last few years I let it out again, and now I can’t stop. I don’t want to.” He added a smiley.

Britton’s lawyer – who has sought to remain anonymous due to the threats they have been receiving for representing Britton – presented a recent sentencing hearing with a fresh report on the zoologist’s “paraphilia”, a psychological term to describe a condition characterised by intense sexual fantasies, urges, or behaviours involving atypical objects, situations, or individuals."

Adam Robert Corden Britton, 51, a zoologist and broadcaster, was sentenced to 10 years after his ""extensive"" offending resulted in the deaths of 39 dogs - including nine puppies.

He was also banned from owning any mammals for the rest of his life.

The expert had previously pleaded guilty to 56 offences related to the torture and sexual exploitation of more than 42 dogs on his rural property.

The ""grotesque"" crimes took place at his Australian home, with his crimes stretching back to 2014.

He was finally arrest for his crimes in April 2022, appearing for sentencing in the NT supreme court on Monday.

""Your depravity falls outside any ordinary human conception,"" Chief Justice Michael Grant told Britton at his sentencing on Thursday.

The court heard how Britton extensively filmed his offending, mistreating animals in the so-called ""torture room"" at his home.

Britton's heinous crimes are considered so ""grotesque"", the judge warned people they may need to leave the courtroom.

During the trial, campaigners stood outside court holding placards and signs denouncing animal cruelty.

The court heard how he ""shared videos online"" under multiple pseudonyms, as well as encouraging other online users to commit offences.

He also offered 'how to' advice to online users looking to abuse animals in a similar manner, reported the Australian Associated Press.

""Your sheer and unalloyed pleasure is sickeningly evident from the recorded material,"" Justice Grant said.

The court heard how Britton would contact families who reluctantly gave their pets, only for them to be abused by the expert.

Britton would then issue false updates on the ""happy"" animals' welfare to reassure their former owners - despite many of the animals already being dead at the time of the messages.

His lawyer argued that his offending was driven by a rare disorder which causes intense, atypical sexual interests.

He could be eligible for parole in April 2028.

A British crocodile expert has been sentenced to 10 years and five months in prison in Australia for brutally abusing and killing dozens of dogs. Adam Britton confessed to his shocking actions in court.

Britton was a renowned expert on crocodiles for many years. He lived in Australia where he conducted research on the animals. In the meantime, he abused dozens of dogs for years.

At least 42 dogs fell prey to the Briton. He tortured the animals and sexually abused them. At least 39 dogs did not survive the abuse. Britton filmed his actions and shared them anonymously on the internet.

Telegram

In Telegram messages used as evidence in the trial, Britton admitted to abusing animals as a child. “I was sadistic towards animals as a child, but I suppressed the feeling. In recent years I have given it free rein and now I can’t stop. I don’t want to,” the 53-year-old Briton wrote.

The abuse took place in a shipping container on the property where Britton lived, on the outskirts of the Australian city of Darwin.

The perpetrator often found the dogs via the online platform Gumtree, an Australian version of Marktplaats, where people offered the animals because they could no longer care for them.

Dog leash

Britton was eventually caught when part of a specific brightly coloured Darwin City Council dog leash was visible in one of the videos he shared online, which led police to the perpetrator two years ago.

During his arrest, animal remains and laptops were seized, among other things. These laptops also turned out to contain child pornography. Britton was also convicted for possession of this.

Many animal rights activists had come to court for his case, the BBC reports, demanding higher sentences for animal cruelty.

During the trial, Britton expressed remorse. “I deeply regret the pain and trauma I have caused innocent animals, as well as my family, friends and community,” he wrote in a letter read by his attorney during the trial."
