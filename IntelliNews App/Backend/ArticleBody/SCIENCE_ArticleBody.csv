NASA says Boeing Starliner Astronauts may fly home on SpaceX in 2025.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/science/boeing-starliner-nasa-spacex.html,"For weeks, NASA has downplayed problems experienced by Starliner, a Boeing spacecraft that took two astronauts to the International Space Station in June.

But on Wednesday, NASA officials admitted that the issues might be more serious than first thought and that the astronauts might not return on the Boeing vehicle, after all.

The agency is exploring a backup option for the astronauts, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, to instead hitch a ride back to Earth on a spacecraft built by Boeing’s competitor SpaceX.

The astronauts’ stay in orbit, which was to be as short as eight days, could be extended into next year."

CNN —

Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams — two veteran NASA astronauts piloting the first crewed test flight of Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft — have now been in space for 63 days, roughly seven weeks longer than initially expected.

There is still no clear return date in sight, and NASA is now making clear that the astronauts may not come home on Starliner at all.

SpaceX, Boeing’s rival under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, may be tapped to bring Williams and Wilmore home instead. The move could potentially extend the astronauts’ stay on the International Space Station by another six months, pushing their return into 2025, agency officials said in a news conference Wednesday.

The comments from NASA leaders indicate a stunning change of tone for the space agency. Until now, officials have repeatedly indicated that Williams and Wilmore were likely to return home on Starliner, and a backup scenario involving Crew Dragon was mentioned as a mere possibility. Wednesday’s update, however, suggests the SpaceX vehicle is rapidly becoming a serious option.

“I would say that our chances of an uncrewed Starliner return have increased a little bit based on where things have gone over the last week or two,” said Ken Bowersox, associate administrator for NASA’s Space Operations Mission Directorate, referring to NASA’s internal review processes that needs to be completed before a return date for Starliner is set. “But again, new data coming in, new analysis, different discussion — we could find ourselves shift in another way.”

Officials said the space agency has until roughly “mid-August” to make a final decision.

Boeing’s propulsion woes

CNN confirmed on Tuesday that NASA has not yet started a “flight readiness review” for the Starliner crew’s return from the space station. The agency had said on July 26 that it would begin that process in the first couple days of August.

But Boeing and NASA teams are still working on a potential return date for the mission that launched June 5, as officials evaluate testing data and conduct analyses about the propulsion issues and helium leaks that hampered the first leg of the Starliner capsule’s flight.

The ground testing that mission teams carried out in New Mexico as they worked to understand the problems led to surprising results, said Steve Stich, NASA’s Commercial Crew Program manager, on Wednesday.

The space agency had previously said it found excess heat around some of the Starliner thrusters was causing teflon seals to bulge, restricting the flow of propellant and triggering the thruster issues.

Uncertainty about whether those bulging seals are indeed the root cause of the issue — and how the problem might affect the Starliner vehicle in space — are the basis for disagreements within NASA about how safe it is for crew to return on the Starliner, officials revealed at the news conference.

NASA officials “got more and more uncomfortable with the uncertainty around the thrusters,” Stich said.

As NASA works to come to a consensus on the likely root cause of those issues and how much danger it might pose to a crewed Starliner return, the space agency has more seriously considered alternative routes home for Williams and Wilmore.

Neither Boeing nor SpaceX officials were available for comment during the Wednesday briefing. Boeing maintains that, in its view, Starliner is safe for the astronauts’ return, according to a Friday statement from Boeing.

Starliner contingency planning

Officials said they had several return scenarios they are considering if Starliner is deemed unsafe to bring Williams and Wilmore home.

One option is to launch a planned SpaceX Crew Dragon mission, Crew-9, with two astronauts on board instead of four. That would leave two seats empty for Williams and Wilmore to occupy on the Crew-9 flight home, but that would also make the astronauts part of the overall Crew-9 rotation on the International Space Station. That means Williams and Wilmore would remain on the station for an additional six months — the length of a routine mission to the ISS — pushing their return to at least February 2025.

In that case, Starliner would be left to fly home empty. And NASA would then have to decide whether the data the mission gathered on this flight is enough to give the space agency the confidence to officially certify Starliner to make routine trips to orbit.

Still, NASA noted, it is not certain that the space agency will need a contingency plan at all.

“We haven’t approved this this plan,” Stich said. “In other words, we’ve done all the work to make sure this plan is there; we have the suits identified to fly up on Crew-9 (for Williams and Wilmore to wear aboard Crew Dragon). … But we have not turned that on formally, as that’s the path that we’re going to go down.”

Stich added that returning Williams and Wilmore aboard Starliner remains the “prime” option.

The odds of a backup plan

Notably, however, NASA announced Tuesday that it was delaying the launch of SpaceX’s Crew-9 mission.

Crew-9 had been slated to take off as soon as August 18 — with the expectation that the Starliner capsule would have returned home with its astronauts before then. Now, Crew-9 will not take off before September 24, NASA said, allowing more flexibility for the agency to make a decision on use of a Starliner contingency plan.

“This adjustment allows more time for mission managers to finalize return planning for the agency’s Boeing Crew Flight Test,” NASA said in a Tuesday news release.

Some complications remain, however, whether NASA chooses to fly Williams and Wilmore home on Crew Dragon or not.

“Switching off of our primary path of bringing Butch and Suni home on Starliner causes us to take additional risk in the rest of our mission profile — and so we have to compare all those risks,” Bowersox said.

If Starliner is made to fly home empty, for example, the spacecraft will require a software update to configure the vehicle for an autonomous flight home. That would essentially revert the Starliner’s computers to run on code the company originally wrote for a 2022 uncrewed test flight — and NASA and Boeing haven’t revisited such software changes in a couple years, according to Stich.

Engineers then would need to run the software update through its paces at what’s called a “integrated test facility” on the ground, Stich added.

“That’s really what would take time if we were to pivot” to returning Williams and Wilmore home aboard the SpaceX Crew-9 mission, he said.

It is not currently clear whether NASA is leaning toward returning the astronauts on Starliner or making use of its contingency plan.

When asked, Bowersox said Wednesday that he could not offer a sense of the likelihood of either scenario.

“It could change drastically one way or another, depending on new data,” he said."

What should have been a quick trip to the International Space Station may turn into an eight-month stay for two NASA astronauts if they have to switch from Boeing to SpaceX for a ride home.

There's lingering uncertainty over the safety of Boeing's new Starliner capsule, NASA officials said Wednesday, and the space agency is split over the risk. As a result, chances are increasing that test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams may have to watch from the space station as their Starliner is cut loose to return to Earth empty.

If that happens, NASA would leave behind two of four astronauts from the next SpaceX taxi flight in late September, with the vacant seats set aside for Wilmore and Williams on the return trip next February.

The pair expected to be gone just a week or two when they launched June 5 as Starliner’s first crew.

NASA is bringing in additional experts to analyze the thruster failures experienced by Starliner before it docked. At the same time, NASA is looking more closely at SpaceX as a backup,

At this point, “we could take either path,” said Ken Bowersox, NASA’s space operations mission chief.

During a recent meeting, “We heard from a lot of folks that had concern, and the decision was not clear,” he said. A final decision is expected by mid-August.

Boeing issued a brief statement following NASA's news update, repeating its position that the capsule could still safely bring the astronauts home.

“We still believe in Starliner’s capability and its flight rationale."" the company said.

Boeing will need to modify the capsule's software in case Starliner ends up returning without a crew.

No serious consideration was given to launching a separate SpaceX flight just to retrieve Wilmore and Williams, according to commercial crew program manager Steve Stich.

Tests on the ground have replicated the thrust problems, pointing to seals as one culprit. But it’s still not understood how or why those seals swell when overheated and then shrink back to the proper size, Stich noted. All but one of the Starliner’s five failed thrusters have since been reactivated in orbit.

These thrusters are essential for allowing Starliner to back away from the space station following undocking, and for keeping the capsule in the proper position for the deorbit.

At the same time, engineers are grappling over helium leaks in Starliner’s propulsion system, crucial for maneuvering. The first leak occurred before liftoff, but was deemed isolated and stable. Then more cropped up in flight.

NASA hired Boeing and SpaceX to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, after the shuttles retired in 2011. SpaceX flew its first crew in 2020. Boeing stumbled on its first test flight without a crew and then fell further behind after a repeat demo.

Officials repeated their desire for a backup taxi service on Wednesday. A situation like this one could happen again, and “that’s why we want multiple vehicles,"" Bowersox said.

The next crew flight will be SpaceX's 10th for NASA. On Tuesday, it was delayed for a month until late September to allow for extra time to figure out how best to handle Starliner's return.

Three NASA astronauts and one Russian are assigned to the flight, and managers on Wednesday declined to say who might be bumped.

NASA says Boeing Starliner Astronauts may fly home on SpaceX in 2025.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/08/07/starliner-nasa-boeing-spacex/,"NASA officials said Wednesday that Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft may not be safe enough to return the crew home and that they could turn to Boeing rival SpaceX for the return much later than originally planned. If NASA takes that extraordinary route, it could mean that Sunita Williams and Barry “Butch” Wilmore, the NASA astronauts who launched on Boeing’s Starliner, would have their mission, originally scheduled for about eight days, extended to eight months, to February 2025, when SpaceX’s flight is scheduled to return.

Boeing, however, has made it clear that it strongly disagrees with NASA’s assessment and has maintained that the spacecraft is healthy and should be able to complete the flight, Starliner’s first with crew on board. The mission, designed to test how the spacecraft performs with humans in the capsule, already has been stretched out over the past two months as NASA and Boeing try to determine what caused several thrusters to malfunction during the June flight to the International Space Station.

Boeing was not invited to participate in Wednesday’s briefing, but said in a statement that it was safe to fly the astronauts home. “We still believe in Starliner’s capability and its flight rationale,” the company said. “If NASA decides to change the mission, we will take the actions necessary to configure Starliner for an uncrewed return.”

The disagreement has created an highly unusual situation that pits Boeing engineers against those from NASA as the sides struggle to determine the best way forward.

Ken Bowersox, NASA’s associate administrator for the space operations mission directorate, described the discussions as productive and said that “reasonable people could pick either” Starliner or SpaceX’s Dragon capsule as the way to return the astronauts.

The teams “were not too far away” from a final decision, Bowersox said, though NASA is still trying to “drive some more consensus amongst our team.” He added that NASA has “heard from a lot of folks that had concerns and the decision was not clear.”

But the debate has been stressful, he said. “I have to admit that sometimes, when we get disagreement, it’s not fun,” Bowersox said. “It can be painful having those discussions, but it’s what makes us a good organization.”

NASA, which has repeatedly stressed that safety is paramount, said that it’s still possible for Williams and Wilmore to return on Starliner. But ground tests meant to mimic what happened in space have not definitively demonstrated what caused them to fail, officials said.

“The NASA community, in general, would like to understand a little bit more of the root cause and the physics,” said Steve Stich, NASA’s commercial crew program manager.

NASA has brought in extra propulsion experts from across the agency — including personnel from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Glenn Research Center and the Goddard Space Flight Center — “to see if there’s some data that perhaps we have missed,” Stich said.

But in a statement last week, Boeing asserted that the cause of the thruster problem has been found, and that it shows Starliner is safe enough: “The data also supports root cause assessments for the helium and thruster issues and flight rationale for Starliner and its crew’s return to Earth.”

While Boeing has long been one of NASA’s most trusted partners, the space agency’s confidence in the company has languished, according to a person familiar with the thinking of NASA’s leadership.

“They just don’t trust Boeing anymore,” said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. “There’s been lots of times when they said, ‘This is good,’ and it turns out not to be good.”

If NASA abandons Starliner for the return mission and use SpaceX’s Dragon as a rescue craft, it would be another humiliating blow for Boeing. The company’s commercial airliner program has been reeling since fatal 737 Max disasters in 2018 and 2019, and assembly problems have been exposed by an incident this January, when a door panel blew off during an Alaska Airlines flight.

Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft is years late and has suffered repeated setbacks, from software problems to sticky valves. It had to redo a test flight without crew on board, after a major software problem prevented Starliner from reaching the space station in 2019.

During the current mission, which launched from Cape Canaveral on June 5, several thrusters used to orient the spacecraft suddenly shut off as it approached the space station. The propulsion system has also suffered helium leaks.

The delay in returning Starliner and the subsequent tests to figure out what went wrong have been costly for Boeing. In a recent earnings call, the company said it had to take a $125 million charge for the program, bringing the total amount the company has had to spend out of pocket for various missteps and failures to about $1.6 billion.

John Shannon, who leads Boeing’s exploration systems division, told The Washington Post last year that the company was having a hard time finding a business case for Starliner and that its future in the program was uncertain. If NASA decides Starliner is unfit to fly Wilmore and Williams home, some in the space agency fear the company would bow out, meaning NASA would only have SpaceX as a domestic supplier of crew transportation to the space station.

The space shuttle Columbia disaster, in which seven astronauts died when the shuttle came apart while flying back to Earth in 2003, remains in the back of NASA leaders’ minds, said Wayne Hale, a longtime NASA flight director.

“Those senior leaders lived through Columbia and don’t want to repeat those mistakes, and that’s why I have a great deal of confidence they’ll make the right decision,” he said in an interview.

He added that while there is pressure on Boeing’s bottom line, NASA would not factor that in its decision-making."
NASA says Boeing Starliner Astronauts may fly home on SpaceX in 2025.,https://www.houstonpress.com/news/boeing-starliner-astronauts-still-stuck-in-outer-space-18693398,"NASA folks now think – and publicly admit – that it could be a long, long time until astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore actually come home from the International Space Station.



Specifically, the astronauts, who piloted the Boeing Starliner to the ISS more than two months ago, could now be in orbit until 2025, officials with the federal space program acknowledged in a press conference on Wednesday.



There is also now a decent chance, NASA officials acknowledged, that the Boeing commercial crew spacecraft’s issues pose enough of a safety risk that Williams, the mission pilot, and Wilmore, the mission commander, won’t fly home aboard Starliner at all.



Instead, the space agency is looking at the possibility of bringing the astronauts home aboard Crew Dragon, built by SpaceX, Boeing’s competitor, in February 2025.



In a statement to ABC News, Boeing said ""we still believe in Starliner's capability and its flight rational"" and that it could bring the astronauts home.



This is only the latest in a miles-long string of setbacks for the aerospace giant, which has been dealing with fallout from the 2019 and 2020 crashes of two 737 Max jets, and started this year with a panel blowing off a 737 Max 9 midair during a January Alaska Airlines flight.



And then there’s Starliner.



Boeing was supposed to have Starliner through its crewed flight test by 2017, but the project has been running years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget. (On top of that, the company has recently written off another $125 million in unexpected costs for the program.)



The spacecraft was supposed to finally thunder off the launchpad for this crucial flight in May, but, due to a series of delays caused by helium leaks and malfunctioning thrusters, didn’t manage to launch until June 5. When the spacecraft, dubbed “Calypso” by Williams and Wilmore, docked at the ISS, five of its 28 thrusters failed to fire. More helium leaks were discovered soon after that.



Since then, NASA and Boeing engineers have been running tests to try and sort out these issues with extensive analysis and ground testing. Along the way, what was once an eight-day-long sojourn has morphed into more than two months aboard the ISS for Williams and Wilmore. Despite these delays, officials have continued to insist that the astronauts would be returning to Earth soon and would do so aboard Starliner — until now, that is.



During the press conference, Steve Stich, manager of NASA’s commercial crew program, maintained that the “prime option” is to have the crew fly home on Starliner, but he acknowledged that NASA officials started talking with SpaceX about a backup plan last month. “In the last few weeks, we have decided to make sure we have that capability there, as our community, I would say, got more and more uncomfortable,” Stich said.



So how will this backup plan work?



SpaceX currently sends four astronauts up to the ISS aboard the Crew Dragon space capsule every six months to rotate out the ISS crew of six. If Williams and Wilmore can’t use Starliner, SpaceX will only send up two astronauts aboard Crew Dragon when it launches September 24 or later. (SpaceX is pushing back its launch by about a month while officials sort out what to do about Starliner.) From there, the astronauts will become part of the regular ISS crew, hitching a ride home in February.



If NASA goes with this option, that is, a decision they’re expected to make a little later this month.



“We could take either path,” said Ken Bowersox, associate administrator for NASA’s space operations mission directorate. “And reasonable people could pick either path depending on where their view is on our position and the uncertainty.""



Starliner won’t just stay docked to the ISS in perpetuity though. Boeing officials have continued to maintain that the spacecraft is safe for the astronauts. However, if NASA opts to go with SpaceX instead, Starliner will be returning to Earth in September, just minus its crew."

Two astronauts stuck at the International Space Station since early June may not return back to Earth until 2025, NASA officials have said.

The space agency has been examining whether the two stranded astronauts could come home on board a SpaceX craft instead of the Boeing’s Starliner capsule, which has been beset with problems since its launch over two months ago.

There is lingering uncertainty over the safety of Boeing’s capsule, NASA officials said on Wednesday, and the space agency is split over the risk.

As a result, chances are increasing that test pilots Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams may have to watch from the space station as their Starliner is cut loose to return to Earth empty.

If that happens, NASA would leave behind two of four astronauts from the next SpaceX taxi flight in late September, with the vacant seats set aside for Wilmore and Williams on the return trip next February. The pair expected to be gone just a week or two when they launched June 5 as Starliner’s first crew.

NASA is bringing in additional experts to analyze the thruster failures experienced by Starliner before it docked. At the same time, NASA is looking more closely at SpaceX as a backup. At this point, “we could take either path,” said Ken Bowersox, NASA’s space operations mission chief.

The disagreements over Wilmore and Williams’ return to earth prompted officials to postpone an in-depth readiness review of the Starliner and to delay a SpaceX launch that was planned for Tuesday.

The Independent has contacted NASA, Boeing, and SpaceX for comment.

Publically, Boeing has insisted it still stands behind the Starliner, which suffered mechanical issues on its way to docking at the ISS on June 6 for what was supposed to be an eight-day mission.

“Boeing remains confident in the Starliner spacecraft and its ability to return safely with crew,” the company said in a statement on Friday. “We continue to support NASA’s requests for additional testing, data, analysis and reviews to affirm the spacecraft’s safe undocking and landing capabilities.”.

Bringing the astronauts back in a SpaceX capsule would be a major blow to Boeing.

The June flight was its first crewed mission to the ISS on the Starliner, a flagship development from the aerospace giant meant to compete with SpaceX for contracts with NASA.

Last week, Boeing reported a $125m loss on the Starliner program, adding to $1.1bn in previous losses it has taken on the effort, according to SEC filings.

The ability of the Starliner to complete its ISS mission could weigh on the fate of the half-dozen contracts it has with NASA for future flights, according to the Journal.

The issues with the Starliner add to a season of difficulty for Boeing, which has been under heavy scrutiny amid a series of mechanical issues and whistleblower claims surrounding its commercial aircraft.

These questions will all surely be on the agenda of Robert “Kelly” Ortberg, who assumes the role of chief executive at Boeing on Thursday."
NASA says Boeing Starliner Astronauts may fly home on SpaceX in 2025.,https://www.space.com/boeing-starliner-iss-astronaut-schedule-flux,"Boeing Starliner may not bring its first astronauts home after all.

NASA officials, absent a representative from Boeing, updated reporters today (Aug. 7) about how troubleshooting Starliner's undocking and landing may affect the next SpaceX astronaut flight to the International Space Station.

Starliner has faced a lot of difficulties since launching its first astronaut mission, most especially after 5 of its 28 reaction control thrusters (RCS) misfired during docking with the ISS on June 6. Work on the matter is ongoing, and as NASA revealed yesterday (Aug. 6), it will require the next launch to the ISS to wait. Crew-9, SpaceX's ninth operational flight to the ISS designed for four astronauts, will now launch Sept. 24 instead of Aug. 18. That's because NASA may send only two astronauts up on Crew-9, and bring the Starliner astronauts with the two returning crew sometime around February 2025.

Crew Flight Test (CFT), that Starliner mission, launched June 5 with NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. They were in large part selected due to their developmental experience as former U.S. Navy test pilots.

The duo was supposed to stay in space for roughly 10 days, but it now has been north of 60 and counting. NASA continues to emphasize the astronauts can leave the ISS if an emergency arises, but agency officials sound less certain now that the astronauts will come home on Starliner, as the mission plan called for.

""We're in a kind of a new situation here, in that we've got multiple options,"" Ken Bowersox, associate administrator for NASA's space operations mission directorate and a former agency astronaut, said during the briefing. ""We don't just have to bring a crew back on Starliner, for example. We could bring them back on another vehicle.""

That vehicle may very well be SpaceX. The sticking point is better understanding if and how apparent failures in thrusters on Starliner will affect its undocking and return to Earth. The descent back to our planet may again overtax the RCS system, some at NASA say. And not everyone yet agrees on the apparent cause, which CFT engineers have said may be overheating in ""doghouse"" shelters over clusters of RCS thrusters, which in turn causes thruster insulation to shed.

Additionally to the apparent insulation shedding, a poppet valve in Starliner's thrusters has been ""heating up and extruding and [...] contracting"" in ground testing, NASA commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said today.

Different members of NASA's program control board have different interpretations of the root cause of the thruster issues, and the risk to the astronauts. Stich framed the discussion as a problem of physics, as well as reliability, as the behavior of the RCS system — and any leftover effects from the shedding or poppet behavior — is not firmly quantified after all the testing.

Starliner can still safely undock from ISS, he said, but how its thrusters would behave on the ride home is uncertain. Knowing more about why the RCS and the poppet is acting this way, Stich said, ""would give us additional confidence to move forward to return Butch and Suni on this vehicle.""

He added that NASA has put a call out for additional propulsion experts across other divisions, such as the agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, to see if they can spot anything Boeing and agency CFT engineers may have missed in extensive ground and space testing.

Should the program control board continue to disagree and no convincing data comes forward, decision for Starliner's flight rationale would then go to Bowersox, whose authority is delegated to NASA administrator Bill Nelson. Final authority rests with Nelson himself.

""The administrator ultimately takes responsibility and and has a very important concern and responsibility for the final decision,"" Bowersox said. Notably, Nelson was on the last space shuttle flight 10 days before the fatal Challenger launch in 1986, and has spoken openly about the devastating effect that had on him.

Should Crew-9 launch as planned, the astronauts are commander Zena Cardman, pilot Nick Hague, mission specialist Stephanie Wilson and mission specialist Alexsandr Gorbunov. Cardman, Hague and Wilson are all with NASA, and Gorbunov is a cosmonaut with Russia's space agency, Roscosmos.

It appears NASA is still mulling over program-level staffing decisions if Crew-9 drops to two people instead of four. ""We're not ready to share specific crew names for the contingency plan,"" ISS program manager Dana Weigel told Space.com. She also didn't specify (when asked) about effects on the arrangement with Roscosmos and other space agencies for Crew-9 or future missions.

After another reporter asked what would happen to the two astronauts removed from Crew-9, Weigel said the ""specific details"" are still being determined. ""We'll go look at future manifests and just see what what makes sense for the overall crew compliments going forward,"" Weigel added.

Regardless of who is on board, per a task order issued by NASA, SpaceX Crew-9 could launch with two astronauts and two seats filled with mass simulators to account for the empty seats. Crew-9 would stay docked to ISS for a normal six-month mission, with Williams and Wilmore returning early next year in the two leftover seats.

Weigel emphasized the CFT astronauts are ""fully trained"" for a normal ISS rotation, and that was planned two years ago knowing a developmental flight may very well extend for months. NASA even has appropriately sized spacesuits on board for the CFT astronauts, in case a need for extravehicular activity arises. The ISS also has a four-month contingency of supplies that the CFT astronauts have been using for matters such as food and oxygen.

Other ripples to the ISS schedule are happening as well. Starliner will undock at some point, whether crewed or uncrewed, to make way for Crew-9 at the ISS Harmony module. Crew-8 will stay on board a little longer as it is expected to leave about a week past Crew-9's arrival, whenever that happens. SpaceX also has been tasked with delaying its 31st Cargo Dragon to the ISS to no earlier than mid-October.

SpaceX and Boeing are the two commercial crew providers for NASA, tasked in 2014 with sending astronauts regularly to the ISS after the space shuttle's retirement in 2011. Russia's Soyuz spacecraft stepped into the launching gap for ISS missions until SpaceX sent its first astronaut test mission to space successfully in 2020.

SpaceX, unlike Boeing, had its Cargo Dragon design to build upon when launching Crew Dragon. Starliner is an all-new spacecraft design, and faced issues on two uncrewed test flights in 2019 and 2022.

NASA says Boeing Starliner Astronauts may fly home on SpaceX in 2025.,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/space/3114906/stranded-astronauts-could-wait-next-year-come-home-nasa/,"The astronauts who traveled to the International Space Station in early June on Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft may have to wait until 2025 to come back home, NASA officials said Wednesday.

There is concern about Starliner’s capability after multiple malfunctions stranded the astronauts, so NASA could use an alternative, SpaceX’s Crew Dragon, in February 2025.

“We could take either path,” said Ken Bowersox, the associate administrator for NASA’s space operations mission directorate. “And reasonable people could pick either path depending on where their view is on, on our position and the uncertainty bound that we have for the data that we’ve got on the thruster system, on the propulsion system.”

If the astronauts stay until February, it would not break the record for the longest stay aboard the space station. It would, however, be significantly longer than their originally planned weeklong stay, which could now be as long as eight months.

NASA commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said the “prime” option is still to return the astronauts on the Starliner.

“You know, our prime option is to return Butch and Suni on Starliner,” Stich said. “However, we have done the requisite planning to make sure we have other options open, and so we have been working with SpaceX to ensure that they’re ready to respond on Crew Nine for a contingency of returning a Butch and Suni on Crew Nine if we need that.

“We have set up the Dragon for Crew Nine to have flexibility, to have only two passengers fly up on that flight, and then we could return four crew members in the February 2025, time frame,” he added.

NASA says Boeing Starliner Astronauts may fly home on SpaceX in 2025.,https://wenewsenglish.pk/boeing-starliner-astronauts-may-fly-home-on-spacex-in-2025-nasa/,"WASHINGTON: NASA officials said that the two astronauts delivered to the International Space Station in June by Boeing’s Starliner could return on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon in February 2025 if Starliner is still deemed unsafe to return to Earth.

NASA has been in talks with SpaceX to potentially reserve two seats on a forthcoming Crew Dragon mission for astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, the first to pilot Boeing’s Starliner.

Initially, Wilmore and Williams’ mission was expected to last around eight days. However, complications with Starliner’s propulsion system have extended their stay and raised concerns about the spacecraft’s safety for their return. A Boeing representative mentioned that if NASA opts for an alternative return plan, the company will prepare Starliner for an unmanned descent.

The Starliner faced thruster failures and helium leaks during its June approach to the ISS, prompting a rigorous testing phase to diagnose and rectify these issues. This testing has led to internal disagreements within NASA about the spacecraft’s readiness for a manned return. Should NASA decide against using Starliner, switching to Crew Dragon would mark a significant setback for Boeing, which has been competing with SpaceX for years.

The Starliner, currently docked at the ISS, has been there for 63 days out of its 90-day limit and occupies the port needed for Crew Dragon’s next mission. In the meantime, NASA, using a SpaceX rocket and a Northrop Grumman capsule, delivered supplies, including clothing for Wilmore and Williams.

The mission represents Starliner’s final test before NASA can approve it for regular astronaut transport to the ISS. Since its development began, Starliner has been plagued by management and engineering problems, costing Boeing $1.6 billion, including $125 million for the current test mission.

NASA’s Commercial Crew Program recently held a meeting that highlighted concerns and disagreements over relying on Starliner for the astronauts’ return. No definitive decision has been made, but NASA is allowing Boeing additional time for further testing. A decision is anticipated next week."
NASA says Boeing Starliner Astronauts may fly home on SpaceX in 2025.,https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/aug/07/spacex-delay-international-space-station-boeing-nasa,"Two US astronauts who blasted into space for an eight-day mission in June may be stuck on the International Space Station until next year if their Boeing Starliner cannot be repaired for them to return home, Nasa has said.

Nasa officials on Wednesday said astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who became the first crew to fly Boeing’s Starliner capsule, could return on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon in February 2025 if Starliner is still deemed unsafe to return to Earth.

The US space agency has been discussing potential plans with SpaceX to leave two seats empty on an upcoming Crew Dragon launch, which itself was delayed by a month on Tuesday, as Nasa and Boeing work out how to bring the astronauts home.

The astronauts’ test mission on 5 June, initially expected to last about eight days on the station, has been drawn out by issues on Starliner’s propulsion system that have increasingly called into question the spacecraft’s ability to safely return them to Earth as planned.

A Boeing spokesperson said if Nasa decides to change Starliner’s mission, the company “will take the actions necessary to configure Starliner for an uncrewed return.”

Using a SpaceX craft to return astronauts that Boeing had planned to bring back on Starliner would be a major blow to an aerospace giant that has struggled for years to compete with SpaceX and its more experienced Crew Dragon.

Starliner has been docked to the ISS for 63 of the maximum 90 days it can stay, and it is parked at the same port that Crew Dragon will have to use to deliver the upcoming astronaut crew.

The SpaceX Crew-9 launch was initially scheduled for mid-August. Nasa now says the mission will launch after 24 September.

Boeing said in July that after rigorous ground tests, engineers pinpointed issues within the Starliner, including the abrupt malfunction of thrusters and helium leaks.

In a 2 August statement, the company said its “confidence remains high in Starliner’s return with crew”.

Recent reports had suggested there was more conflict behind the scenes between Nasa and Boeing leaders. Some of the agency’s leaders had appeared to question whether the Starliner should bring Williams and Wilmore back.

A meeting this week of Nasa’s Commercial Crew Program, which oversees Starliner, ended with some officials disagreeing with a plan to accept Boeing’s testing data and use Starliner to bring the astronauts home, officials said during the news conference on Wednesday.

“We didn’t poll in a way that led to a conclusion,” Commercial Crew Program chief Steve Stich said.

“We heard from a lot of folks that had concerns, and the decision was not clear,” Ken Bowersox, Nasa’s space operations chief, added.

A Boeing executive was not at the Wednesday press conference.

Space experts told the Guardian it was not unusual or unexpected for an experimental spaceflight to develop issues.

“It’s defined as a test mission, it’s called a crewed test flight, and one of its things is to deal with unplanned issues,” said Jerry Stone, senior associate of the Space Studies Institute and author of One Small Step.

But the stakes are high for Boeing, which has been battling a PR crisis for the last few years over its aircraft.

At the company’s last press conference about the Starliner, Mark Nappi, Boeing’s commercial crew program manager, said he regretted being so “emphatic” about how the mission would last only eight days.

“It’s my regret that we didn’t just say we’re going to stay up there until we get everything done that we want to go do,” Nappi said.

Boeing’s testing so far has shown that four of Starliner’s jets had failed in June because they overheated and automatically turned off, while other thrusters re-fired during tests appeared weaker than normal because of some restriction to their propellant.

Aug. 7 (UPI) -- Boeing Starliner astronauts, stranded at the International Space Station after a weeklong test flight turned into a two-month stay due to thruster problems, may be forced to fly home on SpaceX in 2025, NASA has admitted. NASA updated reporters Wednesday at a news conference, which Boeing did not attend, on the timeline for crew members Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. The astronauts have been in space for 63 days with no return date in sight. Advertisement

Wilmore and Williams arrived at the ISS on June 6 on what was the first crewed test flight of Boeing's Starliner capsule. The mission was supposed to be the final step before NASA certified Boeing to fly crews to and from the space station, before faulty thrusters stranded the pair in June.

""We're in kind of a new situation here, in that we've got multiple options,"" Ken Bowersox, associate administrator for NASA's space operations mission directorate and a former agency astronaut, told reporters Wednesday.

""I would say that our chances of an uncrewed Starliner return have increased a little bit on where things have gone over the last week or two,"" Bowersox said. ""But again, new data coming in, new analysis, different discussion -- we could find ourselves shift in another way.""

""We don't just have to bring a crew back on Starliner, for example. We could bring them back on another vehicle,"" Bowersox added. The space agency is expected to make a final decision as early as next week.

""Our prime option is to return Butch and Suni on Starliner,"" Steve Stich, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program said. ""However, we have done the requisite planning to make sure we have other options open, and so we have been working with SpaceX to ensure that they're ready to respond.""

NASA said it is now considering sending only two astronauts, instead of four, on September's SpaceX Crew-9 mission to leave space for Wilmore and Williams to return to Earth on SpaceX Dragon in February 2025. SpaceX has been transporting astronauts to and from the ISS since 2020.

""We're not ready to share specific crew names for the contingency plan,"" ISS program manager Dana Weigel told Space.com. ""We'll go look at future manifests and just see what makes sense for the overall crew compliments going forward.""

On Tuesday, NASA announced SpaceX would delay the Aug. 18 launch of its Crew-9 mission, more than a month, to Sept. 24. The delay will give NASA and Boeing more time to repair Starliner's five of 28 reaction control thrusters which misfired during docking at ISS on June 6.

While NASA said Starliner can safely undock from ISS, there is still uncertainty over how its thrusters would operate during the ride back to Earth.

""Starliner ground teams are taking their time to analyze the results of recent docked hot-fire testing, finalize flight rationale for the spacecraft's integrated propulsion system and confirm system reliability ahead of Starliner's return to Earth,"" NASA said in a statement Tuesday.

Stich told reporters Wednesday that tests on the ground revealed that a small Teflon seal swells under high temperatures, which could be to blame for Starliner's thruster problems.

""That gives us a lot of confidence in the thrusters, but we can't totally prove with certainty what we're seeing on orbit is exactly what's been replicated on the ground,"" Stich added.

Despite not attending Wednesday's briefing, Boeing has maintained its confidence ""in Starliner's return with crew.""

""We still believe in Starliner's capability and its flight rationale,"" the company said in a statement Wednesday, as it also admitted the possibility that a different vehicle could bring the astronauts home.

The delay, which moves the launch of the Crew-9 mission from Aug. 18 to no earlier than Sept. 24, ""allows more time for mission managers to finalize return planning for the agency's Boeing Crew Flight Test,"" NASA wrote in a blog update on Tuesday (Aug. 6).

The update has arrived at a fraught time for NASA and Boeing. The Crew-9 members, who are scheduled to replace the current Crew-8 aboard the ISS, cannot arrive at the station until a free docking port opens up. The preferred Harmony module is currently being occupied by the Starliner spacecraft, which has been stuck on the ISS since June.

There is still no return date for Boeing's spacecraft or its astronauts, who have now been on the ISS for months longer than anticipated. Engineers at NASA are now debating whether they should send Starliner to Earth uncrewed and take the astronauts home aboard a SpaceX vehicle in early 2025.

""I would say that our chances of an uncrewed Starliner return have increased a little bit based on where things have gone over the last week or two, and that's why we're looking more closely at that option"" Ken Bowersox , associate administrator for NASA's Space Operations Mission Directorate, said at a news conference Wednesday (August 7). ""But again, new data coming in, new analysis, different discussion — we could find ourselves shift in another way.""

Isolating the issues

The problems began shortly after NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams rode to orbit in Boeing's spacecraft following years of project delays, successfully blasting off on Starliner's inaugural crewed flight from Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on June 5.

Wilmore and Williams were scheduled to stay a week in orbit, but during the flight the Starliner suffered a series of issues, including five helium leaks and five failures of its reaction control system thrusters. This forced engineers to troubleshoot issues on the ground and has extended the two astronauts' stay aboard the ISS from the planned week to two months and counting.

NASA engineers say that they are taking more time to pick up data on the flight worthiness of Starliner and to iron out its faults. However, progress toward an eventual flight home has stalled. NASA expected to begin a flight-readiness review for the spacecraft at the beginning of August, but the process has yet to start.

Tests conducted by engineers at Starliner's facility in White Sands, New Mexico revealed that, during the spacecraft's climb to the ISS, the teflon seals inside the five faulty RCS thrusters likely got hot and bulged out of place to obstruct the propellant flow, according to NASA.

A hotfire test conducted while the craft was docked to the ISS on July 27 showed the thrust was normal, but NASA engineers are concerned the problem could reappear during the craft's descent back to Earth. They're also worried that the helium leaks could knock out some of the craft's orbital maneuvering and attitude control system (OMAC) thrusters, which maintain the spacecraft on its flight path.

""The worst case would be some integrated failure mechanism, between the helium leaks and the RCS thrusters,"" Steve Stich , the program manager for NASA's Commercial Crew Program, said at the news conference. ""Then you could end up in some cases that aren't as easily controlled — more stressing cases that the team is worried about.""

Among the reasons for the delay is that Starliner cannot autonomously undock from the ISS, a maneuver that is necessary if NASA decides the craft should return on its own without the astronauts on board, Ars Technica reported . Updating and validating the software needed to make this maneuver will take up to four weeks, sources told Ars Technica.

NASA said it has a number of contingency plans in place, one of them being sending only two out of Crew-9s four astronauts to the ISS so that Wilmore and Williams can return with them in February 2025.

But whatever NASA decides, the decision will need to come soon, Stich said.

""We need to probably decide likely in the middle of August one path or the other to go ahead and meet the launch date for Crew-9"" on Sept. 24, he added.

The US pair were expected to be back on Earth by now, but have been grounded by issues with the capsule, which suffered thruster failures before it docked - causing their mission to be extended indefinitely.

They may have to stay until February if NASA decides to bring them back on a SpaceX flight, rather than risk using the Starliner capsule.

That would mean they would watch from the space station as the Starliner is cut loose from the ISS to return to Earth without them.

Ken Bowersox, NASA's space operations mission chief, said the US space agency is looking more closely at SpaceX as a back-up, and ""could take either path"".

Mr Bowersox said during a recent meeting, they ""heard from a lot of folks that had concern, and the decision was not clear"".

A final decision is expected by mid-August.

It could have a knock-on effect on NASA's next SpaceX taxi flight in September, when two of the astronauts scheduled to fly may be left at home, so there is space for Mr Wilmore and Ms Williams on the return trip in February.

Three NASA astronauts and one Russian are assigned to the flight, but it's not known who could miss out.

Boeing has reiterated its capsule could still safely bring the astronauts home, but the company will need to modify Starliner's software in case it has to return without a crew.

NASA's commercial crew manager Steve Stich said they hadn't seriously thought about launching a separate SpaceX flight just to bring back Mr Wilmore and Ms Williams.

He said thruster problems have also happened during ground tests and engineers don't know why seals that swell when overheated then shrink back to their proper size.

All but one of the Starliner's five failed thrusters have since been reactivated in orbit.

Starliner needs them to back away from the space station following undocking and to keep the capsule in the proper position for the deorbit.

Technicians are also trying to plug helium leaks in Starliner's propulsion system, which is crucial for manoeuvring.

And when they do, it may not even be on the Starliner capsule that in June initially brought them to the International Space Station for what was to be a week-long stay.

If the Starliner is ultimately deemed unsafe, NASA astronauts Barry ""Butch"" Wilmore and Sunita ""Suni"" Williams may instead come home in February aboard a SpaceX vehicle, NASA officials announced at a Wednesday news conference. While no decisions have yet been made, the agency indicated that multiple plans exist to get the veteran astronauts back to Earth, including having them even hitch a ride on a Russian Soyuz craft.

The announcement comes on the heels of another revelation surrounding the troubled Starliner venture: that SpaceX’s Crew-9 launch would also be delayed as Boeing and NASA figure out a plan for how the rest of the mission will unfold.

Starliner timeline:2 months after Starliner launched, astronauts still haven’t returned

Starliner crew could return on SpaceX Dragon

While the primary goal has always been for Wilmore and Williams to return on the Starliner, NASA and Boeing have had contingency plans in place to ensure they get home one way or another.

Among those mission contingencies is a last-ditch plan involving a return on SpaceX's Crew Dragon. If that were to occur, it wouldn't be until February that Wilmore and Williams finally make it back to Earth along with the members of SpaceX Crew-9, who are slated to head for a six-month stay at the space station.

""I don't think we're too far away from making that call,"" Ken Bowersox, NASA's associate administrator for space operations, said Wednesday. ""We know at some point we need to bring Butch and Suni home.""

While the return date remains uncertain, the astronauts were only scheduled to stay about a week in orbit when they launched June 5 aboard a Starliner craft perched atop an Atlas V rocket built by United Launch Alliance. But a slew of helium leaks and problems with its propulsion system hampered their return as engineers have been troubleshooting issues from the ground.

The mounting delays have prompted questions of whether Starliner is capable of safely returning the NASA astronauts at all, despite Boeing's insistence that it is.

""Boeing remains confident in the Starliner spacecraft and its ability to return safely with crew,"" the company said in its latest update on Friday, which outlined a series of tests that have been performed from the ground. ""We continue to support NASA’s requests for additional testing, data, analysis and reviews to affirm the spacecraft’s safe undocking and landing capabilities.""

In the meantime, Wilmore and Williams have continued to assist with science experiments and daily maintenance aboard the station, including the unloading of the Cygnus spacecraft that arrived Tuesday.

SpaceX Crew-9 mission delayed

But NASA officials aren't taking any chances.

As engineers evaluate testing data and conduct analyses, the U.S. space agency made the call to postpone the launch of SpaceX Crew-9, which had been slated to take off as soon as Aug. 18 for the space station. The routine flight meant to replace the Crew-8 mission that's been aboard the International Space Station since March now won't happen any sooner than Sept. 24, NASA said in a Tuesday news release.

The four Crew-9 members cannot arrive at the station until a free docking port opens up, meaning Starliner will have to undock by then with or without a crew, said Dana Weigel, manager of the International Space Station program. If the Starliner capsule cannot return home with its astronauts, then a diminished Crew-9 of two spacefarers will instead go to the station to leave room for Wilmore and Williams aboard the Dragon's return journey.

NASA said delaying that launch provides mission managers with more time to finalize a return plan.

""No decisions have been made regarding Starliner’s return,"" according to a statement from NASA.

What is the Boeing Starliner?

Boeing had high hopes that a successful crewed Starliner mission would put it on track to make routine trips to orbit for NASA.

Certifying Boeing for such ventures would provide NASA with a second operational spacecraft to carry astronauts to the space station as the U.S. space agency pivots to more partnerships with private industry. The agency has forked over billions of dollars to both Boeing and SpaceX to develop spacecraft capable of making trips to the International Space Station on its behalf.

But while Boeing's project has lagged behind schedule for years, racking up $1.5 billion in unplanned development costs along the way – as reported by Reuters – SpaceX has already begun reliably transporting astronauts and supplies to the space station.

It was unclear Wednesday whether Starliner could still be certified for crewed rotation missions if the capsule returns without its crew.

On Wednesday, NASA announced another delay in bringing home Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams during a news conference, with the agency saying it’s looking more closely at an alternative plan utilizing SpaceX’s Crew-9 mission.

If tests in the coming weeks suggest that making the trip home on Starliner proves too risky, Steve Stich, NASA’s Commercial Crew Program manager, said Wilmore and Williams would have no choice but to hop on Crew-9’s return flight in February 2025.

“We have been working with SpaceX to ensure they are ready to respond with Crew-9 as a contingency,” Stich said.

“We need to probably decide, likely in the middle of August, one path or the other to go ahead and meet the launch date for Crew-9,” he added.

The SpaceX mission was initially set to take off on Aug. 18 with the expectation that Starliner would have returned home by then, with the flight now delayed to Sept. 24.

The Crew-9 mission is a routine flight slated to bring four astronauts to replace members of the Crew-8 team aboard the International Space Station.

NASA said the Crew Dragon ship, which normally carries two to four passengers at a time, can fit additional occupants if needed.

Although NASA is actively working with SpaceX on the contingency plan, it has yet to make a final decision on which shuttle the two astronauts will be returning home in.

“We have not formally committed to this path, but we wanted to ensure we had all that flexibility in place,” Stich said.

Willmore and Williams were meant to spend just eight days in space following their launch aboard the Boeing Starliner on June 6 — the maiden crewed voyage for the spacecraft.

Once in space, the crew found a series of concerning helium leaks and thruster failures that have left NASA and Boeing scrambling to find a solution.

""We know at some point we need to bring Butch and Suni home,” said Ken Bowersox, NASA's associate administrator for space operations.

NASA revealed they are exploring a backup option for Wilmore and Williams to travel back to Earth on another spacecraft. Steve Stich, the manager for NASA’s commercial crew program, said that the backup plan would involve a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule traveling to the ISS with two astronauts rather than its intended four. Wilmore and Williams would stay at the space station before returning to Earth on the Crew Dragon in February 2025. The capsule was built by SpaceX, Boeing’s competitor.

“We could take either path,” Bowersox said.

Wilmore and Williams were supposed to be in space for just eight days, but their stay has been extended because of issues related to Starliner’s thrusters. NASA and Boeing officials have emphasized, though, that the crew is not “stranded” or “stuck” in space, and that they had plans for them to return at the “right time.”

The SpaceX launch had previously been set for Aug. 18, but NASA announced on Tuesday that the launch has been pushed back to no earlier than Sept. 24 so that officials can finalize a plan for Starliner’s return.

Boeing said in a statement on Friday that it “remains confident in the Starliner spacecraft and its ability to return safely with crew,” adding that it was supporting NASA’s requests for additional testing, data, analysis and reviews of the spacecraft.

If the backup plan is approved, Starliner would return to Earth without any astronauts on board.

NASA officials stressed that they haven’t made a final decision.

The initial trip from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on Florida's Space Coast was supposed to last no more than eight days, the New York Times said on Wednesday.

NASA and Boeing are currently discussing whether the spacecraft is safe enough to return to Earth, or if they will need to seek assistance from rival Elon Musk by using SpaceX to retrieve and bring Wilmore and Williams home, the Wall Street Journal and CNN reported.

The final decision is expected to be made by “mid August,"" per the WSJ.

“I would say that our chances of an uncrewed Starliner return have increased a little bit based on where things have gone over the last week or two,” said Ken Bowersox, associate administrator for NASA’s Space Operations Mission Directorate, according to CNN.

His comment referenced NASA's need to complete an internal review before the agency can set a return date for Starliner.

“But again, new data coming in, new analysis, different discussion — we could find ourselves shift in another way.”

“We could take either path. And reasonable people could pick either path,” Bowersox continued.

Per CNN, as of Tuesday, Aug. 6, NASA had not yet begun its “flight readiness review,” which would allow the Starliner crew to return from the International Space Station.

During the news conference, Steve Stich, NASA’s Commercial Crew Program manager, said “uncertainty around the thrusters” were one of the concerns currently delaying the return of the two astronauts.

However, ahead of Wednesday’s briefing, on Aug. 2 the company said, “Boeing remains confident in the Starliner spacecraft and its ability to return safely with crew. We continue to support NASA’s requests for additional testing, data, analysis and reviews to affirm the spacecraft’s safe undocking and landing capabilities.”

“We still believe in Starliner’s capability and its flight rationale. If NASA decides to change the mission, we will take the actions necessary to configure Starliner for an uncrewed return,” a Boeing spokesperson reiterated during the news conference, per the NYT.

During an International Space Station press conference streamed live by CBS News on July 10, Williams said she had ""a real good feeling in my heart that the spacecraft will bring us home, no problem.""

That date could now be sometime next February, which is when SpaceX is set to return with four crew members, according to WSJ.

NASA says Boeing Starliner Astronauts may fly home on SpaceX in 2025.,https://www.livenowfox.com/news/nasa-astronauts-waiting-come-home-might-hitch-ride-spacex-crew,"The Brief Two astronauts who were supposed to return home in mid-June might hitch a ride on a SpaceX spacecraft which won’t return until February 2025. Boeing continues to conduct tests after several thruster failures on their Starliner capsule. NASA is delaying its next SpaceX crew launch to buy more time to study Starliner’s issues.



NASA officials said on Wednesday that they may attempt to bring back astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams in February 2025 if issues with the Boeing Starliner spacecraft cannot be resolved.

SpaceX might be an option

Wilmore and Williams were meant to visit the International Space Station for a little over a week and return in mid-June, but thruster failures aboard the Starliner spacecraft have kept them in space for two months now.

In order to buy some more time for engineers, NASA has approved moving a separate SpaceX Crew-9 mission which was supposed to launch this month to Sept. 24, according to Steve Stich, manager of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program.

While it’s still preferred to bring Wilmore and Williams back aboard the Starliner, if problems persist, Wilmore and Williams may hitch a ride with SpaceX’s Crew-9 mission aboard their Dragon capsule.

If this is the path that’s chosen to bring back Wilmore and Williams, they won’t return until February 2025, extending their stay to eight months.

""Now we haven’t approved this plan, in other words, we’ve done all the work to make sure this plan is there. We have the suits identified to fly up on Crew-9, we have the seats set up so that we can fly a multiple complement of people, but we have not turned that on, formally, as that’s the path that we’re going to go down,"" Stitch said during a conference call with media.

NASA management expects to see SpaceX's full plan next week. Stich said the decision on how the astronauts return to Earth is expected by mid-August.

Even with the current issues, Sitch said he sees a ""bright future for Starliner.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -NASA officials said on Wednesday the two astronauts delivered to the International Space Station in June by Boeing's Starliner could return on SpaceX's Crew Dragon in February 2025 if Starliner is still deemed unsafe to return to Earth.

The U.S. space agency has been discussing potential plans with SpaceX to leave two seats empty on an upcoming Crew Dragon launch for NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who became the first crew to fly Boeing's Starliner capsule.

The astronauts' test mission, initially expected to last about eight days on the station, has been drawn out by issues on Starliner's propulsion system that have increasingly called into question the spacecraft's ability to safely return them to Earth as planned.

A Boeing spokesperson said if NASA decides to change Starliner's mission, the company ""will take the actions necessary to configure Starliner for an uncrewed return.""

Thruster failures during Starliner's initial approach to the ISS in June and several leaks of helium - used to pressurize those thrusters - have set Boeing off on a testing campaign to understand the cause and propose fixes to NASA, which has the final say. Recent results have unearthed new information, causing greater alarm about a safe return.

The latest test data have stirred disagreements and debate within NASA about whether to accept the risk of a Starliner return to Earth, or make the call to use Crew Dragon instead.

Using a SpaceX craft to return astronauts that Boeing had planned to bring back on Starliner would be a major blow to an aerospace giant that has struggled for years to compete with SpaceX and its more experienced Crew Dragon.

Starliner has been docked to the ISS for 63 of the maximum 90 days it can stay, and it is parked at the same port that Crew Dragon will have to use to deliver the upcoming astronaut crew.

Early Tuesday morning, NASA, using a SpaceX rocket and a Northrop Grumman capsule, delivered a routine shipment of food and supplies to the station, including extra clothes for Wilmore and Williams.

Starliner's high-stakes mission is a final test required before NASA can certify the spacecraft for routine astronaut flights to and from the ISS. Crew Dragon received NASA approval for astronaut flights in 2020.

Starliner development has been set back by management issues and numerous engineering problems. It has cost Boeing $1.6 billion since 2016, including $125 million from Starliner's current test mission, securities filings show.

CONCERNS AT NASA

A meeting this week of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, which oversees Starliner, ended with some officials disagreeing with a plan to accept Boeing's testing data and use Starliner to bring the astronauts home, officials said during a news conference.

""We didn't poll in a way that led to a conclusion,"" Commercial Crew Program chief Steve Stich said.

""We heard from a lot of folks that had concerns, and the decision was not clear,"" Ken Bowersox, NASA's space operations chief, added.

A Boeing executive was not at the Wednesday press conference.

While no decision has been made on using Starliner or Crew Dragon, NASA has been buying Boeing more time to do more testing and gather more data to build a better case to trust Starliner. Sometime next week is when NASA expects to decide, officials said.

The agency on Tuesday delayed by more than a month SpaceX's upcoming Crew Dragon mission, a routine flight called Crew-9, that is expected to send three NASA astronauts and a Russian cosmonaut to the ISS.

NASA's ISS program chief said the agency has not yet decided which astronauts they would pull off the mission for Wilmore and Williams if needed.

Boeing's testing so far has shown that four of Starliner's jets had failed in June because they overheated and automatically turned off, while other thrusters re-fired during tests appeared weaker than normal because of some restriction to their propellant.

Ground tests in late July at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico have helped reveal that the thrusters' overheating causes a teflon seal to warp, choking propellant tubes for the thrusters and thereby weakening their thrust.

""That, I would say, upped the level of discomfort, and not having a total understanding of the physics of what's happening,"" Stich said, describing why NASA now appears more willing to discuss a Crew Dragon contingency after previously downplaying such a prospect to reporters.

What was meant to be a weeklong trip to the International Space Station (ISS) for the first NASA astronauts to fly with Boeing could extend to eight months, with the agency considering bringing them home on a SpaceX spaceship.

A final decision on whether to persist with Boeing's troubled Starliner -- which experienced worrying propulsion issues as it flew up to the orbital platform in June -- is expected later this month, officials said Wednesday in a call with reporters.

Detailed planning is already underway with Boeing's rival SpaceX, owned by Elon Musk, to potentially launch their scheduled Crew-9 mission on September 24 with just two astronauts rather than the usual four.

The Crew Dragon capsule would then be able to return to Earth with Starliner's crew of Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams in February 2025 -- in what would amount to a major embarrassment for aerospace giant Boeing.

In this scenario, Starliner would fly back without crew before Crew-9 launches.

Steve Stich, program manager for NASA's Commercial Crew Program, revealed that there had been intense discussions on the best way forward, with Boeing expressing confidence in its spacecraft after carrying out ground testing to replicate the technical issues seen in space.

""I think the NASA community in general would like to understand a little bit more of the root cause and the physics,"" he said.

Notably absent from the briefing were representatives from Boeing, heightening the perception of a rift.

On August 2, the company released a blog update stating it ""remains confident in the Starliner spacecraft and its ability to return safely with crew.""

- Design flaws -

NASA and Boeing have been conducting tests at the White Sands Testing Facility in New Mexico to better understand why some of Starliner's thrusters experienced a loss of power as it approached the ISS, and why it sprung several leaks of helium, used to pressurize the propulsion system.

Stich said the latest analysis of why the thrusters failed pointed to the flow of fuel being choked within a ""poppet"" valve, as well as overheating causing some fuel to vaporize.

Officials previously said the helium leaks might be due to the use of undersized seals.

NASA's Ken Bowersox, associate administrator for NASA's Space Operations Mission Directorate, insisted that returning with Starliner remained the ""prime option.""

However, if Wilmore and Williams return with SpaceX, it would mark the biggest setback to date for Boeing's space program, as the century-old company continues to reel from the safety crisis affecting its commercial jets.

Both Boeing and SpaceX were awarded multibillion-dollar contracts in 2014 to provide the US space agency with rides to the ISS following the end of the space shuttle program in 2011, which left the United States reliant on Russian Soyuz rockets to ferry its crew.

SpaceX succeeded in its first crewed test in 2020 and has carried dozens of people since.

Boeing's program, by contrast, has faced numerous delays amid setbacks ranging from a software bug that put the spaceship on a bad trajectory on its first uncrewed test, to the discovery that the cabin was filled with flammable electrical tape after the second.

The crewed test itself experienced two aborted launch attempts that came as the astronauts were strapped in and ready for liftoff.

While NASA officials insist that Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are not stranded in space, the two astronauts who launched into orbit on June 5 were initially expected to return home as soon as June 14 — just eight days later.

After launching into orbit, Boeing’s Starliner began facing problems, including helium leaks and failing thrusters, but NASA officials downplayed the difficulties, claiming they were not “significant at all.”

Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months, and now NASA officials are acknowledging that these issues might be more serious than they had initially thought.

Now, the agency admits it has been looking into possibly sending the astronauts home on the Dragon spacecraft.

Last week, sources told Ars Technica that NASA was in the middle of robust discussions about whether to fly the crew home on Starliner or Dragon, with some engineers arguing that the fact they even have to question whether Starliner can safely send the astronauts back to Earth means NASA should opt for the Dragon.

“We could take either path, and reasonable people could pick either path,” NASA’s Ken Bowersox said on Wednesday during a press conference, according to a report by the New York Times.

If NASA opts for SpaceX’s Dragon, Musk’s spacecraft will launch into orbit with two astronauts instead of four, so that the stranded Starliner astronauts can join them for the return trip, reaching Earth in February 2025, the report added.

“In the last few weeks, we have decided to make sure we have that capability there, as our community, I would say, got more and more uncomfortable,” NASA’s program manager for commercial crew Steve Stich said.

While the agency has not yet decided which spacecraft it will choose, Stich added that a decision would have to be made this month.

But if NASA sends the astronauts home on Musk’s Dragon, that could mean the end of Boeing’s Starliner program.

Notably, Boeing has billions of dollars in aerospace contracts with the federal government. Moreover, Boeing said in a SEC filing last week that it expects to lose $125 million because of the Starliner delays.

Perseid meteor shower 2024 peaks this weekend.,https://www.space.com/perseid-meteor-shower-2024-peak,"Every August, just when many people go vacationing in the country where skies are dark, the best-known meteor shower makes its appearance: The Perseids.

This year, the Perseid meteor shower should reach its peak during the overnight hours of late Sunday night into early Monday morning (Aug. 11-12), when there is almost no moon, making the late-night sky nice and dark for shooting star spectators and counters. The first quarter moon sets around 11:20 p.m. local daylight time, leaving the sky nicely dark thereafter. Some Perseids do appear during the evening, but the shower is always better from about 11 p.m. or midnight until the dawn's early light.

Or, to put it another way, expect greater numbers of meteors to be evident during the pre-dawn hours because this is when your side of Earth turns to face the oncoming meteors more directly.

You can also watch the Perseid meteor shower online for free this weekend courtesy of astrophysicist Gianluca Masi of the Virtual Telescope Project. The first livestream will begin at 9 p.m. EDT on Aug. 11 (0100 GMT on Aug. 12,) and the second will begin at 9 p.m. EDT on Aug. 12 (0100 GMT on Aug. 13.), weather permitting.

If you want more advice on how to photograph meteor showers like the Perseids, check out our how to photograph meteors and meteor showers guide and if you need imaging gear, consider our best cameras for astrophotography and best lenses for astrophotography.

Where to look

During those after-midnight hours the shower's radiant point (the point from which it appears to originate), located between the Perseus constellation and the 'W' of Cassiopeia, will be getting progressively higher in the northeast — so meteors should flash across all parts of the sky at a rate of about one every minute or two (as seen by a single observer).

That, anyway, is the prediction if your sky is good and dark. But even if you live under moderate light pollution, as unfortunately, most of us do, you can catch at least the brightest of the Perseids. They have often been described in astronomy journals as including ""many bright and fragmenting meteors"" that leave persistent trains in their wake.

Earth should go through the thickest part of this ""old faithful"" of meteor showers for many hours centered around 1400 UTC on Aug. 12, which is 10 a.m. on that date Eastern Daylight Time, which is during the daytime across all of North America. So, for meteor watchers here, the night before and perhaps even after could be equally good. Fortunately, the Perseids stay active — about one-quarter their peak strength — for several days before and a day or two after their peak, and an occasional one may be seen almost anytime during the month of August.

A Perseid is one whose path, if traced backward across the sky, intersects a spot between the constellations Perseus and Cassiopeia. Other ""sporadic"" meteors traveling in random directions occur once every 5 or 10 minutes. Two much weaker showers are also active at this time of the year, the Delta Aquarids and Kappa Cygnids.

Lay back, relax, and wait

You'll need no experience to watch the Perseids. Just find a spot with a wide-open sky view and no late-night lights nearby. Bundle up warmly (it can sometimes get chilly even on summer nights), lie back on a ground pad or in a sleeping bag or even better, on a reclining lawn chair, and watch the stars. Also cover exposed parts of your body with mosquito repellent so you won't get bit.

Be patient, and give your eyes sufficient time to dark adapt. The direction to watch is not necessarily toward Perseus but wherever your sky is darkest, probably straight up.

The Perseids are the ionization trails made by little bits of debris from comet 109/P Swift-Tuttle, streaking into Earth's upper atmosphere at 37 miles (60 km) per second. The Perseids were especially dramatic in the early-to-mid 1990s surrounding the year of Swift-Tuttle's most recent return (in December 1992). Since then, however, they've reverted to normal. The comet isn't due back until August in the year 2126.

Startling occurrences

But surprises can always happen.

On the morning of Aug. 14, 2021, the Perseids displayed an unexpected outburst of meteors between 06:00 and 09:00 UT (2 to 5 a.m. EDT). The cause of this outburst is currently unknown but is probably the result of an unknown filament of comet debris produced by Swift-Tuttle as it raced through the inner solar system many centuries ago.

In an announcement on Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams Circular #5016 , the maximum zenithal hourly rate was estimated to be somewhere between 130 and 210, plus or minus 20. Amazing numbers considering that rates are normally 50% lower each preceding night after maximum but these rates are two to three times more than was seen during the expected maximum on the night of Aug. 12-13, 2021.

Four years from now ""might"" bring a truly amazing Perseid display, as some meteor experts are predicting that Earth will interact with a thick knot or clump of meteoric material shed by comet Swift-Tuttle during the 15th century, that possibly could produce a short-lived display of many hundreds of meteors per hour.

Defying predictions

Sometimes, even in years that are deemed favorable for Perseid viewing, sky watchers report seeing only a half or a third as many meteors that were predicted — and yet others report up to twice as many! It has been suggested that the stream of Perseid particles, strung out along its orbit around the sun, has a complex filamentary structure with gaps and rich spots.

Complicating the situation is the fact that some people's eyes seem better suited for meteor work than others.

Regardless of your local viewing circumstances, each year the appearance of the Perseids give many people a reason to head outside and gaze upward at the night sky. Even if you see only a few ""shooting stars,"" all it takes is catching sight of one outstandingly bright meteor to make the viewing experience worthwhile.

A final incentive is to note that next year the moon will be at a waning gibbous phase only a few days past full and will flood the sky with bright light, squelching all but the brightest Perseid streaks. So, take advantage of the favorable conditions provided to us this year.

To one and all we wish good luck and clear skies!"

The best time to view the Perseids is during the peak nights, which in 2024 are:

Sunday, Aug. 11

Monday, Aug. 12

Tuesday, Aug. 13

As for timing, meteors are most visible between midnight, after the moon sets, and dawn.

Where to watch the Perseid meteor shower in the Bay Area

For meteor spotting, you want to choose a dark location away from city lights.

Here are a few popular dark locations for watching meteor showers in the Bay Area:

Henry Coe State Park, South Bay

Tilden Park, East Bay

Sunol Regional Wilderness, East Bay

Mount Diablo, East Bay

Skyline Boulevard, Peninsula

Montara Beach, Peninsula

Pescadero, Peninsula

Point Reyes National Seashore, North Bay

Bodega Bay, North Bay

In the North Bay, you can find miles of darkened rural skies from the coast eastward. But note that fog in coastal areas might disrupt your views of the dark night sky.

State parks, national forests, and rural areas are also ideal for night sky watching. And if you’re looking to go beyond the Bay Area, popular spots in California include Pinnacles National Park, Joshua Tree National Park, Death Valley National Park, and the Sierra Nevada mountains.

NEW YORK CITY — With calmer weather ahead in New York City, 2024 could be a stellar year to take in the annual Perseid meteor shower, which peaks Sunday through Tuesday, Aug. 11-13.

Forecasters predicted that Tropical Storm Debby will have moved through the NYC metro by Sunday, so there shouldn't be a chance of any downpours dampening your meteor-watching excitement. And it looks like there will be limited cloud cover across the city during the Perseid shower, according to the NWS – with the clearest skies early on Sunday and Monday morning. Overnight temperatures from Sunday-Tuesday will top out in the mid-to-upper 60s in the five boroughs, per the NWS.



As with most shooting star shows, the best time to see the Perseids is during the hours between midnight and dawn, though NASA says some meteors could be seen as early as 10 p.m. Under dark skies, it’s possible to see between 50 and 100 meteors an hour, with a good possibility for fireballs. The moon will be about 50 percent full, but will set before midnight – just in time for prime meteor shower viewing.

Surprises are always possible, but meteor experts don’t expect 2024 to be an outburst year. Skywatchers who are into serious advance planning should mark the August peak for the 2028 Perseids on their calendars. The shower four years from now could be especially intense due to a meteor storm that could produce 1,000 or more meteors an hour. Until then, sit back and enjoy the last of the summer meteor showers. When it comes to brilliance, only the Geminid meteor shower in December rivals the Perseids. Both are known for swift, bright meteors that frequently leave behind long “wakes” of light and color, according to NASA.

Both are also known for fireballs, larger explosions of light and color that are brighter than typical meteors and whose “tails” last longer than typical meteor streaks. That’s because, NASA explains, fireballs come from larger particles of cometary material. Related: 2024 Guide To Meteor Showers, Supermoons And More The big difference between the shooting star shows from the skywatcher’s vantage point is the difference between summer and winter.

Also - the weather may not be on your side.

SEATTLE — Stargazers, the Perseid meteor shower is expected to reach its peak this year on Aug. 11 and Aug. 12 but will remain visible through late August.

We have compiled a list of places in Washington that are dark enough to give you the best chance of spotting some meteors in the late night/early morning hours.

But first things first, what are the Perseids? And why do they come around every year?

According to NASA, meteors are leftover comet particles from bits of broken asteroids. Comets come around the sun and leave dusty trails in their wake. The Earth then passes through the debris trails that collide with and disintegrate in our atmosphere.

The Perseid meteor shower in particular is comprised of space debris from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle. Swift-Tuttle takes over 133 years to orbit the sun. NASA notes the Perseid meteors can leave long trails of light and color behind them as they burn up in Earth's atmosphere.

For people hoping to spot the Perseids, keep in mind, it's a late-night activity. The Perseids may first become visible around 10 p.m., but the best chance of seeing the meteors may not come until 1 to 2 a.m.

Western Washington's peak Perseid forecast

Unfortunately, there won't be the best conditions for stargazing during the Perseids' peak, according to KING 5's Rich Marriott. Onshore winds will increase over the weekend, pushing low marine clouds overnight beginning Sunday, Aug. 11.

For the Puget Sound area, these clouds move in after midnight, which is when the meteor count is typically the highest.

""At that time, you are on the leading edge of the Earth in its orbit and it sweeps up additional debris for more meteors,"" Marriott said.

There will also be a quarter moon in the sky, adding some brightness even when the skies are clear. Typically, Marriott would suggest heading to eastern Washington to get some stargazing in, but visibility issues may arise due to extensive wildfire smoke.

Spots to stargaze

For stargazing spots in Seattle, check out The Best Spots for Stargazing in Seattle by Space Tourism Guide. Locations include Alki Beach and Constellation Park - however, stargazers in the Emerald City have to contend with intense light pollution that may impact their ability to see the meteors.

For those willing to make a trek, here are some dark spots to check out:

Mount Constitution - Orcas Island

The Washington Trails Association (WTA) lists this spot as the highest point on Orcas Island, offering ""unparalleled views over Puget Sound."" Mount Constitution is in Moran State Park, so those planning on night hiking will have to camp and have a Discover Pass. It's possible to drive to the summit for those uninterested in hiking all the way to the top. Check out more spots on the WTA's Dark Places Digest.

Sunrise Picnic Area - Mount Rainier National Park

The national park said it isn't uncommon to see 60 meteors within an hour during the shower's peak. Once at the Sunrise parking lot, the main trailhead is on the right side of the parking lot between the restrooms and the Sunrise day lodge. The park asks that people stay on paths to help protect plants and wildflowers. Pets on a leash are allowed in the picnic area but not on any trails. This is a popular spot to watch the shower, so plan to get there early.

What to bring when going stargazing

Being out in nature at night requires some preparation and forethinking to make sure everything goes smoothly.

Here's what people should bring for night hiking and hiking in general, according to the Washington Trails Association:

A detailed map of the area and a compass

Plenty of water

Extra food

Rain gear and insulation

Waterproof matches and a dry or waterproof striker

A first-aid kit

Knife or a multitool

A headlamp or flashlight with extra batteries and lightbulbs

Emergency shelter

Eye protection (if starting the hike in the daytime)"

toggle caption Ethan Miller/Getty Images

The annual Perseid meteor shower — the most popular one of the year — has already begun, with the most shooting stars expected to fall around Aug. 11 as the shower reaches its peak.

The Perseids occur each year when the Earth plows through a stream of space rubble left behind by a large comet called Swift-Tuttle. Bits of debris going over 100,000 miles per hour strike the planet’s atmosphere, creating quick streaks of light and sometimes even dramatic fireballs.

Here’s what to know, and how to take in the show.



Aim for dark skies, and adjust your eyes

This time around, the greatest activity is expected to occur on the night of Aug. 11 and into the early morning hours of Aug. 12, says Hunter Miller, a public observing educator at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, who notes that viewing is best under dark skies, away from artificial light and the bright moon.

“This year isn't necessarily the best year when it comes to the moon, but it's not so bad because the moon will be far away from where the Perseids are located in the sky,” says Miller.

Plus, the moon will set around midnight on the day of the shower’s peak, he adds.

“As late as you can be out, the better the views will get, the darker the sky will be,” he says. “As the moon sets, you'll have a pretty nice dark sky.”

He recommends looking northward and giving your eyes at least 30 minutes to adjust to the darkness — and warns that looking at the bright screen of a phone “will basically mess up all of the time that you spent trying to let your eyes get dark-adjusted.”

“You want as big of a view of the sky as possible,” says Miller. “Sit back, get your lawn chair out. My favorite part about meteor showers is that it doesn't really require too much.”

If clouds keep people from watching the Perseids at their peak, the views should also be good in the days immediately before and after, says Peter Brown, a researcher at the University of Western Ontario who studies meteors.

“With some meteor showers, if you miss the night of the peak or even an hour or two off the peak, there's nothing. Not so with the Perseids,” he says. “The Perseids are so large and they're so spread out that you can see them within a day or two of the peak, and you still see a really impressive show.”



Little rocks, big flash

Almost all of the debris streaming off the comet is tiny. Still, even something the size of a grain of sand can create a streak of light visible from the ground, some 60 miles below, because it’s coming in at such a high speed.

“You're not seeing the actual rock, but you're seeing all the light and heat that's being produced as a result of its passage through the atmosphere,” says Brown.

Typically, he says, the biggest incoming rock that someone might see during the Perseids is on the order of a few grams, and less than a half-inch across.

But this meteor shower does occasionally include larger rocks.

To see the full range of sizes that hit the Earth during the Perseids, Brown and some colleagues recently used a lightning mapping instrument on a satellite to observe the flashes of light that occurred during this meteor shower.

“We detected really bright Perseid fireballs over the whole Earth,” says Brown.

He and his colleagues calculated that the very biggest Perseids would be in the range of 20 pounds or so. Given the density of meteors, these space rocks would be smaller than soccer balls.

“That’s the absolute biggest,” he says, adding that rocks that size would entirely burn up in the atmosphere, creating a meteor streak that’s brighter than the full moon.

These largest Perseids mostly go unobserved, however, since they’re uncommon and much of the planet is covered with water and uninhabited land.

“Very, very rarely do people ever see anything this bright, but it is not unheard of,” says Brown. “If you go out, you observe year after year, you may eventually see a Perseid that rivals the full moon. But those are rare.”

More typically, a decent-sized meteor streak seen during the Perseids comes from a rock that weighs about a gram, or about as much as a raisin. These meteors can rival the planet Venus in terms of brightness.

“There are a fair number of those,” says Brown. “In fact, at the peak night of the Perseids, you might see a handful of those — three, four or five of those — an hour. ”"

The half moon will set in the west around midnight so that the best viewing may be around or after midnight away from city lights. Look northwest, but you could see meteors anywhere in the sky.

Here’s more from EarthSky.

Predicted peak: The peak is predicted** for August 12, 2024, at 14:00 UTC. So the mornings of August 11, 12 and 13 are probably your best bet.

When to watch: The moon will be a 1st quarter and 50% illuminated during 2024’s peak of the Perseid meteor shower. So the best time to watch for Perseids will be starting around midnight until dawn. This shower rises to a peak gradually, then falls off rapidly. And Perseid meteors tend to strengthen in number as late night deepens into the wee hours before dawn. The shower is often best just before dawn.

Radiant: The radiant rises in the middle of the night and is highest at dawn. See chart below.

Nearest moon phase: First quarter moon falls at 15:19 UTC on August 12. And a 1st quarter moon sets around midnight, so you’ll have dark skies after then until dawn.

Duration of shower: July 14 to September 1.

Expected meteors at peak, under ideal conditions: Under a dark sky with no moon, skywatchers frequently report 90 meteors per hour, or more.

Note: The August Perseid meteor shower is rich and steady, from early August through the peak. The meteors are colorful. And they frequently leave persistent trains. All of these factors make the Perseid shower perhaps the most beloved meteor shower for the Northern Hemisphere.

Warmer days return?

NOAA’s medium-range outlooks favor warmer-than-normal temperatures again in 8 to 14 days.

ATLANTA — The Perseid meteor shower peaks at the end of the weekend. The streaks of bright light seen in the sky during the Perseids are meteors from debris and dust left behind by the comet Swift-Tuttle, according to NASA.

Arguably one of the best meteor showers of the year, in one of the most active years, outbursts can lead to over 200 meteors per hour. But do not expect to see that many this year. There will be a waxing crescent moon about half illuminated, which will make part of the night not ideal for spotting any meteors with so much light pollution.

The Perseid meteor shower is also known for fireballs, larger explosions of color and light caused by larger comet fragments entering Earth's atmosphere.

When does it peak?

The Perseid meteor shower lasts from late July through the end of August but will peak on the night of Sunday, August 11, through the morning of Monday, August 12. That night, the moon will be visible in the sky for the first half of the night in the southwest sky. The moon will set around 12:03 a.m. on Monday the 12th. After that, the dark night sky will be ideal for spotting meteors.

How many could we see?

A couple of dozen per hour and up to 100 per hour will be possible, but only if you have ideal viewing conditions, with clear skies and no light pollution.

How to watch:

Early Monday morning, get away from city lights and any light pollution. If you live in the city, you'll want to travel a distance in the car somewhere more remote to avoid the city lights. Once you find your spot, give your eyes 15 to 30 minutes to adjust. Then, look up!

The meteors will originate in the north sky. The radiant point is the constellation Perseus. This will be just below the constellation Cassiopeia."

The Perseid meteor shower is set to peak this weekend, offering a spectacular opportunity for night sky photographers.

The Perseid meteor shower, known for its reliability and high activity, is one of the best meteor showers for photography in the northern hemisphere.

Geminid meteor shower, captivating video reveals spectacular cosmic display YouTube

The meteors appear to originate from the constellation Perseus, giving the event its name.

These ""shooting stars"" are actually tiny particles of dust from Comet Swift-Tuttle, which burn up as they enter Earth's atmosphere.

What do you need to take pictures of the Perseids?

Timing is crucial when photographing the Perseids.

While the shower technically started in mid-July, the peak is expected between August 11-12.

For the best results, plan to photograph during the darkest hours, typically between midnight and dawn.

However, since the radiant point of the Perseids is visible just after dark, you can start capturing images as soon as the sky is clear.

Location is also key.

To avoid light pollution, head to a dark sky site far from city lights.

If you're unable to travel, find a spot where you can shield your camera from streetlights, such as the shadow of a building.

Tools like an interactive world light pollution map can help you scout a suitable location.

Other necessary equipment:

Tripod: Long exposure shots are essential for capturing meteors, and a tripod is a must to keep your camera steady. Even a lightweight tripod can work, but for added stability, consider using sandbags to weigh it down.

Wide-Angle Lens: A wide-angle lens will increase your chances of capturing meteors by covering a larger portion of the sky. A telephoto lens, while good for other types of photography, is less effective for meteor showers due to its narrower field of view.

Manual Focus: At night, your camera's autofocus will struggle, so it's best to manually focus your lens. Set your focus to infinity and take test shots, adjusting as needed until stars appear sharp.

Since meteors streak across the sky unpredictably, your camera's shutter needs to be open and ready to catch them.

This means using long exposure times.

To avoid star trails (which occur due to Earth's rotation), follow the 500 Rule: divide 500 by your lens's focal length to get the maximum exposure time in seconds.

For example, with a 20mm lens, your maximum exposure time would be 25 seconds.

Once you have your settings dialed in, don't be afraid to experiment.

Start with your camera's shutter priority mode and adjust the aperture and ISO based on your results.

If your images are too dark, try lowering the aperture number or increasing the ISO.

Adjust one setting at a time to see how it affects your photos.

Photographing the Perseid meteor shower requires patience, the right equipment, and a bit of luck.

By following these tips and setting up your camera properly, you'll increase your chances of capturing stunning images of this celestial event."

The Perseids are an an annual meteor shower visible between mid-July to late August. They are one of the most prolific meteor showers of the year, providing skywatchers with ample opportunities to catch a glimpse of a shooting star during the warmer summer nights.

The meteor shower is caused by debris left behind by comet Swift-Tuttle , the largest object known to repeatedly pass by Earth . It last swung by our planet in 1992 and won't return until 2126. As Earth passes through the comet debris, fragments of rock and ice enter Earth's atmosphere at speeds of up to 130,000 mph (209,000 kph), about 85 times the top speed of a jet fighter. These speeds cause the air in front of the debris to compress and heat up to thousands of degrees. This results in the dazzling trails of bright light known as meteors, or ""shooting stars"".

Meteor showers are named after the constellation from which the meteors appear to radiate from. From Earth's perspective, the Perseids appear from approximately the direction of the Northern Hemisphere constellation Perseus .

When to see the 2024 Perseid meteor shower?

As previously mentioned, this year's timing is perfect because of the current Moon phase and the cooperating weather. The peak happens on Sunday night and into Monday morning. Your best chance is to wait until 11:30 p.m. ET when the moon sets, removing the biggest light sources from the night sky. The best viewing could be between midnight and the pre-dawn hours Monday.

How to view the Perseid meteor shower

Light pollution is the biggest factor in viewing most celestial events. If you can take the time to get away from city lights, you'll have a better chance of seeing shooting stars.

When you get to your viewing location, be sure to step outside into the dark and allow your eyes to adjust to the darkness for about 15 minutes. Then, lay down with as much of the sky as possible in your viewing field. According to NASA, the Perseids originate from the northeast.

In the darkest locations, it's normal to see between 50 and 75 meteors, according to NASA. That's one reason national parks are a popular destination during the Perseid meteor shower peak in the summer. Rangers at Joshua Tree National Park in California are warning of an increase in traffic because of the ongoing celestial show.

Even though the peak occurs this weekend, the Perseid meteor shower continues through Aug. 24. The last week of August will be a good time to try and spot a few meteors because we will be closer to a new Moon, providing an opportunity to view the meteor shower with less moonlight."

Here's what to know in Florida.

As with most shooting star shows, the best time to see the Perseids is during the hours between midnight and dawn. (Shutterstock)

FLORIDA — If the weather cooperates in Florida, 2024 could be a stellar year to take in the annual Perseid meteor shower, which peaks Sunday through Tuesday, Aug. 11-13.

The National Weather Service forecast for the peak dates calls for nightly showers and thunderstorms in Florida. Under dark skies, it’s possible to see between 50 and 100 meteors an hour, with a good possibility for fireballs. The moon will be about 50 percent full, but will set before midnight, just in time for prime meteor shower viewing. As with most shooting star shows, the best time to see the Perseids is during the hours between midnight and dawn.

Surprises are always possible, but meteor experts don’t expect 2024 to be an outburst year. Skywatchers who are into serious advance planning should mark the August peak for the 2028 Perseids on their calendars. The shower four years from now could be especially intense due to a meteor storm that could produce 1,000 or more meteors an hour. Until then, sit back and enjoy the last of the summer meteor showers. When it comes to brilliance, only the Geminid meteor shower in December rivals the Perseids. Both are known for swift, bright meteors that frequently leave behind long “wakes” of light and color, according to NASA.

Both are also known for fireballs, larger explosions of light and color that are brighter than typical meteors and whose “tails” last longer than typical meteor streaks. That’s because, NASA explains, fireballs come from larger particles of cometary material. Related: 2024 Guide To Meteor Showers, Supermoons And More The big difference between the shooting star shows from the skywatcher’s vantage point is the difference between summer and winter. Regardless of the meteor shower, stargazers are rewarded by their patience, something many have in more abundance on warm summer versus cold winter nights.

If you can, find a dark sky location to watch for meteors. Most meteors will fly during predawn hours, though it’s possible to see them any time after 10 p.m. during the peak, according to NASA. Also, the American Meteor Society notes, “the more stars you see, the more meteors will also be visible.”"

The Perseid Meteor shower is active from mid-July to September 1 and brings a dazzling display to the night sky with the naked eye.

NASA calls the Perseid Meteor shower the “best” meteor shower and notes that at its peak, you can see up to 100 meteors per hour although on average you’d see 60 per hour.

The Perseid Meteor Shower will peak August 11 - 12. (wsmv)

Most meteor showers come from the debris of comets. The Perseid meteors are associated with comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle. Swift-Tuttle takes 133 years to orbit the sun once, according to NASA.

Earth passes through debris trails left behind by comets every year, and when particles and bits from said debris collide with our atmosphere, they disintegrate creating fiery/colorful streaks in the sky (meteors).

The radiant of these meteors is the point in the sky from which the Perseids appear to come from. In this case, it is the constellation Perseus. The constellation for which a meteor shower is named only serves to help determine which shower you’re viewing on a given night.

The Perseid Meteor shower is at an optimal time this year with the Northern Hemisphere having the best viewing conditions. This year’s meteor shower peak coincides with a moon only about 44% full.

You can catch the peak of the meteor shower the night of August 11 through the dawn of August 12. At this time, it appears the weather will cooperate with nothing more than a few clouds in the sky.

BEST PRACTICES FOR VIEWING

-Go somewhere dark with an unobstructed view of the sky

-Look directly up above your head. Allow 10-15 minutes for your eyes to adjust

-The best time to see the meteors is anytime 10 pm to dawn

TOLEDO, Ohio — The Perseid Meteor Shower will make its return this weekend, bringing a display of ""shooting stars"" to Earth that you can see in your own backyard. Here's how to see it this year.

What causes the Perseids?

The Perseids are a stream of debris from a comet called ""Swift-Tuttle"" that takes approximately 133 Earth years to orbit the Sun once. Each year, in mid-August, the Earth in its orbit passes through the leftover debris from the last time the comet visited the inner solar system, which was in 1992, according to NASA.

When the Earth passes near this stream of debris, some of the leftover parts of the comet stream enter Earth's atmosphere, where friction (which is absent in the vacuum of space) causes them to burn, producing the light you see during a meteor shower like the Perseids.

When and where can I see it?

Though the Perseids technically began in mid-July and last through late August, the shower is typically at its peak between Aug. 11 and 13. This year, it will be at its peak late Saturday night and into the early hours of Sunday morning.

Some years, the light emitted by the meteoroids as they fall are comparatively dimmed by a bright moon. In 2022, the full moon on Aug. 12 made it difficult for observers to see the shower.

However, on Aug. 12 this year, the moon will be in its first-quarter phase, meaning that while it won't totally blot out the light of the meteor showers, it also won't be completely dark. The moon will be in the southwest while the shower is in the northeast, though, meaning you won't have to contend with the moon's light directly.

The Perseids appear to come out of what's called a ""radiant point"" just above the constellation Perseus, from which the event derives its name. The radiant point will be visible above the horizon at approximately 10 p.m. in the north-northeast. As the night goes on, the Perseids will appear to move up and slightly eastward. By 1 a.m., the star Capella and the Pleiades Cluster will join the Perseids in the sky, in addition to Uranus and Jupiter.

The diagram below shows where the Perseids will be visible this weekend.

Light pollution - Where to find a local dark sky

A crucial part of seeing the Perseids, as is with most astronomical phenomena, is making sure light pollution does not blot out your view.

Fortunately, the moon's waning crescent phase and position in the sky will improve viewing opportunities for everyone.

Additionally, you can improve your viewing experience by finding a darker area, such as a park open after dark or a rural area.

Light pollution is measured on something called the Bortle Scale. A ranking of 1 is true darkness, while 9 is the highest and brightest. Even if you live in a densely populated area, there's nothing a quick drive out into the country can't solve for hopeful astronomers. With less light pollution, spotting the showers is much easier.

Wherever you choose to view these ""falling stars"" (which of course are not so much stars as they are bits of debris as burning up in Earth's atmosphere), be sure to abide by local guidelines and respect other's property lines."

How to watch it from India?



The Perseid Meteor Shower , one of the most anticipated celestial events of the year, is set to peak this weekend. According to NASA , the best time to witness this spectacular display will be during the overnight hours of August 11 into the early morning of August 12, 2024. This year, the conditions are particularly favorable as the moon will be almost absent, providing a dark sky ideal for meteor watching .The Perseid Meteor Shower occurs annually when Earth passes through the debris left by the comet Swift-Tuttle. As these tiny particles enter Earth’s atmosphere at high speeds, they burn up, creating bright streaks of light across the sky. The Perseids are known for their high rate of meteors, with observers often seeing up to 60 meteors per hour at the peak. Some of these meteors are exceptionally bright and leave long-lasting trails, making the Perseids a favorite among stargazers.To get the best view of the Perseid Meteor Shower , find a location away from city lights with a wide-open view of the sky. The meteors will appear to radiate from the constellation Perseus, which will be rising in the northeast after midnight. Meteors, however, may be seen from anywhere in the sky, so lie back and take in as much of it as you can. The peak viewing hours are typically between midnight and dawn, when the sky is darkest and the radiant point is highest.NASA’s advice for watching the Perseids includes giving your eyes about 30 minutes to adjust to the dark. This will help you see the fainter meteors that might otherwise be missed. Bringing a blanket or a reclining chair can make the experience more comfortable, as you’ll be looking up at the sky for extended periods. It’s also a good idea to check the weather forecast to ensure clear skies.The Perseid Meteor Shower has been observed for centuries, with records dating back to ancient China. It is named after the constellation Perseus because the meteors appear to originate from this part of the sky. The shower is visible from most parts of the world, but the best views are typically in theNorthern Hemisphere .The Perseids are also known as the “Tears of St. Lawrence.” This name originates from the association with the feast day of St. Lawrence, a Christian martyr who was executed on August 10, 258 AD. According to legend, St. Lawrence was martyred by being burned alive on a gridiron. The meteors were thought to represent his fiery tears falling from the sky. This association has been part of European folklore for centuries, adding a historical and cultural dimension to the celestial event .In India, the Perseid Meteor Shower can be viewed under similar conditions. The peak will occur during the night of August 11 and the early hours of August 12. Locate yourself somewhere dark and away from city lights to increase your chances of spotting the meteors. The meteors will start to become visible after midnight, with the best viewing times being in the pre-dawn hours.Look towards the northeast, where the constellation Perseus will be rising. Although the meteors will radiate from this point, they can appear anywhere in the sky. Allow your eyes to adjust to the darkness for about 30 minutes, and try to avoid looking at any bright lights, including your phone screen. Bringing a comfortable chair or blanket will help you enjoy the show more comfortably.With clear skies and a bit of patience, viewers in India can enjoy one of the most spectacular meteor showers of the year. Happy stargazing!"
Perseid meteor shower 2024 peaks this weekend.,https://www.yahoo.com/news/perseids-best-meteor-shower-2024-150504653.html,"One of the top astronomy events of 2024, second only to April's total solar eclipse, is about to put on a dazzling display in the night sky as the weekend comes to a close.

The Perseid meteor shower peaks on Sunday night into early Monday morning and will boast up to 100 meteors per hour.

""This meteor shower is perhaps the most popular as it is active during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere,"" the American Meteor Society (AMS) explained on its website. ""There are stronger meteor showers but they appear during the colder time of year in the Northern Hemisphere when conditions are less inviting.""

The best time to view the Perseid meteor shower will be after 2 a.m., local time. However, some people may start to see shooting stars sizzle in the sky not long after nightfall.

The frequency of meteors will be slow at first, particularly during the early part of the night when moonlight will overshadow some of the fainter meteors. However, as the night goes on, observers should be able to spot dozens of meteors per hour, especially from dark locations.

Moreover, the Perseid meteor shower isn't limited to just one night. While the peak will occur from Sunday night into Monday morning, skywatchers can enjoy a good number of shooting stars throughout the entire weekend and into the first half of the new week.

A common misconception about meteor showers is that you need to focus on a specific part of the sky to see shooting stars. However, for many events, including the Perseids, having a wide-open view of the sky offers the best chance to enjoy the spectacle.

""Perseid meteors can be seen in all portions of the sky,"" the AMS said, adding not to look straight up as more meteors will be visible lower in the sky.

Additionally, folks should head to a viewing location far away from light pollution to see more meteors. Allow time for your eyes to adjust to the dark and avoid looking at sources of light, such as a cell phone screen.

""The more stars you can see, the more meteors will also be visible,"" the AMS said.

Many meteor showers throughout the year feature around 10 to 20 meteors per hour, but the Perseids far exceed this benchmark.

The only other meteor shower that outshines the annual August display is December's Geminids, which in recent years have amazed stargazers with 120 to 150 meteors per hour.

However, 2024 will be a challenging year for the Geminids, as its peak coincides with a full moon, significantly reducing the number of visible shooting stars. Because of this, the Perseids claim the title of the year's best meteor shower."

Early morning hours when the first quarter moon has already set and the sun has yet to rise are the best time this year to view the Perseids, which will also be plentiful on days bookending the annual show stopper.

NASA astronomer Bill Cooke said in a 2023 presentation on the Perseid shower that it is considered one of the best stargazing events of the year because up to 100 meteors per hour may be seen in ideal dark sky conditions. Also, it occurs in summer where residents of more northern climes can comfortably watch in warmer overnight temperatures.

Ideal viewing conditions — generally a dark area away from the urban lights — can be hard to come by in South Florida, but a drive to Lake Okeechobee or even a stroll on the beach may suffice.

""This year is special because the moon will have set by midnight, so its light will not wash out the dimmer meteors,"" Cooke said in an email. ""That means folks will see more — both the bright ones and those that are fainter.""

Debris from the comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle is the source of the Perseids, which are named after the mythical Greek hero Perseus. The comet orbits the sun in a large cigar-shaped oval, with Earth passing through its rubble stream every year in mid-August.

“The Perseids you see in the night sky were ejected form Swift-Tuttle hundreds if not thousands of years ago,” Cooke wrote in his 2023 presentation.

Sturgeon moon rises this month:All full moons have names. August's full moon is the sturgeon moon.

While the meteors appear to come from the constellation Perseus, they can be seen in all areas of the night sky. Perseids travel at 132,000 mph.

According to Sky and Telescope, a NASA analysis of all-sky images taken from 2008 to 2013 found the Perseid shower produced more bright meteors than any other annual meteor shower.

Bob King, an amateur astronomer who writes for Sky and Telescope, said this year’s Perseid shower may include outbursts, which happen when the Earth’s path crosses areas thick with debris from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle. A good time to catch an outburst this year is around 5 a.m. Monday, Aug. 12, King said.

The Perseids are back to dazzle the sky with bursts of light and color.

The annual meteor shower, active since July, peaks before dawn Monday. It's one of the brightest and most easily viewed showers of the year, producing ""bright blue meteors—and lots of them,"" said University of Warwick astronomer Don Pollacco.

More than 50 meteors per hour are expected, according to the American Meteor Society. The shower lasts through Sept. 1.

Here's what to know about the Perseids and other meteor showers.

What is a meteor shower?

Multiple meteor showers occur annually and you don't need special equipment to see them.

Most meteor showers originate from the debris of comets. The source of the Perseids is the comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle.

When rocks from space enter Earth's atmosphere, the resistance from the air makes them very hot. This causes the air to glow around them and briefly leaves a fiery tail behind them—the end of a ""shooting star.""

The glowing pockets of air around fast-moving space rocks, ranging from the size of a dust particle to a boulder, may be visible in the night sky.

The Perseids result from ""bigger particles than a lot of other showers,"" said NASA's Bill Cooke, giving them the appearance of ""bright fireballs""—easier to spot than many others.

How to view a meteor shower

Meteor showers are usually most visible between midnight and predawn hours.

It's easier to see shooting stars under dark skies, away from city lights. Meteor showers also appear brightest on cloudless nights when the moon wanes smallest.

The Northern Hemisphere will have the best view of the Perseids. This year's peak coincides with a moon around 44% full.

When is the next meteor shower?

The meteor society keeps a list of upcoming large meteor showers, including the peak viewing days and moonlight conditions.

The next major meteor shower will be the Orionids, peaking in mid-October.

The weather for much of Michigan should cooperate for optimal viewing of the Perseids, which NASA says will be at its absolute best for 2024 this Sunday night (August 11th) heading into Monday morning (August 12th) - ideally after the moon has set.

Why Should I Leave the City to View the Meteor Shower?

If there's a considerable amount of city lights where you are, that's going to make viewing the night sky more difficult.

Watching for meteors - or shooting stars, as many call them - is easier when you're away from bright lights at ground level that may hinder your view.

This light pollution map can help you find the best places in Michigan to watch for the meteor shower. The Headlands International Dark Sky Park near Mackinaw City is probably Michigan's absolute best place for viewing the Perseids, but there are plenty of other rural locations that are suitable as well.

Where Should I Look in the Sky?

According to NASA, you should be able to spot some shooting stars no matter which way you're looking during the peak of the event. How many can you expect?

There can be as little as a few dozen per hour, but some rare years bring a brief ""burst' of up to two hundred beautiful ""shooting stars"" an hour.

Under a clear, dark sky, most skywatchers in Michigan can expect to see at least one meteor about every minute or so.

What Are the Best Ways to View the Meteor Shower?

The Perseids are best viewed by the naked eye, according to NASA.

Since they'll be all over the sky, limiting your view via binoculars or a telescope will significantly reduce your chances of spotting these shooting stars. It's also a good idea to keep your cell phone in your pocket - even checking it for a moment will cause your eyes to adjust to the light given off by your phone, and it'll take longer to re-adjust to viewing the dark sky.

LOOKING UP: 40 Breathtaking Images Of The Perseid Meteor Shower Around The World According to NASA, the Perseid meteor shower is ""considered the best meteor shower of the year."" The show typically peaks mid-August. For 2023, the shower peaked around the world between Aug. 12-14. The latest edition of the meteor shower created an extra special light show in the sky.

Washington State University Astronomer Guy Worthey says the shower should peak around midnight Sunday with about 100 meteors an hour."
Perseid meteor shower 2024 peaks this weekend.,https://gizmodo.com/the-perseids-are-back-how-to-watch-one-of-the-best-meteor-showers-of-the-year-2000484433,"One of the year’s most spectacular meteor showers is about to reach its peak. Here’s what you need to know to get the best view of the Perseid meteor shower.

Although the Perseids began burning up in Earth’s atmosphere in mid-July, it took a few weeks for them to reach their peak. According to EarthSky, this peak is predicted to occur on the night of Sunday, August 11, and continue into the following morning. If you have plans that night, the nights before and after may have slightly fewer meteors, but should still make for some pleasant skywatching. The show should start at around midnight, though the intensity will gradually increase as the night goes on and reach its pinnacle shortly before dawn.

Unfortunately, and as NASA points out, the peak of the shower is set to occur on a night when there will be a 53% waxing Moon, which could have an impact on visibility. However, the Moon is forecast to set before the prime display at dawn, which should allow for quite a few meteors to be seen. Even so, the display isn’t expected to be as grand as what was seen last year.

The meteors are renowned for their bright colors and long tails, as well as for being as plentiful as they are beautiful. During the peak, up to 100 meteors are anticipated to cross the sky every hour, making the shower one of the most bountiful of the year. The Perseids’ only competition on that front may be the Geminids, which take place in mid-December. For those of us in the Northern Hemisphere, the summer weather makes watching the Perseids a much more pleasant option.

The Perseids get their name from the constellation Perseus, which is where they appear to start their voyage across the sky. That point of origin for meteors is called a radiant, but actually has nothing to do with where meteors come from. Meteors are small pieces of rock and dust that get dislodged from a parent comet as it hurtles through space. As the Earth passes through that trail of debris, some of it enters the atmosphere and burns up, creating streaks of light. In the Perseids’ case, that comet is named 109P/Swift-Tuttle, which orbits the Sun once every 133 years. If you’d like to see the comet itself, don’t hold your breath—its orbit and the Earth won’t cross paths again until 2125.

Because the Perseids’ radiant is in the northern portion of the sky, the best views of the shower are in the Earth’s Northern Hemisphere. However, people in parts of the Southern Hemisphere who live near the equator down to the mid-southern latitudes should still be able to catch a glimpse. NASA recommends heading away from city lights to watch the meteors in a dark location for the best viewing experience. Make sure to check the weather forecast for where you’re headed and dress appropriately, with plenty of water and snacks. Lie on the ground (bring a blanket or towel!), tilt your head back, and enjoy."
Perseid meteor shower 2024 peaks this weekend.,https://www.lonestarlive.com/life/2024/08/texas-state-parks-hosting-perseid-meteor-shower-events-to-give-visitors-front-row-seats-to-night-sky.html,"With the peak of the Perseid meteor shower right around the corner, some of the best views in the Lone Star State to view the celestial event will be from Texas state parks.

Several state parks are holding events just before or during this year’s peak period to give skywatchers a front row seat to what many consider to be the best meteor shower of the year.

The Perseid meteor shower will reach its peak the evening of Aug. 11 to 12, with good viewing conditions for a few days on either side of the peak. Skywatchers who look up during the pre-dawn hours could see an average of 50 to 100 meteors, according to NASA.

Whether or not you head to a state park to view this year’s Perseids, you’ll want to get as far away as possible from city lights and other light pollution. The less light pollution, the more meteors you’ll see. You should also allow 30 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the darkness. Try to avoid using a flashlight (unless it has a red light) or looking at your phone.

You won’t need a telescope or binoculars since you’ll want the widest view of the sky possible. Try to find a spot where you can see a lot of the sky without trees or buildings blocking your view, and then simply lie down on a blanket and look up.

Although meteors can come from any direction, you’ll want to generally orient yourself to look to the north toward the Perseus constellation. Though Perseus isn’t the easiest to find, it conveniently follows the brighter and more distinctive constellation Cassiopeia across the night sky.

Here, we break down all of the events happening in Texas state parks during this year’s Perseid meteor shower.

Perseid meteor shower 2024 peaks this weekend.,https://spectrumlocalnews.com/tx/austin/weather/2024/08/07/perseid-meteor-shower-peaks-this-weekend,"One of the best meteor showers of the year peaks late this weekend into early next week.

What You Need To Know The Perseid meteor shower has up to 100 meteors per hour



The best time for viewing will fall between midnight and dawn



This meteor shower comes from the debris of Comet Swift-Tuttle

The Perseid meteor shower peaks Sunday night into Monday, but you can catch them the rest of this weekend and even into early next week. While you can spot meteors zooming across the sky after dark, your best opportunity will be after midnight.

As the night goes on, the constellation Perseus–where the meteors appear to originate­–will rise higher in the northeast sky. However, you can look anywhere overhead, not just in that direction.

The good news is that the moon won't be full yet, meaning the light won't wash out the meteors.

In ideal conditions, this show produces 50 to 100 meteors per hour, or about one or two every minute. Go find a dark place away from city lights and let your eyes adjust to the darkness for at least 15 minutes.

The Perseids produce long, bright trails, making it one of the more visual annual showers.

You might be inclined to photograph these spectacles of light. Like in May, when the northern lights were visible, the best way to capture space phenomena is using a DSLR camera on timer and low exposure.

If opting for your smartphone, it's best to put it on a tripod or stable platform. Go to settings and use long exposure or night mode.

We see the Perseids in the late summer as the Earth passes through the dust and debris that Comet Swift-Tuttle leaves behind. The “shooting stars” actually come from grains that are about the size of Grape Nuts, according to Sky & Telescope, that burn in the atmosphere as they zip by at over 130,000 miles per hour.

Hopefully clouds don’t get in your way! Check your local forecast here. But if clear skies aren’t in the cards Saturday night, don’t worry. That’s when they should be most active, but the Perseids don’t suddenly start and stop; you can try looking any time around the peak.

This isn’t the last meteor shower of the year. See the others coming up, along with other night sights, right here.

Perseid meteor shower 2024 peaks this weekend.,https://www.cntraveler.com/story/perseid-meteor-shower,"Fireworks, but make it totally silent and all-natural. That’s my kind of light show, and the Perseid Meteor Shower—the most popular meteor shower of the year—peaks this weekend, August 11-13. While you can probably see the natural display from your backyard, heading to darker skies pays off. I’ll never forget my first time watching the Perseids during a summer I spent at a dude ranch in a remote Colorado canyon. There were so many meteors, my fellow spectators and I eventually stopped counting, observing the myriad meteors flying through the sky in total awe.

To make the most of your Perseid experience, there are a few things to keep in mind as far as how to escape light pollution if you live in a city, when exactly to watch, and how to set yourself up for celestial success. This is your guide to the 2024 Perseid Meteor Shower.

When can I see the Perseid Meteor Shower?

While the Perseids technically kicked off in mid-July and last through August, the peak arrives in the wee hours of August 11. Peak Perseid activity lasts through the early morning of August 13. This year, the lunar situation is very favorable, with a quarter moon setting around midnight. Read: Darker skies, brighter meteors!

The best time to view will be after midnight (or after the moon sets in your area) until dawn. For night owls, you might as well just stay up late and peep the meteors at midnight. Early birds can set their alarms for 3:30 a.m. or 4:00 a.m. to catch the show.

Where can I catch the Perseids?

Technically, the Perseid Meteor Shower is visible anywhere in the Northern Hemisphere and above mid-latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. But like any celestial phenomena, the darker the skies above, the better the show. Generally speaking, you’ll want to escape urban light pollution and head somewhere more rural. If you’re looking for good dark sky destinations, check the official list of Dark Sky Places, certified by the international nonprofit DarkSky. Unsurprisingly, many destinations on the list are state or national parks, some of which offer camping.

Another consideration is the forecast. If clouds obscure the sky, you won’t be able to see many meteors. If your area has precipitation or overcast skies in the forecast during peak Perseids, consider traveling somewhere clearer for a better viewing experience.

The ultimate place to catch the Perseid Meteor Shower might just be my home state of Utah, which has the greatest concentration of certified Dark Sky Places in the world. As the second driest state in the country, Utah is also likely to have clear skies, especially in August. I’ll be watching from my campsite at Bear Lake along the Utah-Idaho border.

What is the Perseid Meteor Shower?

You’ve probably heard that “shooting star” is a misnomer. But what exactly is a meteor shower? This light show in the sky is a great reminder that earth is on the move—and right now, we’re literally cruising through a bunch of debris that’s burning up as it enters our atmosphere. All this debris is coming from a 16-mile wide comet named Swift-Tuttle. It’s kind of like looking at hail pelting your windshield as you drive through a storm—except that these meteors are on fire about 60 miles above you."
Perseid meteor shower 2024 peaks this weekend.,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/08/08/science/light-pollution-is-making-it-harder-to-see-stars/,"Each year, due to an increase in light pollution as urban areas get brighter, less and less of the night sky is visible. Nationally, light pollution is growing at a rate of about 10 percent a year, according to a 2023 study , as high-powered LED bulbs light up highways, parking lots, and buildings like Christmas trees.

That magic returns late Sunday evening, when the Perseid meteor shower peaks, raining as many as 75 meteors per hour across the night sky. But as astronomer Tim Brothers prepares for a Perseid-watching event at the MIT Wallace Astrophysical Observatory, he worries: How many more of these will be visible in Massachusetts?

There are moments when the Earth feels small, when it becomes abundantly clear that we’re all just sitting on a rock, spinning through the galaxy — like this year’s solar eclipse, for instance, or the Northern Lights that danced across New England skies in May.

What that means is that in most places in Massachusetts, it’s no longer possible to see the Milky Way. And in some places, when you look up, you no longer see many stars.

Advocates have been working for years to pass legislation in Massachusetts to regulate light pollution, and this year everything was falling into place to get things done. But, like many bills left to the last minute, the stargazers walked away from Beacon Hill empty-handed.

The excessive lighting isn’t just making it harder to see the stars, it’s also disrupting circadian rhythm for wildlife and humans alike, contributing to health issues, including breast cancer, mental health disorders, and diabetes, according to the American Medical Association.

But simple changes — like shields that focus light downward, limits on the power of LEDs that have excessive blue tones, and the elimination of unnecessary lighting — can make all the difference.

“It doesn’t cost any more to put up good lights, as opposed to bad lights,” said Mario Motta, a physician who served on the American Medical Association’s board of trustees and has authored reports on outdoor lighting’s effects on health. But when it comes to human health and the environment, the cost of bad lighting is high, he said.

Despite decades of advocacy, Massachusetts has not passed a bill that would regulate light pollution, making it the only New England state that has failed to take that step.

“We are the outlier,” Brothers said, noting that “even New Hampshire,” which often lags behind New England states on environmental regulations, has passed legislation to address light pollution.

Advocates had been hopeful that this could have been the year. Identical bills sponsored by Representative Sean Garballey and Senator Cynthia Creem, both Democrats, would have required government-funded lights to be shielded so they shine downward and not up into space, and also require the state to eliminate unnecessary lighting, and make a regulatory tweak to incentivize municipalities to cut back on wasteful lighting.

The legislators weren’t looking for anyone to rip out old lighting, just to make smart decisions when it’s time for new lights.

“People have the perception that well-lit streets and spaces are safer for you, but that’s just the perception,” said Kelly Beatty, a longtime advocate for light pollution regulations who helped write the bills. In fact, when the city of Chicago studied crime before and after a decision to light alleys in the city — with the expectation that crime would drop — the opposite happened. Crime reports rose more than 20 percent.

The bill breezed through hearings at the legislature with no opposition and a broad base of support, including endorsements by the Sierra Club of Massachusetts, the Trustees of Reservations, Zoo New England, the Massachusetts Medical Society, and more. It even had support from the Illuminating Engineering Society, the technical authority that sets standards for lighting.

Even after it appeared to stall out in the Senate Committee on Ways and Means, House and Senate leaders indicated that it could be included in a major climate bill, according to advocates.

But before the climate bills got out of their respective chambers — bills that would go on to fail with Senate and House leaders unable to reach a compromise — the light pollution bill was inexplicably stripped out.

“We’re just flummoxed,” Beatty, the longtime advocate for regulation, said.

Senator Creem said she was just as baffled.

“I keep thinking, ‘Why isn’t this happening?’”

The best answer she can think of is that, despite a broad group of interests who support the effort, there isn’t yet the on-the-ground urgency of other issues.

“It hasn’t gotten people excited,” she said.

In other words, protecting the night sky got lost in the shuffle as legislators pushed for bigger ticket priorities.

“The nature of our legislature is such that small bills like ours almost never get passed,” said Beatty, even if there’s no real public opposition.

Still, advocates remain hopeful that legislators will be called back to reopen a formal session and their bill could be revived. But they also acknowledge that, at this point, they’re feeling deflated.

Across the state, some 50 municipalities have taken steps to address light pollution, including some that have limited how bright street lights can be. But state regulations are needed, according to supporters of the bill, to regulate any state-owned lights, for example at schools and along highways.

Anne Hayek, a Needham resident and vice president of the Massachusetts chapter of DarkSky International, said she just wants to make sure that the night sky she grew up gazing at is there for her daughter and for future generations.

“An important part of being a human being is to be able to see the stars,” she said. “It helps us realize our place in the universe, connecting us and letting us feel small.”

Is a meteor storm predicted?

MICHIGAN — If the weather cooperates in Michigan, 2024 could be a stellar year to take in the annual Perseid meteor shower, which peaks Sunday through Tuesday, Aug. 11-13.

The National Weather Service forecast for the peak dates calls for mostly sunny conditions with pleasant temperatures across Michigan. Under dark skies, it’s possible to see between 50 and 100 meteors an hour, with a good possibility for fireballs. The moon will be about 50 percent full, but will set before midnight, just in time for prime meteor shower viewing. As with most shooting star shows, the best time to see the Perseids is during the hours between midnight and dawn,

Surprises are always possible, but meteor experts don’t expect 2024 to be an outburst year. Skywatchers who are into serious advance planning should mark the August peak for the 2028 Perseids on their calendars. The shower four years from now could be especially intense due to a meteor storm that could produce 1,000 or more meteors an hour. Until then, sit back and enjoy the last of the summer meteor showers. When it comes to brilliance, only the Geminid meteor shower in December rivals the Perseids. Both are known for swift, bright meteors that frequently leave behind long “wakes” of light and color, according to NASA.

Both are also known for fireballs, larger explosions of light and color that are brighter than typical meteors and whose “tails” last longer than typical meteor streaks. That’s because, NASA explains, fireballs come from larger particles of cometary material. Related: 2024 Guide To Meteor Showers, Supermoons And More The big difference between the shooting star shows from the skywatcher’s vantage point is the difference between summer and winter. Regardless of the meteor shower, stargazers are rewarded by their patience, something many have in more abundance on warm summer versus cold winter nights.

If you can, find a dark sky location to watch for meteors. Most meteors will fly during predawn hours, though it’s possible to see them any time after 10 p.m. during the peak, according to NASA. Also, the American Meteor Society notes, “the more stars you see, the more meteors will also be visible.”"

The annual Perseid meteor shower should reach its peak in the overnight hours of Sunday, Aug. 11, into early Monday, Aug. 12, according to Space.com. About 50 to 100 meteors can be seen per hour at its peak, with NASA calling it the ""best meteor show of the year.""

Here's what to know about the display:

What are Perseids?

The Perseid meteors are made up of debris from the Swift-Tuttle comet — which has a 16-mile nucleus, nearly twice the size of the object hypothesized to have led to the dinosaur extinction, according to NASA. The Swift-Tuttle comet takes 133 years to orbit the Sun, and it leaves a trail of debris in its wake.

Each year, Earth passes through the trail, allowing the particles to collide with the atmosphere and disintegrate into fiery streaks in the sky, known as ""shooting stars."" Perseids get their name from the constellation Perseus, which is the radiant — the point in the sky from which the meteors appear to come, though it is not the actual source.

How to view the meteor shower

On Sunday, the moon sets just after 11 p.m., leaving the sky darkened for prime meteor viewing until the early light of dawn. The pre-dawn hours are also best for Perseid viewing because it is when our side of the Earth turns to face the oncoming meteors more directly, according to Space.com.

To see the meteor shower, just look up at the darkest part of the sky. Meteors should flash across all parts of the sky, and you'll probably be able to catch one every minute or two. To see more meteors, NASA recommends leaving the city and getting to a dark location away from light pollution. NASA also suggests spreading out a blanket and laying flat on your back to soak up as much of the night sky as possible.

The weather is also important when it comes to meteor watching, because fog or rain can make it harder to see the shooting stars. Thankfully, the current forecast for Sunday shows clear skies and 64 degrees — so you may want to bundle up for a cool summer night if you're heading outside to watch.

Saturday and Monday nights potentially may be equally as good for meteor viewing since Perseids are active for several days before their peak and a day or two afterward, according to Space.com. The Perseids are active from mid-July through early September, so you may catch a stray shooting star here and there throughout the rest of August."
Perseid meteor shower 2024 peaks this weekend.,https://www.sciencealert.com/perseid-meteor-shower-2024-is-about-to-hit-its-peak-heres-how-to-watch,"Great ready for one of the surefire astronomical events of 2024, as the peak for the Perseid meteors arrives next week.

To be sure, the Perseids aren't the most intense annual meteor shower of the year; in the first half of the 20th century, that title now goes to the December Geminids.

What the Perseids do have going for them is timing: they typically arrive in early August, before the academic year starts and during prime camping season, which finds lots of folks out under warm summer skies.

Perseid Prospects for 2024

The Perseids are active across August, from July 14th to September 1st. In 2024, the shower is expected to display a broad peak, centered on the night of August 11-12th.

Typically, we see a twin peak in activity from the shower, though we expect the 2024 peak to arrive around 3:00 Universal Time (UT) on the 12th. This puts the shower high in the sky for northern Europe at dawn. North America isn't far behind.

In 2024, the Moon will interfere somewhat, with a 44 percent illuminated waxing crescent phase setting around 11:30 PM local.

During recent years, the Perseids have displayed a maximum rate of up to 150 per hour, coming off high perihelion rates of 500 per hour in the 1990s. In 2024, expect to see around 100 per hour.

The Perseids: A Backstory

The source of the Perseids is none other than periodic comet 109P Swift-Tuttle.

On a 133 year orbit, the comet reaches perihelion again next century on July 12th, 2126. The approach radiant for the shower hails from the northern constellation of Perseus the Hero (near the star Eta Persei) hence the name.

Though the comet was only discovered in the mid-19th century, knowledge of the shower stretches back to antiquity. The Perseids are known as the ""Tears of Saint Lawrence,"" after the Christian saint who was martyred on a hot grid-iron on August 10th, 258 AD.

In Andalusian southern Spain, this name for the summer Perseids in still well-known.

Observing Meteors

Observing the Perseids is as simple as laying back, aiming your working set of 'Mk-1 eyeballs' at the sky, and waiting. A good alternate method of 'hearing' meteors is to tune an old school radio to an unoccupied section of the FM dial, and listening for meteor 'pings'.

Two key factors come into play for a successful meteor watching expedition: watching at the correct time, under as dark a sky as possible. Don't be afraid to start watching a few evenings prior this coming weekend.

For the US southeast, there's always a good chance that Hurricane Debby could sweep out skies in its wake.

For Northern Hemisphere observers, the radiant rises around 10:00 pm local. It will be high in the sky to the northeast around local midnight. This means that you'll start seeing meteors from the Perseids in the late evening after sunset.

Rates will really pick up after midnight, as you turn forward into the stream. You're seeing ancient streams of cometary dust laid down by Swift-Tuttle, intersecting the 12,750 kilometer-wide tunnel carved out by the Earth. The Perseids have a respectable incoming relative velocity of 59 kilometers per second.

Though it may not seem it, even the largest, most brilliant Perseid meteors are the result of pea-sized grains. These are burning up in the Earth's atmosphere about 80 to 120 kilometers overhead. Keep a pair of binoculars handy, to examine any lingering persistent smoke trains.

'Hearing' Meteors

Also, keep an ear out for any hissing audible meteors. This bizarre phenomenon was long thought to be a myth, or at most, a psychological phenomenon.

There's now good evidence that meteors do transmit a corresponding radio emission that can be 'heard' near the observer. This effect is known as electrophonic sound. Powerful auroras are thought to produce a similar effect.

Imaging the Perseids or any meteor shower is as simple as aiming a tripod mounted DSLR camera at a section of the sky and taking long exposure shots. Use as wide a field of view aperture lens as you can. Then, take a series of test shots to get the ISO/f-stop/exposure time correct for current conditions.

An intervalometer is an invaluable tool for this, as you can simply program it to take a series of exposures, then turn it loose while you sit back and enjoy the show.

Finally, don't forget to report what you see. When it comes to meteor showers, astronomers need all the data they can get. Simply count how many meteors you see in a given span of time, and report it to the International Meteor Organization (IMO).

Don't miss a chance to get out under warm summer skies this coming week, and catch the 2024 Perseid meteors.

Perseid meteor shower 2024 peaks this weekend.,https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/perseids-2024,"The Perseids, one of 2024's most stunning meteor showers, is now in full swing – you may have already been lucky enough to catch a glimpse of the fast, bright shooting stars as they skim across the night sky.

And it’s only going to get better. As we approach the middle of August, things are hotting up. During the shower's peak, you can expect to see – conditions permitting – as many as 100 meteors per hour. Some of them may also be fireballs.

Unlike other meteor showers this year, Moonlight is unlikely to drown out the spectacle. True, a waxing Moon will be in the sky as we approach the peak, but fortunate timing means it will have sunk below the horizon when meteor activity starts to pick up.

For a roundup of all the year’s meteor showers, take a look at our meteor shower calendar. If you’d like to get into astrophotography but don’t know where to start, expert Pete Lawrence has put together a beginner’s guide on how to take great pictures of the Moon.

When is the Perseid meteor shower 2024?

undefined

The Perseid meteor shower began on 17 July 2024 and will continue until around 24 August. The best time to see meteors is between midnight and sunset.

The meteor shower peaks on 12 August. It’s around this time that we can expect to see more meteors. As the peak falls during the day, the best time to watch the Perseids will be on either side of the peak, on the nights of 11/12 August and 12/13 August.

A watch between midnight and before the sky begins to lighten (around 5:30am in the UK, 6am in New York and Los Angeles), will yield the best results.

How many meteors can we see?

The Perseids is one of the most active meteor showers of the year, but that doesn’t mean we can expect to see a constant stream of meteors. Most of the photographs you see (like the below) are long-exposure pictures, which capture dozens, sometimes hundreds, of meteors in one shot.

Theoretically, under dark skies and perfect conditions, we’d be looking at around 100 meteors per hour. Realistically, however, we can expect to see far fewer than this, perhaps a few dozen per hour. That being said, the Perseids is still one of the best showers of the year.

Where to look in the sky

The absolute best direction to look to see the Perseids, is straight up. You want to take in as much of the sky as you can in your vision. This is because meteors can streak across the whole sky; they’re not confined to one location.

But it’s nice to know where the radiant is. If anything, it helps to distinguish Perseids from the sporadic meteors (more on that below) which can also be seen. (The radiant for a meteor shower where meteors appear to originate from.)

For the Perseids, the radiant is in the constellation of Perseus, hence the name ‘Perseid'.

In the small hours of the morning, look towards the northeast to see Perseus lingering just above the bright planet Jupiter. Taurus the Bull is situated just to the right of Jupiter, and you might also be able to spot Mars very close to Jupiter*.

The Sun rises in the east so, face this direction and turn slightly towards the left to find northeast. But don’t worry if you can’t orient yourself, as the meteors can appear across the whole sky.

Perseus is situated between the distinctive ‘W’ of the constellation Cassiopeia, and the Pleiades. If you're struggling with finding the radiant, an astronomy app can help (check our best astronomy apps).

* The closest Mars-Jupiter conjunction will happen on 14 August 2024. It's the closest the two planets will be until 2033 and will make for a brilliant sight, should the Perseids prove elusive.

What causes the Perseid meteor shower?

Meteor showers are created when a parent body (a comet or sometimes an asteroid) leaves a trail of debris behind as it orbits the Sun. When Earth subsequently intersects that debris stream, the particles interact with our atmosphere. This produces the lingering streaks of light we see as shooting stars.

Established meteor showers – such as the Perseids – are predictable. They generally occur at the same time every year, and the peak occurs when Earth’s orbit intersects with the densest part of this stream:

“As Earth passes through the debris stream, particle density increases to a maximum and then falls off again, typically over several weeks – but it can be over days. The shower meteors reach peak rate during the maximum density period,” astronomer and BBC Sky at Night presenter Pete Lawrence explains.

For the Perseids, this parent body is the Comet Swift-Tuttle, a large snowball-type comet made of dust, ice and rock. The nucleus is 26km in diameter (around 16 miles) and takes 133 years to complete one orbit of the Sun.

As this is less than the 200-year cut-off point, that makes it a short-period comet. This is indicated by the ‘P’ in its official designation 109P/Swift-Tuttle.

The comet was last in our neighbourhood in 1992 and will make its return in 2125 or 2126. Unfortunately, it was too faint to see with the naked eye in 1992, but should put on more of a display when it returns a little over 100 years from now.

Will the Moon interfere?

This year we have a potentially interfering half-Moon during the two nights on either side of peak on 11/12 August. As we approach the full Moon on 19 August, illumination is gradually increasing.

So, if you opt for an evening viewing session, you’ll have moonlight to contend with. The Moon is at 51 per cent illumination on 12 August, and 61 per cent illumination on 13 August.

But the good news is that by the time Perseid activity starts to ramp up after midnight (on both nights), the Moon will have set. So, it won’t cause a problem if you opt for a morning viewing session.

It’s best to view the Perseids in the small hours before sunrise, between midnight and 5:30am in the UK and 6am in the US. Not only will the Moon be below the horizon, but the meteor rates will be higher – so you’ll have a better chance of spotting more meteors.

Top tips to maximise your chances of spotting some meteors

You don’t need a telescope, or even binoculars to watch the Perseid meteor shower. It’s actually better to just use your eyes as you’ll be able to take in more of the sky than if you were looking through an eyepiece.

“A dark sky with no Moon gives the best view. Allow at least 20 minutes in complete darkness to become fully dark adapted,” says Lawrence. “A sun-lounger makes a great observing platform for meteors.”

“Aim to watch the skies in blocks at least 30 minutes long, longer if you can. The rest is down to luck, but spotting a bright summer meteor streaking across the sky is something that will really stay with you for a long time,” he adds.

Here are some of our top tips to get the most out of your meteor-watch session:

Avoid bright lights. Try to avoid areas with artificial bright lights, and keep streetlights out of your direct line of sight.

Try to avoid areas with artificial bright lights, and keep streetlights out of your direct line of sight. Let your eyes adjust. Sit outside for around 20 minutes so that your eyes adapt to the darkness.

If you can't get up early, you may still be able to catch a few meteors in the evening. As the Moon will be around 50 to 60 per cent illuminated when the shower peaks on 11/12 and 12/13 August, try to find a spot where the Moon is obscured. Use your surroundings to your advantage – look for a location where buildings or foliage block out the Moon's interfering light.

Within the cometary debris that causes the Perseid meteor shower, are larger particles. These create bright explosions of light that persist for longer than your average meteor.

How do I know whether it’s a Perseid meteor?

There are other meteors you can spot at the moment – and these are sporadic meteors.

Often shortened to just ‘sporadics’, they appear to streak from any point in the sky and are not associated with any particular shower. (Although occasionally they can be from an undiscovered shower.)

As Lawrence explains: “Meteors come in two basic varieties: sporadic or random meteors, and shower meteors. Sporadic meteors occur when a small piece of rock, typically no larger than a grain of sand, happens to encounter Earth’s atmosphere, vaporises and produces the bright streak of light called a meteor trail. These can happen at any time, anywhere in the sky and from any direction.”

There’s a nifty way to tell sporadics apart from the Perseids, and it’s all down to where they appear to come from in the sky. Meteors from showers will generally appear to come from the associated radiant for that shower. Whereas sporadics are more random and can shoot across the sky from any direction, at any time.

“Shower meteors are different [to sporadics] and result from a stream of typically sand grain-sized particles in solar orbit encountering the Earth’s atmosphere. The particles are associated with comets or in some cases asteroids, which over time release debris which spreads around their orbits,” Lawrence explains.

“Travelling in parallel orbits around the Sun, when they enter our atmosphere perspective makes them look as if they are coming from the same area of sky, known as the shower radiant.”

So, by knowing where the radiant is for a particular shower, for example, the constellation Perseus for the Perseid meteor shower, you can take an educated guess as to whether the meteors you’re seeing are shower meteors or sporadics.

Some years clouds and even showers would prevent us from seeing the meteors, but most years the show was worth the effort. Hearing the “Oohs” and “Aaahs” from across the darkness as a meteor streaked across the sky and kids echoing “Did you see it?” or “Where was it?” is part of my summer memory.

My summer job during college was working at an overnight camp in Bridgton, Maine and one of the favorite activities of every August was to take the kids out for some stargazing, specifically viewing the Perseid meteor shower.

Beach days, bike rides and baseball games are all part of the magic of summer, but these summer nights bring something equally special. The sound of crickets and cicadas and even the occasional owl provide a noisy backdrop to the warmth and humidity that is a July and August evening.

Back then, even the occasional satellite would be mixed into the backdrop of the Big Dipper and perhaps a setting crescent Moon. Years later I have still had former campers mention the enjoyment they remember on those warm summer nights. The point here is that the Perseid meteor shower is an annual memory-making phenomena that should be viewed and shared whenever possible.

When will the Perseids peak?

This year the Perseids will peak in the early morning hours of Sunday, Aug. 11 and again on Monday, Aug. 12 and perhaps extending into Tuesday morning. The Perseid meteor shower ramps up to a peak later this weekend and then quickly falls off. On a good year there can be up to 100 meteors crossing the sky and the darker the backdrop the better chance you have of seeing more of them. Even in the light of the city the brightest meteors can provide a brief showstopper.

The Perseid meteor shower is forecast to peak on the mornings of Sunday, Aug. 11 and Monday, Aug. 12. There are still five more meteor showers this year, but the Perseids are one of the best. TimeandDate.com

The Perseids themselves are the debris from the comet Swift-Tuttle and actually started showing up in our night sky back in July. They continue through the rest of the month, slowing rapidly after that peak coming up this weekend.

Best viewing times

The Perseids are best viewed in the early morning, pre-dawn hours but can be observed as early as 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. if you don’t want to stay up too late or get up super early. There is nothing magical about how to view them. Just find a dark spot, let your eyes adjust and look up. A blanket or comfortable chair makes it easier so your neck doesn’t become stiff while viewing.

Moonlight can be an issue, but this year the moon will set around midnight leaving the second half of the night dark and ideal for viewing conditions.

The moon is just about 50% full this weekend before setting around midnight, leaving dark skies for stargazing. TimeandDate.com

Of course, cloud cover negates any of this. This year, we are watching the remnants of Debby, which will bring a few showers Friday perhaps lingering into Saturday. The good news is that the clouds should clear for the early-morning hours of Sunday and continue into Monday.

Clouds are forecast to depart in the early morning hours of Sunday this weekend, leaving some good viewing for the Perseid meteor shower. TropicalTidbits

There are actually two other active meteor showers occurring right now, according to the American Meteor Society. They are the Southern Delta Aquariids and the Alpha Capricornids. The first of these is best seen in the Southern Hemisphere, but we can get a couple of meteors in the southern part of the sky. The Alpha Capricornids peaked back in July but again they still can provide a couple of added meteors in the night sky.

As summer wanes, the Perseid meteor shower will dazzle sky watchers this weekend, Space.com reports.

The meteor shower, known for its spectacular displays, will reach its peak from late Sunday night into early Monday morning. This year’s event promises optimal viewing conditions, with minimal moonlight to obscure the show.

The first quarter moon is set to set around 11:20 p.m. local daylight time, creating a dark sky ideal for observing the meteor shower.

What to Expect

Observers can expect the best meteor activity from around 11 p.m. until dawn, with the pre-dawn hours offering the highest visibility. As Earth rotates, it aligns more directly with the meteor stream, increasing the number of visible meteors.

For those planning to capture the event on camera, guidance is available on photographing meteors and selecting the best equipment for astrophotography.

Sky watchers should find a spot with a clear, dark view of the sky. The shower’s radiant point, located between the Perseus constellation and Cassiopeia’s ‘W,’ will rise higher in the northeast, allowing meteors to streak across all parts of the sky at a rate of about one every minute or two. Even in areas with moderate light pollution, the brightest Perseids will be visible and often leave persistent trails.

The peak of the Perseid shower is forecasted for 1 p.m. PDT on Monday, but the meteors will continue to be visible at reduced rates for several days before and after the peak. Occasionally, meteors may appear throughout August.

Past events have shown surprises, such as the unexpected outburst on Aug. 14, 2021, which saw meteor rates up to twice the normal. With favorable conditions this year, sky watchers are advised to take advantage of the clear skies before next year’s bright moon diminishes visibility.

The Perseid meteor shower is considered one of the best, both because of the time of year — warm weather, less cloud-cover — and the fact that onlookers can see roughly 100 meteors an hour at its peak, but only under perfect, dark skies.

This year, the peak occurs on the night of Aug. 11-12.

We get these showers as Earth plows through material left over from comets or asteroids that orbit the sun. As we pass through these trails, the small particles of dust and rocks burn up through our atmosphere, producing beautiful, yet fleeting, streaks in the sky. In this case, comet 109/P Swift-Tuttle.

Try this interactive map showing how Earth passes through the meteor shower:

Some years the moon interferes with all but the brightest meteors, but not this year. The moon will only be a quarter full and will set after 1 a.m. local time.

""The moon is good this year. That's a big help,"" said Peter Brown, Canada Research Chair in meteor astronomy and a professor at Western University in London, Ont.

""And there is some discussion that just after the peak, there might be some old trails that might drive up rates a little bit.""

Brown said that could occur on the night of Aug. 12-13.

How and when to look

While the peak occurs on the weekend, you can still keep an eye out in the days ahead and after.

As with any nighttime celestial event, the best thing to do to get the most out of it, is to get to a dark-sky site. If you can't get out of the city, try going to a park or a location with low light pollution. And remember to have patience and to always keep looking up.

The Perseids are named — as with all but one meteor shower — for the location from which the meteors appear to be appearing from (imagine drawing a line from each meteor you see back towards where it started), called the radiant. And in this case, the constellation is Perseus, which rises in the east around 10 p.m. local time.

But you don't have to necessarily look in that location, as the meteors will appear all around the sky.

Fortunately, the Perseids tend to be quite bright and often produce fireballs, which is yet another reason the shower is considered one of the best of the year.

An added bonus for stargazers this year, is that the sun has been quite active of late, creating beautiful displays of the northern lights, so there's a possibility viewers will get two shows for the price of one."

The Perseid meteor shower, which will peak at midnight Sunday into Monday morning, is expected to produce between 50 and 75 shooting stars per hour.

But the US space agency warned that if you live in an urban area, light pollution could seriously dim the cosmic show.

Skygazers should head outside between 12am and 5:30am to see the meteors, which will appear in the northeastern sky.

This peak period occurs when there is almost no moon and the sky is especially dark, providing the perfect backdrop for dozens of shooting stars.

The Perseid meteor shower will peak this weekend between Sunday, August 11 and Monday, August 12

'Try to get to the darkest location you can. The darker it is where you are, the more meteors you will see streaking across the sky,' NASA wrote in a press release.

The Perseid meteor shower began on July 14 and is set to run until September 1, but the best viewing is this weekend.

The event happens every year when Earth plows through debris left behind by the Swift-Tuttle comet during its trips through the inner solar system.

As it shoots through the sky at a maximum speed of 26.5 miles per second, the comet leaves behind a trail of dust and debris.

Earth's orbit crosses paths with Swift-Tuttle's orbit, causing the comet's dust and debris to burn up in our atmosphere and create the Perseid meteor shower.

NASA has nicknamed it the 'fireball champion' of annual meteor showers for its record-breaking number of super bright meteors.

It's a show you won't want to miss. Luckily, NASA has expert advice for anyone hoping to spot the Perseids this weekend.

First and foremost, you'll want to find a place outside of the city with very little light pollution and an unobstructed view of the sky.

To locate the meteor shower, viewers should look for the Perseus constellation which is the 24th largest constellation in the sky.

The constellation is located in the northern region on the night sky.

Try looking for an International Dark Sky Park near you or consulting a light pollution map to find the best spot.

Check the local weather forecast before you go to make sure that clouds or rain won't obstruct your view, and make sure to pack warm clothes, bug spray, and anything else you might need to stay comfortable.

Comet emit trails of dust and debris as they streak through the sky. The debris trail of the Swift Tuttle comet is what causes the Perseid meteor shower.

Shooting stars from the Perseid meteor shower.

Once you get to your dark sky location, you'll need to know when and where to look up at the stars.

The meteors will be brightest when the night sky is darkest - which is during the pre-dawn hours after the moon sets and before the sun rises.

No matter where you are in North America, the moon will set at around midnight.

To spot the Perseids, you can look anywhere in the night sky. They'll appear to come from the Northeast where the constellation Perseus (their namesake) will rise after dark.

While you're watching, try not to look at your phone or any other source of white light. Doing so will disrupt your night vision and make it difficult to see the meteors.

You also shouldn't use a telescope or binoculars to look for the Perseids. These magnifying instruments will actually make it much harder to see shooting stars.

If you miss the meteor shower's peak, don't worry. The Perseids will still be visible through the end of August.

But if you can get out to see them this weekend, you'll be in for a spectacular show."

The Perseids, discovered first in 1862, resulted from ice and rock debris left behind by Comet Swift-Tuttle. In 2024, the Perseid meteor shower will be active between July 17 and August 24, with the number of meteors increasing every night until it peaks in mid-August, after which it will tail off.

The radiant of the Perseid Meteor Shower, from which the Perseids appear to come, is the constellation Perseus. The average speed for the meteor is 36 miles per second. The smaller meteors vaporise in Earth's atmosphere and leave behind a bright trail of light, while the larger ones can even explode as fireballs. These sand-sized Perseids are around 1,650 degrees Celsius hot and chart a colourful, streaking, vivid path across the sky as they travel past Earth.

When Is the Best Time To Watch the Perseids Meteor Shower?

The 2024 Perseid Meteor Shower is predicted to peak around the midnights of August 11 and August 12, at 02:00 PM Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and in India, from around 7:30 PM August 12, Indian Standard Time (IST). With the moon 50% illuminated then, the night skies will be ideal for meteor watching until dawn. The best time to catch the Perseids is pre-dawn in the northern skies of the Northern Hemisphere. From the Southern Hemisphere, it is visible in the north-eastern skies. As per NASA, the Perseid shower peaks at an average of 100 meteors per hour.

Where and How To Watch the Perseid Meteor Shower?

The Perseid Meteor Shower is best visible in the skies of the US, but some good places to catch the shower in India are Jaisalmer in Rajasthan, Spiti Valley in Himachal Pradesh, and the Marina Beach in Chennai. These showers are also visible from any other similarly open, dark and dust-free place so as to get the best view of clear skies.

The Perseid meteor shower, which peaks in mid-August, is considered one of the best meteor showers of the year. According to NASA, a potential Perseid Meteor Storm in 2028 is slated to occur, which will be bigger, brighter and longer than the yearly Perseid Meteor Shower. After the Perseids, the next meteor shower to look out for is the Draconids Meteor Shower from the Comet Giacobini-Zimmer between October 8 and October 10.

August is a treat for stargazers with celestial events, including the first supermoon of 2024 and the renowned Perseid meteor shower. Starting August 11, a spectacular display of shooting stars will light up the night sky across the United States. Next weekend, the Perseids will reach its peak, offering an incredible display of up to 75 ""shooting stars"" per hour.This celestial event will occur on the night of Sunday, August 11, and early Monday, August 12.Here's everything you need to know about this highly anticipated event:The Perseid meteor shower, a highlight of the summer sky, is visible annually from mid-July to late August. Although bright meteors are expected, the visibility of the Perseids can be impacted by moonlight. This year, however, the moon is expected to set just as the Perseids' activity intensifies. According to the American Meteor Society, the optimal viewing time will be after 1 a.m. local time on Monday, August 12.While the peak offers the highest number of meteors, the Perseid shower is active from July 14 to September 1, 2024. During this period, ""shooting stars"" can be seen on any clear night. The optimal viewing time for the Perseids will be from around midnight, when the moon sets, until dawn. EarthSky suggests that the shower gradually builds to its peak and then declines rapidly, with the best visibility occurring just before dawn. While the meteors will continue to be visible into early September, August 12 offers the most spectacular viewing experience as Earth passes through the densest debris field from the Swift-Tuttle comet.The Perseids are known for their rapid and bright meteors, and they appear to radiate from the constellation Perseus, which gives the shower its name. After midnight, Perseus will be high in the northwestern sky in the Northern Hemisphere, offering the best view of the meteor shower. Alongside Perseus, observers can also spot the Andromeda Galaxy and the Pleiades star cluster in the same region of the sky.For the best experience, find the darkest location possible and spend at least an hour observing the sky after midnight. Allow your eyes about 30 minutes to adjust to the darkness, as meteors can appear in bursts with intermittent lulls.Expect to see between 50 and 100 meteors per hour, with colourful streaks and sometimes persistent trails. The Perseid meteor shower is known for its vibrant display and is a favourite among sky watchers. While the meteors can be enjoyed with the naked eye, capturing clear and detailed images is best achieved with high-quality cameras and tripods.The visibility of the Perseids is heavily influenced by the moon’s phases. Fortunately, on August 12, a half-lit moon will set about an hour after midnight, reducing the likelihood of moonlight interference. To maximise your viewing experience, find a dark, clear sky away from artificial light."

ILLINOIS — If the weather cooperates in Illinois, 2024 could be a stellar year to take in the annual Perseid meteor shower, which peaks Sunday through Tuesday, Aug. 11-13.

The National Weather Service forecast for the peak dates calls for highs of 79 and 80 degrees in Illinois. Chances of rain will be slim, with a 3 percent possibility on Aug. 11, 8 percent on Aug. 12 and 11 percent Aug. 13. Under dark skies, it’s possible to see between 50 and 100 meteors an hour, with a good possibility for fireballs. The moon will be about 50 percent full, but will set before midnight, just in time for prime meteor shower viewing. As with most shooting star shows, the best time to see the Perseids is during the hours between midnight and dawn,

Surprises are always possible, but meteor experts don’t expect 2024 to be an outburst year. Skywatchers who are into serious advance planning should mark the August peak for the 2028 Perseids on their calendars. The shower four years from now could be especially intense due to a meteor storm that could produce 1,000 or more meteors an hour. Until then, sit back and enjoy the last of the summer meteor showers. When it comes to brilliance, only the Geminid meteor shower in December rivals the Perseids. Both are known for swift, bright meteors that frequently leave behind long “wakes” of light and color, according to NASA.

Both are also known for fireballs, larger explosions of light and color that are brighter than typical meteors and whose “tails” last longer than typical meteor streaks. That’s because, NASA explains, fireballs come from larger particles of cometary material. Related: 2024 Guide To Meteor Showers, Supermoons And More The big difference between the shooting star shows from the skywatcher’s vantage point is the difference between summer and winter. Regardless of the meteor shower, stargazers are rewarded by their patience, something many have in more abundance on warm summer versus cold winter nights.

If you can, find a dark sky location to watch for meteors. Most meteors will fly during predawn hours, though it’s possible to see them any time after 10 p.m. during the peak, according to NASA. Also, the American Meteor Society notes, “the more stars you see, the more meteors will also be visible.”"

“The entire shower lasts from July 14 to Sept. 1 with the peak period being the night of Aug. 12 (Tuesday) into the morning of Aug. 13 (Wednesday),” said astronomy educator Gary Boyle, in a recent press release. “The night before and the night after should still result in a spectacular cosmic show.”

Assuming Mother Nature co-operates with clear skies, viewers will want to wait until near or after midnight and that’s because “the first quarter moon will set on Aug. 12 around 11:30 p.m. local time and midnight on Aug. 13.

“With the lunar glow gone, conditions will be ideal to see the estimated 90 meteors per hour including a few bright fireballs.”

It’s also best to view them “away from the glow of city lights,” he added.

“Enjoy these sand-sized particles of Comet Swift-Tuttle as they safely vaporize in the atmosphere at about 72 kilometres per second,” he said.

According to a NASA primer, “the Perseid meteor shower, which peaks in mid-August, is considered the best meteor shower of the year.”

With “swift and bright meteors,” the Perseid meteor shower frequently leaves “long ‘wakes’ of light and colour behind them as they streak through Earth's atmosphere.” The Perseids, added the NASA primer, “are one of the most plentiful showers with about 50 to 100 meteors seen per hour.”

As a bonus their summer timing allows “sky watchers to comfortably view them.”

They are also known for their fireballs, which NASA explained “are larger explosions of light and colour that can persist longer than an average meteor streak.”

“This is due to the fact that fireballs originate from larger particles of cometary material.”

The meteor shower, explained the NASA primer, is the debris left behind by the comet's regular sojourn around the sun.

“When comets come around the sun, the dust they emit gradually spreads into a dusty trail around their orbits. Every year the Earth passes through these debris trails, which allows the bits to collide with our atmosphere where they disintegrate to create fiery and colourful streaks in the sky,” explained the NASA primer.

Swift-Tuttle is a large comet. Its nucleus, explained another NASA primer on the comet, is “26 kilometres across (which) is more than twice the size of the object hypothesized to have led the demise of the dinosaurs.”

A space.com article also explains how the comet sometimes comes pretty close to the earth — pegged to come within a million miles to Earth in 3044.

The comet takes 133 years to complete its annual elongated orbit which stretches past Pluto to just inside Earth’s orbit.

It last reached its closest approach to the sun in 1992, and the next visit is in 2125.

“Comet Swift-Tuttle was discovered in 1862 independently by both Lewis Swift and Horace Tuttle,” according to the NASA primer, adding that “it was Giovanni Schiaparelli who realized in 1865 that this comet was the source of the Perseids.”

The meteor shower is named after the constellation Perseus as that’s “the point in the sky from which the Perseids appear to come,” explained the NASA article, adding that “the constellation is not the source of the meteors … It only serves to aid viewers in determining which shower they are viewing on a given night.”

ALSO ON THE VIEWING AGENDA

While you're watching the Perseid meteor shower, Boyle suggests some planetary viewing as well. Saturn, he said, will rise after 9 p.m. followed by Mars and Jupiter after 1 a.m., both of which will be closest together (conjunction) on the morning of Aug. 14 with a separation less than the width of the full moon.

Meteors are made from leftover comet particles and broken asteroids. When comets orbit the sun, they leave a trail of debris behind them. Every year the Earth turns, passing through this cosmic wasteland, allowing the bits and pieces to collide with our atmosphere, creating fiery and colorful streaks in the sky as they disintegrate.

NASA explains:

“The pieces of space debris that interact with our atmosphere to create the Perseids originate from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle. Swift-Tuttle takes 133 years to orbit the Sun once. It was Giovanni Schiaparelli who realized in 1865 that this comet was the source of the Perseids. Comet Swift-Tuttle last visited the inner solar system in 1992.”

The comet was discovered in 1862 by Lewis Swift and Horace Tuttle. It’s a large comet, with a nucleus of 16 miles across.

“This is almost twice the size of the object hypothesized to have led to the demise of the dinosaurs,” says NASA.

The best meteor shower of the year peaks this month in Ontario and across North America.

The annual Perseid meteor shower is active between July 17 and Aug. 24 but peaks in mid-August, and it is considered the best meteor shower of the year, NASA says on its website.

“The Perseids are one of the most plentiful showers with about 50 to 100 meteors seen per hour,” NASA says.

Perseids frequently leave long “wakes” of light and colour behind them as they streak and are also known to have fireballs. Fireballs are larger explosions of light and colour that can persist longer than an average meteor streak, NASA says.

The 2024 Perseid meteor shower peaks the night of Sunday, Aug. 11 and before the dawn of Aug. 12, Space.com says on its website.

The weather conditions are expected to be cloudy in the GTA and much of southern Ontario on Sunday but clear on Monday. The best place to observe this space phenomena is a dark sky location, away from city nights.

Torrance Barrens near Gravenhurst is an ideal location but Environment and Climate Change Canada is forecasting cloudy and rainy conditions in the area on Sunday.

The best time to look for meteors is in the pre-dawn hours, Space.com says.

If there are clear skies, another bonus is the moon will be out of the picture in the early morning hours.

“This year, the moon will set around midnight, providing dark skies until dawn, which is ideal for meteor watching,” Space.com says.

Where to look

In the post-midnight hours, the radiant point of the shower (the point where it appears) lies between the constellation Perseus and the ‘W’ of Cassiopeia and rises gradually to the northeast – so meteors should shine in all directions. in the sky (as seen by an observer) at a rate of every minute or two.

Anyway, that’s the forecast if your sky is nice and dark. But even if you live under moderate light pollution, as most of us unfortunately do, you can at least catch the bright ones in the Perseids. They are often described in astronomical journals as “numerous bright and fragmentary meteors” that leave continuous trains behind.

Earth must pass through its thickest part “Old Faith” The meteor shower lasted for several hours centered around 1400 UTC on August 12, which is 10 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time on that date, which is daylight saving time across North America. So, for meteor watchers here, the night before and maybe the night after will be equally good. Fortunately, the Perseids are active – about a quarter of their peak strength – for several days before and for a day or two after peaking, and occasionally one can be seen anytime in August.

A Perseid is seen on a retrograde path across the sky, cutting a space between the constellations Perseus and Cassiopeia. Other “sporadic” meteors that travel in random directions occur every 5 or 10 minutes. Delta Aquarites and Gappa Cygnites are two weaker showers active at this time of year.

Lie down, relax, and wait

You don’t need any experience to watch Perseids. Find a spot with a wide-open sky view and no night lights nearby. Bundle up warm (sometimes it gets chilly even on summer nights), lay down on a pad or sleeping bag on the floor, or better yet, in a reclining lawn chair, and watch the stars. Also cover exposed parts of your body with mosquito repellent so you don’t get bitten.

Be patient and give enough time for your eyes to darken. The direction to look isn’t necessarily towards Perseus, but can be straight where your sky is darkest.

The Perseids are ionization trails created by small fragments from Comet 109/P Swift-Tut, which travel through Earth’s upper atmosphere at 37 miles (60 km) per second. Perseids were particularly dramatic in the early to mid-1990s around the most recent Swift-Tuttle return year (in December 1992). But, since then they have returned to normal. The comet will not return until August 2126.

Shocking events

But surprises can always happen.

On the morning of August 14, 2021, between 06:00 and 09:00 UT (2 a.m. to 5 a.m. EDT), Perseids displayed an unexpected meteor shower. The cause of this burst is currently unknown, but it may have been the result of an unknown strand of cometary debris when Swift-Tuttle raced through the inner solar system centuries ago.

In a notification on Central Bureau of Astronomical Telegraphs Circular #5016 The maximum peak hour rate is estimated to be between 130 and 210, plus or minus 20. Rates are typically 50% lower after each previous night’s high, but these rates Two or three times The night of August 12-13, 2021 saw higher than expected maximum levels.

Four more years Some meteorologists predict that Earth will interact with a thick knot or collection of meteors shed by comet Swift-Tuttle in the 15th century, bringing a truly spectacular Perseid display. Several hundred meteors per hour.

Defying predictions

Sometimes, even in years when Perseid sightings are considered favorable, skywatchers report seeing only half or a third of the predicted number of meteors—and some report twice as many! It has been suggested that the stream of Perseid particles, stretching along its orbit around the Sun, has a complex filamentary structure with gaps and rich spots.

Complicating the situation is that some people’s eyes seem better suited to meteor work than others.

Regardless of your local viewing conditions, the appearance of the Perseids each year gives many people a reason to get outside and look up at the night sky. Even if you only see a few “shooting stars,” seeing one super bright meteor is all it takes to make the viewing experience worthwhile.

A final boost is that next year’s moon will be in its waning gibbous phase a few days later, filling the sky with light that will outshine all but the bright Perseid streaks. So, take advantage of the favorable circumstances that have been given to us this year.

Good luck and clear skies to all!"

The biggest and best meteor shower of the year is almost upon us, and NASA is starting to answer questions about how to see as many „shooting stars” as possible. Its main advice? Leave the city and discover dark rural skies.

Perseid M Wheneteor rain: dates

The Perseid meteor shower will run from July 14 to September 1, 2024, but will peak on the night of Sunday, August 11 through Monday, August 12. While you may have already seen a few Perseids, this is the peak night you should be. ready As stated therein American Meteorological SocietyPeak on August 12 at 04:00 UTC (midnight EDT on August 12).

Persid MEdior Shower: When to See

The seasons are perfect this year. „This year’s Perseids will be slightly affected by the 53% waxing moon, but the Moon will set right when the Perseids begin to wax,” says a blog post. Published By NASA. The moon, though half-illuminated and remarkably bright, will set around midnight wherever you are in North America, making the best advice relatively simple – look after moonset (or around it) until dawn.

Take plenty of breaks — no one can stare at the night sky for more than 30 minutes — but avoid looking at your cell phone or any other white light that can ruin your night vision. Red light is much less harmful.

“Get out of town! Try to go as dark as you can. „The darker your location, the more meteors you’ll see in the sky,” says NASA.

A location with a clear, unobstructed view of the night sky is essential, but what you need more than anything else is a clear, dark sky. The best idea is to get away from urban light pollution as much as possible, which can be done through a consultation.

Which direction to look to see Perseids?

You can see it anywhere in the night sky. The Perseids appear to come from the northeast — where its radiant constellation, Perseus (hence their name), rises after dark — but that’s not very important. This means that if you follow the path the „Shooting Star” came from, it will look like it came from Perseus.

It is very important not to use binoculars or binoculars as this will significantly reduce your chances of seeing „shooting stars”.

Perseid Meteor Shower: How Many 'Shooting Stars’?

It differs. „There may only be a few dozen per hour, but some rare years bring a brief 'explosion’ of two hundred beautiful 'shooting stars’ per hour,” says NASA. The „advanced hourly rates” you read say up to 150 are visible, but that number indicates that you can see a clear, dark sky at the same time, if you can see the horizon. Horizon, just in time.

In practice, expect to get about 50 „shooting stars” per hour. That would be a wonderful result.

The Perseids and the Northern Lights?

Will you watch both in the same night? This is possible because solar activity is currently at a 23-year high, with a strong display of the Northern Lights as far south as Central California last weekend and two strong solar flares.

Perseid meteor shower 2024 peaks this weekend.,https://tdpelmedia.com/nasa-urges-americans-to-escape-urban-light-pollution-and-head-to-darker-skies-for-the-spectacular-perseid-meteor-shower-peaking-this-weekend/,"Hey there! Exciting news for stargazers: the most spectacular meteor shower of 2024 is about to light up the night sky.

However, if you’re planning to catch the show, NASA has some tips to help you make the most of it.

The Perseid meteor shower is set to peak from midnight Sunday into Monday morning.

During this peak, you can expect to see between 50 and 75 meteors per hour. For the best experience, it’s recommended to head outside between 12 AM and 5:30 AM, when the meteors will be most visible in the northeastern sky.

NASA warns that city lights could spoil the view.

To enjoy the full display, try to escape the urban light pollution.

The darker your surroundings, the more meteors you’ll be able to see. Find a dark spot away from city lights, ideally in a place with minimal light pollution for the best experience.

The shower will be at its best during the darkest hours of the night when the moon is nearly absent.

This lack of moonlight creates the perfect canvas for observing shooting stars. If you’re looking to enhance your viewing, seek out a location with a clear, unobstructed view of the sky.

The Perseids are named after the Perseus constellation, which is located in the northern part of the sky. You’ll want to find this constellation as a reference point for where the meteors will appear to originate.

For the best spots, consider visiting an International Dark Sky Park or consult a light pollution map.

Prepare for the Night

Before heading out, check the weather forecast to ensure a clear night. Dress warmly, and don’t forget essentials like bug spray. Comfort is key for an enjoyable experience.

Viewing Tips

Once you’re at your dark sky location, avoid using your phone or other sources of white light, as they can ruin your night vision. Also, skip the telescope or binoculars—these tools aren’t helpful for meteor watching and can make the meteors harder to spot.

Enjoy the Show

Even if you miss the peak, don’t stress.

The Perseid shower will continue to be visible until the end of August. But if you catch it this weekend, you’re in for an extraordinary celestial display. Enjoy the show and happy stargazing!

New research suggests ancestors of an early human species nicknamed “hobbits” were even shorter.

Twenty years ago on an Indonesian island, scientists discovered fossils of an early human species that stood at about 3 1/2 feet tall — earning them the nickname “hobbits.”

Now a new study suggests ancestors of the hobbits were even slightly shorter.

“We did not expect that we would find smaller individuals from such an old site,” study co-author Yousuke Kaifu of the University of Tokyo said in an email.

The original hobbit fossils — named by the discoverers after characters in “The Lord of the Rings” — date back to between 60,000 and 100,000 years ago. The new fossils were excavated at a site called Mata Menge, about 45 miles from the cave where the first hobbit remains were uncovered.

In 2016, researchers suspected the earlier relatives could be shorter than the hobbits after studying a jawbone and teeth collected from the new site. Further analysis of a tiny arm bone fragment and teeth suggests the ancestors were 2.4 inches shorter and existed 700,000 years ago.

“They’ve convincingly shown that these were very small individuals,” said Dean Falk, an evolutionary anthropologist at Florida State University who was not involved with the research.

The findings were published this week in the journal Nature Communications.

Researchers have debated how the hobbits — named Homo floresiensis after the remote Indonesian island of Flores — evolved to be so small and where they fall in the human evolutionary story. They’re thought to be among the last early human species to go extinct.

Scientists don’t yet know whether the hobbits shrank from an earlier, taller human species called Homo erectus that lived in the area, or from an even more primitive human predecessor. More research — and fossils — are needed to pin down the hobbits’ place in human evolution, said Matt Tocheri, an anthropologist at Canada’s Lakehead University.

“This question remains unanswered and will continue to be a focus of research for some time to come,” Tocheri, who was not involved with the research, said in an email.

Fossils suggest even smaller ‘hobbits’ roamed an Indonesian island.,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/fossils-suggest-early-human-hobbits-ancestors-even-smaller-rcna165493,"Fossils remains suggest an early human species nicknamed “hobbits” had ancestors who were even shorter, according to a study published Tuesday in the journal Nature.

The extinct Homo floresiensis were named after the Indonesian island of Flores where they roamed, though scientists also refer to them as hobbits after the “Lord of the Rings” characters. Fossils that were discovered on the island 20 years ago and date back 60,000 to 100,000 years suggested the species was about 3½ feet tall.

Researchers who studied fragments of a humerus, or upper arm bone, that were found on the same island in 2013 now say earlier relatives were 2.4 inches shorter and existed since at least 700,000 years ago.

“It is the smallest adult human arm bone ever,” said Gerrit van den Bergh, a co-author of the study and a paleontologist at the University of Wollongong, Australia. “It’s quite special.”

It took researchers almost a decade to deduce the height from the 3.5-inch bone, which was excavated about 45 miles away from the original Liang Bua cave site, and to be sure it was that of an adult, not a child.

“It was broken in many pieces,” Bergh said.

Homo floresiensis arrived on the island almost a million years ago, he said, but quickly evolved to be smaller and eventually went extinct.

While scientists have no definitive answer for why their bodies reduced in size, Bergh said, clues can be found in the area’s fauna.

Animals on the island, such as elephants, underwent similar evolutionary changes, he said, possibly because of the limited food supply.

“If you have a population that quickly grows and depletes their food resources,” he said, “you get a population crash.”

In the face of food shortages, smaller individuals have a better chance of surviving, “so there’s a selective pressure towards a smaller size,” he added.

While the origin of Homo floresiensis has long been the subject of dispute, the authors of the new study say it supports the theory that they descended from Homo erectus, one of the first recognizable humanlike species. Bergh said the anatomy of the tiny arm bone, as well as two fossilized teeth found along with it, is similar to that of Homo erectus.

But a big question still looms, he said: How did the diminutive species end up marooned on an island?

“Probably a freak event, we don’t know, but I don’t think they made boats at that time,” he said. “On the mainland they can move, but on an island, they’re stuck. So they have to adapt to changing climates.”"

Fossils suggest even smaller ‘hobbits’ roamed an Indonesian island.,https://www.inkl.com/news/smallest-human-species-flores-hobbits-were-even-smaller-than-thought-study-finds,"Homo floresiensis, a species of humans dubbed “Hobbits” for their short stature, were even smaller than previously thought, a new fossil study has revealed.

The species, related to modern humans, was first discovered in 2003 at the Liang Bua cave on Indonesia’s island of Flores, after which they are named.

Archaeologists found that the small-brained people lived on the island as recently as 50,000 years ago, when our own species, Homo sapiens, was already long established in Australia to the south.

Initial fossils suggested that individuals of the species grew up to about three feet six inches tall with small brains and large teeth for their tiny size. The origin of the species remained a mystery, however, due to the rarity of their fossils.

It was initially believed that Homo floresiensis was a dwarfed descendant of the early Asian populations of human ancestor species Homo erectus.

Some researchers speculated that the “Hobbits of Flores” were a late-surviving remnant of a more ancient small-statured human ancestor species from Africa predating even Homo erectus.

At a site called Mata Menge, 75km east of the Liang Bua cave on Flores, researchers previously found other ancient human fossils including a jaw fragment and six teeth dating to around 700,000 years ago.

The fossils of a yet-undiscovered species appeared to be from three individuals with even smaller jaws and teeth thanHomo floresiensis. Based on this, researchers believed the small body size of Homo floresiensis likely evolved earlier in the history of the species.

Now, scientists have found three more fossils at Mata Menge, dating to 700,000 years ago, including a tiny adult humerus bone, part of the lower half of the upper arm.

Mata Menge humerus fragment, left, shown at the same scale as the humerus of Homo floresiensis from Liang Bua ( Yousuke Kaifu )

They estimated from these bones that the body height of an adult Homo floresiensis was only about 100cm, about 6cm shorter than the height of the “Hobbit” skeleton from Liang Bua.

“This 700,000-year-old adult humerus is not just shorter than that of Homo floresiensis, it is the smallest upper arm bone known from the hominin fossil record worldwide,” Adam Brumm, co-author of the study at Australia’s Griffith University, said.

“This very rare specimen confirms our hypothesis that ancestors of Homo floresiensis were extremely small in body size. However, it is now apparent from the tiny proportions of this limb bone that the early progenitors of the ‘Hobbit’ were even smaller than we had previously thought.

Skulls of Homo floresiensis, left, and Homo sapiens ( Professor Peter Brown, University of New England )

Further analysis suggested the Mata Menge fossil individuals were likely “direct ancestors” and “an older variant” of Homo floresiensis, but with less specialised teeth than their descendants.

The tiny arm bone examined in the new study hints that extreme body size reduction occurred early in the history of the Flores “Hobbits”.

“The new fossils strongly suggest that the ‘Hobbit’ story did indeed begin when a group of the early Asian hominins known as Homo erectus somehow became isolated on this remote Indonesian island, perhaps a million years ago, and underwent a dramatic body size reduction over time,” Dr Brumm said."
Fossils suggest even smaller ‘hobbits’ roamed an Indonesian island.,https://evrimagaci.org/tpg/ancient-fossils-reveal-even-smaller-tiny-hobbits-roamed-indonesia-6946,"Ancient Fossils Reveal Even Smaller Tiny Hobbits Roamed Indonesia New discoveries add depth to the story of human evolution and the adaptability of early hominins

Fossils uncovered on the Indonesian island of Flores suggest the existence of even smaller versions of the renowned ""hobbits""—a species known scientifically as Homo floresiensis. New research reveals evidence of ancestors of these small hominins, which may have roamed the island around 700,000 years ago. This discovery ignites curiosity about the evolutionary path of our ancient relatives and highlights the complexity of human history.

The Homo floresiensis, often affectionately referred to as ""hobbits"" due to their diminutive stature, is well documented as having significantly smaller body sizes compared to modern humans. Standing at about 3.5 feet tall, these fascinating creatures were first unearthed from Liang Bua cave on Flores island back in 2003. Since then, they have been regarded as some of the most unusual hominins to ever inhabit the Earth.

Recent excavations have revealed fossils believed to belong to this earlier group of hobbits. The evidence suggests these ancient inhabitants were even smaller than previously thought, sparking debates among scientists about their adaptive strategies and survival mechanisms.

Research indicates these early humans had various distinguishing physical traits. They possessed small brains, approximately the size of a grapefruit, which may have limited their cognitive capabilities. Yet, they managed to utilize basic tools and even performed complex tasks such as hunting and gathering. Their abilities highlight how adaptability can take various forms.

This new data originates from excavations at multiple sites across Flores. Excavations reveal not only skeletal remains but also tools, which testifies to the persistence of early hominins on the island! The items found strongly suggest they hunted small creatures, indicating they were resourceful and well-adapted to their environment.

But why were these ancient humans so much smaller? Theories abound! Some studies suggest the process known as dwarfism—when larger species evolve to be smaller due to limited resources and environmental pressures—may have played a significant role. The theory refers to island dwarfism, where larger mammals, like elephants, shrink over generations once isolated on islands. It appears the same phenomenon could apply to humans.

Dr. Julian Richards, an expert on prehistoric human behavior, discusses how geographical conditions influence human evolution. ""The idea is not just about size, but how species adapt to limited resources and environmental aspects related to islands. It’s compelling to think about how small changes over time lead to significant variations within species.""

This highlights the unique evolutionary paths different groups of hominins could have taken. The island's isolation may have driven these adaptations, leading to different survival strategies than those employed by flourishing populations on the mainland.

Interestingly enough, how these smaller hobbit-like humans thrived without the advantages of size is worth pondering. They lived alongside animals like the now extinct dwarf elephants and giant rats, establishing a connection with their unique ecosystem. These small humans developed skills to harvest available resources effectively, which was invaluable for their survival.

While the big-brained Homo sapiens dominate the stories of evolutionary history, findings like this remind us of the diversity within our family tree. With each discovery, the narrative of human evolution is enriched, intertwining various paths taken by our ancestors. Studying species like Homo floresiensis allows scientists to articulate how humans survived and thrived across vastly different environments.

Yet, this exploration isn't just academic; it impacts our view of today’s human experience. Dr. Richards notes, ""Understanding our ancestors can help us comprehend our place within the biodiversity of the planet. They might have faced challenges we cannot even begin to fathom.""

The parallels between us and ancient beings invite reflections on resilience, adaptability, and survival skills. What can we learn from these tiny hominins who crafted their lives on the margins?

For many, the fascination with hobbits ties back to their representation in popular culture—J.R.R. Tolkien’s beloved characters from The Hobbit, which brought the idea of small, brave adventurers to life. But just as fantasy inspired imaginations, the real-life discoveries underline the significance of these tiny humans' existence and their legacy.

So, what next? Archaeologists and anthropologists are joining forces on the island of Flores as they continue to unearth remnants of these distinct hominins. With advancements in technology and growing collaborations across disciplines, new insights are poised to emerge. Researchers hope to piece together the puzzle of their lifestyles, interactions, and eventual extinction.

With the accumulation of knowledge around Homo floresiensis, there remains immense potential for new theories and conclusions to arise. Each excavation offer glimpses of long-gone worlds and hints about the complex story of how humanity developed. The vastness of history we have yet to discover reflects one of evolutionary biology's most intriguing aspects—our past holds lessons for the present, and perhaps even the future.

The story of these simple stone tools and fragile bones challenges conventional narratives about human evolution. It posits questions: How much diversity existed among hominins, and what stories await discovery? The findings continually reinforce the notion of nature's complexity and the constant evolution of life on Earth.

Indeed, our history is not merely about survival but adaptability, innovation, and infinite variations. Just like the hobbits of Flores, humankind's small beginnings speak volumes about perseverance, challenging the scope of our perceptions about intelligence and capability.

Thus, as archaeologists keep digging away, the anticipation builds. What new truths might these ancient whispers tell us about the fragile intersection between past and present, bridging the gap between then and now? The tale of the hobbits resonates with the viewpoint of exploration— the human search for identity, connection, and what it means to be human."

A gorgeous view of auroras an astronaut spotted in space may leave you a little green with envy.

International Space Station (ISS) astronaut Matthew Dominick recently captured auroras dancing behind a Russia Soyuz spacecraft on the orbiting complex.

""Recent solar activity pushed the aurora closer to us. The Soyuz hangs from the station in a stream of aurora,"" NASA's Dominick wrote Aug. 2 on X.

""Soyuz is illuminated in a light blue from a sun behind the camera and in front of the space station that is just about to rise,"" added Dominick, who also added his camera settings for photographers: 1/4s, f1.4, 50mm, ISO 6400.

In his responses, Dominick added the image was taken as the sun was visible behind the camera, ""so that a little bit of light illuminates the Soyuz but does not wash out the aurora.""

Earth's auroras are caused by charged particles from the sun slamming into molecules in Earth's atmosphere, which are excited to higher energy levels and emit light as a result. Different molecules emit different colors; a green glow, for example, comes from excited oxygen.

Model suggests spewing metal nanorods into Mars' atmosphere could warm the planet.,https://phys.org/news/2024-08-spewing-metal-nanorods-mars-atmosphere.html,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies .

The proposed nanoparticle warming method. Credit: Aaron M. Geller, Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics.

A small team of engineers and geophysicists from Northwestern University, the University of Chicago, and the University of Central Florida has found, via modeling, that creating millions of metal nanorods from material on the Martian surface and then blasting them into the atmosphere would be a more efficient way to heat the planet than generating greenhouse gases. Their paper is published in the journal Science Advances.

Science fiction writers have for many years envisioned a future when Mars is made habitable through terraforming techniques, allowing humans to survive without the need for special buildings and spacesuits. Recently, scientists have begun looking at the possibility, though most project ideas are far less ambitious.

Instead of completely transforming the planet, many are looking at simply warming it up a bit to make it more habitable. Most such ideas have centered on releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere to capture more heat from the sun. Unfortunately, there are few ingredients on the Martian surface that could be used to create and release such gases.

In this new effort, the research team suggests an alternative method—releasing millions of metal nanorods into the atmosphere.

Metal nanorods, the researchers suggest, could trap heat in much the same way that Martian dust does but would remain in the atmosphere longer. They compare the effort to shooting glitter into the atmosphere. They state that nanorods could be easily made with materials on the Martian surface, and presumably be reused once they fall to the ground. Initial testing showed the nanorods would settle 10 times more slowly than dust.

To find out if their idea is feasible, the researchers used the MarsWRF global climate model, along with an additional 1-D model to mimic the conditions they sought. After including data describing the addition of metal nanorods into the atmosphere, they ran the model to see what would happen.

The model showed that if the nanorods were fired at 30 liters per second into the atmosphere, the entire planet would warm by 30 K (which is equivalent to 30°C or 54°F). It further showed that if the firing were sustained for at least 10 years, ice on the surface would start to melt.

The research team suggests the use of metal nanorods to warm Mars would be far more efficient than trying to do so with greenhouse gases.

Photos of the remains, found in the Oymyakon District, appeared on the Russian social media site Telegram on Aug. 2.

Novo rinoceronte-lanudo fóssil encontrado em ótimo estado de conservação!https://t.co/useXIqKva2August 5, 2024

Following the discovery, researchers at the North-Eastern Federal University (NEFU) in Yakutsk visited the site and recovered the rhino's horn. The rest of the mummified woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis) will be excavated in the coming months, according to a translated statement from the NEFU .

""This is a truly unique find that will allow us to study the history of the region, its ancient fauna, climate and geological conditions in more depth,"" Anatoly Nikolaev, rector of the NEFU, said in the statement.

The permafrost in Siberia provides ideal conditions for the preservation of ancient creatures. The cold conditions mummify the remains, normally dehydrating soft tissues and locking them away in a frozen ""time capsule.""

Maxim Cheprasov , senior researcher and head of the laboratory of the NEFU Mammoth Museum, said this is only the fifth time scientists have found a woolly rhino with intact soft tissues. ""Until today, there was no such rare find in the collection of the Mammoth Museum,"" he said in the statement. ""In the modern history of NEFU, this is the first such find.""

Woolly rhinos mainly lived during the Pleistocene epoch (2.6 million to 11,700 years ago), first appearing about 300,000 years ago across northern Eurasia. As the last ice age ended, their range contracted until they only inhabited parts of Siberia — eventually going extinct about 10,000 years ago as a result of the changing climate and human activity .

NEFU researchers plan to study the horn before the rest of the remains are excavated. ""According to morphological parameters, it belonged to a mature individual,"" Cheprasov said. ""The exact biological age and sex of the animal will be determined after a comprehensive study of the carcass itself."""

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are one of the most recent open mysteries of modern astrophysics. Within a few milliseconds, these powerful events release an immense amount of energy, among the highest observable in cosmic phenomena.

FRBs were discovered just over ten years ago and mostly arise from extragalactic sources. Their origin, however, is still uncertain and there are huge ongoing efforts by the astrophysics community around the world to understand the physical processes behind them.

In very few cases, the rapid flash that characterizes FRBs coincides with a persistent emission, which is also observed in the radio band. A new study led by the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF) has recorded the weakest persistent radio emission ever detected for an FRB so far.

The subject of the study is FRB20201124A, a fast radio burst discovered in 2020, whose source is located about 1.3 billion light-years away from us. Along with INAF researchers, the collaboration involves the Universities of Bologna, Trieste and Calabria, in Italy, and the international participation of research institutes and universities in China, the United States, Spain and Germany.

The observations were performed with the most sensitive radio telescope in the world, the Very Large Array (VLA) in the United States. The data enabled scientists to verify the theoretical prediction that a plasma bubble is at the origin of the persistent radio emission of fast radio bursts. The results are published today in the journal Nature.

""We were able to demonstrate through observations that the persistent emission observed along with some fast radio bursts behaves as expected from the nebular emission model, i.e. a 'bubble' of ionized gas that surrounds the central engine,"" explains Gabriele Bruni, INAF researcher in Rome and lead author of the new paper.

""In particular, through radio observations of one of the bursts that is nearest to us, we were able to measure the weak persistent emission coming from the same location as the FRB, extending the radio flux range explored so far for these objects by two orders of magnitude.""

This research also helps narrow down the nature of the engine powering these mysterious radio flashes. According to the new data, the phenomenon is based on a magnetar (a strongly magnetized neutron star) or a high-accretion X-ray binary, i.e. a binary system consisting of a neutron star or black hole, accreting material from a companion star at very intense rates.

In fact, winds produced by the magnetar or the X-ray binary would be able to ""blow"" the plasma bubble giving rise to the persistent radio emission. There is therefore a direct physical relationship between the engine of FRBs and the bubble, which is located in its immediate vicinity.

The motivation for this observing campaign came from another work led by Luigi Piro of INAF, who is also a co-author of the new paper. In their earlier work, the researchers had identified the persistent emission in this FRB's host galaxy, but they had not yet measured the position with sufficient precision to associate the two phenomena.

""In this new work, we conducted a campaign at higher spatial resolution with the VLA, along with observations in different bands with the NOEMA interferometer and the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GranTeCan), which allowed us to reconstruct the general picture of the galaxy and discover the presence of a compact radio source—the FRB plasma bubble—immersed in the star-forming region,"" adds Piro.

""In the meantime, the theoretical model on the nebula had also been published, allowing us to test its validity and, finally, to confirm the model itself.""

Most of the work focused on excluding that the persistent radio emission comes from a star-forming region, and is therefore not physically linked to the FRB source. For this purpose, the NOEMA observations in the millimeter band measured the amount of dust, which is a tracer of ""obscured"" star-forming regions, whereas GranTeCan optical observations measured emission from ionized hydrogen, which is also a tracer of the star formation rate.

""Optical observations were an important element to study the FRB region at a spatial resolution similar to that of radio observations,"" notes co-author Eliana Palazzi from INAF in Bologna. ""Mapping hydrogen emission at such a great level of detail allowed us to derive the local star formation rate, which we found to be too low to justify continuous radio emission.""

Most FRBs do not exhibit persistent emissions. Until now, this type of emission had only been associated with two FRBs—both, however, with such a low brightness that did not allow to verify the proposed model.

FRB20201124A, instead, is located at a large but not excessive distance, which made it possible to measure the persistent emission despite its low brightness. Understanding the nature of the persistent emissions allows researchers to add a piece to the puzzle about the nature of these mysterious cosmic sources.

A new nebula origin for the persistent radio emission of fast radio bursts.,https://gizmodo.com/big-bubble-of-plasma-in-space-shoots-fast-radio-burst-toward-earth-2000484616,"A team of researchers believes the flurry of radio waves emanating from deep space came from a bubble of plasma surrounding a compact object, one of the universe’s densest entities.

The waves were a fast radio burst, or FRB, an enigmatic class of radio waves characterized by their brilliance and their unpredictable lengths. Many are fleeting, but some are very reliable; one source described by a different team last year blinked every 22 minutes for 30 years.

Astronomers discovered the burst, called FRB20201124A, in 2020, spewing from a source about 1.3 billion light-years away. Last year, a different team of researchers found the most distant FRB yet, coming from a source about 10 billion light-years away. Thus, the more recently analyzed burst practically seems local. A paper published this week in Nature described the nature of its origin

“We were able to demonstrate through observations that the persistent emission observed along with some fast radio bursts behaves as expected from the nebular emission model, i.e. a ‘bubble’ of ionized gas that surrounds the central engine,” said Gabriele Bruni, a researcher at the National Institute for Astrophysics and lead author of the new paper, in an INAF release.

Fast radio bursts are flurries of radio waves that generate “as much energy in a thousandth of a second as the Sun does in a year,” according to NASA. They are brilliant in the truest sense, making them exciting sources of data for radio astronomers. FRB20201124A was scrutinized with the most sensitive radio telescope on Earth, the Very Large Array. The team determined that the FRB came from a bubble of plasma surrounding a dense object.

What kind of dense object could lie at the bubble’s center, you ask? There are a couple of possibilities, but both are very dense. The new data suggests that a magnetar—a strongly magnetized neutron star—may lie at its core. Another possibility is a binary system of a neutron star or a black hole taking voluminous amounts material from a smaller companion star. Winds produced by either source could effectively “blow” the plasma bubble surrounding it, according to a National Institute for Astrophysics release.

“Optical observations were an important element to study the FRB region at a spatial resolution similar to that of radio observations,” said study co-author Eliana Palazzi, also a researcher at INAF. “Mapping hydrogen emission at such a great level of detail allowed us to derive the local star formation rate, which we found to be too low to justify continuous radio emission.”

Like other reliable FRBs, FRB20201124A’s radio emissions are persistent. In fact, they are the weakest persistent radio emissions yet detected for an FRB. More observations of similar FRBs and their sources may clarify the conditions that generate the bursts in general, as well as the various types of bursts, of different strengths and persistences."
A new nebula origin for the persistent radio emission of fast radio bursts.,https://www.unlv.edu/news/release/study-plasma-bubbles-and-engine-cosmic-fast-radio-bursts,"An international team of researchers has unlocked the latest clue in the search for what drives some fast radio bursts (FRBs) – violent, deep-space cosmic explosions of electromagnetic radiation that in just milliseconds produce the energy equivalent of our sun’s annual output.

First discovered just over a decade ago, FRBs remain among the most mysterious events in the universe. Despite extensive research, the precise mechanisms driving these bursts remain unclear. However, in a few instances, the brief flash of an FRB is accompanied by a weaker, persistent radio emission.



A new study led by the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF) and an international team of scientists – including UNLV astrophysicist Bing Zhang – has revealed that the persistent emission of radiation following the initial flash of some FRBs is likely generated by plasma bubbles. The study was published Aug. 7 in the journal Nature.

Researchers focused on FRB20201124A, a fast radio burst discovered in 2020 whose source is located about 1.3 billion light-years away from Earth. The FRB was captured in observations by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico, which is currently the most sensitive radio telescope in the world, along with other arrays worldwide. This combination of sources allowed scientists to build a comprehensive picture of the FRB and its host galaxy.

“We were able to demonstrate through observations that the persistent emission observed along with some fast radio bursts behaves as expected from the nebular emission model, i.e. a ‘bubble’ of ionized gas that surrounds the central engine,” explains Gabriele Bruni, INAF researcher and lead author of the new paper. “Through radio observations of one of the bursts that is nearest to us, we were able to measure the weak persistent emission coming from the same location as the FRB, extending the radio flux range explored so far for these objects by two orders of magnitude.""

These observations suggest that the central engines of these FRBs could be magnetars, incredibly dense, city-sized neutron stars that possess the most powerful magnetic fields in the universe. Because magnetars occasionally produce X-ray bursts through dissipation of magnetic fields, they’re viewed as plausible sources to power FRBs. Another possibility is that they are driven by what are known as high-accretion X-ray binary systems, which consist of a neutron star or black hole and draw in material from companion stars at very high rates.



According to researchers, winds produced by a magnetar or X-ray binary would be able to “blow” the plasma bubble that leads to the persistent radio emission.

“According to our theory, the brightness of persistent radio sources should linearly scale with the Faraday rotation measure, a parameter that measures the strength and density of the medium surrounding the FRB source,” said Bing Zhang, study co-author and professor and director of the Nevada Center for Astrophysics at UNLV. “What we’ve observed aligns very well with prediction models, suggesting a consistent picture of known FRB sources.”

Though most FRBs do not exhibit a measurable persistent emission, researchers say that understanding the nature of the emission offers is crucial to solving the puzzle about the origins of these mysterious cosmic sources.

“Persistent radio sources from most FRBs are predicted to be too faint to detect, which is consistent with our theory,” said Zhang. “Detecting more radio bubbles around nearby FRBs with more magnetized environments will further test our theory and bring us another step closer to understanding the nature and origin of FRBs.”

You can read their full press release HERE. This particular burst, located approximately 1.3 billion light-years from Earth, provided the team with unprecedented data, thanks to the NSF VLA, currently the most sensitive radio telescope in the world. Observations from the NSF VLA enabled the team to verify that a plasma bubble was responsible for the persistent emission observed in conjunction with FRBs. This supports the theoretical model predicting such an origin. The data suggest that the engine driving these FRBs could be a magnetar (a highly magnetized neutron star) or a high-accretion x-ray binary system, where intense winds from the magnetar or the binary system’s accretion process create this plasma bubble. The persistent emission associated with FRB20201124A is the weakest ever detected for an FRB, expanding the known range of these emissions by two orders of magnitude.

Gabriele Bruni, INAF researcher and lead author of the paper, explains, “Our observations confirm that the persistent radio emissions from FRBs behave as expected from the nebular emission model, indicating a bubble of ionized gas surrounding the central engine. This allows us to better understand the physical relationship between the engine of FRBs and the surrounding nebula.”

The NSF VLA’s advanced capabilities were crucial in distinguishing the weak, compact emission from the surrounding diffuse emission, providing insights that previous studies could not achieve.

Recent studies have provided new insights into the origins of fast radio bursts (FRBs), linking these intense cosmic phenomena to highly magnetized neutron stars known as magnetars.

These findings have significant implications for our understanding of some of the most energetic events in the universe.

The Mystery of Fast Radio Bursts

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are powerful flashes of radio waves that last only milliseconds but release an immense amount of energy, often more than the Sun emits in three days. First discovered in 2007, their origins have been a subject of intense study and debate among astronomers. Most FRBs are extragalactic, coming from sources millions to billions of light-years away. However, pinpointing their exact sources has been challenging due to their brief and sporadic nature.

FRBs are detected by radio telescopes around the world, but their short duration and random occurrence make them difficult to study in detail. Despite these challenges, astronomers have made significant progress in understanding these bursts. The energy released by FRBs is immense, and understanding the mechanisms behind these bursts can provide valuable insights into the extreme physical processes occurring in the universe.

Magnetars as a Source of FRBs

Scientists have long suspected that magnetars, a type of neutron star with extremely powerful magnetic fields, could be the source of FRBs. Neutron stars are formed from the remnants of supernova explosions, compressing the mass of the sun into a sphere only about 12 miles in diameter. The intense magnetic fields of magnetars, combined with their rapid rotation rates, make them prime candidates for generating the powerful bursts of energy seen in FRBs.

Magnetars are among the most exotic objects in the universe. Their magnetic fields are trillions of times stronger than Earth's magnetic field, and they can produce violent outbursts of energy. These characteristics make magnetars a plausible source of the intense radio waves detected as FRBs. The hypothesis that magnetars are behind FRBs is supported by the fact that some FRBs have been associated with X-ray and gamma-ray bursts, which are known to be produced by magnetars.

Plasma Bubbles and Persistent Emissions

The research also linked the persistent radio emissions associated with some FRBs to plasma bubbles around magnetars. The study, led by Gabriele Bruni of the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF), showed that these bubbles are formed by winds from magnetars or high-accretion X-ray binaries, which include neutron stars or black holes drawing material from companion stars at intense rates.

""We were able to demonstrate through observations that the persistent emission observed along with some fast radio bursts behaves as expected from the nebular emission model, i.e., a 'bubble' of ionized gas that surrounds the central engine,"" Bruni explained. This discovery helps narrow down the nature of the engine powering these mysterious radio flashes and provides a direct physical relationship between the engine of FRBs and the plasma bubble in its immediate vicinity.

The observations focused on FRB 20201124A, an active and repeating FRB located about 1.3 billion light-years away. Using the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile, the team detected the faintest radio continuum emission associated with an FRB to date, confirming a theoretical model that predicts these bursts are surrounded by a bubble of plasma created by the winds of charged particles from the central engine, likely a magnetar.

Observations and Methodology

The observations were performed with the most sensitive radio telescope in the world, the Very Large Array (VLA) in the United States. The data enabled scientists to verify the theoretical prediction that a plasma bubble is at the origin of the persistent radio emission of fast radio bursts. The results were published in the journal Nature.

In addition to the VLA, the team utilized observations from the NOEMA interferometer and the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GranTeCan). These instruments provided a multi-wavelength view of the FRB's host galaxy, allowing researchers to map the emissions from hydrogen and measure the amount of dust in star-forming regions. This detailed approach helped ensure that the observed emissions are directly linked to the FRB and not other astrophysical processes.

The combination of these high-resolution observations allowed the team to reconstruct the general picture of the galaxy and discover the presence of a compact radio source—the FRB plasma bubble—immersed in the star-forming region. This detailed mapping was crucial in confirming the nebular emission model and understanding the environment in which these powerful bursts occur.

Implications for Understanding FRBs

The confirmation of the nebular emission model and the link to magnetars provide a framework for future research into these powerful cosmic events. Observations using the most sensitive radio telescopes, such as the VLA and the NOEMA interferometer, will continue to explore these phenomena.

By mapping the emissions from hydrogen and measuring the amount of dust in star-forming regions, scientists aim to exclude other potential sources of persistent radio emissions.

""This research helps narrow down the nature of the engine powering these mysterious radio flashes,"" Bruni noted. Understanding the nature of persistent emissions allows researchers to add a piece to the puzzle about the nature of these mysterious cosmic sources.

The findings are significant for understanding the physical processes behind FRBs and their environments, and they underscore the importance of high-resolution observations and international collaboration in solving one of astrophysics' most intriguing mysteries."

Long ago, Mars teemed with water.

New imagery captured by the European Space Agency's Mars Express orbiter depicts the planet's once watery past. The spacecraft, which has orbited the Red Planet for two decades, snapped views of the eroded remains of once sprawling Lake Eridania — which the space agency noted was larger than any lake on Earth. (The largest lake on Earth is by far the Caspian Sea, which at some 149,200 square miles, or 386,400 square kilometers, is bigger than Montana.)

""We believe that water, and a lot of it, once existed here,"" ESA said in a statement.

But Mars gradually lost its insulating atmosphere, the result of a lost magnetic field and relentless solar radiation. Ultimately Mars' once thick atmosphere diminished, and bounties of water escaped. Without this insulating blanket, the planet dried out. Today, the planet is 1,000 times drier than the driest desert on Earth.

Views of the lakebed's remnants can be seen below. In the first image, which depicts topography, the blue color (lower elevation), shows part of the lake basin. A large crater, itself with signs of past flowing water on its rim, sits next to the lake.

For a wider perspective, the map below shows the region, Caralis Chaos, recently mapped by the Express orbiter. The smaller white box shows the area covered in the images above (while the larger white box depicts the total area recently imaged by the craft).

The body of water was truly huge. ""This lake would have filled the flatter regions labelled Ariadnes Colles, Caralis Chaos, and Atlantis Chaos,"" the space agency wrote. It would have harbored over three times the water held by the Caspian Sea.

Planetary scientists suspect that Mars could have once hosted primitive, microbial life in watery areas or moist Martian soils — such as the Jezero Crater, which also hosted a large lake.

Recently, NASA's Perseverance rover drilled into a rock in Jezero, where the six-wheeled robot had detected organic molecules (aka the ""building blocks of life"" as we know it). The robot collected a sample, and inside, scientists spotted a telltale composition that suggests the potential of ancient microbial life. ""The rock exhibits chemical signatures and structures that could possibly have been formed by life billions of years ago when the area being explored by the rover contained running water,"" NASA said in a statement. But, crucially, much more research, over many years, is needed to confirm this possibility.

The ongoing exploration of intriguing Martian places will continue — and one day Martian astronauts may join this discovery effort."

ESA’s star-surveying Gaia mission has again proven to be a formidable asteroid explorer, spotting potential moons around more than 350 asteroids not known to have a companion.

Previously, Gaia had explored asteroids known to have moons — so-called ‘binary asteroids’ — and confirmed that the telltale signs of these tiny moons show up in the telescope’s ultra-accurate astrometric data. But this new finding proves that Gaia can conduct ‘blind’ searches to discover completely new candidates, too.

Gaia spots possible moons around hundreds of asteroids “Binary asteroids are difficult to find as they are mostly so small and far away from us,” says Luana Liberato of Observatoire de la Côte d’Azur, France, lead author of the new study. “Despite us expecting just under one-sixth of asteroids to have a companion, so far we have only found 500 of the million known asteroids to be in binary systems. But this discovery shows that there are many asteroid moons out there just waiting to be found.” If confirmed, this new finding adds 352 more binary candidates to the tally, nearly doubling the known number of asteroids with moons.

An outstanding asteroid explorer Asteroids in Gaia data release 3 Asteroids are fascinating objects, and hold unique insights into the formation and evolution of the Solar System. Binaries are even more exciting, enabling us to study how different bodies form, collide and interact in space. Thanks to its unique all-sky scanning capabilities, Gaia has made a number of important asteroid discoveries since its launch in 2013. In its data release 3, Gaia precisely pinpointed the positions and motions of 150 000+ asteroids — so precisely that scientists could dig deeper and hunt for asteroids displaying the characteristic ‘wobble’ caused by the tug of an orbiting companion (the same mechanism as displayed here for a binary star). Gaia also gathered data on asteroid chemistry, compiling the largest ever collection of asteroid ‘reflectance spectra’ (light curves that reveal an object’s colour and composition).

20 times more precise: Gaia maps 150 000+ asteroid orbits The 150 000+ orbits determined in Gaia’s data release 3 were refined and made 20 times more precise as part of the mission’s Focused Product Release last year. Even more asteroid orbits are anticipated as part of Gaia’s forthcoming data release 4 (expected not before mid-2026). “Gaia has proven to be an outstanding asteroid explorer, and is hard at work revealing the secrets of the cosmos both within and beyond the Solar System,” says Timo Prusti, Project Scientist for Gaia at ESA. “This finding highlights how each Gaia data release is a major step up in data quality, and demonstrates the amazing new science made possible by the mission.”

Rendezvous with a binary asteroid system Artist impression of Hera gliding past Didymos to Dimorphos ESA will further explore binary asteroids via the forthcoming Hera mission, due to launch later this year. Hera will follow up on NASA’s DART mission — which collided with Dimorphos, a moonlet orbiting the asteroid Didymos, in 2022 as an asteroid deflection test — to produce a post-impact survey of Dimorphos. It will be the first probe to rendezvous with a binary asteroid system. Gaia helped astronomers view the shadow cast by Didymos as it passed in front of more distant stars in 2022, an observing technique known as stellar occultation. The feasibility of this technique has been drastically improved by Gaia’s asteroid orbits and ultra-precise star maps in recent years, proving the mission’s immense value for Solar System exploration."

The European Space Agency's (ESA) Gaia space telescope has already proven itself invaluable in tracking billions of stars in the Milky Way, but now it has proved its worth with much smaller bodies, much closer to home.

The Gaia mission has spotted potential moons orbiting over 350 asteroids that were previously predicted to be singletons. Gaia had already been investigating known asteroid binaries, confirming they have companions, but this breakthrough shows the star surveyor is capable of conducting ""blind searches"" for completely new asteroid-moon partnerships.

If the new observations are confirmed, these 352 binaries will almost double the number of known binary asteroid systems in the solar system.

""Binary asteroids are difficult to find as they are mostly so small and far away from us,"" Luana Liberato, leader of the team behind the discovery and researcher at the Observatoire de la Côte d’Azur, said in a statement.

Why hunt asteroid binaries?

Asteroids are the remains of the material that first formed the sun and then birthed the planets of the solar system over 4.6 billion years ago. They are mainly located in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, thus receiving little radiation from the sun, which means this early solar system material is mostly ""unspoiled"" in asteroids.

Thus, by studying asteroids, astronomers get a better picture of what the solar system was like billions of years ago. Additionally, many scientists believe that water and other complex organic molecules, vital ingredients for life, were delivered to Earth by asteroid bombardment.

Studying asteroids could reveal if this theory is correct. But studying binary asteroids, in particular, could reveal even more than this about the infancy of our planetary system.

The early solar system was a turbulent and violent place in which collisions between rocky bodies were extremely common. Binary asteroids can reveal how these collisions proceeded and what happens when rocky bodies interact in the solar system.

Gaia has been making important discoveries about asteroids ever since it began scanning our cosmic backyard and the wider Milky Way in 2013. In Gaia's Data Release 3 (DR3), however, the ESA satellite surpassed itself, determining the orbits of over 156,000 asteroids. But it's not all about quantity; the Gaia data has impressive quality, too.

This data was estimated to be 20 times more precise as part of Gaia's Focused Product Release. This meant that Liberato and colleagues were able to observe tiny ""wobbles"" in the orbit of asteroids that indicate they have a hidden moon companion gravitationally tugging on them.

""This finding highlights how each Gaia data release is a major step up in data quality and demonstrates the amazing new science made possible by the mission.""

Excitingly, the fourth release of data from Gaia, DR4 currently set for mid-2026, will contain even more asteroid orbit data. This promises the discovery of even more asteroid-moon partnerships.

However, Gaia isn't the only ESA mission that investigates binary asteroids.

This October, the space agency will launch Hera, a mission set to investigate the asteroid Didymos and its tiny moon Dimorphos.

If those names sound familiar, that's because Dimorphos was the space rock that NASA slammed with the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) in Sept. 2022. The aim of this was to test if a kinetic impact on an asteroid moon could shift it and its parent body from a collision course with Earth.

Hera will conduct a deep investigation of Dart's impact and its aftereffects to gauge the viability of this method for planetary defense efforts.

European Space Agency.,https://www.digitaltrends.com/space/gaia-asteroid-binaries/,"There are plenty of moons orbiting around the planets in our solar system — Saturn, for example, has well over 100 known moons — and astronomers believe that planets outside our solar system almost certainly have moons too, called exomoons. Those are particularly hard to spot, but now researchers have a new bevy of a different type of moon to explore: those that orbit around asteroids.

It seems funny to think of it, but it’s actually quite common for asteroids to have tiny moons of their own. These form what is called a binary asteroid, like the famous pair of Didymos and Dimorphos, which NASA crashed a spacecraft into in 2022. The new data about binary asteroids comes from the European Space Agency’s Gaia mission, a space-based telescope that has spotted new potential moons around 350 asteroids.

Gaia is on a mission to map the entire Milky Way in 3D, but during its observations it also collects a large amount of data about objects within our solar system. It is this solar system data that has turned up the many new potential asteroid binaries. If these are confirmed, it would almost double the number of known asteroid binaries for astronomers to explore.

Gaia is able to detect hints of these binaries by looking for a distinctive “wobble” in the orbits of larger asteroids, which implies the existence of a smaller binary partner. Gaia is still collecting data, with another large-scale data release coming in 2026 that will uncover even more asteroid orbits.

Why study asteroids?

Asteroids are spacerocks left over from the formation of our Solar System; remnants of the dusty disc of material that surrounded our young Sun in its infancy.

The material in this circumstellar disc coalesced over time to form the planets and moons we see today across our Solar System.

And remnants of that disc are seen in asteroids; particularly the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter.

As such, asteroids can be studied to learn more about what our early Solar System was like and how it evolved over time.

And binary asteroids can give astronomers insight into how different bodies form, collide and interact in space.

If Gaia's data is confirmed, it will add 352 known binary asteroids to the total, nearly doubling the known number of asteroids with moons.

Gaia's asteroid discoveries

ESA’s Gaia space telescope launched on 19 December 2013, tasked with surveying over a billion stars to create the most precise 3D map of our Milky Way ever made.

In its data release 3, Gaia revealed the positions and motions of over 150,000 asteroids, and astronomers were able to use this data to look for asteroids 'wobbling' as a result of the gravitational tug of a moon in orbit around them.

This is the same method used to detect binary stars or even exoplanets orbiting stars.

Gaia was also able to unlock the characteristics of the asteroids' chemistry, gathering data known as asteroid ‘reflectance spectra’, which relates to how light from a celestial object can reveal information about that object's colour and composition.

""Gaia has proven to be an outstanding asteroid explorer, and is hard at work revealing the secrets of the cosmos both within and beyond the Solar System,"" says Timo Prusti, Project Scientist for Gaia at ESA.

Gaia and DART

The Gaia mission lent its assistance to the DART mission in 2022, which purposely collided with Dimorphos, a moon orbiting asteroid Didymos.

The aim of the DART mission was to study how the collision affected the asteroid moon's orbital path.

Gaia observed the shadow cast by Didymos as it passed in front of distant stars, known as stellar occultation.

ESA's Hera mission is due to launch in October 2024 and will follow up on the DART mission to produce a post-impact survey of Dimorphos.

A new report finds that Boeing’s rockets are built with an unqualified workforce.,https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/a-new-report-finds-boeings-rockets-are-built-with-an-unqualified-work-force/,"The NASA program to develop a new upper stage for the Space Launch System rocket is seven years behind schedule and significantly over budget, a new report from the space agency's inspector general finds. However, beyond these headline numbers, there is also some eye-opening information about the project's prime contractor, Boeing, and its poor quality control practices.

The new Exploration Upper Stage, a more powerful second stage for the SLS rocket that made its debut in late 2022, is viewed by NASA as a key piece of its Artemis program to return humans to the Moon. The current plan calls for the use of this new upper stage beginning with the second lunar landing, the Artemis IV mission, currently scheduled for 2028. In NASA parlance, the upgraded version of the SLS rocket is known as Block 1B.

However, for many reasons—including the readiness of lunar landers, Lunar Gateway hardware, a new mobile launch tower, and more—NASA is unlikely to hold that date. Now, based on information in this new report, we can probably add the Exploration Upper Stage to the list.

""We found an array of issues that could hinder SLS Block 1B’s readiness for Artemis IV including Boeing’s inadequate quality management system, escalating costs and schedules, and inadequate visibility into the Block 1B’s projected costs,"" states the report, signed by NASA's deputy inspector general, George A. Scott.

Quality control a concern

There are some surprising details in the report about Boeing's quality control practices at the Michoud Assembly Facility in southern Louisiana, where the Exploration Upper Stage is being manufactured. Federal observers have issued a striking number of ""Corrective Action Requests"" to Boeing.

""According to Safety and Mission Assurance officials at NASA and DCMA officials at Michoud, Boeing’s quality control issues are largely caused by its workforce having insufficient aerospace production experience,"" the report states. ""The lack of a trained and qualified workforce increases the risk that the contractor will continue to manufacture parts and components that do not adhere to NASA requirements and industry standards.""

This lack of a qualified workforce has resulted in significant program delays and increased costs. According to the new report, ""unsatisfactory"" welding operations resulted in propellant tanks that did not meet specifications, which directly led to a seven-month delay in the program.

NASA's inspector general was concerned enough with quality control to recommend that the space agency institute financial penalties for Boeing’s noncompliance. However, in a response to the report, NASA's deputy associate administrator, Catherine Koerner, declined to do so. ""NASA interprets this recommendation to be directing NASA to institute penalties outside the bounds of the contract,"" she replied. ""There are already authorities in the contract, such as award fee provisions, which enable financial ramifications for noncompliance with quality control standards.""

The lack of enthusiasm by NASA to penalize Boeing for these issues will not help the perception that the agency treats some of its contractors with kid gloves.

Seven years late

The new report predicts that Block 1B development costs will reach $5.7 billion before it ultimately launches, which is already $700 million more than a cost estimate NASA formally established just last December.

As for the upper stage itself, NASA initially predicted development costs would be $962 million back in 2017. However, the new report predicts that the Exploration Upper Stage will actually cost $2.8 billion, or three times the original cost estimate. (For what it is worth, Ars used a simple estimating tool in 2019 to predict the Exploration Upper Stage development cost would be $2.5 billion. So it's not like it was a huge secret that NASA and Boeing would blow out the budget here).

However, the increased costs will benefit Boeing, since this is a cost-plus contract that pays for all of Boeing's expenses, plus a fee. This may help explain why a development program that was originally supposed to be completed in 2021 is not likely to be finished until 2028 at the earliest.

And what for? The Space Launch System works great as it is. There are far, far cheaper upper stages that could be used for the rocket's primary function to launch the Orion spacecraft to lunar orbit, including United Launch Alliance's reliable (and ready) Centaur V upper stage. With Starship and New Glenn, NASA will also soon have two very powerful commercial super heavy lift rockets to draw upon."
A new report finds that Boeing’s rockets are built with an unqualified workforce.,https://www.devhardware.com/new-report-reveals-boeing-missiles-are-being-built-with-an-unskilled-workforce/,"NASA’s program to develop a new upper stage for the Space Launch System rocket is seven years behind schedule and significantly over budget, New report But alongside these headline numbers, there is also some eye-opening information about the project’s prime contractor, Boeing, and its poor quality control practices.

NASA considers the new Exploration Upper Stage, the more powerful second stage of the SLS rocket that debuted in late 2022, a key part of the Artemis program to return humans to the moon. The current plan calls for the new upper stage to be used starting with the second lunar landing, the Artemis 4 mission, currently scheduled for 2028. In NASA parlance, the upgraded version of the SLS rocket is known as Block 1B.

But for a variety of reasons—including the readiness of the lunar landers, the Lunar Gateway hardware, the new mobile launch tower, and more—NASA is unlikely to stick to that date. Now, based on the information in this new report, we may be able to add the Exploration Upper Stage to the list.

“We found a range of issues that could impede SLS Block 1B readiness for the Artemis IV program, including Boeing’s inadequate quality management system, high costs and schedules, and insufficient visibility into the projected costs of Block 1B,” said the report, signed by NASA Deputy Inspector General George A. Scott.

Quality control is a concern.

There are some surprising details in the report about Boeing’s quality control practices at its Michoud assembly plant in southern Louisiana, where the exploration upper stage is manufactured. Federal regulators have issued Boeing a staggering number of “corrective action requests.”

“According to NASA safety and mission assurance officials and Michoud IP defense agency officials, Boeing’s quality control problems are largely due to its insufficient workforce experience in spacecraft production,” the report said. “The lack of a trained and qualified workforce increases the risk that the contractor will continue to manufacture parts and components that do not meet NASA requirements and industry standards.”

This lack of a qualified workforce has led to significant delays in program implementation and increased costs. According to the new report, “unsatisfactory” welding operations resulted in fuel tanks that did not meet specifications, directly delaying the program by seven months.

NASA’s inspector general was so concerned about quality control that he recommended financial penalties for Boeing’s noncompliance. But in response to the report, NASA’s deputy associate administrator, Kathryn Koerner, declined to do so. “NASA interprets this recommendation as directing NASA to impose penalties outside the scope of the contract,” she said. “There are already authorities in the contract, such as award fee provisions, that provide financial consequences for noncompliance with quality control standards.”

NASA’s lack of enthusiasm for punishing Boeing over these issues will not help reinforce the impression that the agency treats some of its contractors with caution.

Seven years late

The new report projects that Block 1B development costs will reach $5.7 billion before it finally launches, which is already $700 million more than the cost estimate NASA officially set last December.

As for the upper stage itself, NASA originally projected development costs of $962 million in 2017. However, the new report projects that the exploration upper stage will actually cost $2.8 billion, or three times the original estimate. (It’s worth noting that Ars used a simple estimation tool in 2019 to predict the exploration upper stage would cost $2.5 billion. So it’s no secret that NASA and Boeing are spending a lot of money here.)

But the increased costs will benefit Boeing, because this is a profit-plus contract that covers all of Boeing’s expenses, plus fees. That may help explain why a development program that was supposed to be completed in 2021 won’t be completed until 2028 at the earliest.

But why? The Space Launch System works great as it is. There are much cheaper upper stages that can be used for the primary job of launching Orion into lunar orbit, including the reliable (and off-the-shelf) Centaur V upper stage from United Launch Alliance. And with Starship and New Glenn, NASA will soon have two super-powerful commercial rockets capable of lifting heavy payloads."
Physicists solve nuclear fusion mystery with mayonnaise. Near-Limitless Energy.,https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/nuclear-energy/physicists-solve-nuclear-fusion-mystery-with-mayonnaise,"Nuclear fusion technology could get a breakthrough from an unexpected place: mayonnaise.

In a new study, published in May in the journal Physical Review E , scientists plopped the creamy condiment into a churning wheel machine and set it whirling to see what conditions made it flow.

""We use mayonnaise because it behaves like a solid, but when subjected to a pressure gradient, it starts to flow,"" study lead author Arindam Banerjee , a mechanical engineer at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania, said in a statement .

This process could help elucidate the physics that occur at ultrahigh temperatures and pressures inside nuclear fusion reactors — without having to create those extreme conditions.

Related: World's largest nuclear fusion reactor is finally completed. But it won't run for another 15 years.

Nuclear fusion forges helium from hydrogen at the hearts of stars. In theory, it could be the source of nearly limitless clean energy on Earth — if the reaction could produce more energy than it requires to run.

That's a tall order; star-powered fusion occurs at 27 million degrees Fahrenheit (15 million degrees Celsius), according to NASA . And a star's massive gravity forces hydrogen atoms together, overcoming their natural repulsion. On Earth, however, we don't have those crushing pressures, so human-made fusion reactors must run 10 times hotter than the sun .

To reach these mind-melting temperatures, scientists use multiple approaches, including one called inertial confinement.

In this process, physicists freeze pea-sized pellets of gas — typically a mix of heavy isotopes, or versions, of hydrogen — into metal capsules. Then, they blast the pellets with lasers, which heats the gas to 400 million F (222 million C) in a flash — and, ideally, turns it into a plasma where fusion can occur, according to the statement.

Unfortunately, the hydrogen gas wants to expand, causing the molten metal to explode before hydrogen has time to fuse . This explosion occurs when the metal capsule enters an unstable phase and starts to flow.

Banerjee's team realized that molten metal behaves a lot like mayonnaise at lower temperatures: It can be elastic, meaning it bounces back when you push on it, or plastic, meaning it doesn't bounce back, or flowing.

The Rotating Wheel Rayleigh Taylor Instability Experiment - YouTube Watch On

""If you put a stress on mayonnaise, it will start to deform, but if you remove the stress, it goes back to its original shape,"" he said. ""So there's an elastic phase followed by a stable plastic phase. The next phase is when it starts flowing, and that's where the instability kicks in.""

In the new study, the researchers placed mayonnaise in a machine that accelerated the egg-and-oil emulsion until it started to flow. Then, they characterized the conditions at which the condiment transitioned between plastic, elastic and unstable states.

""We found the conditions under which the elastic recovery was possible, and how it could be maximized to delay or completely suppress the instability,"" Banerjee said.

The study also found which conditions allowed for more energy yield.

Of course, mayonnaise and ultrahot metal capsules are different in many ways. So it remains to be seen whether the team's findings can be translated to a pellet of plasma many times hotter than the sun."
SpaceX to build three new rocket landing zones on the Space Coast as Starship planning proceeds.,https://www.floridatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2024/08/08/spacex-plans-project-to-build-three-florida-rocket-landing-zones-at-cape-canaveral/74717999007/,"SpaceX plans to construct three new rocket landing zones on Florida's Space Coast, upping the number of missions the company can launch in the coming years — and presumably able to accommodate Starship-Super Heavy mega-rocket systems.

Thursday morning, the Space Florida board of directors briefly discussed the $27 million SpaceX undertaking, which was listed on the agenda as Project Liftoff. Construction will occur at the company's two rocket sites: Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and pad 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center.

""The project will enable higher cadence of flights, reduce pad down time, and enable job growth. Without these improvements, flight cadence at launch complex 39A and 40 would remain capped at current rates,"" Howard Haug, Space Florida executive vice president, treasurer and chief investment officer, told board members.

Cape Canaveral:Is there a launch today? Upcoming SpaceX, NASA rocket launch schedule from Florida

Haug said the project is estimated to create 300 jobs with average annual wages of $89,000. The project also includes ""resiliency enhancement"" such as corrosion protection, structural improvement, fire protection upgrades and environmental mitigation, he said.

The project is slated to be completed by the end of 2026, and the Florida Department of Transportation and SpaceX will each contribute more than $13.3 million, Space Florida spokesperson Alayna Curry said in an email.

SpaceX lands boosters at land, sea

Today, SpaceX operates Landing Zones 1 and 2 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. That's where Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy boosters descend for landings after some missions — generating sonic booms across Central Florida.

SpaceX boosters also land atop the drone ships Just Read the Instructions and A Shortfall of Gravitas in the Atlantic Ocean, most frequently during the company's numerous Starlink missions.

SpaceX has sent up 51 of the 55 rockets launched thus far this year from the Space Coast, with United Launch Alliance accounting for the other four. That pace should surpass the short-lived annual record of 72 launches, which was just set last year.

To that end, back-to-back SpaceX launches are scheduled for Friday and Saturday mornings, an Federal Aviation Administration operations plan advisory shows. The 4½-hour launch window for Friday's Starlink 8-3 mission from KSC extends from 8:13 a.m. to 12:43 p.m., while Saturday's Starlink 10-7 mission window from Launch Complex 40 lasts from 7:21-11:51 a.m.

Starship-Super Heavy coming to Space Coast

In an email, Curry said the uses for SpaceX's three future rocket landing zones have not been specified. However, SpaceX has altered and enlarged its Starship operational plans at KSC since NASA released an environmental assessment five years ago.

""SpaceX now proposes to construct additional launch infrastructure not previously contemplated in the 2019 EA; launch an advanced design of the Starship and Super Heavy vehicle; operate at a projected higher launch tempo; and land the Super Heavy booster at LC-39A in support of the reusability concept. Starship landings are no longer proposed to occur at Landing Zone 1 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station,"" an FAA website said.

Now, the FAA and other agencies are conducting an environmental assessment of SpaceX's plan to launch Starship-Super Heavy missions up to 44 times per year from pad 39A. SpaceX officials want to build a Super Heavy catch tower at the pad, along with onsite facilities for propellant generation and storage, a cooling tower, air separation unit and deluge system, an FAA fact sheet shows.

In tandem, SpaceX officials hope a Starship-Super Heavy launch complex becomes operational by 2026 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The U.S. Air Force is preparing a Starship environmental impact statement in conjunction with the FAA, NASA and U.S. Coast Guard.

SpaceX competitors, Blue Origin and United Launch Alliance, raised concerns as part of the FAA review, warning the rocket is too untested, too potentially dangerous and too disruptive. Brevard residents have also expressed concerns ranging from the environmental impact to the impact on local communities, fishing families and tourism.
