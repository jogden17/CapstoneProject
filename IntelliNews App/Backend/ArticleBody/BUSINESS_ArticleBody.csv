Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, United Airlines Holdings' stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions

50% of the business is held by the top 15 shareholders

Ownership research along with analyst forecasts data help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock

Every investor in United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 75% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).

And institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 15% last week. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 27% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. Hence, if weakness in United Airlines Holdings' share price continues, institutional investors may feel compelled to sell the stock, which might not be ideal for individual investors.

In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of United Airlines Holdings.

Check out our latest analysis for United Airlines Holdings

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About United Airlines Holdings?

Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.

We can see that United Airlines Holdings does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at United Airlines Holdings' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.

Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in United Airlines Holdings. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 11% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 9.2% and 7.2%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.

A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 15 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.

While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.

Insider Ownership Of United Airlines Holdings

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of United Airlines Holdings, Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$72m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to see if those insiders have been buying or selling.

General Public Ownership

The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 24% stake in United Airlines Holdings. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

Next Steps:

I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for United Airlines Holdings you should be aware of.

"Nasdaq, S&P 500 end 2% higher in rally after US job.",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nasdaq-domo/domo/news/domo-incs-nasdaqdomo-business-and-shares-still-trailing-the,"With a price-to-sales (or ""P/S"") ratio of 0.9x Domo, Inc. ( ) may be sending very bullish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all the Software companies in the United States have P/S ratios greater than 4.2x and even P/S higher than 11x are not unusual. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly reduced P/S.

What Does Domo's Recent Performance Look Like?

With revenue growth that's inferior to most other companies of late, Domo has been relatively sluggish. The P/S ratio is probably low because investors think this lacklustre revenue performance isn't going to get any better. If you still like the company, you'd be hoping revenue doesn't get any worse and that you could pick up some stock while it's out of favour.

Do Revenue Forecasts Match The Low P/S Ratio?

Want the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our will help you uncover what's on the horizon.

Domo's P/S ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very poor growth or even falling revenue, and importantly, perform much worse than the industry.

Retrospectively, the last year delivered virtually the same number to the company's top line as the year before. Although pleasingly revenue has lifted 44% in aggregate from three years ago, notwithstanding the last 12 months. So while the company has done a solid job in the past, it's somewhat concerning to see revenue growth decline as much as it has.

Turning to the outlook, the next year should bring diminished returns, with revenue decreasing 2.0% as estimated by the five analysts watching the company. That's not great when the rest of the industry is expected to grow by 22%.

With this information, we are not surprised that Domo is trading at a P/S lower than the industry. Nonetheless, there's no guarantee the P/S has reached a floor yet with revenue going in reverse. Even just maintaining these prices could be difficult to achieve as the weak outlook is weighing down the shares.

What We Can Learn From Domo's P/S?

Typically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-sales ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.

As we suspected, our examination of Domo's analyst forecasts revealed that its outlook for shrinking revenue is contributing to its low P/S. As other companies in the industry are forecasting revenue growth, Domo's poor outlook justifies its low P/S ratio. Unless there's material change, it's hard to envision a situation where the stock price will rise drastically.

You should always think about risks. Case in point, we've spotted you should be aware of, and 1 of them makes us a bit uncomfortable.

If you're unsure about the strength of Domo's business, why not explore for some other companies you may have missed.

"Nasdaq, S&P 500 end 2% higher in rally after US job.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stock-market-up-today-dow-jones-s-p-500-nasdaq-federal-reserve/,"Stocks in the the U.S. rebounded on Tuesday as financial markets regained their footing after a sharp selloff on Monday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which fell more than 1,000 points yesterday, rose 294 points, or 0.8%, to closed at 38,998, while the S&P 500 gained 1% after suffering its worst one-day plunge in more than two years. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also climbed 1%.

The steadier trading followed three days of market turmoil sparked by signs the U.S. economy is slowing and concerns that the Federal Reserve has waited too long to cut interest rates. Based on that economic data, Wall Street now expects the Fed to cut rates more deeply in September than they had previously, and to usher in more cuts throughout 2024.

""The recovery in equities so far today has lightened the mood,"" analysts with Capital Economics said in a report on Tuesday. ""[T]he risks of a 'hard landing' have risen but one is still not the base case, not least because the Fed will probably start easing monetary policy fairly soon.""

All economists surveyed by financial data company FactSet now expect the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.5 percentage points at its September 17-18 meeting, or double prior forecasts for a 0.25 percentage point cut.

Sentiment was also helped by a report Monday by the Institute for Supply Management that said growth for U.S. services businesses was a touch stronger than expected, led by the arts, entertainment and recreation sectors, along with accommodations and food services.

The U.S. economy is still growing, and most economists don't expect recession. The U.S. stock market is still up a healthy amount for the year, with double-digit percentage gains for the S&P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq.

What hurt stocks?

The stock market rout began on Thursday after weak reports on manufacturing and construction, which stoked fears the U.S. economy may finally be buckling under the pressure of high interest rates. Then on Friday, investors were further spooked by a monthly jobs report that was far weaker than expected, fueling Wall Street's anxiety that the U.S. could be heading for a recession.

Other catalyts also led investors to sell, including a view that some large technology players were overvalued. Although tech companies' earnings have been solid this year, they haven't wowed investors.

Nvidia, the chip company whose technology powers artificial intelligence, shed 23% of its value between July 31 and August 5. Its shares rebounded $3.80, or 3.8%, to $104.25 Tuesday.

Markets have romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part due to a frenzy around artificial intelligence technology, and critics have been saying prices looked too expensive.

Other worries also are weighing on the market, with investors fretting that the Israel-Hamas war and other global hotspots could cause sharp swings for the price of oil.

Despite Tuesday's rebound, some Wall Street analysts warn there could be more volatility. Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, is warning more drops could be ahead because of a slowing U.S. economy and sticky inflation. He had been predicting a coming ""correction"" in U.S. stock prices for a while, including an acknowledgement in July that his initial call was early. That was two days before the S&P 500 set its latest all-time high and then began sinking.

—With reporting by the Associated Press."
"Nasdaq, S&P 500 end 2% higher in rally after US job.",https://fortune.com/2024/08/05/stock-market-crash-nearly-everything-sinking-sp500-dow-nasdaq-japan-worst-1987/,"A scary Monday that started with a plunge abroad reminiscent of 1987’s crash swept around the world and pummeled Wall Street with more steep losses, as fears worsened about a slowing U.S. economy.

The S&P 500 dropped 3% for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average reeled by 1,033 points, or 2.6%, while the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%.

The drops were the latest in a global sell-off that began last week. Japan’s Nikkei 225 helped begin Monday by plunging 12.4% for its worst day since the Black Monday crash of 1987.

It was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday’s report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the U.S. economy to come in weaker than expected, and it’s all raised fear the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation.

Professional investors cautioned that some technical factors could be amplifying the action in markets, and that the drops may be overdone, but the losses were still neck-snapping. South Korea’s Kospi index careened 8.8% lower, and bitcoin dropped below $54,000 from more than $61,000 on Friday.

Even gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during tumultuous times, slipped about 1%.

That’s in part because traders began wondering if the damage has been so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, briefly sank below 3.70% during the morning from 3.88% late Friday and from 5% in April. It later recovered and pulled back to 3.89%.

“The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3% doesn’t really seem like an emergency.”

Of course, the U.S. economy is still growing, the U.S. stock market is still up a healthy amount for the year and a recession is far from a certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.

Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession within the next 12 months following Friday’s jobs report. But he still sees only a 25% probability of that, up from 15%, in part “because the data look fine overall” and he does not “see major financial imbalances.”

Some of Wall Street’s recent declines may simply be air coming out of a stock market that romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Critics have been saying for a while that the stock market looked expensive after prices rose faster than corporate profits.

“Markets tend to move higher like they’re climbing stairs, and they go down like they’re falling out a window,” according to JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America. He chalks much of the recent worries to euphoria around AI subsiding, with pressure rising on companies to show how AI is turning into profits, and “a market that was ahead of itself.”

The only way for stocks to look less expensive is either for prices to fall or for their profits to strengthen. Expectations are still high for the latter, with growth for S&P 500 profits this past quarter looking to be the strongest since 2021.

Professional investors also pointed to the Bank of Japan’s move last week to raise its main interest rate from nearly zero. Such a move helps boost the value of the Japanese yen, but it could also force traders to scramble out of deals where they borrowed money for virtually no cost in Japan and invested it elsewhere around the world.

Treasury yields also pared their losses Monday after a report said growth for U.S. services businesses was a touch stronger than expected. Growth was led by arts, entertainment and recreation businesses, along with accommodations and food services, according to the Institute for Supply Management.

Still, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy’s strength took sharp losses on the fears about a slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 3.3%, washing out what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.

Making things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks tumbled as the market’s most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the “ Magnificent Seven ” had propelled the S&P 500 to record after record this year, even as high interest rates weighed down much of the rest of the stock market.

But Big Tech’s momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports that began with updates from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines.

Apple fell 4.8% Monday after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker.

Nvidia, the chip company that’s become the poster child of Wall Street’s AI bonanza, fell even more, 6.4%. Analysts cut their profit forecasts over the weekend for the company after a report from The Information said Nvidia’s new AI chip is delayed. The recent selling has trimmed Nvidia’s gain for the year to nearly 103% from 170% in the middle of June.

Another Big Tech titan, Alphabet, fell 4.4% after a U.S. judge ruled Google’s search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation.

All told, the S&P 500 fell 160.23 points to 5,186.33. The Dow sank 1,033.99 to 38,703.27, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 576.08 to 16,200.08.

Worries outside corporate profits, interest rates and the economy are also weighing on the market. The Israel-Hamas war may be worsening, which beyond its human toll could cause sharp swings for the price of oil. That’s adding to broader worries about potential hotspots around the world, while upcoming U.S. elections could further scramble things.

Wall Street has been concerned about how policies coming out of November could impact markets, but the sharp swings for stock prices could affect the election itself.

The threat of a recession is likely to put Vice President Kamala Harris on the defensive. But slower growth could also further reduce inflation and force former President Donald Trump to pivot from his current focus on higher prices to outlining ways to revive the economy.

“It comes down to jobs,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. Jobs drive spending by U.S. consumers, which in turn is the biggest part of the U.S. economy.

“When we get to election day, the unemployment rate is going to be extremely important.”"
"Nasdaq, S&P 500 end 2% higher in rally after US job.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hillman-solutions-corp-nasdaq-hlmn-102826504.html,"With its stock down 7.7% over the past week, it is easy to disregard Hillman Solutions (NASDAQ:HLMN). However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. Specifically, we decided to study Hillman Solutions' ROE in this article.

Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.

View our latest analysis for Hillman Solutions

How Is ROE Calculated?

ROE can be calculated by using the formula:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Hillman Solutions is:

0.5% = US$6.0m ÷ US$1.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).

The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.01 in profit.

What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?

Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.

Hillman Solutions' Earnings Growth And 0.5% ROE

It is quite clear that Hillman Solutions' ROE is rather low. Even compared to the average industry ROE of 14%, the company's ROE is quite dismal. Despite this, surprisingly, Hillman Solutions saw an exceptional 46% net income growth over the past five years. We believe that there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.

As a next step, we compared Hillman Solutions' net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 11%.

Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Hillman Solutions is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.

Story continues

Is Hillman Solutions Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?

Given that Hillman Solutions doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.

Summary

On the whole, we do feel that Hillman Solutions has some positive attributes. With a high rate of reinvestment, albeit at a low ROE, the company has managed to see a considerable growth in its earnings. We also studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that the company's earnings growth is expected be similar to its current growth rate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals? Click here to be taken to our analyst's forecasts page for the company.

( ) as a stock to avoid entirely with its 47.4x P/E ratio. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.

HealthStream certainly has been doing a good job lately as its earnings growth has been positive while most other companies have been seeing their earnings go backwards. It seems that many are expecting the company to continue defying the broader market adversity, which has increased investors’ willingness to pay up for the stock. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price.

Is There Enough Growth For HealthStream?

Want the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our will help you uncover what's on the horizon.

There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like HealthStream's to be considered reasonable.

If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 39%. Pleasingly, EPS has also lifted 124% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.

Turning to the outlook, the next year should generate growth of 1.1% as estimated by the six analysts watching the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 15%, which is noticeably more attractive.

In light of this, it's alarming that HealthStream's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are hoping for a turnaround in the company's business prospects, but the analyst cohort is not so confident this will happen. There's a good chance these shareholders are setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.

The Key Takeaway

It's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.

Our examination of HealthStream's analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E anywhere near as much as we would have predicted. When we see a weak earnings outlook with slower than market growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. This places shareholders' investments at significant risk and potential investors in danger of paying an excessive premium.

"Nasdaq, S&P 500 end 2% higher in rally after US job.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stock-market-today-dow-jones-s-p-500-down/,"Stocks in the U.S. plunged for a third consecutive trading day, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbling more than 1,000 points amid growing fears of an economic downturn sparked by a slowdown in hiring and consumer spending.

The S&P 500 slid 160 points, or 3%, to 5,186 on Monday, the index's biggest one-day drop in nearly two years, according to FactSet. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite sank 3.4% as investors fled some of the Big Tech players that until recently had powered the U.S. market higher — Apple shed 4.8%, while Meta and Nvidia, fell 2.5% and 6.4%, respectively.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 1,034 points, shedding 2.6% of its value. Earlier in the day, it had lost as more than 1,200 points, but the markets regained some of their early losses as Wall Street digested Monday data from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Services index, which showed that service employment picked up in July.

""The details of the ISM report were encouraging, with business activity, new orders and employment all rebounding markedly in July,"" Oxford Economics said in a Monday research note. The report ""aligns with our view of an economy in transition rather than one on the brink of collapse.""

Even with Monday's rout, U.S. stocks still remain in positive territory this year. The S&P 500 has gained 9.4% in 2024, even after including its recent slide, while the Dow remains up by 2.6%.

What's driving down stocks

Stocks lost ground on Thursday after weak reports on manufacturing and construction, which stoked fears the U.S. economy may finally be buckling under the pressure of high interest rates.

Then on Friday, government data showed that hiring last month was far weaker than expected, adding to Wall Street's fears that a ""soft landing,"" in which the U.S. economy could avoid a recession despite the highest interest rates in 23 years, could instead become a hard landing.

""The main factor that has staying power is the economy's slowdown,"" wrote Wells Fargo head of global investment strategy Paul Christopher in a report. ""Investors have been watching household financial stress build for the past two years, but during that time, job growth remained above its December 2009-December 2019 average of 180,000 new jobs per month.""

But Friday's jobs report showed that employers added only 114,000 new jobs last month, far fewer than the 175,000 jobs expected by economists, he noted.

Tech stocks have been hit particularly hard in recent weeks as investors pull back from artificial intelligence companies amid questions about when the emerging sector will deliver profits.

""It has been a tough few weeks for the AI group as earnings were reported,"" analysts with Melius Research wrote. 'Microsoft, Meta, Google and Amazon were all asked about payoffs from AI investments. While pretty clear that they all need to keep spending, the market remains skeptical of the pace.""

The market rout extended to Asian and European markets, with Japan's benchmark stock index plunging 12.4% on Monday. The Nikkei had dropped 5.8% on Friday, making this its worst two-day decline ever.

Stocks in Korea and Taiwan also fell sharply, with all three Asian markets damaged as investors pull back from companies focused on artificial intelligence out of concern the sector has been overhyped.

When will the Fed cut rates?

With the disappointing economic data, Wall Street is worried the Federal Reserve may have kept its benchmark interest rate too high for too long, heightening the risk of a recession. The central bank kept the federal funds rate unchanged when it met on July 31 to discuss economic conditions and whether and when it should begin cutting rates.

A rate cut would make it less expensive for U.S. households and companies to borrow money, but it could take time for the effects to boost the economy. On Monday, some investors called for the Fed to start cutting rates sooner rather than later to stave off an economic downturn.

""The Federal Reserve needs to start easing monetary policy more aggressively than had been anticipated, in order to head off a looming recession in the world's largest economy,"" said Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, an independent financial advisory and asset management firm, in an email. ""The Fed was behind the curve at the beginning of the cycle, it cannot afford to be behind the curve this time too.""

Economists still don't expect a recession

Although worries over weakness in the U.S. economy and volatile markets have rippled around the world, domestic economic activity remains solid, with many analysts saying that a recession remains unlikely. Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist with Capital Economics, still expects a soft landing, while acknowledging that the risk of a sharper downturn is rising.

The economy has accelerated this year, with the nation's gross domestic product jumping to 2.8% in the second quarter, blowing past forecasts. A recession is typically marked by two consecutive quarters of negative GDP. And although July's jobs report was disappointing, analysts point out that it reflects just one month of data, while also noting that the depressed hiring figures in July could have also been impacted by Hurricane Beryl.

""It can be a mistake to read too much into a single data release,"" noted Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, told investors in a research note. ""The number of people who reported being unable to work [in July] due to the weather was 436,000; this compares to an average of 33,000 for July since 2000.""

Since Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) ranks 10th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.

Tech stocks are continuing to decline amid fears the Fed is taking too long to begin interest rate cuts, stoked by the latest jobs data that showed unemployment is rising. However, some analysts believe the latest decline in AI stocks is part of a normal market rotation and gives investors an opportunity to buy. While talking to CNBC in a latest program, Michael Landsberg of Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth said that the latest decline is a “little bit of a reset, obviously.” The analyst said that AI stocks had a “great run” and the latest pullback is a “typical process” of market rotation.

“It doesn’t mean we are not positive longer term on AI but when you have big runs like that that’s why you rebalance portfolios to keep the risk in check,” Landsberg said.

Asked if the AI bubble has popped and this is the end of the AI hype, the analyst said “absolutely not” and called the recent pullback “deceleration” from growth and “normalization.”

Landsberg said that the earnings season will “separate the wheat from the chaff” and believes major tech companies will still drive earnings in the future.

Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 77

Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) shares recently saw a bloodbath following the company’s weak Q2 results and disappointing guidance. The results show the AI growth everyone was talking about won’t come cheap. Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) expects its gross margin in the third quarter to decline to 34.5% from 38.7% reported in the second quarter, which was a significant decline from the company’s expectation of 43.5%.

While Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) has suspended its dividend and announced massive layoffs, its problem of inventory won’t be resolved anytime soon. Intel has 137 days of inventory, worth over $11.2 billion. This is much higher than the industry average of 90 days. Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) has close to $52 billion in long-term debt and analysts believe its cost-cutting measures along with AI growth initiatives won’t let it fix this problem soon. S&P Global recently put the stock’s credit rating on “watch” saying:

Story continues

“While these cost-cutting measures, including significant capital expenditure reductions, could alleviate some near-term cash-flow-generation challenges, it is unclear whether these steps will be sufficient to maintain its business competitiveness and enable healthy growth.”

Raymond James said in a report after earnings that Intel’s margin issues are expected to continue until 2025. AI PC growth has become a larger headwind for margins, as the higher cost of external wafers offsets modest average selling price premiums.

Amid these factors, investors are better off looking for other AI stocks and avoid Intel for now until there’s visibility on how exactly Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) would resolve its core problems.

ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:

“The massive ramp up in spending on AI spending has crowded out spending in other technology verticals such as software and traditional enterprise infrastructure. This has also driven a market where “AI winners” have enjoyed strong multiple expansion, while perceived “AI losers” have been severely punished. One example of a perceived AI loser temporarily cast aside was the Strategy’s top detractor for the quarter, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), whose shares declined as it put out financial targets for 2027 that were below Wall Street expectations, and also noted that demand for its core PC and server chips remained depressed. We take a contrarian view of Intel and do not think it will be an AI loser, but rather see underappreciated opportunity as AI PCs ramp over the next few quarters in enterprises, where Intel has a stronghold. We also believe that the company’s technology roadmap remains intact, which we believe will lead to a stabilization in market share in its core PC and server markets. Both markets remain depressed, but we believe that aging infrastructure and the ongoing growth of IT workloads will lead to a cyclical recovery in both markets, which should benefit shares.”

Overall, Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) ranks 10th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Latest AI News, Earnings and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. While we acknowledge the potential of Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Rivian Automotive's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions

A total of 7 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership

along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a business

To get a sense of who is truly in control of Rivian Automotive, Inc. ( ), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 44% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).

And institutional investors saw their holdings value drop by 16% last week. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 38% for shareholders. Also referred to as ""smart money"", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Rivian Automotive, which might have negative implications on individual investors.

In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Rivian Automotive.

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Rivian Automotive?

Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.

Rivian Automotive already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Rivian Automotive, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.

Hedge funds don't have many shares in Rivian Automotive. The company's largest shareholder is Amazon.com, Inc., with ownership of 16%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 11% and 7.0% of the stock. In addition, we found that Robert Scaringe, the CEO has 1.1% of the shares allocated to their name.

On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 7 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.

While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.

Insider Ownership Of Rivian Automotive

The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.

Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.

Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Rivian Automotive, Inc.. Insiders own US$169m worth of shares (at current prices). we sometimes take an interest in

General Public Ownership

The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 26% stake in Rivian Automotive. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

Private Company Ownership

Our data indicates that Private Companies hold 11%, of the company's shares. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.

Public Company Ownership

It appears to us that public companies own 17% of Rivian Automotive. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.

Next Steps:

It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Rivian Automotive better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified that you should be aware of.

"Nasdaq, S&P 500 end 2% higher in rally after US job.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-market-low-tolerance-aviat-143640994.html,"It is hard to get excited after looking at Aviat Networks' (NASDAQ:AVNW) recent performance, when its stock has declined 13% over the past three months. It seems that the market might have completely ignored the positive aspects of the company's fundamentals and decided to weigh-in more on the negative aspects. Long-term fundamentals are usually what drive market outcomes, so it's worth paying close attention. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Aviat Networks' ROE today.

Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.

See our latest analysis for Aviat Networks

How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?

Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Aviat Networks is:

5.3% = US$14m ÷ US$259m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).

The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.05.

What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?

Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.

Aviat Networks' Earnings Growth And 5.3% ROE

On the face of it, Aviat Networks' ROE is not much to talk about. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 8.2%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. As a result, Aviat Networks reported a very low income growth of 3.9% over the past five years.

Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Aviat Networks' reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 13% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see.

Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is Aviat Networks fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.

Story continues

Is Aviat Networks Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?

Aviat Networks doesn't pay any regular dividends, which means that it is retaining all of its earnings. However, this doesn't explain the low earnings growth the company has seen. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.

Conclusion

Overall, we have mixed feelings about Aviat Networks. While the company does have a high rate of reinvestment, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping any benefit to its investors, and moreover, its having a negative impact on the earnings growth. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Shattuck Labs' stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions

The top 6 shareholders own 51% of the company



If you want to know who really controls Shattuck Labs, Inc. ( ), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 44% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).

Institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$147m last week. However, the 24% one-year return to shareholders may have helped lessen their pain. But they would probably be wary of future losses.

Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Shattuck Labs.

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Shattuck Labs?

Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.

As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Shattuck Labs. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Shattuck Labs, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.

It would appear that 20% of Shattuck Labs shares are controlled by hedge funds. That catches my attention because hedge funds sometimes try to influence management, or bring about changes that will create near term value for shareholders. FMR LLC is currently the largest shareholder, with 15% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 12% and 7.8%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. Furthermore, CEO Taylor Schreiber is the owner of 5.5% of the company's shares.

On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 6 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.

While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.

Insider Ownership Of Shattuck Labs

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.

Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.

Our information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Shattuck Labs, Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$147m, and insiders have US$20m worth of shares in their own names. It is great to see insiders so invested in the business. It might be worth checking

General Public Ownership

The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 23% stake in Shattuck Labs. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.

Next Steps:

While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks for example - Shattuck Labs has we think you should know about.

(NASDAQ:MU) received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$153 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$89.00. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Micron Technology's current trading price of US$89.00 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap?

Let’s take a look at Micron Technology’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.

View our latest analysis for Micron Technology

What Is Micron Technology Worth?

Good news, investors! Micron Technology is still a bargain right now. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $143.54, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Micron Technology’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.

What kind of growth will Micron Technology generate?

Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With revenue expected to more than double in the next few years, the future appears to be extremely bright for Micron Technology. If expenses can also be maintained, it looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.

What This Means For You

Are you a shareholder? Since MU is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on MU for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy MU. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price.

View our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices

Is Advanced Micro Devices Still Cheap?

The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It’s trading around 5.91% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Advanced Micro Devices today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $127.30, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Advanced Micro Devices’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.

What does the future of Advanced Micro Devices look like?

Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Advanced Micro Devices. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.

What This Means For You

Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in AMD’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on AMD, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

It can be quite valuable to consider what analysts expect for Advanced Micro Devices from their most recent forecasts. At Simply Wall St, we have the analysts estimates which you can view by clicking here.

"Nasdaq, S&P 500 end 2% higher in rally after US job.",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nasdaq-tcx/tucows/news/tucows-incs-nasdaqtcx-price-is-right-but-growth-is-lacking-a,"Tucows Inc. ( ) shares have had a really impressive month, gaining 31% after a shaky period beforehand. Taking a wider view, although not as strong as the last month, the full year gain of 17% is also fairly reasonable.

Although its price has surged higher, Tucows may still be sending bullish signals at the moment with its price-to-sales (or ""P/S"") ratio of 0.8x, since almost half of all companies in the IT industry in the United States have P/S ratios greater than 1.9x and even P/S higher than 4x are not unusual. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the reduced P/S.

What Does Tucows' Recent Performance Look Like?

The revenue growth achieved at Tucows over the last year would be more than acceptable for most companies. It might be that many expect the respectable revenue performance to degrade substantially, which has repressed the P/S. Those who are bullish on Tucows will be hoping that this isn't the case, so that they can pick up the stock at a lower valuation.

Do Revenue Forecasts Match The Low P/S Ratio?

We don't have analyst forecasts, but you can see how recent trends are setting up the company for the future by checking out our earnings, revenue and cash flow.

The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/S as low as Tucows' is when the company's growth is on track to lag the industry.

If we review the last year of revenue growth, the company posted a worthy increase of 8.1%. The solid recent performance means it was also able to grow revenue by 16% in total over the last three years. Therefore, it's fair to say the revenue growth recently has been respectable for the company.

Comparing the recent medium-term revenue trends against the industry's one-year growth forecast of 8.6% shows it's noticeably less attractive.

With this in consideration, it's easy to understand why Tucows' P/S falls short of the mark set by its industry peers. It seems most investors are expecting to see the recent limited growth rates continue into the future and are only willing to pay a reduced amount for the stock.

What Does Tucows' P/S Mean For Investors?

Tucows' stock price has surged recently, but its but its P/S still remains modest. We'd say the price-to-sales ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.

Our examination of Tucows confirms that the company's revenue trends over the past three-year years are a key factor in its low price-to-sales ratio, as we suspected, given they fall short of current industry expectations. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in revenue isn't great enough to justify a higher P/S ratio. Unless the recent medium-term conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.

Before you take the next step, you should know about the (3 can't be ignored!) that we have uncovered.

"Nasdaq, S&P 500 end 2% higher in rally after US job.",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nasdaq-ewcz/european-wax-center/news/what-you-can-learn-from-european-wax-center-incs-nasdaqewcz,"To the annoyance of some shareholders, European Wax Center, Inc. ( ) shares are down a considerable 25% in the last month, which continues a horrid run for the company. The recent drop completes a disastrous twelve months for shareholders, who are sitting on a 61% loss during that time.

Although its price has dipped substantially, given close to half the companies in the United States have price-to-earnings ratios (or ""P/E's"") below 17x, you may still consider European Wax Center as a stock to avoid entirely with its 29.9x P/E ratio. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.

European Wax Center certainly has been doing a good job lately as its earnings growth has been positive while most other companies have been seeing their earnings go backwards. The P/E is probably high because investors think the company will continue to navigate the broader market headwinds better than most. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason.

Is There Enough Growth For European Wax Center?

Want the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our will help you uncover what's on the horizon.

The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as European Wax Center's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.

Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 115% last year. Although, its longer-term performance hasn't been as strong with three-year EPS growth being relatively non-existent overall. So it appears to us that the company has had a mixed result in terms of growing earnings over that time.

Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 43% each year as estimated by the nine analysts watching the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 11% each year, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.

In light of this, it's understandable that European Wax Center's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.

What We Can Learn From European Wax Center's P/E?

A significant share price dive has done very little to deflate European Wax Center's very lofty P/E. While the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.

We've established that European Wax Center maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.

And what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted (of which 1 doesn't sit too well with us!) you should know about.

"Nasdaq, S&P 500 end 2% higher in rally after US job.",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/nasdaq-has-hundreds-of-penny-stocks-now-it-s-trying-to-purge-them-11723122701515.html,"Nasdaq is taking steps to purge itself of dubious companies whose shares trade below $1 each, following criticism that the exchange has become home to hundreds of risky penny stocks.

Proposed rule changes released by Nasdaq on Thursday could accelerate the delisting of such companies as Bit Brother, a tiny Chinese blockchain company that became an embarrassment to the exchange during the past year.

Starting in 2020, Bit Brother carried out three reverse splits to keep its share price above $1, allowing it to maintain its Nasdaq listing, even as its share price sank more than 99% after adjusting for the splits. The stock drew attention in late December when it experienced a wild surge in trading volume, fueled by individual meme-stock investors and social-media buzz.

Bit Brother was finally delisted in March. But Nasdaq still took heat from brokers and investor advocates who say it lists too many other small, risky companies that don’t deserve the seal of approval that comes with an exchange listing.

“These are classic penny-stock companies that are often tied to pump-and-dump trading activity and other forms of market manipulation,"" the electronic-trading firm Virtu Financial told the Securities and Exchange Commission in a petition filed in July.

Virtu urged the SEC to limit excessive reverse stock splits and to force exchanges to delist companies more quickly if their share prices fall below $1. Nasdaq-listed companies whose share drop below that level can currently stave off a delisting for more than a year, owing to various grace periods permitted under Nasdaq rules.

When a stock closes below $1 for 30 consecutive trading days, Nasdaq deems the company to be noncompliant and gives it 180 days to remedy the situation. After 180 days, if the stock hasn’t climbed above $1, the company can request another 180-day grace period. At the end of that second period, the company can still get a last-minute reprieve by appealing to a Nasdaq hearings panel. The delisting is stayed while the company awaits its hearing.

Some say those rules are lax, leading to a pileup of penny stocks on Nasdaq. On Wednesday, there were 523 stocks listed on U.S. exchanges that closed below $1 per share, of which 433 were listed on Nasdaq, according to Dow Jones Market Data. By comparison, there were fewer than a dozen sub-$1 stocks in early 2021.

The two proposed rule changes unveiled by Nasdaq on Thursday would tighten up some of the rules regarding sub-$1 stocks, though they don’t go as far as Virtu has demanded.

Under one of the proposed changes, companies that reach the end of their second 180-day grace period wouldn’t be able to postpone delisting by seeking an appeal. Instead, their shares would move to the over-the-counter market—a sort of purgatory where companies land after being delisted—while they await the appeal. Effectively, the rule change caps the amount of time that sub-$1 stocks can be listed on Nasdaq to roughly a year.

The second proposed rule change would speed up the delisting process for companies that recently did a reverse stock split. Under the change, if a company carried out a reverse split to prop up its share price, but then its stock fell below $1 within a year, Nasdaq would immediately send the company a delisting notice. The company could still appeal and remain listed for another 180 days.

Both rule changes must be approved by the SEC to take effect. In a regulatory filing posted on its website, Nasdaq said it was proposing the changes to protect investors, after observing a pattern of repeated reverse splits by troubled companies.

“Nasdaq believes that such behavior is often indicative of deep financial or operational distress within such companies rendering them inappropriate for trading on Nasdaq for investor protection reasons,"" the exchange said.

In a reverse split, a company swaps multiple shares for one share, boosting the share price without changing the company’s market value. The maneuver is often viewed as a red flag by investors. Still, it has grown more common as speculative companies that went public in 2020 and 2021—a frenzied period for new issuance—have struggled to keep their share prices above $1.

Last year, exchange-listed companies carried out a record 495 reverse splits, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. The pace has continued into this year, with 249 reverse splits in the first half of 2024, S&P data shows.

"Nasdaq, S&P 500 end 2% higher in rally after US job.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/why-is-the-stock-market-down-what-should-investors-do/,"Financial analyst on stock market turmoil and what it means for your 401K Financial analyst on stock market turmoil and what it means for your 401K 09:01

A swift and sudden downdraft in global stocks is raising concern among ordinary investors about the impact on their portfolios and 401(k) plans.

The S&P 500 slid 160 points, or 3%, to 5,186 on Monday, the index's biggest one-day drop in nearly two years, according to FactSet. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite sank 3.4% as investors fled some of the tech giants that until recently had powered the U.S. market higher, with Apple shedding 4.8% and Nvidia falling 6.4%.

Notably, the slump follows what had been a bullish year, with the stock market reaching record highs that bolstered the retirement accounts of millions of U.S. workers. The whiplash may have some 401(k) savers questioning what's behind the reversal, especially after the U.S. economy had appeared to be on solid footing, with steady growth and cooling inflation, thanks to the Federal Reserve's flurry of interest rate hikes.

Here are four reasons why experts say the stock market is tumbling, along with their advice on what investors should do.

The Fed might have waited too long to cut interest rates

A range of signals in recent months suggest the economy is losing speed, leading some experts to urge the Federal Reserve to lower its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2020. For now, however, the central bank has left rates unchanged, including more at its policy meeting last week.

Investors now fret that the Fed may have waited too long to ease borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, raising the risks of a recession.

""The real issue here is investors are worried the Fed is behind the curve in cutting interest rates, and that means there could be a bigger risk of a policy error,"" Amanda Agati, chief investment officer of PNC's asset management group, told CBS MoneyWatch. ""The fear is that we might ultimately tip into a recession, versus that prior expectation for a soft landing.""

Economic data points to U.S. slowdown

Stocks have soared into record terrain this year, propelled by expectations the Fed would soon trim interest rates for the first time since 2020 and by the ongoing artificial intelligence boom.

But market sentiment began to shift in mid-July as a growing number of economic signals pointed to a slowdown in growth. Those concerns intensified on August 2 after data showed a dip in manufacturing and construction, while a weaker-than-expected employment report added to Wall Street's fears about the economy running out of steam.

Potentially more worrisome is that consumer spending — which accounts for roughly two-thirds of economic activity — is showing signs of weakness. Companies such as McDonald's and Walmart are reporting that their customers are cutting back amid the strain of still-elevated inflation and high borrowing costs.

Still, some experts caution that such data points might turn out to be a blip, rather than a trend.

""Without stating the obvious, one month does not make a trend, so next month's jobs report will be very important,"" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, in an email. ""It's worth pointing out that the April 2024 payroll number was initially 165,000 and then was revised down to 108,000 before rebounding to 216,000 the following month.""

Tech stocks are a victim of high expectations

Some of the worst-hit stocks during the rout can be found in the tech sector, with the so-called Magnificent Seven, a group of tech stocks including Amazon, Apple and Nvidia, among the market's worst performers on Monday. Nvidia, the chip company whose technology powers artificial intelligence, has shed 23% of its value since July 31.

Prior to last week, these stocks had been among the year's best performers, which meant that Wall Street had lofty expectations for their revenue and profit growth. And while their earnings reports have been solid so far this year, they haven't wowed investors.

""Even if earnings come in as expected, the valuation multiples are so high that it's hard to sustain"" those prices, PNC's Agati said. ""Investors are panicking, and this is a really rapid sentiment shift.""

She added, ""We don't think the underlying fundamentals support this shift. For the most part, the Magnificent Seven have been fine in terms of earnings results.""

Japan's interest rate hike

Professional investors also pointed to the impact of the Bank of Japan's move last week to raise its main interest rate from nearly zero.

This boosted the value of the Japanese yen. But it has also forced traders to unwind investments in which they had borrowed money in Japan at near-zero interest rates and then converted the yen into dollars, which they then used to buy U.S. stocks. In other words, traders have had to sell assets to cover their trades, which could be feeding into the stock market declines, experts said.

""This 'carry trade' has been unraveling in recent weeks and might have crescendoed on Friday,"" according to Yardeni Research.

What should investors do?

First it's important to understand that stock downturns — even sharp ones — are common. Although the S&P 500 is down roughly 8% from its peak in July, drops in equity prices of 5% or more have occurred at least once a year for the past four decades, according to Oxford Economics. Market corrections, or a drop of at least 10% from their highs, occur an average of every one and half to two years, the firm said in a report.

But even bear markets, or when stocks decline at least 20% from their peak, are normal and aren't a reason to panic, experts say. While the temptation might be to sell, it's best to resist that urge, especially for people saving for the long-term such as for retirement. Market timing, or trying to buy and sell stocks to capture gains and avoid losses, is notoriously difficult and can lead to lost opportunities, research from Charles Schwab has found.

""If you are a long term investor, take a deep breath — it is very scary, I get it,"" Jill Schlesinger, the business analyst for CBS News, told the network. ""As long as you are in a long-term portfolio, you shouldn't worry.""

Moving into cash ""is never a good investment,"" added PNC's Agati. That's especially the case when the Fed is widely expected to cut rates as early as September, which will reduce the returns for savings accounts and money market funds.

""If you are worried about your retirement plan, I wouldn't be pulling the plug and moving to cash,"" Agati added, noting that he would look at investment-grade fixed income investments or U.S. Treasuries because they may provide more attractive yields moving forward."
"Nasdaq, S&P 500 end 2% higher in rally after US job.",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-vygr/voyager-therapeutics/news/lacklustre-performance-is-driving-voyager-therapeutics-incs,"With a price-to-sales (or ""P/S"") ratio of 2.7x Voyager Therapeutics, Inc. ( ) may be sending very bullish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all the Biotechs companies in the United States have P/S ratios greater than 11.1x and even P/S higher than 61x are not unusual. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/S at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so limited.

How Voyager Therapeutics Has Been Performing

While the industry has experienced revenue growth lately, Voyager Therapeutics' revenue has gone into reverse gear, which is not great. Perhaps the P/S remains low as investors think the prospects of strong revenue growth aren't on the horizon. So while you could say the stock is cheap, investors will be looking for improvement before they see it as good value.

Do Revenue Forecasts Match The Low P/S Ratio?

Want the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our will help you uncover what's on the horizon.

There's an inherent assumption that a company should far underperform the industry for P/S ratios like Voyager Therapeutics' to be considered reasonable.

Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 26% decrease to the company's top line. That put a dampener on the good run it was having over the longer-term as its three-year revenue growth is still a noteworthy 8.7% in total. Accordingly, while they would have preferred to keep the run going, shareholders would be roughly satisfied with the medium-term rates of revenue growth.

Shifting to the future, estimates from the ten analysts covering the company suggest revenue growth is heading into negative territory, declining 26% each year over the next three years. Meanwhile, the broader industry is forecast to expand by 111% per annum, which paints a poor picture.

With this in consideration, we find it intriguing that Voyager Therapeutics' P/S is closely matching its industry peers. Nonetheless, there's no guarantee the P/S has reached a floor yet with revenue going in reverse. There's potential for the P/S to fall to even lower levels if the company doesn't improve its top-line growth.

The Key Takeaway

We'd say the price-to-sales ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.

As we suspected, our examination of Voyager Therapeutics' analyst forecasts revealed that its outlook for shrinking revenue is contributing to its low P/S. Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/S as they concede future revenue probably won't provide any pleasant surprises. It's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.

( ) may be sending bullish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all the Capital Markets companies in the United States have P/S ratios greater than 3x and even P/S higher than 7x are not unusual. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the reduced P/S.

What Does TPG's P/S Mean For Shareholders?

Recent revenue growth for TPG has been in line with the industry. One possibility is that the P/S ratio is low because investors think this modest revenue performance may begin to slide. If not, then existing shareholders have reason to be optimistic about the future direction of the share price.

How Is TPG's Revenue Growth Trending?

If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our .

The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/S as low as TPG's is when the company's growth is on track to lag the industry.

If we review the last year of revenue growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 21%. Despite this strong recent growth, it's still struggling to catch up as its three-year revenue frustratingly shrank by 50% overall. So unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that the company has not done a great job of growing revenues over that time.

Shifting to the future, estimates from the eight analysts covering the company suggest revenue growth is heading into negative territory, declining 23% over the next year. That's not great when the rest of the industry is expected to grow by 6.6%.

With this in consideration, we find it intriguing that TPG's P/S is closely matching its industry peers. Nonetheless, there's no guarantee the P/S has reached a floor yet with revenue going in reverse. There's potential for the P/S to fall to even lower levels if the company doesn't improve its top-line growth.

What Does TPG's P/S Mean For Investors?

Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-sales ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.

It's clear to see that TPG maintains its low P/S on the weakness of its forecast for sliding revenue, as expected. Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/S as they concede future revenue probably won't provide any pleasant surprises. Unless these conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.

Don't forget that there may be other risks. For instance, we've identified that you should be aware of.

"Nasdaq, S&P 500 end 2% higher in rally after US job.",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/insurance/nasdaq-nodk/ni-holdings/news/does-the-market-have-a-low-tolerance-for-ni-holdings-incs-na,"NI Holdings (NASDAQ:NODK) has had a rough week with its share price down 11%. We, however decided to study the company's financials to determine if they have got anything to do with the price decline. Fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes so it makes sense to study the company's financials. Specifically, we decided to study ROE in this article.

Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.

How Is ROE Calculated?

The formula for ROE is:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for NI Holdings is:

2.2% = US$5.7m ÷ US$256m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).

The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.02 in profit.

What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?

We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.

NI Holdings' Earnings Growth And 2.2% ROE

It is quite clear that NI Holdings' ROE is rather low. Even when compared to the industry average of 13%, the ROE figure is pretty disappointing. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the five year net income decline of 52% seen by NI Holdings was possibly a result of it having a lower ROE. However, there could also be other factors causing the earnings to decline. Such as - low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.

That being said, we compared NI Holdings' performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 9.1% in the same 5-year period.

Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about NI Holdings''s valuation, check out , as compared to its industry.

Is NI Holdings Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?

Because NI Holdings doesn't pay any regular dividends, we infer that it is retaining all of its profits, which is rather perplexing when you consider the fact that there is no earnings growth to show for it. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating.

Summary

In total, we're a bit ambivalent about NI Holdings' performance. Even though it appears to be retaining most of its profits, given the low ROE, investors may not be benefitting from all that reinvestment after all.

"Nasdaq, S&P 500 end 2% higher in rally after US job.",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-prva/privia-health-group/news/privia-health-group-incs-nasdaqprva-fundamentals-look-pretty-1,"With its stock down 12% over the past week, it is easy to disregard Privia Health Group (NASDAQ:PRVA). However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. Specifically, we decided to study ROE in this article.

Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.

How Is ROE Calculated?

ROE can be calculated by using the formula:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Privia Health Group is:

2.8% = US$18m ÷ US$623m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).

The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.03 in profit.

What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?

Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.

A Side By Side comparison of Privia Health Group's Earnings Growth And 2.8% ROE

It is hard to argue that Privia Health Group's ROE is much good in and of itself. Even compared to the average industry ROE of 12%, the company's ROE is quite dismal. In spite of this, Privia Health Group was able to grow its net income considerably, at a rate of 31% in the last five years. We believe that there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.

We then compared Privia Health Group's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 5.6% in the same 5-year period.

Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is Privia Health Group fairly valued compared to other companies? These might help you decide.

Is Privia Health Group Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?

Privia Health Group doesn't pay any regular dividends currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the high earnings growth number that we discussed above.

Summary

Overall, we feel that Privia Health Group certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Even in spite of the low rate of return, the company has posted impressive earnings growth as a result of reinvesting heavily into its business. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate. To know more about the latest analysts predictions for the company, check out this

The narrative on Wall Street is shifting.

Traders have long placed their bets on the Federal Reserve cutting rates in September, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell basically confirmed as much Wednesday.

That rate cut, expected in six weeks, was priced in to stocks, which have been rising over the past few months in hopes of a cut. Rate cuts tend to juice stocks, because they lower borrowing costs for businesses and can help boost profits.

But now, fear is starting to take hold, as concerns mount that the Fed may not be acting quickly enough to keep America’s job market in good shape. Friday’s worse-than-expected jobs report confirmed those fears.

Powell warned Wednesday that cracks are starting to form in the labor market, and the sudden jump to a 4.3% unemployment rate is the latest piece of evidence.

On Thursday, the stock market underwent a bit of a reset, with the Dow falling more than 600 points as America may be entering a new phase of the economy — a slowdown in hiring. The broader S&P 500 tumbled 1.5% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped a stunning 2.5%.

Those fears extended globally, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 plunging 5.8% Friday, the index’s biggest daily drop since March 2020.

US stocks fell further Friday after Amazon and Intel reported dreadful earnings and outlooks as the transition to AI has proven costly while its prospects remain uncertain. The bad jobs report sent stocks sinking even further: The Dow fell 800 points, or 2.3%. S&P 500 futures were down 2.6% and Nasdaq futures were 3.1% lower.

It’s been a turbulent few weeks for markets, as some earnings reports have underwhelmed and fear about increased regulation of tech and lackluster AI performance have soured investors’ moods. Companies have reported US consumers have pulled back from restaurants and retailers, and this week some preliminary jobs data looked weak.

But America’s economy remains strong. A report last week on second-quarter gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the US economy, was particularly robust, showing consumer spending resilience. Housing data is starting to show some signs of improvement, including mortgage rates tumbling to their lowest levels since February on Thursday. And Wall Street seems unfazed by Vice President Kamala Harris’ surprise frontrunner status for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Look for more of this bumpiness over the next few months as economists and investors sort out what may be a new phase in America’s economic growth story."
"Nasdaq, S&P 500 end 2% higher in rally after US job.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-stock-market-sell-off-is-about-more-than-weak-economic-data-140119052.html,"Stocks tanked on Monday, continuing losses from the past several trading sessions as fears about a weakening economy gripped markets.

The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped about 3.4%, while the S&P 500 fell 3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) shed about 2.6%, or more than 1,000 points in afternoon trading.

The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) was hovering near 3.78%, down roughly 50 basis points in less than two weeks. Volatility has spiked, too, The CBOE Volatility Index, known by its ticker as simply the VIX (^VIX), shot up above 60 for the first time since 2020.

The latest leg of the sell-off accelerated overnight as Japan's Nikkei 225 (^N225) dropped more than 12% in its biggest-ever daily loss after a surprise interest rate hike from the Bank of Japan. Yardeni Research president Ed Yardeni told Yahoo Finance he thinks the ""large extent"" of the sell-off in US stocks is attributable to the moves in Japan.

Yardeni explained that an unwinding of the so-called carry trade spawned from speculators borrowing in Japan at 0% interest rates and then taking that money and investing in areas of the market like the Magnificent Seven tech stocks.

""Now, with the central bank tightening while other central banks are easing, the yen suddenly had a big move to the upside and that strength really led to a lot of margin calls of these speculative positions,"" Yardeni said. ""That's all coming unglued. And I think it's a lot of margin calls, and I think it's going to happen pretty quick, and the unwind should be over by the end of the week.""

The sell-off in US stocks also came as investors also adjusted their expectations for domestic monetary policy.

A weaker-than-expected July jobs report, which revealed a widely accurate recession indicator tied to a rise in the unemployment rate had been triggered, exacerbated fears that Fed policy may be too restrictive.

Subsequently, markets have quickly shifted to price in higher chances of more rate cuts this year. As of Monday morning, markets are pricing in a roughly 95% chance of a 50-basis-point interest rate cut by the end of the Fed's September meeting, up from a less than 12% chance a week prior, per the CME FedWatch Tool.

Still, some Wall Street strategists don't think the move in markets is a clean bet on a flailing US economy.

""I don't necessarily buy the fact that the market is voting that the economy is just weakening outright overnight,"" Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon told Yahoo Finance. ""I think it takes a little bit longer for us to get a sense of that.""

Story continues

Gordon notes that since the recent market highs in July, defensive sectors like Consumer Staples and Utilities have led the market, while the largest losses have been seen in Technology.

""The sector action is telling me that it's much more about selling the high flyers and making some profits ... It's not this outright collapse in the cyclical trade.""

To Gordon, the recent market reaction to the jobs report was in sync with sentiment shown by investors following Big Tech earnings. In both cases expectations were likely too upbeat compared to the actual data.

""It's a good reminder that this is really all about expectations and not necessarily about good versus bad when it comes to data,"" Gordon said.

On Monday, Big Tech remained the main culprit of the sell-off, with Nvidia (NVDA) sliding more than 6% while Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) were all off more than 3%.

Citi US equity strategist Drew Pettit agreed with Gordon that the market action is a continuation of a recent trend where investors take profits from the ""high flying"" tech stocks that led the market rally in 2023 and most of 2024, and move into other areas of the market that are less reliant on growth.

""This is kind of what you get when markets have a really aggressive run with not a lot of volatility,"" Pettit said. ""Everyone kind of gets on very similar trades. Everyone gets pulled up at the same time.""

He added, ""We're just working from a place where sentiment was really strong, growth expectations were really high, and we're calling that into question right now.""

For Pettit, that fundamental story for stocks to end the year higher than their current levels hasn't changed yet, he said.

"Nasdaq, S&P 500 end 2% higher in rally after US job.",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-hrtx/heron-therapeutics/news/investors-dont-see-light-at-end-of-heron-therapeutics-incs-n,"Heron Therapeutics, Inc. ( ) shareholders that were waiting for something to happen have been dealt a blow with a 32% share price drop in the last month. Longer-term, the stock has been solid despite a difficult 30 days, gaining 16% in the last year.

Since its price has dipped substantially, Heron Therapeutics may look like a strong buying opportunity at present with its price-to-sales (or ""P/S"") ratio of 2.2x, considering almost half of all companies in the Biotechs industry in the United States have P/S ratios greater than 11.1x and even P/S higher than 61x aren't out of the ordinary. However, the P/S might be quite low for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.

What Does Heron Therapeutics' P/S Mean For Shareholders?

Recent times haven't been great for Heron Therapeutics as its revenue has been rising slower than most other companies. Perhaps the market is expecting the current trend of poor revenue growth to continue, which has kept the P/S suppressed. If this is the case, then existing shareholders will probably struggle to get excited about the future direction of the share price.

What Are Revenue Growth Metrics Telling Us About The Low P/S?

Want the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our will help you uncover what's on the horizon.

The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/S as depressed as Heron Therapeutics' is when the company's growth is on track to lag the industry decidedly.

Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew revenue by an impressive 16% last year. Pleasingly, revenue has also lifted 64% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Therefore, it's fair to say the revenue growth recently has been superb for the company.

Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 20% each year as estimated by the four analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be materially lower than the 111% per year growth forecast for the broader industry.

With this in consideration, its clear as to why Heron Therapeutics' P/S is falling short industry peers. Apparently many shareholders weren't comfortable holding on while the company is potentially eyeing a less prosperous future.

The Key Takeaway

Having almost fallen off a cliff, Heron Therapeutics' share price has pulled its P/S way down as well. Using the price-to-sales ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.

As expected, our analysis of Heron Therapeutics' analyst forecasts confirms that the company's underwhelming revenue outlook is a major contributor to its low P/S. Shareholders' pessimism on the revenue prospects for the company seems to be the main contributor to the depressed P/S. Unless these conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.

You need to take note of risks, for example - (and 1 which is concerning) we think you should know about.

"Nasdaq, S&P 500 end 2% higher in rally after US job.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgdd0xvxd7o,"Is the US really heading for recession?

Experts say the main reason for this fear is that US jobs data for July , released on Friday, was much worse than expected.

The sudden turn comes as fears grow that the US economy - the world's biggest - is slowing down.

Trading screens across the US, Asia and, to a certain extent, Europe are awash with blinking red numbers heading south.

Over the past few days, global stock markets have been plummeting.

However, for some, talk of an economic slowdown - or even a (whisper it) recession - is a little premature.

So, what did the official figures show us? As always with economics, there is good news and bad news.

Bad news first. US employers created 114,000 jobs in July which was way below expectations of 175,000 new roles.

The rate of unemployment also rose to 4.3%, a near three-year high, which triggered something known as the ""Sahm rule"".

Named after American economist Claudia Sahm, the rule says if the average unemployment rate over three months is half a percentage point higher than the lowest level over the past 12 months then the country is at the beginning of a recession.

In this case, the US unemployment rate rose in July, so the three-month average was 4.1%. That compares to the lowest level over the last year which was 3.5%.

Adding to these concerns was the fact that the US Federal Reserve voted last week not to cut interest rates.

Other central banks within developed economies, including the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, have recently cut interest rates.

The Fed held borrowing costs but its chair, Jerome Powell, signalled that a cut in September was on the table.

However, this led to speculation that the Fed had waited too long to act.

A cut in interest rates means it is cheaper to borrow money which should, in theory, act as a boost to the economy.

If the jobs figures suggest that the economy is already tipping downwards, then the fear is the Fed is too late.

Then, on top of all this, are technology companies and their share prices. There has been a long-running rally in their shares, fuelled in part by optimism over artificial intelligence (AI).

Last week, the chip-making giant Intel announced it was cutting 15,000 jobs. At the same time, market rumours suggested that rival Nvidia may have to delay the release of its new AI chip.

What followed was a bloodbath on the Nasdaq, the technology-heavy US index. After hitting a high only a few weeks ago, it plunged by 10% on Friday.

That helped pump-up the fear factor across markets and that's where danger could lie.

If stock market panic continues and shares keep plunging the Fed could potentially step in before its next meeting in September and cut interest rates.

This could happen, according to Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, if there is ""a market dislocation that deepens and starts to threaten systemically important institutions and/or broader financial stability""."

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NASDAQ:NXPI).

Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.

Check out our latest analysis for NXP Semiconductors

How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?

Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for NXP Semiconductors is:

30% = US$2.8b ÷ US$9.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).

The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.30 in profit.

Does NXP Semiconductors Have A Good ROE?

By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, NXP Semiconductors has a better ROE than the average (15%) in the Semiconductor industry.

roe

That is a good sign. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . To know the 3 risks we have identified for NXP Semiconductors visit our risks dashboard for free.

Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROE

Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.

Combining NXP Semiconductors' Debt And Its 30% Return On Equity

NXP Semiconductors does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.09. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.

Story continues

Summary

Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.

Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.

Of course NXP Semiconductors may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.

( ) is a stock worth checking out, seeing as almost half of all the Transportation companies in the United States have P/S ratios greater than 1.4x and even P/S higher than 5x aren't out of the ordinary. However, the P/S might be low for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.

How Heartland Express Has Been Performing

Heartland Express could be doing better as its revenue has been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive revenue growth. It seems that many are expecting the poor revenue performance to persist, which has repressed the P/S ratio. If you still like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's out of favour.

What Are Revenue Growth Metrics Telling Us About The Low P/S?

If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our .

The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/S as low as Heartland Express' is when the company's growth is on track to lag the industry.

Taking a look back first, the company's revenue growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 12%. Even so, admirably revenue has lifted 79% in aggregate from three years ago, notwithstanding the last 12 months. Although it's been a bumpy ride, it's still fair to say the revenue growth recently has been more than adequate for the company.

Shifting to the future, estimates from the four analysts covering the company suggest revenue growth is heading into negative territory, declining 0.2% over the next year. Meanwhile, the broader industry is forecast to expand by 7.7%, which paints a poor picture.

With this in consideration, we find it intriguing that Heartland Express' P/S is closely matching its industry peers. However, shrinking revenues are unlikely to lead to a stable P/S over the longer term. There's potential for the P/S to fall to even lower levels if the company doesn't improve its top-line growth.

The Key Takeaway

We'd say the price-to-sales ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.

With revenue forecasts that are inferior to the rest of the industry, it's no surprise that Heartland Express' P/S is on the lower end of the spectrum. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in revenue isn't great enough to justify a higher P/S ratio. Unless there's material change, it's hard to envision a situation where the stock price will rise drastically.

Many other vital risk factors can be found on the company's balance sheet. Our with six simple checks will allow you to discover any risks that could be an issue.

Of course, profitable companies with a history of great earnings growth are generally safer bets. So you may wish to see this free

"Nasdaq, S&P 500 end 2% higher in rally after US job.",https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/trump-is-already-rattling-the-stock-market,"Former President Donald Trump has long regarded the stock market as a barometer for success, constantly touting record highs during his time in office and still bragging incessantly about the “beautiful” stock market on his watch.

However, what many commentators miss is not just the 40 record highs the stock market has hit under the Biden-Harris administration—but also that while Trump does hold significant sway over pockets of the stock market, much of his impact is profoundly negative, particularly for individual companies and industries that draw his ire.

Trump’s tantrums are nothing new

Stock price moves are rarely attributable to a single factor—but there is substantial evidence suggesting that Trump’s tantrums often appear to catalyze market dislocations, especially in the companies or sectors he targets politically.

For example, consider what happened after Trump attacked Taiwan’s semiconductor manufacturers, which account for ~90% of the world’s production, and questioned whether the U.S. should defend Taiwan militarily in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek. In the immediate aftermath, U.S.-founded Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) plummeted ~15%, and the broader semiconductor index plunged 10%. Charts clearly show that July 16—the date on which the Bloomberg Businessweek interview was published—was an unmistakable turning point.

In the same interview, Trump also aggressively took aim at large U.S. tech companies, exacerbating a tech sell-off, with the Nasdaq 100 falling by nearly 10% in the days after, erasing over $1.7 trillion in wealth.

Trump’s attacks on green/renewable/clean energy companies similarly sparked a rout in those specific sectors, with market commentators quipping, “Trump storm batters wind and solar stocks.”

The losses in market value from Trump’s attacks dwarf the few isolated pockets of the market that have benefited significantly from the prospect of a Trump win, in what some have dubbed the “Trump Trade”—sectors that have been heavily regulated under the Biden administration, such as private prisons, predatory lenders, and gun manufacturers. In any case, initial gains in these sectors in the days following Biden’s debate disaster and the assassination attempt on Trump have largely been reversed over the last couple of weeks.

Trump crashing the stocks of companies and industries he capriciously targets is not a new phenomenon. There’s a long trail of cases dating back to his first term, when his abrupt social media pronouncements, offhand remarks, or unexpected policy shifts sank the stocks of his unfortunate targets. After all, markets generally crave predictability—the antithesis of Trump’s modus operandi.

For example, Harley-Davidson dropped nearly 10% over two days in June 2018 after Trump abruptly tweeted threats to increase taxes on the company for supposedly outsourcing (which was later shown to be untrue).

Similarly, days into his first term, the stock of Delta Airlines dropped nearly 10% over the span of two days after bizarre Trump tweets implying that the airline was to blame for the botched implementation of Trump’s travel ban and associated long delays at airports.

In other instances, companies—and their investors—were hurt by Trump’s weaponization of government to punish political enemies and help political friends.

For example, when Trump took offense at CNN’s coverage of him, he seemingly retaliated by holding up the merger between CNN’s then-parent company, Time Warner, and AT&T, for two years, hurting both badly.

And it wasn’t just individual companies or sectors. Sometimes Trump rattled the entire market with his ravings. For instance, the S&P fell 4% in two days in 2019 after Trump suddenly tweeted that he would slap tariffs on $500 billion worth of imports from China. In another case, the market lost $500 billion in value in a single day after Trump, out of nowhere, attacked Fed Chairman Jay Powell.

A Barron’s study even found that the stock market tended to fall on days when the keywords “tariffs,” “Powell,” or “Fed” showed up in Trump’s tweets. Evidently, markets did not welcome Trump’s protectionist pivots or attempts to undermine the Fed’s independence. Another study by Merrill Lynch during Trump’s first term noted that days on which Trump tweeted a lot (in the 90th percentile, defined as more than 35 tweets) were associated with statistically significant negative stock market returns.

Perilous times for the stock market

As bad as turbulence has been, a second Trump term promises to be even more perilous for the stock market. He has promised 10% tariffs on all imports and picked a running mate known for pro-antitrust, anti-corporate rhetoric. At recent rallies, Trump has started attacking the record-high stock market as just making “rich people richer,” reflecting a level of hardcore economic populism that makes even the conservative Wall Street Journal’s Editorial Board shudder. In short, a second Trump term would likely be very different from the corporate-friendly deregulatory agenda that largely defined his first.

Most importantly, the ties between Trump and America’s CEOs have frayed badly—an ominous sign given Trump’s propensity to hold personal grudges. As Bloomberg Businessweek recently reported, “Trump is highly attuned to his standing with America’s corporate chieftains… he bristles when it’s pointed out to him that no Fortune 100 CEO has publicly contributed to his campaign, according to Jeffrey Sonnenfeld in the New York Times.”

The only silver lining is that the Trump Dump usually had only a passing impact, as the targets of his taunts rebounded quickly—with the multinational firms he’s attacked as “woke” even far outperforming the “alt-right” economy and “anti-woke” startups rallying around the MAGA agenda.

However, Trump is likely to carry out his anti-corporate vendettas more efficiently and ruthlessly if he wins a second term. As Businessweek noted, “Trump believes he understands the levers of power much more deeply now…saying, ’Now, I know everybody. Now, I am truly experienced’.”

Unfettered by electoral constraints and emboldened by an improbable comeback, second-term Trump would likely extract a far steeper price on the companies that find themselves in his crosshairs—and that cost will be borne by their unfortunate shareholders.

This kind of unchecked, personalized targeting of individual companies is more typical of foreign authoritarians than anything seen in our long history. And it is no coincidence that businesses have never prospered under capricious authoritarian regimes. As one prominent GOP-supporting CEO told me, “Businesses invest where there is the rule of law, not the law of rulers.”

Trump has often tried to bend individual stocks and sectors to his will by vindictively singling them out. Investors—and all Americans—should be concerned that all the evidence points to him going even further if he wins a second term."

Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Beyond Meat's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions

The top 25 shareholders own 45% of the company

along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a business

If you want to know who really controls Beyond Meat, Inc. ( ), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 48% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.

And institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 12% last week. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 66% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. Hence, if weakness in Beyond Meat's share price continues, institutional investors may feel compelled to sell the stock, which might not be ideal for individual investors.

Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Beyond Meat.

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Beyond Meat?

Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.

We can see that Beyond Meat does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Beyond Meat's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.

Beyond Meat is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Parkwood Corporation, Asset Management Arm with 8.3% of shares outstanding. With 8.2% and 7.0% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. Additionally, the company's CEO Ethan Brown directly holds 2.3% of the total shares outstanding.

A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.

While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.

Insider Ownership Of Beyond Meat

The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.

Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.

We can report that insiders do own shares in Beyond Meat, Inc.. In their own names, insiders own US$17m worth of stock in the US$363m company. Some would say this shows alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. But it might be worth checking

General Public Ownership

The general public-- including retail investors -- own 47% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

Next Steps:

It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Beyond Meat better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should learn about the .

Significant control over Star Bulk Carriers by individual investors implies that the general public has more power to influence management and governance-related decisions

The top 25 shareholders own 33% of the company



To get a sense of who is truly in control of Star Bulk Carriers Corp. ( ), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are individual investors with 58% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.

While institutions, who own 37% shares weren’t spared from last week’s US$166m market cap drop, individual investors as a group suffered the maximum losses

Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Star Bulk Carriers.

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Star Bulk Carriers?

Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.

Star Bulk Carriers already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Star Bulk Carriers, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.

Hedge funds don't have many shares in Star Bulk Carriers. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is AllianceBernstein L.P. with 4.7% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 4.6% and 3.5% of the stock. Petros Pappas, who is the third-largest shareholder, also happens to hold the title of Member of the Board of Directors.

On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.

While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.

Insider Ownership Of Star Bulk Carriers

The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.

Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.

We can see that insiders own shares in Star Bulk Carriers Corp.. This is a big company, so it is good to see this level of alignment. Insiders own US$84m worth of shares (at current prices). If you would like to explore the question of insider alignment, you can

General Public Ownership

The general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, collectively holds 58% of Star Bulk Carriers shares. This size of ownership gives investors from the general public some collective power. They can and probably do influence decisions on executive compensation, dividend policies and proposed business acquisitions.

Next Steps:

It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Star Bulk Carriers better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted you should be aware of.

( ) shareholders would be excited to see that the share price has had a great month, posting a 69% gain and recovering from prior weakness. Unfortunately, the gains of the last month did little to right the losses of the last year with the stock still down 17% over that time.

Even after such a large jump in price, Thoughtworks Holding may still be sending bullish signals at the moment with its price-to-sales (or ""P/S"") ratio of 1.4x, since almost half of all companies in the IT industry in the United States have P/S ratios greater than 1.9x and even P/S higher than 4x are not unusual. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/S at face value as there may be an explanation why it's limited.

How Thoughtworks Holding Has Been Performing

While the industry has experienced revenue growth lately, Thoughtworks Holding's revenue has gone into reverse gear, which is not great. It seems that many are expecting the poor revenue performance to persist, which has repressed the P/S ratio. If this is the case, then existing shareholders will probably struggle to get excited about the future direction of the share price.

Is There Any Revenue Growth Forecasted For Thoughtworks Holding?

Keen to find out how analysts think Thoughtworks Holding's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our .

The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/S as low as Thoughtworks Holding's is when the company's growth is on track to lag the industry.

Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 17% decrease to the company's top line. That put a dampener on the good run it was having over the longer-term as its three-year revenue growth is still a noteworthy 15% in total. Accordingly, while they would have preferred to keep the run going, shareholders would be roughly satisfied with the medium-term rates of revenue growth.

Turning to the outlook, the next year should generate growth of 1.0% as estimated by the eleven analysts watching the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the industry is forecast to expand by 8.5%, which is noticeably more attractive.

With this information, we can see why Thoughtworks Holding is trading at a P/S lower than the industry. It seems most investors are expecting to see limited future growth and are only willing to pay a reduced amount for the stock.

The Bottom Line On Thoughtworks Holding's P/S

The latest share price surge wasn't enough to lift Thoughtworks Holding's P/S close to the industry median. It's argued the price-to-sales ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.

As we suspected, our examination of Thoughtworks Holding's analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior revenue outlook is contributing to its low P/S. Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/S as they concede future revenue probably won't provide any pleasant surprises. It's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.

Don't forget that there may be other risks. For instance, we've identified that you should be aware of.

Of course, profitable companies with a history of great earnings growth are generally safer bets. So you may wish to see this free

"Nasdaq, S&P 500 end 2% higher in rally after US job.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-the-japanese-yen-is-pushing-around-the-us-stock-market-morning-brief-100053746.html,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:

The chart of the day

What we're watching

What we're reading

Economic data releases and earnings

Tuesday's gains left investors with two questions: ""Is the selling over?"" and ""When should I buy?""

Wall Street thinks the worst is over, but to truly wrap our heads around what's going on we must voyage overseas to Japan to study the so-called carry trade.

That's because the Japanese yen has found itself tightly correlated with US tech stocks — which have been powering the market this year.

Currencies fluctuate relative to each other largely based on interest rate differentials, haven flows during times of panic, and international trade.

Japan has been mired in a decades-long deflationary spiral, from which it is only now climbing out, and its rates have correspondingly hovered around the zero line for decades. As the world's last holdout with negative rates, it climbed into positive territory only this year when it hiked to 0.1% in March — then again last week to 0.25%.

Global Central Bank Policy Rates

Meanwhile, rates in the US have been north of 5% for a year and the European Central Bank sits just under 4%, having cut in June.

Out of this large gap, an entire cottage industry of investors emerged who borrow cheaply in Japan, then reinvest in higher-yielding assets elsewhere. It's called the carry trade.

Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, joined Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief show to break down the particulars.

""[A] lot of speculators went and borrowed in Japan at zero interest rates,"" said Yardeni, who explained that the borrowed yen was then converted into dollars and other currencies.

""The yen weakened, the dollar strengthened, and they took that money and invested it in assets around the world,"" he said.

Since 2010, this persistent selling pressure on the yen, combined with the corresponding bid on the US dollar, has made the dollar twice as valuable as the yen — a stupendously large move for a developed-world currency.

The crashing yen even led the Bank of Japan to intervene at times, but ultra-low rates encourage capital flight. And now that the BOJ is raising rates, the engines are reversing, along with the international money flows back into the yen.

Leverage and volatility act as masochistic siblings, feeding on each other during times of strife — wiping out pyramided positions. Movements that would normally take months occur in the span of a few days.

Story continues

Markets survived the first round of margin calls Monday and Tuesday, but bear markets don't occur overnight. When looking for clues about future direction, investors should also consider the backdrop in US markets.

In the back half of July, investor portfolios had already been subjected to a gut-wrenching rotation from megacaps into small caps and value sectors.

Throw in some recession fears stoked by softening US economic numbers along with a Fed chair with an index finger on the ""cut"" button, and investors themselves were quick to press ""sell.""

Wall Street is leaning toward a fairly quick resolution of the episode. Morgan Stanley's sales desk wrote to clients, ""We are closer to the end of the selling than to the beginning."" JPMorgan's co-head of FX strategy Arindam Sandilya believes we're 50% to 60% through the carry unwind as of Monday.

For his part, Yardeni sees the end a bit sooner: ""The unwind should be over by the end of the week.""

Institutions' substantial holdings in AbCellera Biologics implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price

The top 8 shareholders own 51% of the company

Insiders own 27% of AbCellera Biologics

A look at the shareholders of AbCellera Biologics Inc. (NASDAQ:ABCL) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 34% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.

And so it follows that institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$812m last week after a 12% drop in the share price. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 52% for shareholders. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. Hence, if weakness in AbCellera Biologics' share price continues, institutional investors may feel compelled to sell the stock, which might not be ideal for individual investors.

Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about AbCellera Biologics.

View our latest analysis for AbCellera Biologics

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About AbCellera Biologics?

Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.

We can see that AbCellera Biologics does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at AbCellera Biologics' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.

It looks like hedge funds own 9.4% of AbCellera Biologics shares. That worth noting, since hedge funds are often quite active investors, who may try to influence management. Many want to see value creation (and a higher share price) in the short term or medium term. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is the CEO Carl Hansen with 19% of shares outstanding. Baker Bros. Advisors LP is the second largest shareholder owning 9.4% of common stock, and Baillie Gifford & Co. holds about 7.5% of the company stock.

We did some more digging and found that 8 of the top shareholders account for roughly 51% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.

While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.

Insider Ownership Of AbCellera Biologics

The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.

Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.

It seems insiders own a significant proportion of AbCellera Biologics Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$812m, and insiders have US$216m worth of shares in their own names. It is great to see insiders so invested in the business. It might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying recently.

General Public Ownership

With a 30% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over AbCellera Biologics. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.

Next Steps:

While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for AbCellera Biologics you should know about.

But ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

( ) is definitely a stock worth checking out, seeing as almost half of all the Biotechs companies in the United States have P/S ratios greater than 11.3x and even P/S above 63x aren't out of the ordinary. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly reduced P/S.

What Does Coherus BioSciences' Recent Performance Look Like?

Recent times haven't been great for Coherus BioSciences as its revenue has been rising slower than most other companies. The P/S ratio is probably low because investors think this lacklustre revenue performance isn't going to get any better. If this is the case, then existing shareholders will probably struggle to get excited about the future direction of the share price.

Is There Any Revenue Growth Forecasted For Coherus BioSciences?

Keen to find out how analysts think Coherus BioSciences' future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our .

There's an inherent assumption that a company should far underperform the industry for P/S ratios like Coherus BioSciences' to be considered reasonable.

If we review the last year of revenue growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 65%. Despite this strong recent growth, it's still struggling to catch up as its three-year revenue frustratingly shrank by 32% overall. Therefore, it's fair to say the revenue growth recently has been undesirable for the company.

Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 13% per annum as estimated by the eight analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be materially lower than the 176% per year growth forecast for the broader industry.

With this information, we can see why Coherus BioSciences is trading at a P/S lower than the industry. Apparently many shareholders weren't comfortable holding on while the company is potentially eyeing a less prosperous future.

The Final Word

Typically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-sales ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.

As expected, our analysis of Coherus BioSciences' analyst forecasts confirms that the company's underwhelming revenue outlook is a major contributor to its low P/S. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in revenue isn't great enough to justify a higher P/S ratio. The company will need a change of fortune to justify the P/S rising higher in the future.

It is also worth noting that we have found (1 can't be ignored!) that you need to take into consideration.

Of course, profitable companies with a history of great earnings growth are generally safer bets. So you may wish to see this free

"Nasdaq, S&P 500 end 2% higher in rally after US job.",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-cvgi/commercial-vehicle-group/news/commercial-vehicle-group-incs-nasdaqcvgi-stock-has-shown-wea,"Commercial Vehicle Group (NASDAQ:CVGI) has had a rough three months with its share price down 16%. However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. In this article, we decided to focus on ROE.

Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.

How To Calculate Return On Equity?

The formula for ROE is:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Commercial Vehicle Group is:

25% = US$44m ÷ US$176m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).

The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.25.

What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?

So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.

Commercial Vehicle Group's Earnings Growth And 25% ROE

Firstly, we acknowledge that Commercial Vehicle Group has a significantly high ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 14% which is quite remarkable. Yet, Commercial Vehicle Group has posted measly growth of 4.5% over the past five years. That's a bit unexpected from a company which has such a high rate of return. Such a scenario is likely to take place when a company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.

Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Commercial Vehicle Group's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 11% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see.

Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is CVGI fairly valued? This has everything you need to know.

Is Commercial Vehicle Group Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?

Commercial Vehicle Group doesn't pay any regular dividends currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This doesn't explain the low earnings growth number that we discussed above. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.

Conclusion

On the whole, we do feel that Commercial Vehicle Group has some positive attributes. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

"Nasdaq, S&P 500 end 2% higher in rally after US job.",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-smci/super-micro-computer/news/what-you-can-learn-from-super-micro-computer-incs-nasdaqsmci,"Super Micro Computer, Inc. ( ) shareholders that were waiting for something to happen have been dealt a blow with a 27% share price drop in the last month. Looking at the bigger picture, even after this poor month the stock is up 78% in the last year.

In spite of the heavy fall in price, Super Micro Computer may still be sending very bearish signals at the moment with a price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 34.4x, since almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 17x and even P/E's lower than 10x are not unusual. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.

With its earnings growth in positive territory compared to the declining earnings of most other companies, Super Micro Computer has been doing quite well of late. It seems that many are expecting the company to continue defying the broader market adversity, which has increased investors’ willingness to pay up for the stock. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price.

Is There Enough Growth For Super Micro Computer?

Want the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our will help you uncover what's on the horizon.

Super Micro Computer's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.

If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 74%. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 915% overall rise in EPS, aided by its short-term performance. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.

Turning to the outlook, the next year should generate growth of 46% as estimated by the analysts watching the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 15%, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.

With this information, we can see why Super Micro Computer is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.

What We Can Learn From Super Micro Computer's P/E?

A significant share price dive has done very little to deflate Super Micro Computer's very lofty P/E. We'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.

We've established that Super Micro Computer maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.

It's always necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk. (at least 1 which is potentially serious), and understanding these should be part of your investment process.

Significantly high institutional ownership implies Walgreens Boots Alliance's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions

50% of the business is held by the top 12 shareholders

Using data from alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a company

Every investor in Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. ( ) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 59% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).

As a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by US$397m. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 59% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Also referred to as ""smart money"", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell Walgreens Boots Alliance which might hurt individual investors.

In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Walgreens Boots Alliance.

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Walgreens Boots Alliance?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.

Walgreens Boots Alliance already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Walgreens Boots Alliance, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.

Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Walgreens Boots Alliance is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is Newcip S.A., with ownership of 17%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 9.5% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.9% by the third-largest shareholder.

A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 12 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.

While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.

Insider Ownership Of Walgreens Boots Alliance

The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

Our information suggests that Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. We do note, however, it is possible insiders have an indirect interest through a private company or other corporate structure. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$41m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking

General Public Ownership

The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 24% stake in Walgreens Boots Alliance. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

Private Company Ownership

We can see that Private Companies own 17%, of the shares on issue. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.

Next Steps:

It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Walgreens Boots Alliance better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the .

But ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at .

NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated. This may not be consistent with full year annual report figures.

( ) looks to be giving off some buy signals with its 0.1x P/S ratio. However, the P/S might be low for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.

How Century Casinos Has Been Performing

Recent times have been advantageous for Century Casinos as its revenues have been rising faster than most other companies. One possibility is that the P/S ratio is low because investors think this strong revenue performance might be less impressive moving forward. If the company manages to stay the course, then investors should be rewarded with a share price that matches its revenue figures.

Do Revenue Forecasts Match The Low P/S Ratio?

If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our .

In order to justify its P/S ratio, Century Casinos would need to produce sluggish growth that's trailing the industry.

Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew revenue by an impressive 33% last year. The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow revenue by 100% in total over the last three years. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing revenue over that time.

Looking ahead now, revenue is anticipated to climb by 7.2% during the coming year according to the three analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the industry is forecast to expand by 13%, which is noticeably more attractive.

In light of this, it's understandable that Century Casinos' P/S sits below the majority of other companies. Apparently many shareholders weren't comfortable holding on while the company is potentially eyeing a less prosperous future.

What We Can Learn From Century Casinos' P/S?

While the price-to-sales ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of revenue expectations.

As we suspected, our examination of Century Casinos' analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior revenue outlook is contributing to its low P/S. Shareholders' pessimism on the revenue prospects for the company seems to be the main contributor to the depressed P/S. It's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.

Having said that, be aware in our investment analysis, you should know about.

"Nasdaq, S&P 500 end 2% higher in rally after US job.",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wall-street-warming-apple-stock-again-heres-why,"Cupertino-based tech titan Apple Inc. (AAPL) has long been a trailblazer in innovation, yet found itself lagging in the artificial intelligence (AI) race. As AI became the tech industry's buzzword, Apple's efforts seemed tepid compared to rivals like Microsoft (MSFT) who aggressively embraced this game-changing technology.

Plus, fiscal 2023 marked a rare setback for Apple, with negative revenue growth across all four quarters - a first since the pre-iPhone era of 2001. Meanwhile, its FAANG peers soared, rebounding as a group from the 2022 market crash and winning investor confidence. Faced with fierce competition in the smartphone space and a perceived AI shortfall, several high-profile analysts downgraded AAPL stock to start this year.

However, despite the initial skepticism, the tide is turning. Wall Street analysts are starting to warm up to Apple once again, with optimism on the rise toward the tech giant. Here's a look at what’s driving this renewed bullish sentiment.

About Apple Stock

Founded in 1976, Apple Inc. (AAPL) is the unrivaled leader in tech innovation. Commanding a staggering market cap of $3.5 trillion, this innovative powerhouse consistently redefines technology standards with its iconic products, such as the iPhone, iPad, Mac, AirPods, Apple Watch, and the revolutionary Apple Vision Pro.

In addition to its impressive array of tech products, Apple recently made its long-awaited foray into the AI landscape with ""Apple Intelligence."" This strategic move propelled the stock to unprecedented levels. The mega-cap stock soared to a new all-time high of $237.23 on July 15, fueled by bullish analyst notes over Apple's AI ambitions.

After starting the year as a significant underperformer among its Big Tech peers, AAPL stock is firmly back on positive ground on a YTD basis. The stock has now rallied 16.7% since the start of 2024, closing its performance gap with the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX).

With a decade-long streak of increasing dividends, the company remains committed to rewarding its shareholders. On May 16, the tech giant announced a 4% bump in its quarterly dividend to $0.25. Its annualized dividend of $1.00 offers a 0.44% dividend yield. Apple also announced a historic $110 billion share buyback plan alongside its Q2 earnings, setting a new record in the process.

From a valuation perspective, AAPL stock trades at 35.56 times forward earnings, roughly in line with Microsoft, but lower than other “Magnificent Seven” giants such as Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) and Amazon.com (AMZN).

Apple Beats Q2 Earnings Projections

Following the company’s fiscal Q2 earnings report after the close on May 2, which exceeded Wall Street’s predictions on both the top and bottom lines, Apple shares jumped almost 6% in the subsequent trading session. The tech giant reported revenue of $90.8 billion for the quarter, reflecting a 4.3% decrease from the same period last year, but slightly above the consensus estimate of $90.5 billion.

This continued revenue drop is largely due to a significant 10% year-over-year decline in iPhone sales, which indicates weakened demand for Apple's latest smartphone model, launched last September. During the quarter, the company posted EPS of $1.53, sailing past estimates by a 1.5% margin.

Reflecting on the Q2 performance, CFO Luca Maestri said, “Thanks to very high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty, our active installed base of devices has reached a new all-time high across all products and all geographic segments, and our business performance drove a new EPS record for the March quarter.”

Looking forward to Q3, management forecasts total revenue growth in the low single digits year over year, while the services business is expected to deliver double-digit revenue growth. The company is expected to report its fiscal Q3 earnings results on Thursday, August 1.

Analysts tracking Apple expect the company’s profit to reach $6.59 per share in fiscal 2024, up 7.5% year over year, and climb another 12.1% to $7.39 per share in fiscal 2025.

Apple's AI Breakthrough

On June 10, Apple joined the AI race by unveiling ""Apple Intelligence"" at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). This initiative integrates ChatGPT from OpenAI to bolster iPhone virtual assistant Siri's functionality, a significant step in Apple's bid to close the gap with AI frontrunners like Microsoft and Alphabet (GOOGL).

The upcoming software updates promise not only to revamp Siri with enhanced capabilities and a more engaging persona, but also to introduce creative tools such as real-time emoji creation, dubbed ""Genmojis.""

The consumer tech company’s move into on-device AI is closely watched, because analysts will be looking for the rollout to spark a much-needed uptick in iPhone sales when new models are launched - expected this September.

What Do Analysts Expect For Apple Stock?

Despite the skepticism surrounding AAPL stock initially this year, the company’s strategic announcement of an AI-enabled smartphone has significantly boosted analyst confidence in the stock. On July 15, Morgan Stanley (MS) listed the company as a ""top pick” and also raised its price target to $273.

According to the investment bank, Apple is set to embark on a record-breaking multi-year upgrade cycle fueled by the introduction of Apple Intelligence. Supported by the company’s AI endeavors, Morgan Stanley analysts foresee Apple potentially selling close to a whopping 500 million iPhones in the next two years.

Additionally, on the same day, Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah awarded Apple a “Buy” rating and set a price target of $300, marking a new Street-high target for the stock. The analyst sees Apple becoming the preferred hub for generative AI, echoing its historical prowess in capturing market trends with products like the iPhone and iPod.

Overall, AAPL stock has a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating. Of the 30 analysts covering the stock, 20 advise a “Strong Buy,” three say it’s a “Moderate Buy,” six have a “Hold” rating, and the remaining one recommends a “Strong Sell.”

This optimistic consensus marks a notable shift from three months ago, with the percentage of “Buy” or better ratings increasing from 66% then to 76% now.

Even though the stock currently trades nearly flat with its average analyst price target of $224.09, Loop Capital’s Street-high target of $300 suggests that AAPL could rally as much as 33.6% from current levels.

"Nasdaq, S&P 500 end 2% higher in rally after US job.",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/chipotle-stock-good-buy-after-its-50-1-split,"Would you believe me if I told you that a company that makes burritos and tasty Mexican-inspired bowls has outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 10 years?

Shares of fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) have absolutely trounced the broader market over the last decade.

After soaring 275% over the last 10 years, Chipotle finally decided to implement a 50-for-1 stock split last month. Although stock splits do not inherently change the market capitalization of a company, the lower share price is often perceived by investors as more affordable, thereby opening up trading activity to a broader base.

Let's take a look at how Chipotle stock has been moving since the split, and assess if now is a good time for investors to get in on the action.

How has Chipotle stock performed since the split?

Stock splits have a tendency to garner outsize attention from investors. In particular, momentum investors may enter a stock-split candidate right around the time of the split. This can cause the share price to rise sharply, only to witness a sell-off as day traders quickly exit their positions and book a quick profit.

The chart below illustrates this point nicely as it relates to Chipotle.

Chipotle's stock split is depicted in the chart above with the purple circle with the letter ""S"" in the middle.

You can see that just days before the split, shares of Chipotle suddenly rose -- hitting a price of $68.55. For what it's worth, that level was an all-time high for Chipotle stock.

Yet shortly thereafter, the stock experienced a brief sell-off prior the split and has subsequently continued to fall since the split went into effect on June 26.

While this might seem like Chipotle has lost some of its allure, I'd caution investors from such thinking.

A sizzling operation

One of the most important key performance indicators in the restaurant industry is same-store sales. Same-store sales is a measurement of how growth is trending in existing storefronts. This is important to analyze because it sheds light on the profitability of each location, and whether or not expansion opportunities are attainable.

The table below breaks down Chipotle's same-store sales over the last 12 months.

Metric Q3 2023 Q4 2023 Q1 2024 Q2 2024 Same-store sales growth 5% 8.4% 7% 11.1%

Seeing Chipotle's same-store sales consistently accelerate is an encouraging sign. Moreover, I think it's particularly impressive given some of the pressures the macroeconomy has endured over the last couple of years.

Despite nagging inflation and tighter consumer discretionary controls, Chipotle has found ways to continue resonating with its customers and build loyal brand equity.

While same-store sales is an important metric to look at, it's only one piece to the puzzle. The bigger idea behind accelerating same-store sales is that it helps Chipotle achieve better unit economics from a margin perspective.

As depicted above, Chipotle has been able to recognize significant growth in its operating income and gross profit margin over the last several years.

This is a great sign, as margin expansion and growing profitability allow Chipotle to invest in new, innovative products and services to help make its restaurants even more efficient and build further brand loyalty.

A premium valuation well worth the price

One of the challenging aspects when analyzing Chipotle is its valuation. As seen in the trading patterns above, Chipotle is a growth stock and can experience outsize volatility.

Moreover, you can see in the chart above that the stock has witnessed particular expansion in its valuation multiples in just the last year. With a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 48.9, shares of Chipotle are indeed a bit pricey.

With that said, the recent sell-off since the split presents an interesting buying opportunity right now.

Furthermore, considering Chipotle showcased yet again in its second-quarter earnings that its business is thriving, I see the current dip in Chipotle stock as a great opportunity for long-term investors to take advantage of some depressed price action and scoop up some shares.

Don’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity

On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:

"Nasdaq, S&P 500 end 2% higher in rally after US job.",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nasdaq-mrtn/marten-transport/news/marten-transport-ltds-nasdaqmrtn-stock-has-shown-weakness-la,"It is hard to get excited after looking at Marten Transport's (NASDAQ:MRTN) recent performance, when its stock has declined 7.6% over the past week. However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. In this article, we decided to focus on ROE.

Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.

How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?

Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Marten Transport is:

5.7% = US$44m ÷ US$767m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).

The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.06 in profit.

Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?

We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.

A Side By Side comparison of Marten Transport's Earnings Growth And 5.7% ROE

When you first look at it, Marten Transport's ROE doesn't look that attractive. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 14% either. However, the moderate 5.1% net income growth seen by Marten Transport over the past five years is definitely a positive. So, the growth in the company's earnings could probably have been caused by other variables. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.

As a next step, we compared Marten Transport's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 14% in the same period.

The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Marten Transport fairly valued compared to other companies? These might help you decide.

Is Marten Transport Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?

Marten Transport's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 18% (implying that it retains 82% of its income), which is on the lower side, so it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business.

Additionally, Marten Transport has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders.

Summary

Overall, we feel that Marten Transport certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Specifically, its fairly high earnings growth number, which no doubt was backed by the company's high earnings retention. Still, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping a lot of benefit to the investors. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

"Nasdaq, S&P 500 end 2% higher in rally after US job.",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-algm/allegro-microsystems/news/allegro-microsystems-incs-nasdaqalgm-30-cheaper-price-remain,"The Allegro MicroSystems, Inc. ( ) share price has fared very poorly over the last month, falling by a substantial 30%. Instead of being rewarded, shareholders who have already held through the last twelve months are now sitting on a 49% share price drop.

Even after such a large drop in price, Allegro MicroSystems' price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 63.2x might still make it look like a strong sell right now compared to the market in the United States, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios below 16x and even P/E's below 10x are quite common. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.

With earnings that are retreating more than the market's of late, Allegro MicroSystems has been very sluggish. It might be that many expect the dismal earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. If not, then existing shareholders may be very nervous about the viability of the share price.

Does Growth Match The High P/E?

Keen to find out how analysts think Allegro MicroSystems' future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our .

In order to justify its P/E ratio, Allegro MicroSystems would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.

Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 69% decrease to the company's bottom line. This has soured the latest three-year period, which nevertheless managed to deliver a decent 6.6% overall rise in EPS. So we can start by confirming that the company has generally done a good job of growing earnings over that time, even though it had some hiccups along the way.

Shifting to the future, estimates from the six analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 41% per year over the next three years. With the market only predicted to deliver 10% each year, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.

With this information, we can see why Allegro MicroSystems is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.

The Key Takeaway

Allegro MicroSystems' shares may have retreated, but its P/E is still flying high. Using the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.

We've established that Allegro MicroSystems maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.

We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find that you need to be mindful of.

Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Mitek Systems' stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions

The top 14 shareholders own 51% of the company



If you want to know who really controls Mitek Systems, Inc. ( ), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 68% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).

And so it follows that institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$538m last week after a 18% drop in the share price. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 5.7% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Mitek Systems, which might have negative implications on individual investors.

In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Mitek Systems.

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Mitek Systems?

Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.

We can see that Mitek Systems does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Mitek Systems, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.

Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. It looks like hedge funds own 6.1% of Mitek Systems shares. That's interesting, because hedge funds can be quite active and activist. Many look for medium term catalysts that will drive the share price higher. Our data shows that BlackRock, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 7.8% of shares outstanding. With 7.5% and 6.1% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and Blue Grotto Capital, LLC are the second and third largest shareholders.

After doing some more digging, we found that the top 14 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.

While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.

Insider Ownership Of Mitek Systems

The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.

Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.

We can see that insiders own shares in Mitek Systems, Inc.. In their own names, insiders own US$13m worth of stock in the US$538m company. Some would say this shows alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. But it might be worth checking

General Public Ownership

The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 24% stake in Mitek Systems. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.

While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified that you should be aware of.

Downbeat forecasts from Amazon and Intel hit the pricey Big Tech valuations—richly valued technology firms—exacerbating a selloff that brought the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index into correction territory. The cooler-than-expected jobs data stoked fears among traders that the US could be heading towards recession.

An index or stock is considered to be in a correction when it closes 10 per cent or more below its previous record closing high. The S&P 500 was down 2.5 per cent in midday trading, on pace for its worst day since 2022 and its first back-to-back loss of over one per cent since April. The Nasdaq slumped over 10 per cent from its July peak as a sell-off for stocks whipped worldwide back to Wall Street.

Bears grip Wall Street over recession fears after US weak jobs data A report showing hiring by US employers slowed last month by much more than economists expected sent fear through markets. It followed a batch of weaker-than-expected reports on the economy from a day earlier, including a worsening in US manufacturing activity, which has been one of the areas hurt most by high rates.

According to the jobs data, 114,000 US jobs were added in July, well below estimates, and the unemployment rate unexpectedly climbed for a fourth month to 4.3 per cent, renewing concerns that the economy is slowing. This follows Thursday's data showing that US manufacturing activity shrank by the most in July in eight months.

Earlier this week, US Federal Reserve officials signalled that they are on course to cut rates in September, and the readings prompted traders to ramp up policy-easing bets. The S&P 500 hit its lowest level since June 5, and the index, along with the blue-chip Dow, is on track for its biggest two-day slides in nearly two years.

MSCI's global stock gauge MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe fell 2.26 per cent to 785.26. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 569.93 points, or 1.41 per cent, to 39,778.04, the S&P 500 lost 119.44 points, or 2.19 per cent, to 5,327.24 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 560.79 points, or 3.26 per cent, to 16,633.36.

According to a Reuters analysis of LSEG data, over the last 44 years, the index has slipped into correction territory after hitting a new high 24 times, or about once every two years. The Nasdaq is still up 12 per cent year-to-date. The S&P 500 has lost about six per cent from its high and is also up 12 per cent this year.

The Nasdaq's tumble comes as investors turn more wary of the highly valued tech stocks that have led the charge higher for most of the year, driven by excitement over the potential of artificial intelligence (AI).

Lacklustre results from Tesla and Alphabet last month compounded worries about stretched valuations. At the same time, there may be concern that weaker-than-expected results reflect a broader softness in the economy.

Treasury yields fell sharply in the bond market as traders raised their expectations for how deeply the US Federal Reserve would have to cut interest rates. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 3.81 per cent from 3.98 per cent late Thursday and from 4.70 per cent in April.



US stocks today Amazon.com fell nine per cent on slow online sales growth in the second quarter as cautious consumers sought cheaper purchase options. Intel crashed 27 per cent after forecasting third-quarter revenue below estimates and suspending its dividend starting in the fourth quarter. Intel also announced it would cut more than 15 per cent of its workforce while reporting a $1.6 billion quarterly loss.

Other chip stocks were also set to extend Thursday's losses. Nvidia and Broadcom lost two per cent each, while Micron Technology and Arm Holdings were down around seven per cent each. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index hit a three-month low, set for its biggest two-day slide since March 2020.

Bucking the negative trend in megacaps, Apple rose 2.3 per cent after posting better-than-expected third-quarter iPhone sales and forecasting more gains, betting on AI to attract buyers. Chevron Corp fell 3.5 per cent after the oil giant missed estimates for second-quarter profit.

Major US banks also fell for the second straight day on recession concerns, with the S&P 500 Financials and Banks indexes losing three per cent and 4.7 per cent, respectively. Among other movers, Snap declined 24.7 per cent after forecasting current-quarter results below expectations.

The small-cap Russell 2000 index slumped four per cent to hit a nearly one-month low and was set for its biggest two-day slide since June 2022. Wall Street's ""fear gauge"", or VIX index, breached the long-term average of 20 points to hit its highest mark since last March.

Europe, Asia markets European stocks extended their slide after the jobs data exacerbated a rout in tech shares. The Stoxx 600 Index ended the session 2.7 per cent lower, the most in over a year. Investors took shelter in defensive stocks, with utilities and some pharmaceuticals, including AstraZeneca Plc and Sanofi SA, outperforming.

Emerging market stocks fell 23.92 points, or 2.20 per cent, to 1,063.88. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 2.27 per cent lower, at 554.93. In Asia, where markets closed before the US jobs data, Tokyo led losses. Nikkei 225 tanked 5.8 per cent—its biggest drop since the start of the pandemic four years ago—owing to a stronger yen, which hit Japan's key export sector.

The Bank of Japan (BoJ)'s decision to hike interest rates for the second time in 17 years—and talk of another to come—strengthened the yen to its best level since March. Hong Kong and Sydney were off more than two per cent, Seoul gave up more than three per cent, and Taipei shed more than four per cent, with losses also in Shanghai, Mumbai, and Singapore.



Bullion, crude oil prices Gold prices hit their highest in over two weeks on Friday as Treasury yields, and the US dollar declined after data showed the U.S. economy created fewer jobs than expected in July. The data boosted hopes of the Federal Reserve's rate cuts this year.

Spot gold was up over one per cent at $2,472.59 per ounce, just $11 shy of the record peak of $2,483.60 scaled on July 17. US gold futures climbed 1.4 per cent to $2,516.50. Gold has gained 3.2 per cent so far this week, on track for its best week since April, as rising safe-haven demand from Middle East tensions and expectations of rate cuts made the metal more appealing for investors."
"Nasdaq, S&P 500 end 2% higher in rally after US job.",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/automobiles/nasdaq-mbly/mobileye-global/news/why-were-not-concerned-yet-about-mobileye-global-incs-nasdaq,"Mobileye Global Inc. ( ) shareholders that were waiting for something to happen have been dealt a blow with a 43% share price drop in the last month. For any long-term shareholders, the last month ends a year to forget by locking in a 59% share price decline.

Although its price has dipped substantially, you could still be forgiven for thinking Mobileye Global is a stock to steer clear of with a price-to-sales ratios (or ""P/S"") of 7x, considering almost half the companies in the United States' Auto Components industry have P/S ratios below 0.7x. However, the P/S might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.

What Does Mobileye Global's Recent Performance Look Like?

Mobileye Global could be doing better as its revenue has been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive revenue growth. One possibility is that the P/S ratio is high because investors think this poor revenue performance will turn the corner. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason.

Is There Enough Revenue Growth Forecasted For Mobileye Global?

Want the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our will help you uncover what's on the horizon.

In order to justify its P/S ratio, Mobileye Global would need to produce outstanding growth that's well in excess of the industry.

Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 4.3% decrease to the company's top line. Still, the latest three year period has seen an excellent 33% overall rise in revenue, in spite of its unsatisfying short-term performance. Although it's been a bumpy ride, it's still fair to say the revenue growth recently has been more than adequate for the company.

Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 29% per year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the industry is forecast to only expand by 17% per annum, which is noticeably less attractive.

In light of this, it's understandable that Mobileye Global's P/S sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.

The Final Word

A significant share price dive has done very little to deflate Mobileye Global's very lofty P/S. Using the price-to-sales ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.

As we suspected, our examination of Mobileye Global's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior revenue outlook is contributing to its high P/S. It appears that shareholders are confident in the company's future revenues, which is propping up the P/S. Unless the analysts have really missed the mark, these strong revenue forecasts should keep the share price buoyant.

Having said that, be aware in our investment analysis, you should know about.

Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Savara's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions

A total of 8 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership

along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a business

A look at the shareholders of Savara Inc. ( ) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 49% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).

No shareholder likes losing money on their investments, especially institutional investors who saw their holdings drop 10.0% in value last week. However, the 8.2% one-year returns may have helped alleviate their overall losses. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future.

Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Savara.

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Savara?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.

As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Savara. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Savara, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.

Our data indicates that hedge funds own 5.0% of Savara. That catches my attention because hedge funds sometimes try to influence management, or bring about changes that will create near term value for shareholders. Our data shows that New Enterprise Associates, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 15% of shares outstanding. With 6.1% and 6.0% of the shares outstanding respectively, TCG Crossover Management, LLC and PGIM, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.

On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 8 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.

While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.

Insider Ownership Of Savara

The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

We can report that insiders do own shares in Savara Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$684m, and insiders have US$13m worth of shares, in their own names. This shows at least some alignment. You can

General Public Ownership

The general public-- including retail investors -- own 20% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.

Private Equity Ownership

With a stake of 21%, private equity firms could influence the Savara board. Some investors might be encouraged by this, since private equity are sometimes able to encourage strategies that help the market see the value in the company. Alternatively, those holders might be exiting the investment after taking it public.

Next Steps:

I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) that you should be aware of before investing here.

Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Cullinan Therapeutics' stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions

A total of 11 investors have a majority stake in the company with 52% ownership

Ownership research along with help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock

To get a sense of who is truly in control of Cullinan Therapeutics, Inc. ( ), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 44% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).

No shareholder likes losing money on their investments, especially institutional investors who saw their holdings drop 9.6% in value last week. Still, the 64% one-year gains may have helped mitigate their overall losses. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future.

Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Cullinan Therapeutics, beginning with the chart below.

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Cullinan Therapeutics?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.

Cullinan Therapeutics already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Cullinan Therapeutics, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.

It would appear that 25% of Cullinan Therapeutics shares are controlled by hedge funds. That worth noting, since hedge funds are often quite active investors, who may try to influence management. Many want to see value creation (and a higher share price) in the short term or medium term. BioImpact Capital LLC is currently the company's largest shareholder with 13% of shares outstanding. Deerfield Management Company, L.P. Series C is the second largest shareholder owning 5.7% of common stock, and BVF Partners L.P. holds about 5.5% of the company stock.

Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 52% of the ownership is controlled by the top 11 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.

Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.

We can see that insiders own shares in Cullinan Therapeutics, Inc.. This is a big company, so it is good to see this level of alignment. Insiders own US$46m worth of shares (at current prices). If you would like to explore the question of insider alignment, you can

General Public Ownership

The general public-- including retail investors -- own 21% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.

Private Equity Ownership

With an ownership of 5.1%, private equity firms are in a position to play a role in shaping corporate strategy with a focus on value creation. Some investors might be encouraged by this, since private equity are sometimes able to encourage strategies that help the market see the value in the company. Alternatively, those holders might be exiting the investment after taking it public.

Next Steps:

While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

"Nasdaq, S&P 500 end 2% higher in rally after US job.",https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/us-jobs-report-july-markets/index.html,"A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on August 1. Jeenah Moon/Getty Images

After a much-worse-than-expected jobs report Friday, the dominant emotion on Wall Street has been fear.

CNN Business’ Fear & Greed Index, a measure of market sentiment, fell to 26 — close to “Extreme Fear.” It was in “Neutral” territory just one week ago.

To be certain, Friday’s jobs report was bad news for the US economy. But it’s not that bad, economists and analysts say: The US economy remains strong. The market reaction (the Dow tumbled more than 900 points at one point) may be overdone.

“It feels a little panicky,” Truist’s Keith Lerner said. “The market has a lot of things to digest at once. And that makes it hard to get confidence.”

Risks of a recession are rising, said Moody’s Mark Zandi, but he still believes the odds remain low. He said the Federal Reserve may have to consider a half-point rate cut at its next policy meeting, in September, to ensure the economy gets into better shape.

“I do feel like this economy will be able to navigate through this, but it’s going to be close,” Zandi said. “They’ve got to get moving here.”

Bank of America economist Michael Gapen agreed, saying a so-called soft landing — in which inflation slows without throwing the economy into a recession — remains the most likely outcome.

“There’s a very good chance we can get a soft landing out of this,” Gapen said."

Crown Crafts will host its Annual General Meeting on 13th of August

Salary of US$400.0k is part of CEO Olivia Elliott's total remuneration

Total compensation is 58% below industry average

while total shareholder loss over the past three years was 17%

Shareholders may be wondering what CEO Olivia Elliott plans to do to improve the less than great performance at Crown Crafts, Inc. ( ) recently. At the next AGM coming up on 13th of August, they can influence managerial decision making through voting on resolutions, including executive remuneration. Setting appropriate executive remuneration to align with the interests of shareholders may also be a way to influence the company performance in the long run. In our opinion, CEO compensation does not look excessive and we discuss why.

Comparing Crown Crafts, Inc.'s CEO Compensation With The Industry

At the time of writing, our data shows that Crown Crafts, Inc. has a market capitalization of US$49m, and reported total annual CEO compensation of US$431k for the year to March 2024. That's a notable decrease of 25% on last year. Notably, the salary which is US$400.0k, represents most of the total compensation being paid.

For comparison, other companies in the with market capitalizations below US$200m, reported a median total CEO compensation of US$1.0m. Accordingly, Crown Crafts pays its CEO under the industry median. Moreover, Olivia Elliott also holds US$858k worth of Crown Crafts stock directly under their own name.

Component 2024 2023 Proportion (2024) Salary US$400k US$400k 93% Other US$31k US$174k 7% Total Compensation US$431k US$574k 100%

Speaking on an industry level, nearly 21% of total compensation represents salary, while the remainder of 79% is other remuneration. According to our research, Crown Crafts has allocated a higher percentage of pay to salary in comparison to the wider industry. If salary is the major component in total compensation, it suggests that the CEO receives a higher fixed proportion of the total compensation, regardless of performance.

Crown Crafts, Inc.'s Growth

Over the last three years, Crown Crafts, Inc. has shrunk its earnings per share by 7.5% per year. In the last year, its revenue is up 17%.

Investors would be a bit wary of companies that have lower EPS But in contrast the revenue growth is strong, suggesting future potential for EPS growth. In conclusion we can't form a strong opinion about business performance yet; but it's one worth watching. We don't have analyst forecasts, but you could get a better understanding of its growth by checking out of earnings, revenue and cash flow.

Has Crown Crafts, Inc. Been A Good Investment?

With a three year total loss of 17% for the shareholders, Crown Crafts, Inc. would certainly have some dissatisfied shareholders. So shareholders would probably want the company to be less generous with CEO compensation.

In Summary...

The loss to shareholders over the past three years is certainly concerning. The downward trend in share price performance may be attributable to the the fact that earnings growth has gone backwards. The upcoming AGM will provide shareholders the opportunity to raise their concerns and evaluate if the board’s judgement and decision-making is aligned with their expectations.

CEO compensation is an important area to keep your eyes on, but we've also need to pay attention to other attributes of the company. In our study, we found you should be aware of, and 1 of them doesn't sit too well with us.

Arguably, business quality is much more important than CEO compensation levels. So check out this free

Since Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.

The much-feared correction in mega-cap tech stocks is here as investors keep pulling out of AI winners to pile into small-cap stocks as possible rate cuts from the Federal Reserve near. Brent Thill, Jefferies tech research analyst, recently said while talking to CNBC that we are seeing a rotation inside the tech industry where semiconductor and internet companies are performing well while software companies are underperforming. However, Thill reiterated his view that in the back half of the year things will start to change and tech companies will start their rebound. The analyst cited a few software earnings that suggest no signs of “demand cracks.” He said that many semiconductor stocks are now in the overbought territory.

Brent Thill said the selloff has made software stocks more “attractive.”

But Thill also sees a broader rotation ongoing in the stock market, where sectors like financials and industrials are benefitting amid investor exodus from tech.

Asked what is causing a sudden rebound in small-cap stocks, Thill said that interest rate cut expectations and a broader rotation out of mega-cap stocks have a role to play here, in addition to the M&A activity which has increased significantly recently.

Thill thinks the AI “payoff” time is still years away and companies are still at the beginning of the AI spending curve.

For this article we compiled the biggest AI news updates and analyst rating upgrades/downgrades around AI stocks over the past few days. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Is Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Among the Top 10 Latest AI Stock News and Analyst Ratings?

Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 293

Brent Thill, Jefferies tech research analyst, while talking on CNBC about AI companies, said that of all AI companies, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is best positioned to begin monetizing AI. The analyst thinks companies are still “years” away from making money from AI.

“The ramp really begins in 2025, 2026. Microsoft is leading that pack. We think they are in a phenomenal position. It could be a low single-digit percent of their total revenue stream this year and grow going forward,” Thill said.

Story continues

Thill also said in a separate interview that Microsoft is in “great shape” with its “Copilot strategy” for the back half of 2024.

Dan Ives of Wedbush also believes MSFT is one of the leaders in the AI enterprise segment.

New Street Research started covering the stock with a Buy rating. The firm said that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is well positioned to grow profit in the “low teens for years to come” even if the AI revolution fails to pan out. New Street Research has a $570 price target on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).

Analysts believe Microsoft Corp’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) AI ecosystem around its products would strengthen its Cloud division thanks to Microsoft Corp’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) integration of AI into its Cloud products.

Microsoft Corp’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) huge investments to revive its Search business are also working. Bing’s market share has jumped to 3.64% as of April 2024, a 0.88 points gain on a YoY basis.

Wall Street expects Microsoft Corp’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) earnings to grow 12.50% next year. The stock’s forward P/E of 31 based on 2025 EPS makes it look attractive at the current levels.

Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:

“The top absolute contributors were Alphabet, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon. Microsoft was another top absolute contributor in the quarter, speaking to a growing appreciation for all the ways the company has an opportunity to monetize GenAI, be it in its Office suite or Azure cloud business. In the latter case, it contributed 7% to Azure’s revenue growth in the most recent quarter. We believe Microsoft remains a highly advantaged business with many secular tailwinds driving durable growth for the foreseeable future, even at its immense scale.”

Overall, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Latest AI Stock News and Analyst Ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

( ) may be sending bullish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios greater than 18x and even P/E's higher than 32x are not unusual. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the reduced P/E.

With earnings that are retreating more than the market's of late, Jack in the Box has been very sluggish. It seems that many are expecting the dismal earnings performance to persist, which has repressed the P/E. If you still like the company, you'd want its earnings trajectory to turn around before making any decisions. Or at the very least, you'd be hoping the earnings slide doesn't get any worse if your plan is to pick up some stock while it's out of favour.

Is There Any Growth For Jack in the Box?

If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our .

The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as low as Jack in the Box's is when the company's growth is on track to lag the market.

Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 19%. As a result, earnings from three years ago have also fallen 14% overall. Accordingly, shareholders would have felt downbeat about the medium-term rates of earnings growth.

Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 17% each year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 10% per annum growth forecast for the broader market.

With this information, we find it odd that Jack in the Box is trading at a P/E lower than the market. Apparently some shareholders are doubtful of the forecasts and have been accepting significantly lower selling prices.

The Final Word

We'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.

We've established that Jack in the Box currently trades on a much lower than expected P/E since its forecast growth is higher than the wider market. There could be some major unobserved threats to earnings preventing the P/E ratio from matching the positive outlook. At least price risks look to be very low, but investors seem to think future earnings could see a lot of volatility.

Before you settle on your opinion, we've discovered (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) that you should be aware of.

But if you pay close attention, you might find that its key financial indicators look quite decent, which could mean that the stock could potentially rise in the long-term given how markets usually reward more resilient long-term fundamentals. In this article, we decided to focus on ROE.

ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.

How To Calculate Return On Equity?

ROE can be calculated by using the formula:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Allient is:

9.2% = US$25m ÷ US$267m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).

The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.09 in profit.

Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?

So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.

Allient's Earnings Growth And 9.2% ROE

On the face of it, Allient's ROE is not much to talk about. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 12%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. Allient was still able to see a decent net income growth of 7.9% over the past five years. So, the growth in the company's earnings could probably have been caused by other variables. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.

Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Allient's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 13% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see.

Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. If you're wondering about Allient's's valuation, check out , as compared to its industry.

Is Allient Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?

Allient's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 7.4% (implying that it retains 93% of its income), which is on the lower side, so it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business.

Besides, Allient has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders.

Conclusion

In total, it does look like Allient has some positive aspects to its business. Specifically, its fairly high earnings growth number, which no doubt was backed by the company's high earnings retention. Still, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping a lot of benefit to the investors. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Wall Street extended a pattern of money rotating into small caps and out of the megacap “safety” since last week’s soft inflation data. Over the past four sessions, the Russell 2000 has beaten the Nasdaq 100 by almost 12 percentage points — a feat not seen since 2011. An equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 — where the likes of Nvidia Corp. carry the same heft as Dollar Tree Inc. — outpaced the US equity benchmark. That index is less sensitive to gains from the biggest companies — providing a glimpse of hope the rally will broaden out."
"Nasdaq, S&P 500 end 2% higher in rally after US job.",https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT/,"Summer Shakeout amid Positive EPS Season The stock market in mid- to late-July experienced its worst stretch of the year, including its worst week since 2022. The strong start to the month sent the S&P 500 and the other major indices to all-time highs. Even following the late-month selloff, stocks entered the final partial trading week of July barely changed for the month. The stasis in the market is consistent with ongoing uncertainty. The nature of the presidential election changed dramatically over the past month. The Fed appears to be teeing up 50 basis points (bps) or possibly even 75 bps of rate cuts by the end of the year. However, no cuts appear likely until mid-September, leaving investors dangling. Consumers too are waiting for rate cuts, whether they know it or not, because a lower fed funds rate is the linchpin to getting the overall interest rate environment down from its multi-year peak. Amid the uncertainty, the second-quarter earnings season mostly has been a bright spot. While good past-quarter earnings are always important, investors hold their breaths regarding current-quarter outlooks. Companies have generally reaffirmed the moderately positive outlook for the full year, which is still trending toward high single-digit to low double-digit EPS growth for 2024. Up and Down in July The S&P 500, which came into mid-year up 14.5% for 2024, piled on an additional 3.8% in the first half of July. The index was up 18.8% for the year at its all-time closing peak of 5,667 on 7/16/24. By 7/19/24, the S&P 500 had shed over 100 points. And by 7/25/24, the index had lost more than 260 points from its all-time high, to close at 5,399. Given the strong start to the month, followed by equally strong selling, the S&P 500 entered the final partial trading week of July up 14.4% for the year - barely budged from where it stood at mid-year. The Trump assassination attempt and the switch in Democratic presidential contenders occurred in the space of two weekends. However, rather than point to political upheaval, most investors attributed the July selling to a much-needed correction in extremely overbought names in the Information Technology and Communication Services sectors. While some wealth flowed out of all equities in the late-July period, much of the proceeds from tech stock redemptions flowed into other sectors. With three trading days remaining in the month as of 7/26/24, Information Technology (IYW) was down 4% for the month of July; and Communication Services (XLC) was down just under 2%. Where did the money go? Lots flowed into the Financial sector (IYF), which was up 7% for the month. Upcoming cuts in the fed funds rate will pinch banks' net interest margins. However, the 2Q earnings season for the sector has been highly positive, featuring significant recovery in fee-based businesses such as investment banking. Those upcoming lower interest rates can also be expected to rekindle loan and mortgage growth, which have been an ongoing negative amid generally positive bank earnings results. Other winning sectors in July include Industrials (IYJ), up 4.5%; Utilities (IDU), up 3.3%; Healthcare, up 2.9%; Consumer Staples, up 2.5%; and Materials, up 2.4%. Most of these sectors rose with the market early in the month and then were able to hold onto their gains on generally positive second-quarter earnings results. As we prepared this report, the market on 7/29/24 was oscillating, rising in the morning on earnings optimism toward traditional growth leaders and then selling off by midday on fears those companies would disappoint. The market response to upcoming earnings and other major non-technology companies could determine not just the July outcome, but also the market's performance in August and into summer-end. Second-Quarter Earnings Season The above-cited July 29-through-August 2 period will be the biggest week in 2Q24 EPS season, with about one-third of S&P 500 components companies reporting results. We will be sure to weigh in on the biggest earnings week, which culminates with equally big economic news, the nonfarm payrolls for July on 8/2/24. In the interim, and based on 2Q24 EPS data through 7/26/24, the second-quarter earnings season has been a success so far. With just over 180 companies (36%) of S&P 500 component companies reporting, second-quarter 2024 earnings from continuing operations are up 9.1% on a share-weighted basis compared with 2Q23 EPS. According to Bloomberg, 2Q24 earnings are up 14.8% on a market-cap-weighted basis. This premium of market-cap-weighted to share-weighted EPS growth is consistent with recent quarters and is reflective of the earnings outperformance of the largest capitalization companies compared with small and mid-caps. According to the other earnings compiling agencies, FactSet reports 9.8% earnings growth for 2Q24 as of 7/26/24; and Refinitiv is reporting 12% earnings growth. Variation in performance measurements among FactSet, Refinitiv and Bloomberg reflect minor differences in calculating continuing operations earnings as well as different prior-year baselines. For the remainder of our 2Q earnings report card, we will mainly source Bloomberg data unless otherwise noted. An unusually high percentage of companies (31%) have reported negative earnings for 2Q24. The average EPS decline for the negative-earnings group, which is heavily weighted in Energy, Materials, and Real Estate, is 16%. For the 69% of companies reporting positive EPS, average earnings growth is a robust 22%. A key reason investors are optimistic about second-half 2024 earnings growth is that the negative drag from Energy, Materials, and Real Estate is expected to diminish in 3Q24 and particularly in 4Q24. About 79% of companies have reported positive EPS surprises in 2Q24, compared with (again) a high 14% of companies reporting negative surprises. According to FactSet, 78% of companies have reported positive EPS surprises. These percentage are above the 10-year average of 74%. For these companies, the median beat against consensus estimates is 5.2% (FactSet has it at 4.4%). For the first time in several quarters, the median beat against expectations is below the 10-year average of 6.8%. At the sector level, the strongest earnings growth is coming from Financial, Information Technology, and Utilities - all up in the 16%-17% range year over year. Communication Services 2Q24 earnings are up 15%. Other sectors reporting positive EPS growth include Healthcare, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, and Industrials, in descending order; all are up in the 2%-4% range. As noted, Energy, Materials, and Real Estate are all down; Materials is off in high single-digits, while Energy and Real Estate earnings are down 20%-21% from a year earlier. From a statistical standpoint, 36% would be considered a fairly reliable and predictive sample size. Timing of the remainder of 2Q24 earnings season, however, may introduce some variability. Over 61% of Financial companies have already reported, in what has been a better-than-anticipated season for the sector. Only 23% of Energy companies have reported; given similar sensitivity off all component companies to key commodities (oil and natural gas), the contribution from this sector will likely continue to pull down overall results. The swing sector is likely to be Information Technology. Fewer than 30% of tech companies have reported. Further, 2Q earnings from the heavy hitters (Apple, Microsoft, etc.) are not reflected in the data discussed above. Earnings from the big Healthcare, Industrial, and Consumer Discretionary (AMZN) companies could also play an outsized role. For 2Q24, Argus continues to model high-single-digit continuing-operations EPS growth for S&P 500 component companies. We see a higher likelihood that our forecast misses on the upside than on the downside. In other words, once all the component companies are tallied, we are more likely to see low-double-digit EPS growth for 2Q24 than we are to see mid-single-digit EPS growth. Conclusion Investors will veer away from earnings analysis for a few hours on the morning of 8/2/24 to assess the state of the labor economy. Argus Chief Economist Chris Graja, CFA, forecasts 185,000 new nonfarm payroll jobs for July, approximately in line with the 188,000 consensus forecast. The bigger focus will be on the unemployment rate, which was 4.1% in June. If July unemployment hits 4.2%, that would trigger the Sahm indicator. When unemployment rises 50 bps within a cycle, the Sahm rule posits, recession follows or has already begun. In this scenario, deteriorating labor markets become 'a self-reinforcing feedback loop,' according to former New York Fed president William Dudley. Secular and demographic factors may argue for structurally lower unemployment rates over the long term. This includes ongoing retirements from within the huge Baby Boomer cohort, and a smaller pool of workers from the generational cohorts that follow available to fill vacant boomer positions. Triggering the Sahm rule, nonetheless, would be a warning sign and presumably a wake-up call for the Fed to focus on the fight in front of it (preventing recession) and not the nearly won war against inflation."
"Nasdaq, S&P 500 end 2% higher in rally after US job.",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/23/stock-market-today-live-updates.html,"Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on June 24, 2024.

Stocks sold off Wednesday, weighed down by underwhelming reports from two megacap tech companies, leading the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite to post their worst session since 2022.

The broad market index lost 2.31%, closing at 5,427.13, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq slid 3.64% to end at 17,342.41. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 504.22 points, or 1.25%, closing at 39,853.87.

Shares of Google parent company Alphabet fell 5% for their biggest one-day drop since Jan. 31, when they dropped 7.5%. Although Alphabet reported a top- and bottom-line beat, YouTube advertising revenue came in below the consensus estimate. Meanwhile, Tesla shares declined 12.3% — their worst day since 2020 — on weaker-than-expected results and a 7% year-over-year drop in auto revenue.

Other major tech stocks fell in sympathy with Alphabet and Tesla. Nvidia and Meta Platforms respectively lost 6.8% and 5.6%, while Microsoft slid 3.6%.

Those reports mark investors' first look at how megacap companies fared during the second quarter. Reports from these names are of special interest to Wall Street as this small cohort is responsible for the bulk of this year's gains.

Wednesday's sell-off was caused by a perfect storm of an overbought market, high bar for earnings and a seasonally weak period for equities. That is why this pullback has not come as a total surprise to investors, according to Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird.

""We would view this sell-off as ultimately quite viable, because it's against the backdrop of a bull market. And a healthy correction inside of a bull market is something that we view as a place of opportunity, rather than a place to get defensive or to try to shield your money from this volatility,"" Mayfield added in an interview with CNBC.

The small-cap Russell 2000 was down 2.1% on the day. For the month, however, the small-cap benchmark is up 7.2% as investors recently began rotating out of large-cap tech names into beaten-down smaller ones. In July, the Dow has gained 1.9%, while the S&P 500 has slipped 0.6% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has fallen 2.2%.

Despite these misses from the megacap tech titans, the earnings season overall is off to a strong start. More than 25% of S&P 500 companies have reported their second-quarter earnings, with roughly 80% of them topping expectations, according to FactSet data.

Adding to investor concerns Wednesday morning was weaker-than-expected U.S. manufacturing data.

The U.S. PMI flash manufacturing output index fell to 49.5 in July, unexpectedly slipping into contraction territory as new orders, production and inventories declined. Economists had forecast a reading of 51.5, according to Dow Jones.

A Wednesday report also showed new home sales came in lighter than economists had expected for the month of June."

The losses come ahead of earnings this week from some of the chipmakers’ largest big tech customers amid concerns about their spending on AI infrastructure.

Tuesday's pullback also speaks to a broader market shift ahead of key decisions on interest rates from the Federal Reserve that could favor small-cap stocks.

Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM) and other chip stocks lost ground in intraday trading Tuesday, dragging the tech sector and major indexes down with them.

The losses came ahead of earnings from some of the chip companies’ largest big tech customers, amid concerns about their spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, and ahead of key decisions on interest rates from the Federal Reserve that could favor small-cap stocks.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were both down sharply in late trading Tuesday, with Nvidia and other chip stocks among the biggest decliners.

Big Tech Earnings To Highlight Spending on AI, and Chips

With Microsoft (MSFT) set to report earnings after the bell Tuesday, Meta (META) following on Wednesday, and Apple (AAPL) reporting Thursday, investors could get key updates on how big tech leaders are approaching AI investments, amid concerns about their costs.

Whether they signal a pullback to appease investors’ worries about AI’s hefty price tag, or double down, will have implications for chipmakers, whose products support the data centers powering AI, and could be some of the biggest beneficiaries of rising AI spending.

Earnings from AMD on Tuesday, chip designer Arm (ARM) on Wednesday, and Intel (INTC) on Thursday, could also speak to the rising appetite for AI chips.

Pullback Comes Amid Market Rotation Ahead of Key Fed Decisions on Interest Rates

Tuesday’s pullback from tech stocks also comes amid a broader market shift ahead of key decisions on interest rates from the Federal Reserve that could benefit small-cap stocks.

While the central bank isn’t expected to lower interest rates at its policy meeting tomorrow, expectations that the Fed will lower rates in September have fueled hopes that small-cap stocks could get a boost after lagging big tech companies’ performance so far this year.



However, CFRA, Wedbush, Bank of America, and UBS analysts have suggested earlier this month that the recent pullback in tech stocks could be temporary, citing strong fundamentals and surging demand for AI products, potentially offering long-term investors an opportunity to ""buy the dip."""

"Third person dies, nine more fall ill in Boar’s Head deli.",https://nypost.com/2024/08/08/business/third-person-dies-nine-more-fall-ill-in-boars-head-deli-meat-listeria-outbreak-cdc/,"The deadly Boar’s Head listeria outbreak claimed another life, raising the grim tally to three, and nine more have fallen ill since millions of pounds of the popular deli meat were recalled last month, the Centers for Disease Control announced Thursday.

The latest fatality was in Virginia, following deaths in Illinois and New Jersey from the tainted meat outbreak that began in May, the agency said. The deceased have ranged in age from 32 to 94 years old.

Meanwhile, 43 have now been sickened across 13 states, with all of them hospitalized. It’s likely countless others have also fallen sick but haven’t reported their maladies.

Most people don’t get medical care and are not tested for the bacteria, according to a Food Poison Journal report.

5 An outbreak of listeria that began in July has been linked to Boar’s Head deli meat products of which 71 brands have been recalled. Christopher Sadowski

5 Most people don’t get medical care and are not tested for the bacteria, according to a Food Poison Journal report. AP

Boar’s Head — a 119-year-old family-run business headquartered in Sarasota, Fla . — did not immediately comment.

The company recalled seven million pounds of meat last week – up from 200,000 pounds it pulled off shelves when the illnesses were first reported on July 26.

The Boar’s Head facility in Jarratt, Va. was identified as the source of the outbreak, first detected by the Maryland Department of Health after it tested an unopened package of liverwurst.

5 Missouri residents Patrick and Sue Fleming sued Boar’s Head and the food store where they bought liverwurst which caused Sue to be hospitalized. Obtained by the New York Post

On July 30, the company said that it had learned from the USDA that its Strassburger Brand Liverwurst “has been linked to the national deli meat listeria outbreak. Based on this new information, we took steps to ensure we are doing everything possible to protect public health.”

The expanded recall on July 31 included 71 products listed on the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service website.

There are at least three lawsuits filed against Boar’s Head and food stores that sell its products, including a proposed class action complaint filed by a customer in Queens who claimed that Boar’s Head didn’t do enough to warn customers about the safety of its products.

An elderly couple from Missouri also filed a complaint when the wife, Sue Flemming, 88, became ill and was hospitalized after eating Boar’s Head liverwurst.

Meanwhile, supermarkets have been advised to remove Boar’s Head signage from their deli counters “until further notice,” according to a memo obtained by The Post and sent by the National Supermarket Association to its 750 members.

Sales of Boar’s Head products in local stores are down, according to a supermarket owner in the Bronx.

“Our deli clerk has been getting questions about the products,” the owner told The Post.

A third person has died and more than 40 people have been hospitalized in a multistate listeria outbreak stemming from deli meat, according to new numbers released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A third death has been reported in the outbreak that began in May, the CDC said in a press release Thursday. The deaths have been in Illinois, New Jersey and the latest one in Virginia.

Meanwhile, nine more illnesses have been reported since the last update July 31, bringing the total number of sickened patients from the outbreak to 43 across 13 states. The agency noted the true number of sick people is likely higher as all the documented ill patients were hospitalized, and some people may recover without medical care.

The ill patients ranged from 32 to 94 years in age, with a median age of 77.

“Epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback data show that meats sliced at deli counters, including Boar’s Head brand liverwurst, are contaminated with Listeria and are making people sick,” the CDC said in a statement Thursday.

Boar’s Head had already issued a recall for more than 7 million pounds of deli and poultry items produced at its Jarratt, Virginia, facility over concerns they may contain the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes following the outbreak.

The investigation remains underway.

The CDC said that the Maryland Department of Health and the Baltimore City Health Department collected an unopened Boar’s Head liverwurst product from a retail store and identified Listeria monocytogenes. Further, a New York State Food Laboratory identified the bacteria from a previously collected sample of unopened Boar’s Head Liverwurst products collected from retail stores. Authorities determined both to be the same strain as the strain making people sick in this outbreak.

A majority of patients interviewed by state and local public health officials reported in interviews to eating a variety of meats sliced at deli counters in the month prior to falling ill.

Of 33 patients asked if they ate liverwurst, 55% said they ate deli-sliced liverwurst before getting sick and 13 reported eating Boar’s Head brand.

Listeria infection is a food borne bacterial illness, most commonly caused by eating improperly processed deli meats and unpasteurized milk products, according to the Mayo Clinic. It’s the third-leading cause of death from food poisoning in the U.S.

Symptoms usually appear within two weeks of eating contaminated food, and include fever, muscle aches, tiredness, stiff neck and confusion. In severe cases, the bacteria may cause a blood infection or meningitis. The infection is dangerous for those who are older, those with weakened immune systems and pregnant women, and those who fall into such categories are advised by the CDC to avoid deli meats.

The CDC estimates that around 1,600 people get listeriosis each year, and about 260 die.

The Boar’s Head recall, which includes more than 70 products, was distributed to stores nationwide and the Cayman Islands, the Dominican Republic, Mexico and Panama.

People who bought the recalled products should throw them away or return them to the store, and also clean out their refrigerators as the bacteria can grow in cold temperatures and spread to other foods."
"Third person dies, nine more fall ill in Boar’s Head deli.",https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/person-dies-listeria-outbreak-tied-boars-head-deli-112684005,"Federal food safety officials say three people have now died in a listeria food poisoning outbreak linked to Boar’s Head deli meats

Three people have now died in a listeria food poisoning outbreak linked to Boar's Head deli meats, federal food safety officials announced Thursday, and the overall number of people sickened rose to 43.

The additional death happened in Virginia, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a news release Thursday. The other two deaths were in New Jersey and Illinois. The CDC also said nine more cases were reported since a July 31 release about the outbreak, which started in late May.

Boar’s Head recalled 7 million pounds of deli meats on July 30, expanding an initial recall on July 25 after a liverwurst sample collected by health officials in Maryland tested positive for listeria. The CDC said Thursday that a New York health officials tested a liverwurst sample and confirmed the same strain of listeria.

The recall includes more than 70 products — including liverwurst, ham, beef salami and bologna — made at the company's plant in Jarratt, Virginia.

Boar’s Head already faces two lawsuits over the outbreak, one in a Missouri court and the other a class action suit in federal court in New York.

The meat was distributed to stores nationwide, as well as to the Cayman Islands, the Dominican Republic, Mexico and Panama. Consumers should not eat the recalled meats and should discard them or return them to the store for a refund. Listeria bacteria can survive and grow in the refrigerator, so officials say people who had recalled products should thoroughly clean and sanitize the fridge to prevent contamination.

The CDC estimates 1,600 people a year get listeria food poisoning and about 260 of those people die.

The most common symptoms include fever, muscle aches and fatigue, though infections may also cause confusion and convulsions. Infections are most dangerous for people older than 65, people with weak immune systems and pregnant people. Symptoms may not appear for weeks after eating contaminated food.

The deaths were caused by listeria infections linked to Boar's Head meat sold across the country, in places like Target, Walmart and other grocery stores.

The CDC revealed today that the latest victim was from Virginia, with the other deaths occurring in Illinois and New Jersey.

Since the last update at the end of July, nine more cases have been reported bringing the total to 43. All 43 people have been hospitalized.

The multi-state recall for listeria contaminated products

Sue Fleming, 88, and her husband Patrick, 76, are suing deli meats manufacturer Boar's Head and the shop where they purchased the meat after Ms Fleming became 'deathly ill' from listeria. She has survived the illness

Boar's Head expanded its swepping recall on July 30 to now cover around seven million pounds of deli meats, both prepackaged and the kind freshly sliced at the deli counter.

Four days previously, the recall affected around 200,000 pounds of meats.

The items range from beef, bologna, ham, liverwurst and salami, among others.

According to the CDC: 'The New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets’ Division of Food Safety and Inspection collected unopened Boar’s Head liverwurst products from retail stores and the New York State Food Laboratory identified Listeria monocytogenes.'

It was the same strain currently driving a multi-state outbreak of listeria infection, which is especially dangerous for seniors and pregnant people, as well as those with already weakened immune systems.

Most people who get listeriosis do not get severely ill. But approximately 1,600 people in the US develop serious listeria infections, known as listeriosis, every year — and about 260 of those infections are fatal.

Boar's Head has recalled over 7 million pounds of deli meats, up from slightly over 200,000 pounds that were recalled last month

Pregnant women are 10 times more likely to get listeriosis compared to other adults because of changes in the immune system during pregnancy, which makes it easier for infections to take hold and harder for the body to fight them off.

If it spreads to the nervous system, listeria can also lead to severe brain inflammation, blood poisoning, convulsions, and brain swelling. Early diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics is crucial to avoiding the worst possible outcome.

In addition to causing flu-like symptoms, listeriosis can cause nausea, diarrhea, and stomach cramps. This was the case for Sue Fleming, 88, who lives with her husband Patrick, 76, in High Ridge, Missouri. She ate a Boar's Head liverwurst late last month after buying it from her local grocery store.

She was rushed to hospital, where tests confirmed a listeria infection — according to a lawsuit she filed against the company.

Mrs Fleming spent nine days in intensive care and 11 in rehab, but claims she still suffers from neurological symptoms and is yet to regain her full strength.

Listeria lives in soil, meaning it comes in contact with anything that touches or is rooted in the soil, such as animals and the vegetables we eat.

Mrs Fleming [right] is yet to recover from, has taken the joy out of their life and damaged their marriage. They are pictured above holding a book the pair wrote on how to heal trauma from past abuse

The CDC began tracking cases of listeriosis in May when officials determined that 16 of 18 people who tested positive for the bacteria had eaten the now-recalled deli meats

It can also survive for a long time on counter tops, because it forms a biofilm that sticks around on hard surfaces, making it tougher to ensure the food we eat is safe.

The CDC has not specified which of the now-43 infections required hospitalization, but when that tally sat at 34 cases, all but one require care in a hospital.

The CDC began sampling deli meats in May in response to a smattering of cases. The meats that have been recalled were distributed across the US and has sickened people in Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin.

The wide-ranging Boar's Head recall is not the first that federal officials have had to contend with this year.

In July, Ohio based Wiers Farm Inc. recalled some of their whole and bagged salad cucumbers that were sold at select Walmarts in Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio.

Pulled items include green beans, peppers, zucchini, jalapeños, and more - as the recall was expanded to also include green beans and jalapeños sold under the banner of Freshire Farms, an Aldi brand.

Also last month, the USDA recalled 2,000 pounds of chicken kebabs and patties on Friday after a routine inspection found the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes at the producer's Canadian manufacturing facility that then exported products to the US."

The Fed has cut rates amid stock swoons before. Not this time.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-cut-rates-amid-stock-100129264.html,"By Ann Saphir and Dan Burns

(Reuters) - A sharp slowdown in the U.S. job market that touched off days of global stock-market turmoil also fueled speculation the Federal Reserve may not wait until its next scheduled meeting, in September, to cut interest rates.

Indeed, an interest rate futures contract expiring later this month that tracks Fed policy expectations shot to a two-month high earlier in the week in a bet that rates would be lower by the end of August.

The odds are against it. As Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said earlier this week, ""the law doesn't say anything about the stock market. It's about employment and it's about price stability,"" referring to the Fed's double mandate to foster full employment and price stability.

An increasing number of analysts are now penciling in a half-a-percentage-point rate cut for the Fed's September meeting. But few if any believe the Fed will move sooner.

""Current economic data do not warrant an emergency intermeeting rate cut, and this would only ignite a new round of panic into the markets,"" wrote Nationwide economist Kathy Bostjancic.

Even former New York Fed President Bill Dudley, who called for the U.S. central bank to cut rates last week even before the latest data showed the unemployment rate jumped to 4.3% in July, wrote this week that an intermeeting cut is ""very unlikely.""

In the days since the rout began, global stock markets - which had also been pummeled by worries about Bank of Japan tightening and an unwinding of yen-funded trades - have somewhat recovered. A report Thursday showing fewer Americans filing unemployment insurance claims added to a sense of relief in U.S. markets.

Traders of short-term U.S. interest-rate futures have for now not only all but abandoned bets on an intermeeting Fed move but have also pared expectations on the size of the first rate reduction. What had been seen as a nine-to-one chance of a half-point rate cut in September is now down to about even odds as against a quarter-point cut, rate-futures prices show.

In late August Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to have a chance to give a fresh steer on what he thinks could be needed when global central bankers gather at the Kansas City Fed's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

For now Powell is widely anticipated to look past the stock-market swoon and stick to what he said last Wednesday, after the Fed's decision to leave the policy rate in the 5.25%-5.50% range.

""If we do get the data that we hope we get, then a reduction in our policy rate could be on the table at the September meeting,"" he said.

Story continues

In the weeks ahead, data on jobs, inflation, consumer spending and economic growth could all influence whether that reduction would be a quarter-point cut or something bigger.

On each of the eight occasions over the past 30 years that the U.S. central bank has cut rates between policy-setting meetings, the upheaval in markets went well beyond equities. In particular, bond market indications of rapidly building disruptions to the credit flows that keep businesses humming were in plain view, a factor notably absent so far.

A spin through each of them shows why those times were different.

RUSSIAN FINANCIAL CRISIS/LTCM - 25 basis points

Oct. 15, 1998 - The Fed, which had only just delivered a quarter-point rate cut at its meeting two weeks earlier, cut the policy rate another 25 basis points. The failure of hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management - on the heels of Russia's sovereign debt default two months earlier - was reverberating through U.S. financial markets, blowing out credit spreads that threatened to impact investment and drag down the economy.

TECHNOLOGY STOCK SWOON - 100 basis points

Jan. 3 and April 18, 2001 - The Fed delivered two surprise half-point interest rate cuts early in the year after the sharp upswing in dot-com tech stocks turned into an equity rout that policymakers worried would pinch household and business spending. What had been mostly a stock market event bled into the corporate bond market through late 2000, sending high-yield credit spreads to their widest on record to that point.

The two Fed cuts were in addition to two half-point cuts at its Jan. 31 and March 20 meetings.

SEPT 11 ATTACKS - 50 basis points

Sept. 17, 2001 - The Fed cut the policy rate by half a percentage point following the attacks and the days-long closure of U.S. financial markets, and promised to continue to supply unusually large volumes of liquidity to the financial markets until more normal market functioning was restored. High-yield bond spreads widened more than 200 basis points before the Fed's actions helped restore calm in credit markets.

GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS - 125 basis points

Jan. 22 and Oct. 8, 2008 - The Fed cut its policy rate by 75 basis points at an unscheduled meeting in January as what had begun as a crisis in subprime lending the prior summer gathered steam and spread to global markets. High-yield spreads stood at their widest in five years at the time.

Then, Lehman Brothers' failure on Sept. 15 ushered in a new phase of the crisis, and though the Fed skipped policy action at its meeting a day later, by early October it got together with other global central bankers for a coordinated action that included a half-point cut to the federal funds rate. Credit spreads eventually peaked near year end at what is still a record for both high-yield and investment-grade bonds.

COVID-19 PANDEMIC - 150 basis points

March 3 and March 15, 2020 - The Fed cut rates by half a percentage point, and then less than two weeks later by another full point, to ease policy as global travel and commerce suddenly skidded to a near standstill in the face of government shutdowns to prevent the spread of COVID-19. While U.S. stock indexes dropped more than 30%, of even greater concern was a 700-point widening of credit spreads and disruptions to the function of the U.S. Treasury market.

Aug 8 - Canada's main stock index climbed by the most in six months on Thursday, as stocks that are sensitive to the economic outlook led a broad-based rally after U.S. jobless claims data eased fears of a slowdown in activity.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index ended up 344.66 points, or 1.58%, at 22,225.61, its biggest advance since Feb. 15.

It follows four straight days of declines, with the index posting on Wednesday its lowest closing level in nearly six weeks.

""Gains have been led by the cyclical sectors, like financials and energy, because the U.S. numbers have eased concerns about a slowdown in the U.S. economy,"" said Elvis Picardo, a portfolio manager at Luft Financial, iA Private Wealth.

U.S. stocks also jumped after the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week.

""The market is really being roiled by every incoming piece of economic data and that's usually the case when you have inflection points like the present,"" Picardo said.

""There is a big tug of war as far as investor sentiment is concerned, and that's between lingering hopes of a soft landing and fears that the U.S. is slowing faster than expected.""

All 10 major sectors on the Toronto market gained ground, including the economically sensitive and heavily weighted financials group.

It ended 1.45% higher, with shares of Manulife Financial Corp rising 2.47% after the insurer reported better-than-expected quarterly profit.

Energy rose 2.02% as the price of oil settled up 1.3% at $76.19 a barrel. Gold and copper prices also climbed, boosting metal mining shares.

The materials group, which includes metal miners and fertilizer companies, added 1.74% and technology was up 3.04%.

Canadian Tire Corporation was a standout. Its shares jumped 7.74% after the company beat quarterly earnings estimates."

The Fed has cut rates amid stock swoons before. Not this time.,https://www.livemint.com/Money/tzPWI84Uec1id5uRbRYViO/FAQs-on-payments-banks.html,"News: The commercial lending scenario of the country is all set to change. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday announced the first set of payments banks and gave in-principle approval to 11 entities. This is the first time that the central bank has issued a differentiated bank licence. Till date, it has only issued universal banking licences.

Origin: The idea of such licences was mooted in the report of the Committee on Comprehensive Financial Services for Small Business and Low Income Households, submitted by a Nachiket Mor-led committee set up in 2013. These were envisioned keeping in view financial inclusion of the under-served and unserved population of the country.

What will it do?

The primary objective of the new entities will be to push financial inclusion and promote various schemes such as the Paradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana and insurance schemes. It will offer small savings accounts and allow payments and remittance services to various sections of the society, especially the migrant labour workforce, low-income households, small businesses and the unorganized sector.

How will it operate?

The new entities have been created to accept deposits through basic bank accounts of up to ₹ 1 lakh from each individual. Though the entity may issue debit cards, it will not be allowed to issue credit cards. It can also distribute mutual fund units or insurance products which are non-risk in nature.

Interestingly, these new entities can become business correspondents of universal banks and offer services such as credit on banks’ behalf. The payments banks cannot undertake lending activities on their own.

How will it utilize its funds?

A payments bank will need to invest 75% of its funds in government securities or treasury bills with maturity up to one year and the minimum capital required to set up a payments banks is ₹ 100 crore. It can hold maximum 25% in current and fixed deposits with other scheduled commercial banks for operations and liquidity management.

Who can own a piece of the pie?"
The Fed has cut rates amid stock swoons before. Not this time.,https://bilyonaryo.com/2024/08/08/aboitiz-moving-heaven-and-earth-map-urging-over-50-big-business-groups-to-back-lotilla-amid-coal-ban-corruption-case/,"The fingerprint of Aboitiz Power led by Marcos ally Sabin Aboitiz is evident in the Management Association of the Philippines’ effort to rally the country’s biggest business groups behind its beleaguered former director, Energy Secretary Raphael Lotilla.

A Babbler said that MAP executive director Arnold P. Salvador had sent an “urgent” letter to 52 business organizations, requesting them to “co-sign” a joint statement of support for Lotilla.

Salvador had asked the business groups to send their replies by 11:00 a.m. on Friday, August 19.

Babbler said the driving force behind the petition is MAP energy committee chairperson Ruth Yu-Owen, a self-proclaimed advocate for renewable energy.

Yu-Owen is the chair of energy committee and CEO of Upgrade Energy Philippines (UGEP), which signed a 50-50 joint venture with AboitizPower Distributed Renewables Inc. (APX) last year to develop rooftop solar projects.

Lotilla has been accused of graft, grave misconduct, and actions against public interest for violating the coal moratorium policy approved in 2020 by approving the expansion of Aboitiz-owned Therma Visayas Inc. (TVI) Unit 3 in Cebu last year.

“TVI should have been disqualified due to the coal moratorium. We view his action as a violation of the moratorium and a violation of his mandate to ensure that he is not partial to any corporation. Siya mismo kasi ay dating nasa Aboitiz,” Sanlakas secretary general Aaron Pedrosa, one of the complainants, said.

Lotilla was a director of Aboitiz Power and its parent, Aboitiz Equity Ventures.

“By approving the expansion of TVI, Secretary Lotilla not only increased the cost of electricity for the people of Cebu and contributed to more pollution in the Central Visayas, but also favored his old company, AboitizPower. AboitizPower was effectively exempted from following the provisions of the coal moratorium, a privilege not given to any other company,” said P4P convenor Gerry Arances, another complainant.

The Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI) issued a statement of support for Lotilla last Monday.

PCCI agrees with Lotilla that the coal moratorium applies only to new coal-fired power projects and does not affect existing projects, expansion plans, or projects already in significant progress."
Boeing’s new CEO is already making an overdue change his first day.,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/08/business/boeing-seattle-new-ceo/index.html,"New York CNN —

Today is Kelly Ortberg’s first day as CEO of Boeing. He’s already winning praise – for his work location.

Ortberg has decided he will work out of Boeing’s offices in Seattle, which had been the company’s home for its first 85 years before it moved its corporate headquarters to Chicago in 2001.

The new CEO said in a memo to staff Thursday that he decided to work 2,300 miles from the company’s current corporate offices in Arlington, Virginia, to help restore trust in the company’s commercial aircraft business.

“Because what we do is complex, I firmly believe that we need to get closer to the production lines and development programs across the company,” Ortberg said in the letter. “I plan to be based in Seattle so that I can be close to the commercial airplane programs.”

Ortberg said he’d be on the factory floor in Renton, Washington, Thursday, where the company makes its troubled 737 Max line of planes.

Boeing critics say moving headquarters away from its factories in the Puget Sound area more than 20 years ago underscored the company’s focus on financial results instead of production processes.

But Boeing has been plagued by serious quality issues in recent years, problems that resulted in two fatal crashes, deep losses and terrifying incidents, including a door plug that blew off the fuselage on a January 5 Boeing 737 Max flight operated by Alaska Airlines.

Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory and a long-time critic of Boeing management, praised Ortberg’s choice of office location.

“It’s incredibly promising,” he said. “It shows that he’s not afraid to go where the problem are and to put in some serious hard work solving them. The other great virtue of showing up is that you get an accurate picture of the situation, rather than news filtered through what people think you want to hear. He continues to look like the exact opposite kind of leader than the ones that plagued Boeing.”

Boeing previously insisted that moving headquarters was in the company’s best interests, noting Boeing builds products other than commercial aircraft, including from its defense and space business. And the executives in charge of commercial airplanes have always been based in Seattle, even if the corporate headquarters was elsewhere.

The company said it had no comment whether it is considering moving its entire headquarters back to Seattle along with Ortberg.

Ortberg will have his hands full, no matter where his office is located. The company has had almost nothing but problems for more than five years. A design flaw in its best selling 737 Max resulted in fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019, followed by a 20-month grounding of the jet. That in turn kicked off years of financial losses that topped $33 billion in core operating losses in the most recent quarter.

In January a door plug blew off the side of an Alaska Airlines flight as it approached 16,000 feet, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane and bringing new attention to its production problems. Since that time it has agreed to plead guilty to deceiving the Federal Aviation Administration, a plea that will require it to work under the supervision of a court-appointed monitor.

It faces a series of other federal probes, including one by the National Transportation Safety Board, which just concluded two days of public hearings on the Alaska Air incident. Boeing executives admitted there they still don’t know how the plane in the door plug blowout left Boeing’s Renton, Washington factory without the four bolts needed to keep the door plug in place.

“We don’t know and neither do they, and that’s a problem,” NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy told reporters during the hearing.

Ortberg, in his letter, acknowledged Boeing needs to do better.

“While we clearly have a lot of work to do in restoring trust, I’m confident that working together, we will return the company to be the industry leader we all expect,” he said."

Boeing’s new CEO is already making an overdue change his first day.,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/07/business/boeing-ntsb-hearing-alaska-airlines-door-plug/index.html,"Washington CNN —

Seven months of investigations. Nearly 10 hours of hearings. And yet neither Boeing nor the National Transportation Safety Board know how a 737 Max was delivered to Alaska Airlines without the four bolts needed to keep a door plug in place.

What is known: Boeing’s procedures and training – by employees, and by safety investigators – has drawn enormous skepticism and criticism from regulators. That was on full display in the first day of a two-day hearing. The NTSB called a rare public hearing to examine the near tragedy on the January 5 Alaska Air flight in which a door plug blew out, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane – and in Boeing’s already battered reputation.

The door plug was removed at the Boeing factory in Renton, Washington, last September so that problems with some rivets could be repaired. But the necessary paperwork for that temporary door plug removal was apparently never created. So when workers replaced the door plug temporarily, other workers were unaware that bolts needed to be reinstalled, said Elizabeth Lund, senior vice president of quality for Boeing Commercial Airplanes.

But under questioning from the NTSB Lund admitted that it’s not clear who and when that door plug was put in place. That lack of information concerned members of the NTSB.

“We don’t know and neither do they and that’s a problem,” NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy told reporters during a break in the hearing.

The second day of hearings focused on the safety management system and quality management systems that have been in place at Boeing for several years that were supposed to prevent problems from occurring.

Boeing executives said the two programs have been making improvements in the work done at its factories, although they admitted that the January accident showed that there are “gaps” in the systems and that improvement is still needed.

Homendy told CNN that Boeing’s 737 factory has had issues with “unauthorized” work on door plugs “for years.” And she’s therefore concerned that the January 5 accident could occur again.

“Could this happen again? Sure,” Homendy said. “Yes, you have some more inspections, but what else to prevent it? It can’t just rely on one person or a group of people.”

Homendy also suggested that the problem could occur again during questioning of Boeing executives.

“I want to ask, are you 100% sure a defect will not occur tomorrow? Yes or no?” she asked.

“No,” replied Hector Silva, vice president of regulatory compliance and core quality for Boeing.

“Are you 100% sure there will never be an unauthorized removal (of a door plug)?” Homendy asked.

“No,” Silva replied.

Asked if he could promise there will not be another door plug improperly installed, Silva answer, “I cannot make a promise or guarantee of that. All I can say is, we are definitely committed to making sure that all the changes we need to make are made.”

Other members of the NTSB expressed dissatisfaction with both Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration’s oversight of the company.

“Is it just me or are we seeing a game of whack-a-mole every five to ten years on safety?” said board member J. Todd Inman, citing past agreements between Boeing and the FAA that were supposed to fix quality problems. “What do you think will be different this time?”

Homendy said that Boeing has disclosed that there are two employees who worked on the Alaska Airlines jet who have been “sidelined,” with pay, as part of the investigation. She criticized that action, saying it sends a message that there will be retaliation even for non-intentional errors, and that it therefore will discourage other workers from coming forward when they know of mistakes due to fear of there being action taken against them.

“Safety is a collective responsibility. It is not just one person. It is not just two people,” Homendy said. “So I have a lot of questions about these two people who have been sidelined. I just want to understand why two people on a door crew are sidelined for something that is a collective responsibility.”

To avoid the problem in the future, Boeing is considering adding a warning light in the cockpit that would alert pilots if the door plug moves even a little bit – well before it could blow out in the kind of accident that occurred on the Alaska Air flight.

All 737 exit doors have such an indicator light in the flight deck if one of the plane’s doors moves out of locked position. But because the door plugs are not meant to be opened and shut except as part of maintenance, the same feature is not included on them. But that change will likely take about a year to implement, and should be available to retrofit onto existing planes that have door plugs.

In the meantime, Boeing revealed it has a much more low-tech answer to ensure that planes at the factory don’t have door plugs removed and then reinstalled without the necessary bolts: The company is hanging a laminated blue and yellow tag on all door plugs when they arrive in the factory with with relatively large lettering that says “Do not open.” And in smaller font it says “without contacting quality assurance.”

Employees raise concerns

Boeing employees’ testimony to NLRB regulators released as part of Tuesday’s hearings showed employees questioned the training they have to do for initiatives like reinstalling door plugs and making other changes on planes. They also complained about a relentless pressure for speed, planes hitting the assembly line floor rife with defects and employees for suppliers at Boeing factories treated like “cockroaches.”

Overall the testimony described a company in chaos with thin training and occasional confusion about who was doing what. All told the hearings so far paint a picture of a company that has yet to recover from a series of safety lapses that have left everyone from regulators to ordinary passengers rattled, lapses severe enough that the company has agreed to plead guilty to charges of defrauding the Federal Aviation Administration. Boeing faces the possibility of further criminal charges related to the Alaska Air incident. Under its announced guilty plea it will be required to operate under a federal monitor for years.

Boeing executives and those from supplier Spirit AeroSystems did their best to assure the NTSB that they have made changes in their operations that will prevent another near tragedy from occurring.

“We feel this will not be a recurring trend,” said Lund. She pointed to improved metrics and increased training and inspections that have taken place since the January 5 accident , and promised the changes at Boeing are permanent.

“These things won’t be taken away,” she said.

But she and other Boeing executives faced tough questions and criticisms from board members.

“I just want a word of caution here. This is not a PR campaign for Boeing,” Homendy said at one point in the hearing, chastising the company for focusing too much on what has happened since the accident and not enough on the problems that allowed the accident to occur.

“You can talk all about where you are today, there’s going to be plenty of time for that,” she said. “This is an investigation on what happened on January 5. Understand?”

As part of the public hearing the NTSB released 70 documents running nearly 4,000 pages, chock full of disturbing statements from Boeing workers and other experts, including from the Federal Aviation Administration, about the problems at Boeing.

Workers, many of them not identified in the transcripts released by the NTSB, spoke about being pushed to do more work than they could do without making errors, of problems on plane after plane moving along the Boeing assembly lines, with a large portion of them regularly needing to be reworked.

The problems with the planes put the workers “in uncharted waters to where… we were replacing doors like we were replacing our underwear,” one worker told NTSB investigators.

“The planes come in jacked up every day. Every day,” the worker added.

‘Lean manufacturing’ eliminates inspections

One former FAA official told investigators that he blamed problems on Boeing moving to a “lean” manufacturing model to try to cut costs, and that it cut inspections as part of that process.

“A couple of ex-Toyota managers were brought in to build airplanes the way Toyota builds cars,” said James Phoenix, a retired manager of the FAA office that oversaw Boeing. He said when the FAA demanded that Boeing restore inspections, “they complied with all of that, but slowly, very slowly.”

Phoenix told the NTSB it took two fatal crashes of the 737 Max in 2018 and 2019 for Boeing to give in to FAA demands to restore inspections it had stopped doing.

“That really didn’t change until the Max 9 accidents where it brought a lot of things to light. So you need a lot of leverage to get Boeing to change and then when Boeing changes, it’s very slow and it took a long time for them to really understand that their quality system needed to improve.”

Lund defended Boeing’s use of lean manufacturing, saying it’s not at odds with the goal of safer, better quality aircraft.

“We really believe in is the number one way to improve ‘lean’ is to improve quality,” she said.

While Lund said Boeing is committed to making further improvements, Homendy said the company had plenty of evidence of quality issues and didn’t do enough to improve its practices until the Alaska Air incident.

“Where are we going in the future? So we don’t end up in another situation… (where further change comes from) a reaction to a terrible tragedy,” she said.

The advertising trade group The World Federation of Advertisers told its members on Thursday that it was ""discontinuing"" activities for its Global Alliance for Responsible Media initiative following an antitrust lawsuit filed by Elon Musk's X against the company earlier this week.

Stephan Loerke, the CEO of the WFA, wrote in an email to members, seen by Business Insider, that the decision was ""not made lightly"" but that GARM is a not-for-profit organization with limited resources.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Loerke said that the WFA and GARM intended to contest the allegations in X's suit in court and were confident the outcome of the case would ""demonstrate our full adherence to competition rules in all our activities.""

The news came just two days after X filed an antitrust suit in a Texas court, which alleged that GARM's members illegally colluded to ""collectively withhold billions of dollars in advertising revenue"" from Twitter, now known as X. GARM members Unilever, Mars, CVS, and Ørsted are also named defendants.

Representatives for the WFA and GARM didn't immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

X CEO Linda Yaccarino posted to X shortly after this article was published: ""No small group should be able to monopolize what gets monetized. This is an important acknowledgement and a necessary step in the right direction. I am hopeful that it means ecosystem-wide reform is coming.""

Founded in 2019, GARM is a US-based initiative that created frameworks to provide common definitions around areas like hate speech, brand safety, and misinformation. Its 100-plus members include major advertisers, agency groups, and ad tech platforms. The uptake of these frameworks was voluntary — they don't name or rank any specific platforms — and GARM's role wasn't to advise marketers on where to spend their budgets.

Twitter's advertising revenue plummeted after Musk's takeover, with large advertisers among those who fled the platform after the company changed owners. Musk had fired hordes of sales and safety staff and brought back previously banned accounts to the platform now known as X. The platform's lawsuit alleged that after Musk acquired Twitter in 2022, GARM persuaded top brands not to advertise on it.

Advertising insiders expressed concerns to Business Insider earlier this week that while they thought the claims made in X's suit were baseless, the action would nonetheless sap GARM of resources that would hinder its work.

GARM has only two full-time members of staff and had already retained counsel to deal with legal requests from the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. The Committee has been investigating whether GARM members illegally colluded to demonetize conservative platforms and voices. That investigation is ongoing.

""This is a big win for the First Amendment and a big win for Chairman Jordan's oversight work,"" said Russell Dye, a spokesperson for the Committee.

Earlier this week, the video site Rumble also filed an antitrust suit against the WFA, and the ad agency holding company WPP and its media arm GroupM, alleging they collectively agreed to restrict advertising on social platforms, including Rumble.

In posts on X, Musk had previously encouraged other companies who had been ""systematically boycotted by advertisers"" to file their own lawsuits.

""There may also be criminal liability via the RICO Act,"" he posted, referring to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.

Representatives for X didn't immediately respond to a request for comment."
The Global Alliance for Responsible Media is 'discontinuing' after Elon Musk's death.,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/08/elon-musk-x-lawsuit-advertisers,"A global advertiser alliance has discontinued its corporate responsibility program after a lawsuit from Elon Musk’s X accused the group of orchestrating a “massive advertiser boycott”.

The World Federation of Advertisers (WFA) told members on Thursday that it would shut down the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (Garm) following legal attacks from X, formerly Twitter, according to Business Insider, which first reported the news. Garm is a not-for-profit initiative within the WFA that helps brands avoid advertising alongside or monetizing harmful content.

The social media firm filed an antitrust lawsuit earlier this week claiming advertisers including Unilever, Mars and CVS Health, all members of the WFA, unlawfully conspired to withhold “billions of dollars in advertising revenue” from X.

X CEO Linda Yaccarino tweeted after the news broke: “No small group should be able to monopolize what gets monetized. This is an important acknowledgement and a necessary step in the right direction. I am hopeful that it means ecosystem-wide reform is coming.”

The online video platform Rumble, a favorite of the American right, also joined the action, filing its own lawsuit with similar claims against the WFA over Garm.

Advertising revenue at X saw a sharp decline after Musk bought the company in 2022 and quickly gutted the social network’s content moderation teams, leading to a sharp rise in antisemitic content on X, including ads running beside posts expressing pro-Nazi sentiments. X sued a watchdog organization over its reports on the proliferation of offensive content on the social network.

Musk claimed advertisers fleeing in light of such policy changes were engaging in “blackmail” and, in a profanity-laced rant, told them to stay away. X is now seeking unspecified damages and a court order against any continued efforts to conspire to withhold ad dollars.

The WFA responded to a request for comment by saying that it would issue a statement shortly. Unilever, Mars and CVS Health did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The ad tech watchdog Check My Ads said the suit was likely to make even more advertisers flee the platform.

“Everyone can see that advertising on X is a treacherous business relationship for advertisers,” said Claire Atkin, co-founder of Check My Ads. “The upside to today’s news is that advertisers will no longer rely on Garm and will now take more direct responsibility over where their ads appear.”

A committee within the US Congress held a hearing in July on “collusion in the Global Alliance for Responsible Media”, targeting advertising firms for “anticompetitive collusion in online advertising”.

In response to the news, the X account for Republicans on the House judiciary committee posted: “Big win for the First Amendment. Big win for oversight.”

Called to speak before Congress, Unilever USA’s president, Herrish Patel, defended his company’s right to advertise where it chooses.

“Unilever, and Unilever alone, controls our advertising spending,” Patel said. “No platform has a right to our advertising dollar.”"
The Global Alliance for Responsible Media is 'discontinuing' after Elon Musk's death.,https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-sued-an-ad-group-for-fcking-off-too-well-now-its-discontinuing-operations-2000484866,"On Tuesday, Elon Musk announced a lawsuit filed by his X Corps against a little-known advertising consortium dubbed GARM (short for the Global Alliance for Responsible Media). X claimed that GARM had conspired to shut off advertising revenue to its business, thus depriving it of “billions” of dollars. Now, some 48 hours later, it would appear that the besieged ad organization is halting its operations and disbanding.

The New York Times reports that GARM plans to “shut down,” citing an internal email from the non-profit organization that states it doesn’t have the financial resources to continue operations while also fighting X’s litigation effort. Business Insider originally reported on the email, which stated that the organization would be “discontinuing” its activities.

GARM is an initiative established by the World Federation of Advertisers in 2019, following the Christchurch massacre. It has publicly stated that its goal is to address “the challenge of illegal or harmful content on digital media platforms and its monetization via advertising.” Functionally, what this has meant is advising companies on sites that might prove problematic from a brand safety perspective. An investigation by the conservative-led House Judiciary Committee claims that the organization broke anti-trust laws in its efforts to “demonetize disfavored content in the name of brand safety,” and that it has specifically targeted conservative organizations.

Last year, Musk told advertisers who didn’t like him or his website to “go fuck” themselves, stating that he hoped companies that didn’t support his way of doing business wouldn’t advertise on X. Apparently he didn’t really mean it, since his company is now suing some of the advertisers who decided to do that. X’s lawsuit claims that following Musk’s acquisition of Twitter (which he later renamed X), GARM helped trigger a “massive advertiser boycott” that deprived the company of “billions of dollars in advertising revenue.” The suit says that, internally, “GARM celebrated—and took responsibility for—the massive economic harm imposed on Twitter by the boycott.”

While the organization may be shutting down, GARM and the WEF have denied that they broke antitrust laws. Gizmodo reached out to both organizations for comment.

On Thursday, X’s CEO, Linda Yaccarino, posted about GARM’s disbandment, saying: “No small group should be able to monopolize what gets monetized. This is an important acknowledgement and a necessary step in the right direction. I am hopeful that it means ecosystem-wide reform is coming.”

Musk has yet to directly comment on the development. The tech billionaire has made a habit of high-profile litigation in recent years. In addition to X’s legal assault on GARM, Musk and/or X are also currently suing OpenAI, the company he originally helped found, Media Matters, a left-leaning non-profit watchdog, and the Center for Countering Digital Hate, another non-profit. Of course, the complete list of legal entanglements that Musk and his companies are involved in is long."
The Global Alliance for Responsible Media is 'discontinuing' after Elon Musk's death.,https://nypost.com/2024/08/08/business/shadowy-ad-cabal-garm-shuts-down-after-elon-musks-x-files-antitrust-suit-over-censorship/,"The left-leaning advertising cabal accused of conspiring to suppress conservative outlets was reportedly disbanded Thursday – just days after Elon Musk’s X slapped the group with a federal antitrust lawsuit.

The World Federation of Advertisers, which organized the Global Alliance for Responsible Media initiative, informed its members that GARM was “discontinuing” activities, according to an email obtained by Business Insider.

WFA CEO Stephen Loerke said in his email the decision to shutter GARM was “not made lightly,” and cited the initiative’s status as a nonprofit with limited resources.

GARM came under fire last month after a damning House Judiciary Committee alleged its radical executive Robert Rakowitz coordinated a campaign to stifle free speech and restrict ads to a slew of news outlets and online platforms, including The Post.

In its bombshell lawsuit earlier this week, X accused GARM and WFA of organizing an illegal ad boycott that cost the social media platform “billions of dollars in advertising revenue.”

Aside from GARM and WFA, a handful of major companies — CVS Health, Mars, Orsted and Unilever – were named as defendants. X is seeking trebled compensatory damages and injunctive relief.

The WFA’s membership includes dozens of the world’s largest companies, including Disney, Coca-Cola and Adidas, that collectively control 90% of global marketing spending, according to its website.

X CEO Linda Yaccarino said GARM’s shutdown was “an important acknowledgement and a necessary step in the right direction.”

“No small group should be able to monopolize what gets monetized,” she added in her post to the social media site.

5 GARM is an initiative of the World Federation of Advertisers.

Loerke said in the email that WFA and GARM would still fight X’s lawsuit in Texas federal court and expressed confidence that the outcome would “demonstrate our full adherence to competition rules in all our activities.”

When reached for comment, a WFA spokesperson said the group would share a statement on its decision “shortly.”

In an interview with The Post, House Judiciary Chairman Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) called GARM’s demise “great news for freedom, free markets, First Amendment, all the good things that make America special.”

Jordan said the committee’s investigation is ongoing and remains focused on potential antitrust violations.

“The World Federation of Advertisers, we think, has the same bias,” Jordan said. “Our investigation is looking at all of that. It’s all about stopping the censorship however it’s done.”

As The Post reported last week, the House Judiciary Committee sent out letters to more than 40 companies to provide information and preserve documents related to the inquiry.

Adidas, American Express, Bayer, BP, Carhartt, Chanel, CVS and General Motors were among the companies that received letters.

Separately, at least two Republican state attorneys general are known to be examining evidence surfaced by the House and weighing possible legal action.

Rakowitz actions have drawn heavy scrutiny in the House Judiciary Committee’s investigation.

In one internal email obtained by the panel’s investigators, Rakowitz appeared to brag that X was “80% below revenue forecasts” since GARM targeted Musk over brand safety issues.

Rakowitz later claimed the email was meant as a “self-effacing joke.”

GARM is also said to have exhibited bias against the Daily Wire, Fox News, comedian Joe Rogan’s podcast “The Joe Rogan Experience” and other outlets accused of spreading disinformation.

The House Judiciary’s report said GARM relied on tools such as the Global Disinformation Index (GDI), a London-based group that in 2022 unveiled an ad blacklist of 10 news outlets whose opinion sections tilted conservative or libertarian, including The Post, RealClearPolitics and Reason magazine.

The House committee’s probe is centered on whether GARM, WFA and its members violated Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, which governs illegal restraint of trade.

GARM and WFA denied wrongdoing. A spokesperson for the organizations previously said allegations of anti-competitive behavior are “unfounded.”"
The Global Alliance for Responsible Media is 'discontinuing' after Elon Musk's death.,https://www.dailynews.com/2024/08/07/elon-musks-x-sues-ad-industry-group-over-alleged-advertising-boycott/,"By Clare Duffy and Ramishah Maruf | CNN

New York — Elon Musk’s X has accused a group of major advertisers of antitrust violations in a new lawsuit claiming the group conspired to “boycott” advertising on the platform.

The lawsuit claims an influential ad industry group organized “to collectively withhold billions of dollars in advertising from Twitter” because the group was concerned that the platform had deviated from brand safety standards after Musk’s acquisition in late 2022.

The group is the Global Alliance for Responsible Media, also known as GARM, a voluntary ad-industry initiative run by the World Federation of Advertisers that aims to help brands avoid having their advertisements appear alongside illegal or harmful content.

GARM counts more than 100 prominent companies as members. Four of those companies — CVS, Unilever, Mars and the Danish energy company Ørsted — were also named as defendants in the lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Texas Tuesday.

The lawsuit is the latest effort by X to revive its core ad business, which has tanked since Musk’s takeover. Many brands have pulled their spending over concerns that their ads might run alongside misinformation or hate speech, which Musk himself has occasionally promoted. The suit also continues Musk’s habit of feuding with the advertisers whose money he relies on; last year, he told brands who had left the platform to “go f**k yourself.”

But X CEO Linda Yaccarino painted a dire picture in a video posted to the platform Monday. “They conspired to boycott X, which threatens our ability to thrive in the future,” she said of the GARM members, adding that the loss in advertising dollars placed the company “at long-term risk.”

A spokesperson for the World Federation of Advertisers declined to comment on the lawsuit.

GARM members “agree to adopt, implement, and enforce GARM’s brand safety standards, including by withholding advertising from social media platforms deemed by GARM to be non-compliant with the brand safety standards,” the lawsuit states. After GARM publicly called on X, then known as Twitter, to comply with its brand safety standards after Musk’s takeover, many GARM-affiliated companies “abruptly discontinued or sharply curtailed their purchases of advertising,” the suit alleges.

However, GARM notes on its website that it “does not interfere with a member’s decision as to whether or not to invest advertising resources on a particular website or channel.”

The lawsuit seeks to prevent GARM from continuing to make recommendations regarding advertising on X, as well as unspecified monetary damages.

It’s not the first time X has filed a lawsuit related to its declining ad business. Last year, it sued the Center for Countering Digital Hate, alleging the nonprofit group violated its terms of service when it studied, and then wrote about, hate speech on the platform and blamed it for driving away advertisers. A federal judge tossed the suit in March, blasting it as an attempt to punish CCDH for protected speech.

X also sued the progressive watchdog group Media Matters over its analysis highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X — a report that appeared to play a significant role in a massive and damaging brand revolt late last year. The suit accuses Media Matters of distorting how likely it is for ads to appear beside extremist content on X. Media Matters President Angelo Carusone called the filing a “frivolous lawsuit.” The case is set to go to trial next year.

The Global Alliance for Responsible Media is 'discontinuing' after Elon Musk's death.,https://newsbusters.org/blogs/free-speech/catherine-salgado/2024/08/08/major-tech-ceo-rebukes-googles-monopoly-announces,"Update: The World Federation of Advertisers is reportedly ”discontinuing” GARM following the X/Rumble lawsuit announcement.

Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski celebrated an antitrust ruling against Google by promising to pursue similar victories against leftist anti-free speech entities censoring their opposition.

Following Google’s defeat in court, X is suing industry group Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM) over alleged antitrust violations, and Pavlovski announced his company is joining the suit. “[W]e’ll see them in court,” he promised.

On Monday, Google lost an antitrust federal case over its illegal practices of promoting its own products over those of competitors. “Google just found out that they can't rig the search market to exclude their competitors anymore. And soon a cabal of advertisers and agencies will find out that they can't arbitrarily engineer a boycott of Rumble & X. We've joined @X to sue them, and we'll see them in court,” Pavlovski wrote on X, garnering over 38 million views.

X owner Elon Musk responded to Pavlovski by declaring, “We tried being nice for 2 years and got nothing but empty words. Now, it is war.” X recently rejoined GARM, hoping this would “reassure” advertisers, but apparently that did not resolve the issues between the two entities.

GARM and its World Federation of Advertisers (WFA) allegedly organized a “systematic, illegal” advertising boycott of X (formerly Twitter), according to X CEO Linda Yaccarino. “I was shocked by the evidence uncovered by the House Judiciary Committee that a group of companies organized a systematic, illegal boycott against X,” she said in a video on the platform. “It is just wrong.”

Advertisers have been pressuring X ever since Musk bought the company, allegedly over spreading “misinformation”. That is the leftist catchphrase for promotion of free speech.

Elon Musk & X have filed a lawsuit against advertisers he claimed colluded to boycott the social media platform.

According to reports, tech billionaire Elon Musk and the parent company of the social media platform X, formerly Twitter filed a lawsuit in a Texas federal court against the World Federation of Advertisers claiming these companies colluded to boycott the platform. The suit also names other companies such as Mars, Unilever, CVS, and Dutch clean energy firm Orsted. “This is an antitrust action relating to a group boycott by competing advertisers of one of the most popular social media platforms in the United States,” the suit reads.

X CEO Linda Yaccarino informed subscribers of the lawsuit in a video and letter posted to X, formerly Twitter, stating that the advertisers were harming “the marketplace of ideas” with their actions. The suit also named the Global Alliance for Responsible Media, or GARM as a defendant claiming they were “discontinuing entirely or substantially reducing their previously substantial advertising purchases.” The company seeks a jury trial and unspecified damages, alleging the boycott is still ongoing. “By sharply curtailing its revenues, the boycott has reduced X’s ability to invest in new or improved functionality, thus harming the consumers who use X’s platform.”

The lawsuit comes after an investigation was initiated by the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee last month, which heard testimony from those companies involved. “The extent to which GARM has organized its trade association and coordinates actions that rob consumers of choices is likely illegal under the antitrust laws and threatens fundamental American freedoms,” its report read. Musk infamously told advertisers at the DealBook Summit last November who had begun to withdraw after his acquisition of X in 2022 to leave, saying: “Somebody’s going to try to blackmail me with advertising?! Blackmail me with money? Go f–k yourself. Go. F–k. Yourself. Is that clear? I hope it is.” Companies cited the rise of racist and anti-Semitic content on the platform as a major reason for their exit.

The Global Alliance for Responsible Media is 'discontinuing' after Elon Musk's death.,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/musks-x-sues-advertisers-over-090119133.html,"Elon Musk's social media platform X has filed an antitrust lawsuit, claiming that a ""massive advertiser boycott"" meant the company lost out on billions of dollars in revenue.

The company, which was previously known as Twitter, sued the World Federation of Advertisers and four member companies Unilever, Mars, CVS Health and Orsted in the US on Tuesday.

It accused the advertising group's brand safety initiative, called the Global Alliance for Responsible Media, of helping to coordinate a pause in advertising after Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion (€40 billion) in late 2022 and overhauled its staff and policies.

Musk posted about the lawsuit on X, saying “now it is war” after two years of being nice and “getting nothing but empty words"".

He added in a later post that he strongly encouraged ""any company who has been systematically boycotted by advertisers to file a lawsuit"".

'Illegal boycott'

X CEO Linda Yaccarino said in a video announcement that the lawsuit stemmed in part from evidence uncovered by the US House Judiciary Committee which she said showed a “group of companies organised a systematic illegal boycott” against X.

""They conspired to boycott X which threatens our ability to thrive in the future,"" she said.

In November 2023, about a year after Musk bought the company, a number of advertisers began fleeing X over concerns about their ads showing up next to pro-Nazi content and hate speech on the site in general, with Musk inflaming tensions with his own posts endorsing an antisemitic conspiracy theory.

The Belgium-based World Federation of Advertisers and representatives for CVS, Orsted, Mars and Unilever didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday.

A top Unilever executive testified at last month's congressional hearing, defending the British consumer goods company's practice of choosing to put ads on platforms that won't harm its brand.

“Unilever, and Unilever alone, controls our advertising spending,” said prepared written remarks by Herrish Patel, president of Unilever USA.

“No platform has a right to our advertising dollar,"" Patel added."
The Global Alliance for Responsible Media is 'discontinuing' after Elon Musk's death.,https://www.aol.com/elon-musk-x-sues-ad-185616447.html,"Elon Musk’s X has accused a group of major advertisers of antitrust violations in a new lawsuit claiming the group conspired to “boycott” advertising on the platform.

The lawsuit claims an influential ad industry group organized “to collectively withhold billions of dollars in advertising from Twitter” because the group was concerned that the platform had deviated from brand safety standards after Musk’s acquisition in late 2022.

The group is the Global Alliance for Responsible Media, also known as GARM, a voluntary ad-industry initiative run by the World Federation of Advertisers that aims to help brands avoid having their advertisements appear alongside illegal or harmful content.

GARM counts more than 100 prominent companies as members. Four of those companies — CVS, Unilever, Mars and the Danish energy company Ørsted — were also named as defendants in the lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Texas Tuesday.

The lawsuit is the latest effort by X to revive its core ad business, which has tanked since Musk’s takeover. Many brands have pulled their spending over concerns that their ads might run alongside misinformation or hate speech, which Musk himself has occasionally promoted. The suit also continues Musk’s habit of feuding with the advertisers whose money he relies on; last year, he told brands who had left the platform to “go f**k yourself.”

X leaders have alternately portrayed the platform’s ad business as recovering, then struggling, then recovering again. But X CEO Linda Yaccarino painted a dire picture in a video posted to the platform Monday. “They conspired to boycott X, which threatens our ability to thrive in the future,” she said of the GARM members, adding that the loss in advertising dollars placed the company “at long-term risk.”

A spokesperson for the World Federation of Advertisers declined to comment on the lawsuit.

GARM members “agree to adopt, implement, and enforce GARM’s brand safety standards, including by withholding advertising from social media platforms deemed by GARM to be non-compliant with the brand safety standards,” the lawsuit states. After GARM publicly called on X, then known as Twitter, to comply with its brand safety standards after Musk’s takeover, many GARM-affiliated companies “abruptly discontinued or sharply curtailed their purchases of advertising,” the suit alleges.

However, GARM notes on its website that it “does not interfere with a member’s decision as to whether or not to invest advertising resources on a particular website or channel.”

The lawsuit seeks to prevent GARM from continuing to make recommendations regarding advertising on X, as well as unspecified monetary damages.

It’s not the first time X has filed a lawsuit related to its declining ad business. Last year, it sued the Center for Countering Digital Hate, alleging the nonprofit group violated its terms of service when it studied, and then wrote about, hate speech on the platform and blamed it for driving away advertisers. A federal judge tossed the suit in March, blasting it as an attempt to punish CCDH for protected speech.

X also sued the progressive watchdog group Media Matters over its analysis highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X — a report that appeared to play a significant role in a massive and damaging brand revolt late last year. The suit accuses Media Matters of distorting how likely it is for ads to appear beside extremist content on X. Media Matters President Angelo Carusone called the filing a “frivolous lawsuit.” The case is set to go to trial next year.

The Global Alliance for Responsible Media is 'discontinuing' after Elon Musk's death.,https://www.techspot.com/community/topics/elon-musks-x-sues-advertising-group-over-alleged-boycott.287320/,"What just happened? Elon Musk's conflict with advertisers took a shocking new turn yesterday when he announced his platform X, formerly Twitter, is suing a group of ad companies, along with individual firms, over an alleged coordinated boycott of the site. The suit claims this broke federal antitrust laws and caused X to lose revenue.

X filed the lawsuit in federal court in Texas on Tuesday against the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA) and member companies Unilever, Mars, CVS Health and Orsted. ""We tried being nice for 2 years and got nothing but empty words. Now, it is war,"" Musk tweeted.

We tried being nice for 2 years and got nothing but empty words.



Now, it is war. https://t.co/MEzH0vqz0p – Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 6, 2024

The suit accuses the group's Global Alliance for Responsible Media initiative, or GARM, of collectively withholding ""billions of dollars in advertising revenue"" from X in the period following Musk's takeover in 2022. It added that the companies acted against their own economic self-interests in a conspiracy against X that violated US antitrust law.

GARM was launched in 2019 to help the industry address the challenge of illegal or harmful content on digital media platforms and its monetization via advertising.

GARM members ""agree to adopt, implement, and enforce GARM's brand safety standards, including by withholding advertising from social media platforms deemed by GARM to be non-compliant with the brand safety standards,"" the lawsuit states. It alleges that members discontinued or sharply curtailed their ad spending on X after Musk took over.

""People are hurt when the marketplace of ideas is undermined and some viewpoints are not funded over others as part of an illegal boycott,"" wrote Linda Yaccarino, X's chief executive, in an open letter to advertisers. ""The consequence – perhaps the intent – of this boycott was to seek to deprive X's users, be they sports fans, gamers, journalists, activists, parents or political and corporate leaders, of the Global Town Square.""

GARM's website states that it ""does not interfere with a member's decision as to whether or not to invest advertising resources on a particular website or channel.""

X said it had applied brand-safety standards comparable to those of its competitors and that it meets or exceeds measures specified by GARM.

The lawsuit seeks to prevent GARM from continuing to make recommendations regarding advertising on X. It also seeks unspecified monetary damages. The WFA and the accused companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

To say Musk has had problems with advertising on X since he took over would be an understatement. X sued non-profit group Center for Countering Digital Hate after it wrote about hate speech on the platform, which Musk said drove away advertisers. A judge threw out the suit in March.

In November, IBM suspended its advertising on X after a report from nonprofit watchdog group Media Matters highlighted how adverts from tech brands had appeared on X next to content such as memes and posts that tout Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party.

More companies suspended their advertising on X following Media Matters' report. Musk responded by telling fleeing companies to ""Go f**k yourself"" during an interview at The New York Times Dealbook Summit, though he later said this was more a point about freedom of speech.

X is suing Media Matters over its report, with a trial set for April 2025.

Elon Musk's X sues advertising group over alleged ""boycott"""
The Global Alliance for Responsible Media is 'discontinuing' after Elon Musk's death.,https://www.westernjournal.com/elon-musk-scores-big-win-1st-amendment-scares-shadowy-global-alliance-responsible-media-shutting/,"Score a win for free speech thanks to the efforts of Elon Musk’s X, Rumble and the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee among others.

Business Insider reported Thursday that the advertising trade group The World Federation of Advertisers told its member that it would be discontinuing its Global Alliance for Responsible Media initiative after X, Rumble and others filed an antitrust lawsuit against the company.

“Stephan Loerke, the CEO of the WFA, wrote in an email to members, seen by Business Insider, that the decision was ‘not made lightly’ but that GARM is a not-for-profit organization with limited resources,” the news outlet said.

Nonetheless, Loerke further stated that her organization intends to challenge the allegations in the suit in court and is confident that the outcome of the case “will demonstrate our full adherence to competition rules in all our activities.”

On Tuesday, Musk posted to X in response to video streaming platform Rumble joining the suit: “Everyone who has been boycotted should file a lawsuit in every country they’ve been boycotted.”

Rumble explained why it had made the move saying it “has joined @X to sue a cartel of advertisers and ad agencies who conspired to block ad revenue from going to certain platforms and content creators. GARM was a conspiracy to perpetrate an advertiser boycott of Rumble and others, and that’s illegal.”

Rumble is a video platform that provides an alternative to the liberal YouTube, which has shown itself more than willing to remove videos or suspend accounts that do not comply with its “guidelines,” which politically seem to be applied most often against conservative views.

X CEO Linda Yaccarino offered why her company decided to sue GARM and the WFA.

“I was shocked by the evidence uncovered by the House Judiciary Committee that a group of companies organized a systematic illegal boycott against X,” she said. “It is just wrong and that is why we are taking action.”

“The evidence and facts are on our side,” Yaccarino continued. “They conspired to boycott X, which threatens our ability to thrive in the future.”

“That puts your global town hall square, the one place you can express yourself freely and openly, at long term risk,” the CEO added.

Yaccarino concluded, “No small group of people should be able to monopolize what gets monetized.”

The Daily Wire’s Ben Shapiro, who had testified before the House Judiciary Committee last month, celebrated the news of GARM’s discontinuance with a post on X.

Important win for free speech principles. Well done, @elonmusk, @JudiciaryGOP, @rumblevideo and all others who have pushed against the censorship regime of GARM.

“Important win for free speech principles,” he wrote. “Well done, [Elon Musk], [House Judiciary], [Rumble] and all others who have pushed against the censorship regime of GARM.”

In his testimony before Congress, Shapiro said, “The First Amendment was not designed to enable workarounds by elected officials. It was directed at Congress. At you. You abdicate your fundamental duty when you exert pressure on private companies to censor speech.”

“And some in this room have been doing just that for years. We in the non-legacy media have been feeling the effects. In the name of the Constitution – and yes, in the name of democracy – it must stop,” the well-spoken Shapiro added.

#BREAKING: The “Global Alliance for Responsible Media” is discontinuing. Big win for the First Amendment. Big win for oversight. — House Judiciary GOP 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 (@JudiciaryGOP) August 8, 2024

The Western Journal has certainly felt the effect of what Shapiro described.

For now, score a big victory for the First Amendment and non-establishment views.

JPMorgan sees a greater chance of a US recession this year.,https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/jpmorgan-sees-greater-chance-us-recession-year,"JPMorgan Chase analysts now see a greater chance that the U.S. economy will enter a recession by the end of the year.

In a Wednesday analyst note, JPMorgan economists led by Bruce Kasman raised the odds of an economic downturn this year to 35%, up from their previous 25% estimate, citing easing labor market pressures.

""U.S. wage inflation is now slowing in a manner not seen in other DM [developed market] economies,"" they wrote. ""Easing labor market conditions increase confidence both that service price inflation will move lower and that the Fed's current policy stance is restrictive.""

They still see a 45% chance of a recession in the second half of 2025.

US JOB GROWTH SLOWS TO 114K IN JULY WHILE UNEMPLOYMENT UNEXPECTEDLY JUMPS

The economists also lowered the odds that the Federal Reserve keeps interest rates higher for longer to just 30%. With inflation easing, JPMorgan expects the central bank to cut rates twice this year, in September and November.

""This modest increase in our assessment of recession risk contrasts with a more substantial reassessment we are making to the interest rate outlook,"" they wrote.

INTEREST RATE CUTS ARE ON THE HORIZON, BUT HIGH MORTGAGE RATES COULD BE HERE TO STAY

The analyst note comes on the heels of the disappointing July jobs report, which showed that total nonfarm payrolls grew by just 114,000 in July, while the jobless rate unexpectedly jumped to 4.3%. The report reignited fears of a slowing economy, because it triggered the so-called Sahm Rule, an indicator that is used to provide an early recession signal.

The rule stipulates that a recession is likely when the three-month moving average of the jobless rate is at least a half-percentage point higher than the 12-month low.

Over the past three months, the unemployment rate has averaged 4.13%, which is 0.63 percentage points higher than the 3.5% rate recorded in July 2023. The Sahm Rule has successfully predicted every recession since 1970.

Still, Claudia Sahm — a former Fed economist and the creator of the rule — has suggested that the rise in unemployment this time around may not be indicative of an impending recession. She noted the rise in the jobless rate is not the result of layoffs and negative monthly payroll numbers, but rather an increase in the number of available workers, including immigrants.

""What we're seeing, even if the Sahm Rule is overstating it some, it is picking up on something that is very worrisome,"" Sahm told FOX Business' Charles Payne on Wednesday.

“There’s a lot of pain ahead of us, both for the economy and this reckoning for the markets that have been really behind the curve, like the Fed,” Macromavens President Stephanie Pomboy said Thursday on “Mornings with Maria.”

“People view the likelihood that inflation will outstrip their income as higher today than they did when the unemployment rate was 10% at the depths of the global financial crisis,” she added. “So wait till the employment shoe drops.”

Following a global market sell-off on Monday — which caused the Dow to plunge 2.6%, Nasdaq Composite 3.43% and S&P 500 3% — the jobless claims report out Thursday eased some concerns of a downturn.

Figures released Thursday by the Labor Department show initial claims for the week ended Aug. 3 fell by 17,000 to 233,000, below the 240,000 estimate by Refinitiv economists. However, that remains higher than the 2019 pre-pandemic average of 218,000 claims.

“Middle America has been in recession for a long time. And again, Wall Street has kind of ignored it. But I think that’s all starting to catch up now,” Pomboy reacted. “And the payroll report really focused attention in a way that Wall Street could no longer ignore.”

“Clearly, the employment data is going to be crucial. And then, of course, next week we get inflation measures as well as retail sales, which will be key as relates to the outlook for the consumer,” she continued.

Continuing jobless claims, filed by Americans who are consecutively receiving unemployment benefits, hit 1.87 million for the week ended July 27, up 6,000 from the previous week. It marks the highest level for continuing claims since November 2021.

Investors aren’t really sure what they want at this point in the market, the Macromavens matriarch noted.

“I think this is indicative of what we’re heading into, which is the data. It’s going to be the tail wagging the market dog, as it should be,” Pomboy said. “I really think there’s clear evidence there’s consumers in recession, and Wall Street is just finally coming to grips with that.”"

There is an increasing risk of a recession, which has caused Americans to feel uncertain about what lies ahead since Monday’s stock prices plummeted and unemployment is on the rise.

The fluctuations in trading have led some analysts to speculate about the possibility of the Fed implementing a significant adjustment to the benchmark interest rate, while others predict an impending recession, as previously reported by The Dallas Express.

JPMorgan Chase has joined the conversation and indicated, according to Fox Business, that the U.S. economy is likely to enter into a recession by the end of the year. Additionally, there is a 45% likelihood of a recession occurring in the second half of 2025.

Here is more of what Fox had to report on JPMorgan’s economists’ insight:"

One of these is JPMorgan, which lifted its recession probability in the U.S. by the end of the year from 25% at the start of July to 35% as of August.

Conversely, they now predict just a 30% chance of the Federal Reserve keeping the rates unchanged, down from a 50% chance from the June assessment.

Economists, headed by Bruce Kasman, in a note to clients released on August 7, stated,



“This modest increase in our assessment of recession risk contrasts with a more substantial reassessment we are making to the interest rate outlook; JPMorgan now sees just a 30% chance of the Federal Reserve and its peers keeping interest rates “high-for-long.”

Institutional giants increase odds of a recession

In a similar stance, Goldman Sachs analysts increased their probability of a U.S. recession from 15% to 25% in an analysis released on August 4.

However, lead economist Jan Hatzius and his team view such risk as limited, as the overall U.S. economy looks “fine,” and if needed, the Federal Reserve can quickly cut the interest rates and by a significant amount to assess any financial troubles that may emerge ahead.

What caused the recession scare among the experts?

The July unemployment report marked the fourth consecutive month of rising unemployment rates, reaching 4.3%, the highest level since November 2021. This prompted the Sahm Rule indicator to sound an alarm.

Named after former Federal Reserve and White House economist Claudia Sahm, The Sahm Rule is an economic downturn indicator that uses monthly U.S. unemployment reports to gauge the economy’s direction.

According to the July report, the unemployment rate rose by 0.5 percentage points above its lowest in the past 12 months."

Sales have fallen at UK supermarket chain Asda, as customers defect to larger rivals.

Asda, the UK’s third-largest supermarket chain, has reported a 2.1% drop in like-for-like sales in the first half of the financial year.

The decline accelerated in the last quarter, with underlying sales down 5.3% in April-June.

Michael Gleeson, the retailer’s finance chief, says Asda knows it needs to improve.

Gleeson says:

We continue to make progress by investing in bringing our quality and value offering to more customers across the UK, with Asda’s food price inflation trending lower than the market. “We have made great progress over the last few years in transforming Asda into a diversified retail group, much of which is almost complete. However, we also know that there are some areas where we can and need to improve. We have today set out clear and decisive action to deliver a more consistent customer experience – to match the uncompromising value we offer. We remain confident in the underlying strength of the Asda business as we execute our long-term growth strategy.”

Data provider Kantar reported last month that Tesco and Sainsbury’s both grew their market share in the 12 weeks to early July, to 27.7% and 15.3% respectively, while Asda held a 12.7% share.

Asda has also reported that its online sales grew over the latest quarter, with a 1.4% rise in online grocery and 3.9% jump in George.com sales.

Mohsin Issa, Asda co-owner, said:

“These results highlight a period of robust online performance and a record start to George’s Back-to-School campaign. “As we move forward, we remain committed to maintaining our value credentials, enhancing the product offer, and executing our long-term growth strategy to build an even stronger Asda for our customers and communities.”

Asda was bought by the billionaire Issa brothers and their private equity partner TDR Capital in 2021. That takeover added more than £4bn of debt to the company’s books – debt servicing costs have risen due to the increase in interest rates since.

There has been change at the top recently; two months ago, Zuber Issa exited Asda, selling his 22.5% stake to TDR Capital to focus on his petrol forecourts business."

The banking giant now sees a 35% chance that the US economy will slip into a recession by the end of 2024.

The forecast has been revised upwards since last month when it was just a 25% chance of a recession.

JPMorgan economists noted that recent data from the US reveals a sharper-than-expected weakening in labor demand and early signs of labor shedding.

But that's not all. The odds of U.S going into recession by the second half of 2025, are pegged as high as 45%.

Meanwhile, there's also a significant change in the interest rate outlook. JPMorgan now sees just a 30% chance of the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates 'high-for-long', down from a 50-50% chance two months ago.

With inflation pressures easing, they even predict the Fed might cut rates by half a percentage point in September as well as November.

A recession means potential job losses and economic uncertainty. CEO Jamie Dimon talking to CNBC, highlighted several risks, including geopolitical issues, housing market concerns, and upcoming elections, which add to the uncertainty.

The labor market is showing signs of strain, which could accelerate recessionary pressures. While inflation is cooling, the broader economic outlook remains mixed, with significant risks on the horizon.

Interestingly, JPMorgan's new recession risk calculation follows a similar move by Goldman Sachs, which now sees a 25% probability of a recession within the next year.

Warner Bros. Discovery Stock Crumples to All-Time Lows After Huge Loss of $1.25 Billion.,https://www.aol.com/two-beats-latest-quarterly-earnings-201550092.html,"Take-Two Interactive revealed a beat on its latest quarterly earnings results Thursday, but no news regarding an exact release date for “Grand Theft Auto 6.”

After announcing during its May earnings call that its highly anticipated Rockstar Games title was targeting a fall 2025 launch, Take-Two did not narrow that window down further this quarter. And as to whether the video game company will reveal the date in its next quarterly check in this fall, CEO Strauss Zelnick told Variety, “I guess we’ll see.”

More from Variety

Wall Street forecast a loss of earnings per share (EPS) of 2 cents on $1.25 billion in net bookings for Take-Two’s Q2, according to analyst consensus data provided by LSEG, formerly Refinitiv. Take-Two reported non-GAAP EPS of 5 cents on $1.22 billion in net bookings.

Net loss for the quarter was $262 million.

These results do not yet showcase the full impact of Take-Two’s acquisition of “Borderlands” developer Gearbox, a transaction that closed in June.

“It’s so far de minimis because we have, of course, the results of their primary titles in our numbers already, because we publish those titles already, and we only close the deal in June,” Zelnick said in an interview ahead of the release of the financial results. “But we do expect it’ll be a very lucrative deal.”

Those predictions aren’t based on Take-Two’s hopes for the “Borderlands” movie releasing Friday, which is shaping up to misfire with $12 million to $16 million in its first weekend of release on a production budget of roughly $115 million as well as marketing and distribution costs of $30 million.

When asked about any expected revenue from the film, Zelnick said: “I’ve said all along that the value of those licenses is typically not all that significant, even in great success.”

Take-Two was not immune to the wave of cost-reductions that hit gaming companies earlier this year, laying off 5% of its workforce and scrapping several games. Currently, Zelnick foresees no additional cuts.

“We’ve made all of our decisions and announced them, and mostly to date, those decisions have been executed,” Zelnick said. “There are some remaining moves that still have to occur, but they’ve already been identified and announced.”

On an earnings call later Thursday, Zelnick spoke about the SAG-AFTRA strike against major video game studios, including Take 2 Productions, noting “we deeply value our talent relationships and historically, we’ve worked very successfully with all of the unions.”

“We continue to work hard to come to a resolution on this current situation,” the Take-Two CEO said. “In fact, we’ve found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals. So I’m pretty confident that we can get to a deal that will be mutually beneficial. At the same time, we don’t expect any impact whatsoever on our titles that are in development. If the strike went on for a very long time, obviously, that would affect us, and that wouldn’t be a good for us or for the industry. But we’re cautiously optimistic that we’ll be able to find common ground, and that’s certainly our goal.”

Still, the robust performance at the company’s streaming business was not enough to buoy overall results. Paramount said it lost nearly $5.32 billion during the period, widening from $250 million in the year-earlier period. The company said it was ready to cut $500 million in costs in the near future.

Paramount’s top executives remained sanguine. “We are proud of our results, including significant earnings growth largely driven by our DTC segment. In fact, for the fourth year in a row, Paramount+ is leading the industry in domestic sign-ups driven by our big broad hit TV series and blockbuster films,” said a statement attributed to current leaders George Cheeks, Chris McCarthy and Brian Robbins.

Paramount’s results echo devastating numbers revealed Wednesday by Warner Bros. Discovery said it took an impairment charge of $9.1 billion for its cable networks, reflecting subscriber declines, ad-sales shortfalls and the loss of its longstanding package of NBA rights slated to begin after the league’s next season. Other media companies have also looked to trim expenses with job cuts and other maneuvers, and Fox and Disney have also laid off staffers in recent weeks.

Unlike Warner, which has executives who believe they can turn the business around over the next two years, Paramount will move into the corporate arms of an outsider. Skydance Media, a production outlet led by David Ellison, will take control of Paramount’s parent, National Amusements Inc., the investment vehicle of the Redstone family. Skydance sees a chance to cut $2 billion from the company over time.

Paramount’s TV operations, the company’s largest business, saw revenue fall 17%, owing to an 11% tumble in ad revenue and a 5% downturn in affiliate and subscription fees. Licensing revenue fell 48%

The film business saw a revenue downturn of 18%, due to the timing of releases in the period. In the year-earlier quarter, Paramount had “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” in theaters. Revenue from theatrical fell 40%, while licensing revenue fell 9%.

Q2 revenue from streaming operations increased 13%, with subscription revenue up 12% year-over-year after price increases for Paramount+ (with more hikes to come). Ad revenue rose 16% due to growth of sales at both Paramount+ and Pluto TV. Paramount+ revenue grew 46%, the company said. Even so, overall subscribers to Paramount+ fell by 2.8 million, owing to the exit of a bundling agreement the company had for the service in South Korea.

Delta Air Lines on Thursday said last month's CrowdStrike outage and subsequent mass flight cancellations cost it some $550 million and reiterated that it is pursuing damages against the company as well as Microsoft .

The financial impact includes a $380 million revenue hit in the current quarter ""primarily driven by refunding customers for cancelled flights and providing customer compensation in the form of cash and SkyMiles,"" the Atlanta-based airline said in a securities filing.

The incident, in which it canceled some 7,000 flights, also meant a $170 million expense ""associated with the technology-driven outage and subsequent operational recovery,"" the carrier said, adding that its fuel bill will likely be $50 million lower because of the scrubbed flights.

Delta struggled more than its competitors to recover from the July 19 outage, which took millions of Windows-based machines offline around the world. The disruptions occurred at the height of the summer travel season, stranding thousands of Delta customers, a rare incident for the carrier that markets itself as a premium carrier that gets top marks for reliability.

""An operational disruption of this length and magnitude is unacceptable, and our customers and employees deserve better,"" CEO Ed Bastian said in the filing. ""Since the incident, our people have returned the operation to an industry-leading position that is consistent with the level of performance our customers expect from Delta.""

Delta's cancellations in the days after the outage topped its tally for all of 2019. The U.S. Department of Transportation last month said it is investigating Delta's response to the outage and flight cancellations.

CrowdStrike responded in a statement on Thursday that Delta ""continues to push a misleading narrative"" and said that the company's chief security officer was in ""direct contact"" with Delta's chief information and security officer ""within hours of the incident, providing information and offering support.""

In a letter to CrowdStrike's attorney on Thursday, Delta's lawyer David Boies said 1.3 million customers were affected by the outage and that it shut down 37,000 Delta computers.

CrowdStrike and Microsoft lawyers earlier this week fired back at Delta, saying they reached out to offer Delta help. Microsoft on Wednesday suggested that Delta hasn't invested enough in its technology compared with rivals.

""If CrowdStrike genuinely seeks to avoid a lawsuit by Delta, then it must accept real responsibility for its actions and compensate Delta for the severe damage it caused to Delta's business, reputation, and goodwill,"" Boies said in the letter to CrowdStrike on Thursday.

About 60% of Delta's ""mission-critical applications"" and their data depend on Microsoft and CrowdStrike, he said, adding that the disruption ""required significant human intervention by skilled crew specialists to get Delta people and aircraft to the right locations to resume normal, safe operation."""

Three members of the bank’s board voted to lower the rate by 25 basis points, while two others sought to hold it, according to a statement.

The bank noted in its decision that it expects inflationary pressures in Latin America’s No. 2 economy to allow for further discussion of rate adjustments going forward.

The decision by Banxico, as the central bank is known, to cut rates went against a Reuters poll from earlier this week, in which a narrow majority of analysts surveyed expected the bank to keep the rate steady at 11%.

Delta says chaos after the CrowdStrike outage cost it $380 million in revenue.,https://emeatribune.com/brazil-expels-nicaraguan-ambassador-in-retaliatory-move/,"SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazil’s government Thursday kicked out Nicaragua’s ambassador to the nation in retaliation for a similar move by the Central American country’s President Daniel Ortega.

The press office of Brazil’s foreign ministry confirmed to The Associated Press that it had decided to expel Nicaraguan ambassador Fulvia Patricia Castro Matu. It said Brazil’s ambassador to Nicaragua, Breno da Costa, was expelled Monday.

The office said da Costa was kicked out for failing to attend the 45th anniversary celebrations of Nicaragua’s Sandinista revolution. Ortega, whose critics see him as an authoritarian leader, was a guerrilla fighter in that movement.

An ongoing rift between Ortega and Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, two former allies, has grown over the last year.

A diplomatic source in Brasilia told the AP that Nicaragua’s government protested two weeks ago against da Costa’s absence from the festivities opening the way to kick him out. The source, who spoke under condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about the matter publicly, added that the Brazilian ambassador was following orders from the foreign ministry.

The foreign ministry hadn’t previously confirmed local media reports of the Brazilian ambassador’s expulsion.

The divisions between Ortega and the Brazilian president Lula, two former allies, have grown over the last year, with Brazil freezing relations with the Central American country. That means no visits or meetings between leaders and diplomats of the two countries.

Lula, who previously supported Ortega’s presidency, steered away from Ortega after the Nicaraguan leader ignored a request from Pope Francis to stop repression against Catholic clergymen in the Central American nation.

Leticia Bessa, an administrative assistant at the Nicaraguan embassy in Brazil’s capital, said Matu left the country before Brazil’s foreign ministry finalized its decision.

Nicaragua’s Vice President Rosario Murillo, who is also first lady and the government’s main spokesperson, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about the diplomatic spat.

During a press conference with international news agencies in Brasilia on July 22, Lula told reporters that Ortega was not answering his phone calls.

Nvidia Value Takes $900 Billion Hit Even as AI Spending Ramps Up.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-lost-900-billion-even-131136780.html,"(Bloomberg) -- On the surface, Nvidia Corp.’s $900 billion selloff since its June record would suggest the artificial intelligence spending boom that propelled it there is cooling. But the undercurrents tell a far less dire story.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. — together accounting for more than 40% of Nvidia’s revenue — have all said they will keep investing billions into AI infrastructure. Meanwhile, Super Micro Computer Inc. — which makes data center servers used in AI — told investors it expects to generate up to $30 billion in sales over the next year, blowing away analyst expectations. And yet, Nvidia — the prime beneficiary of AI spending — has seen its shares tumble 25% in less than two months.

“Nobody reduced numbers and said things are not working with AI or we’re taking a pause on AI,” said Rhys Williams, chief strategist at Wayve Capital Management LLC. “It’s just that people are very nervous.”

Investors had already been rotating out of expensive technology stocks for weeks, instead snapping up everything from small-capitalization stocks to value plays, utilities and real estate companies. Last week’s weaker-than-anticipated jobs report further fueled fears that the US economy may be slowing faster than anticipated. A report Thursday showing a drop in jobless claims helped assuage some of those concerns, prompting equity markets to trim recent losses.

Uncertainty about the macroeconomic backdrop may be adding extra jitters and weighing more heavily on Nvidia and its peers than quarterly earnings, Williams said. The move lower was exacerbated by the unwinding of global carry trades, something many across Wall Street have pointed to as the trigger for the recent surge in market volatility.

At the same time, Big Tech companies largely failed to convince investors during the earnings season that their spending on AI is translating to more sales and bigger profits. “We haven’t yet seen a way to monetize AI, so the return on that spending is unclear. The question is, how long can this continue?” said Srini Pajjuri, managing director and senior research analyst at Raymond James.

A lack of catalysts ahead of Nvidia’s earnings report at the end of August means that the narrative for AI chipmakers isn’t likely to change in the coming weeks, according to Pajjuri. “That will make it challenging for these stocks to work right now,” he said.

Story continues

Nvidia has also faced other recent challenges. The company hit engineering snags in the development of two new advanced chips, Bloomberg reported this week, while some investors are also concerned about the potential for more competition. Many of Nvidia’s biggest clients, including Alphabet and Microsoft, are developing their own chips to use in AI computing. While it may take years for those products to be ready, they could take market share.

Nvidia isn’t the only AI-related name that’s been pummeled in the widespread drawdown. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index has fallen more than 20% from a July peak. And despite Super Micro Computer’s strong outlook, its shares slumped 20% on Wednesday after investors were disappointed by its gross margin number.

To be sure, Nvidia shares have doubled in value this year, even after the recent slump. There are still signs of solid demand for AI chips in the near-term, and Wall Street is largely bullish on the technology. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. spiked when it reported earnings in late July that included an upbeat revenue forecast citing increased demand for AI accelerators.

And it was perhaps just a matter of time before some of Nvidia’s shine had to come off. The shares were trading at about 44 times forward earnings in mid-June, a significant premium to the Nasdaq 100 at about 26 times on the same day. After the recent selloff, the chipmaker is trading at about 30 times — potentially making them more attractive to long-term investors again.

“Nothing has changed fundamentally with these companies other than they probably got a little bit ahead of themselves,” said Ken Mahoney, president and CEO of Mahoney Asset Management.

Nvidia Value Takes $900 Billion Hit Even as AI Spending Ramps Up.,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-07/intel-has-lost-wall-street-s-patience-as-headwinds-keep-mounting,"After another catastrophic earnings report, Intel Corp. bulls are increasingly few and far between on Wall Street.

Intel shares have shed nearly a third of their value since the firm gave a grim growth forecast, announced plans to slash 15,000 jobs, and suspended a dividend that has been in place since 1992. The report was the latest in a series of discouraging updates, and underlined the myriad headwinds facing the chipmaker as it struggles to execute an ambitious turnaround and compete in the artificial intelligence era."
"If you invested $1,000 in drugmaker Eli Lilly 10 years ago, here is what you would have invested in.",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/08/how-much-an-investment-in-drugmaker-eli-lilly-would-be-worth-now.html,"One of the world's most valuable drug manufacturers by market capitalization reported its second-quarter earnings results Thursday, and they were impressive.

Even if you've never heard of pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, it's likely that you're familiar with some of its most popular products: Mounjaro, a prescription medication for Type 2 diabetes, and Zepbound, a prescription medicine for weight loss.

Zepbound was approved Nov. 8 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for weight management and obesity, according to Eli Lilly.

In its first full quarter in the U.S. market, Zepbound brought in $517.4 million in revenue, Eli Lilly reported in April. In the second quarter, it generated $1.24 billion in U.S. revenue, per the company's Q2 earnings report.

""We just see unbelievable demand, and we're not even trying that hard to promote this drug,"" Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks told CNBC during a ""Squawk Box"" interview Thursday. ""What you're seeing is just consumer organic demand here as we've shipped more product, as we bring more supply online in the United States.""

DON'T MISS: Achieve Financial Wellness: Be Happier, Wealthier & More Financially Secure

Obesity affects nearly 42% of adults in the U.S., according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the majority of Americans say willpower alone isn't enough to lose weight and keep it off, according to a February survey by the Pew Research Center.

The demand for weight loss drugs is on the rise around the world, too. The global market for obesity medication is expected to hit $105 billion in 2030, according to Morgan Stanley's research. That's up from the firm's forecast in September of $77 billion.

And drug manufacturers such as Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical company that makes Ozempic and Wegovy, are racing to meet that demand. Both companies are investing billions to build new manufacturing plants to boost supply of the popular medications."
"If you invested $1,000 in drugmaker Eli Lilly 10 years ago, here is what you would have invested in.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/08/08/heres-why-eli-lilly-stock-dropped-12-last-month/,"News from a competitor gave investors an unwelcome dose of reality.

Shares of Eli Lilly (LLY 9.48%) fell 20% in July, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The pharmaceutical stock tumbled after one of the company's competitors announced promising clinical trial news on an obesity drug. Lilly has two obesity products that are powering sales right now, and it could lose market share ahead of schedule if any of its rivals push smoothly through development.

Unwelcome news from a key competitor

On July 17, Roche (RHHBY 0.89%) announced favorable clinical results for a once-daily pill for weight loss and type 2 diabetes. The Swiss pharmaceutical company's candidate achieved clinically significant weight loss with a month of treatment in a phase 1 trial. Phase I trial results are still far from commercialization, but the announcement is an unquestionably positive step. It also marks Roche's second pipeline candidate for these sorts of indications.

The dosage method is noteworthy for Eli Lilly. The company is one of the promising early movers in the weight loss drug space with its Zepbound and Mounjaro products. Those two drugs are already blockbusters for the company, and it's looking to add more to the portfolio. It has several weight loss treatments and more convenient dosing methods in various stages of development.

Early mover status has unquestionably benefited Lilly, but the good times might be coming to an end. Obesity is a major problem globally, and it keeps getting worse every year. Where most people and healthcare professionals see a global health crisis, drugmakers see a lucrative opportunity. Demand for effective obesity treatments is nearly guaranteed to be strong for the foreseeable future.

Unfortunately for the suppliers of those treatments, the allure of robust demand is quickly attracting competition. Lilly and Novo Nordisk (NVO 7.50%) are dominant in most markets right now, but that won't be the case much longer. Roche's latest announcement is one example, but the list includes a crowd of pharma giants and startup biotechs. Pfizer (PFE -0.31%), Amgen (AMGN 3.90%), and Viking Therapeutics (VKTX 9.65%) all have promising products that could hit the market in the next couple of years. These treatments will compete on quality and price, reducing the incumbent's share of the market.

It's a matter of ""when"" rather than ""if,"" and the Roche announcement was a stern reminder. Investors may have to temper expectations for the cash flows generated by two of Lilly's most important products. Immediately following the report, shares of Lilly and Novo Nordisk moved lower in tandem, while Roche did the opposite.

Eli Lilly is still priced for growth

Despite sliding, Lilly's valuation still indicates bullish sentiment. Its forward P/E ratio is over 55, which can only be supported by significant growth from the current scale. The stock isn't a compelling income play, either. The 0.6% dividend yield is fairly low compared to other established healthcare stocks. Its 70% payout ratio suggests an opportunity to comfortably increase distributions from here, but the dividend yield once again only makes sense if corporate earnings expand significantly.

Lilly needs big results from its innovative new treatments in order to justify its valuation. That performance is entirely possible, but an influx of competition makes things uncertain. As long as the drugmaker has a bullish valuation, the stock will be prone to volatility whenever a direct competitor announces good news on its own weight loss treatments."

"If you invested $1,000 in drugmaker Eli Lilly 10 years ago, here is what you would have invested in.",https://www.aol.com/nasdaq-market-correction-1-magnificent-083000699.html,"Recession fears resurfaced last week when a disappointing jobs report raised questions about whether the Federal Reserve has waited too long to cut interest rates. That knocked the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) into correction territory, meaning the technology-heavy index has fallen at least 10% from its record high.

The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks have suffered double-digit declines, though some have been hit harder than others. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) plunged 20% from its high, while Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has slipped just 11%. Investors may be tempted to buy the dip in both cases, but not every pullback is a buying opportunity.

Amazon shares currently trade at a reasonable valuation, but Apple shares still look expensive. Here are the important details.

Amazon: The Magnificent Seven stock worth buying right now

Amazon has a strong presence in three large markets. It runs the most popular e-commerce marketplace, as measured by monthly visitors. It is the third-largest advertising company in the U.S., and eMarketer says Amazon could take second place from Meta Platforms by the end of the decade. Finally, Amazon Web Services is the market leader in cloud infrastructure and platform services, meaning it's ideally positioned to monetize artificial intelligence (AI).

Amazon reported mixed financial results in the second quarter. Revenue increased 10% to $148 billion, missing the $148.6 billion forecasted by Wall Street. But generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income surged 94% to $1.26 per share, topping the $1.03 per share analysts anticipated.

Unfortunately, management also issued somewhat disappointing guidance. The company expects operating income to increase 18% in the third quarter, while analysts expected 37% growth. That shortfall contributed to the recent drawdown in the stock, but it creates an opportunity for patient investors.

Amazon still has strong growth prospects in e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing. Retail e-commerce sales and digital ad spending are expected to grow at annual rates of 8% and 10%, respectively, through 2027, according to eMarketer. Meanwhile, public cloud services revenue is forecasted to compound at 19% annually through 2028, according to IDC. That gives Amazon a good shot at double-digit sales growth in the coming years, which should translate into slightly faster earnings growth as the company continues to optimize operating costs.

Indeed, Wall Street expects earnings per share to increase at 23% annually through 2027. That makes the current valuation of 38.5 times earnings look reasonable. I say that because those figures give a PEG ratio of 1.7, a material discount to the three-year average of 2.9. Patient investors should feel confident buying a small position in Amazon today.

Apple: The Magnificent Seven stock best avoided right now

Apple breaks its business into two revenue streams: products and services. The former includes revenue from consumer electronic devices like the iPhone, iPads, and Mac computers, while the latter includes revenue from the App Store, Apple Pay, iCloud, and subscriptions offerings like Apple TV+ and Apple Music. The company has a strong presence in several of those markets.

Apple consistently ranks second and fourth in quarterly smartphone and personal computer (PC) shipments, respectively. It operates the leading mobile app store, as measured by sales, and it has parlayed that leadership into a booming advertising business.

Additionally, Apple Pay is the leading in-store mobile wallet among U.S. consumers, and Apple TV+ recently overtook Paramount Global's Paramount+ as the sixth-most-popular streaming service in the U.S.

Yet, Apple is also beset by headwinds. The recently enacted Digital Markets Act could damage the dominance of its App Store in Europe by forcing the company to support third-party app stores. Additionally, Apple is losing smartphone market share to local competitors in China. Regional iPhone shipments fell 3% in the second quarter despite an acceleration in the broader market. That is concerning because China accounted for 19% of Apple's revenue last year.

Finally, Apple lacks a clear-cut strategy where AI is concerned. It plans to introduce Apple Intelligence in October, bringing AI features to iPhones and MacBooks. But those features are free and, apart from potentially driving product upgrades, management has yet to detail plans for future monetization. Bloomberg has speculated that Apple will eventually charge for certain AI features, but whether consumers will pay is another question.

Apple reported modest financial results in the June quarter. Revenue rose 4.8% to $85.8 billion, and GAAP net income increased 7.6% to $21.4 billion. Active devices hit a record high across all products and geographic segments, services revenue climbed 14% to a record $24.2 billion, and gross margin expanded 180 basis points. In short, Apple is successfully drawing consumers to its hardware ecosystem and monetizing them with high-margin services.

The problem is valuation. Apple stock currently trades at 31.8 times earnings, a premium to the three-year average of 27.8 times earnings. That price tag looks especially expensive, given that Wall Street expects Apple to grow earnings per share at 9% annually over the next three years.

That rich valuation may explain why Warren Buffett has slashed Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple in recent quarters. Investors should avoid this stock right now.

The days of sneaking into Costco with someone else's card are coming to an end. The retailer is cracking down on membership card sharing with a new policy where all cards will be scanned at store entrances.

Costco said in a recent statement on its website: “Over the coming months, membership scanning devices will be used at the entrance door of your local warehouse.”

Under the new process, all members must scan their physical or digital cards by “placing the barcode or QR Code against the scanner.” Previously, shoppers typically only had to present their membership cards at the cash register during check out.

Guests without cards must be accompanied by a member to enter, making it harder to slip in on a borrowed card.

For members with cards without a photo, they'll be asked to show a valid photo ID, and are encouraged to have their photo taken to add to their cards at the membership counter.

The statement said that an attendant would be stationed at store entrances to assist shoppers.

For members whose cards are inactive, expired or those who would like to sign up for a new membership, the attendant will ask them to stop at the membership counter prior to entering the warehouse to shop.

NBC News has reached out to Costco for comment.

Costco relies on membership fees to drive most of its revenue and help keep merchandise prices low.

The new card-checking policy is the latest effort to put a stop to non-members taking advantage of the benefits.

Last year, Costco stepped up enforcement by adding an extra check for memberships in self-checkout aisles in an effort to stop shoppers from using other members’ cards.

The store also announced last month it would increase its membership rate for the first time since 2017. The fee would rise by $5 in the U.S. as of Sept. 1, changing the annual membership fee from $60 5o $65. Its higher-tier plan, called “Executive Membership,” will increase to $130 a year from $120."

“Prior to entering, all members must scan their physical or digital membership card by placing the barcode or QR Code against the scanner,” the Costco website says. “Guests must also be accompanied by a valid member for entry.”

If a guest does not have a photo included on their membership card, they will be required to show a valid photo ID.

The scanners have already been installed at the Burbank Costco, one member told The Times, where they created a bottleneck as customers slowed to scan their cards and ask questions.

“If your membership is inactive, expired, or you would like to sign up for a new membership, the attendant will ask that you stop by the membership counter prior to entering the warehouse to shop,” the company said.

In June 2023, Costco starting carrying out their initial photo-verification system at self-checkout kiosks after noticing that “non-member shoppers have been using membership cards that do not belong to them,” the company wrote in a statement shared with PEOPLE at the time.

“Costco is able to keep our prices as low as possible because our membership fees help offset our operational expenses, making our membership fee and structure important to us,” the company added in the statement.

They also emphasized that “membership cards are not transferable” and that “we don’t feel it’s right that non members receive the same benefits and pricing as our members.”

In 2020, efforts to discourage card sharing were also implemented when Costco announced that non-members would no longer be able to dine at their famously cheap food court where you can get a hot dog meal for $1.50.

At the time, the warehouse chain put up signs at their locations across the U.S. that said, “Effective March 16, 2020, an active Costco membership card will be required to purchase items from our food court. You can join today. Please see our membership counter for details.”

The only exceptions to the entry rule are people who are visiting the pharmacy or who have an appointment with an in-house optometrist (though you’ll need a membership if you plan to purchase glasses or contacts there).

Costco began experimenting with card scanners (instead of the long-standing practice of just flashing a card at the store employee on duty) in January. A post on Reddit at the time noted that once members scanned their card, a display would show the face on file for the employee to check. If the cardholder was obviously not the member, they could be turned away.

The use of the facial scanners did not replace the photo ID verification at check-out at those locations testing them.

Costco has been adamant about cracking down on membership-sharing, saying in a statement to media last June: “We don’t feel it’s right that non-members receive the same benefits and pricing as our members. Costco is able to keep our prices as low as possible because our membership fees help offset our operational expenses, making our membership fee and structure important to us.”

The membership card scanners are expected to be installed at the store entrances. In California, the new scanners have already been spotted at Costco locations in Huntington Beach and Inglewood, with videos on TiTok and other social media platforms going viral over the change. According to The Hill, locations in New York, Florida and Pennsylvania will begin scanning cards soon, while one location in Texas said they would likely start the process next month.

The lone exception to shopping at Costco without a membership are pharmacy prescriptions, which can be purchased both online or at a location. This exception doesn’t extend to the optical center.

This decision is the latest in a series of efforts to crack down on unauthorized card-sharing. Costco announced earlier this year it will start initiating spot checks at the self-checkout counters to discourage shopping without a membership or sharing a membership with another person.

On its website, Costco now has a section titled Membership Scanners at Warehouse Entrances.

The retailer plans to implement scanning devices at the entrances of Costco warehouses.

""Once deployed, prior to entering, all members must scan their physical or digital membership card by placing the barcode or QR Code against the scanner,"" it read.

Also, if a guest wants to shop, they need to be with a member to gain entry.

The company also affirmed, with enthusiasm, that there will always be an attendant at the door to help with questions or concerns.

It added that if your membership is inactive or expired, or if you want to sign up for a new one, the person at the door will ask you to go to the membership counter before opening the door.

Attendants will also ask to see a valid photo ID if a member's card doesn't have their photo.

Costco encourages members to get their picture taken at the membership counter so it's on their cards for their next shopping trips.

Another shared that they felt the membership card was a ""prison badge.""

""I have found shopping at Costco to become an increasingly unpleasant experience,"" a user wrote.

Costco's Membership Crackdown Earlier this year, Costco started cracking down on members who would share their cards with non-paying guests. To tackle the issue, the retailer started testing a new system that introduced card scanners at the entrance of stores. This forces members to scan their IDs and verify who they are upon entry to the warehouse. The new system started being tested in January at a warehouse near Costco's headquarters in Issaquah, Washington. Similar checks have been rolled out at self-checkouts and manned registers. “Our membership policy states that our membership cards are not transferable and since expanding our self-service checkout, we’ve noticed that non-member shoppers have been using membership cards that do not belong to them,” Costco said in a statement. “We don’t feel it’s right that non-members receive the same benefits and pricing as our members.”

MEMBERSHIPS

The popular warehouse recently announced a spike in its membership prices.

Fees will increase annually from $60 to $65 for the Gold Star Membership and from $120 to $130 for the Executive Membership.

Prices will change in the United States and Canada on September 1, CNBC reported.

Usually, the retailer increases its membership every five years, but in 2022, Costco's CEO Craig Jelinek said it wasn't the right time.

Jelinek said it was ""not on the table right at the moment,"" CNBC reported.

""I made it very clear. I don’t think it’s the right time. Our sign-ups continue to be strong.""

Costco adds membership scanners upon entry to crack down on customers sharing cards.,https://evrimagaci.org/tpg/costco-cracks-down-on-membership-card-sharing-with-new-scanning-tech-8448,"Costco Cracks Down On Membership Card Sharing With New Scanning Tech The retailer tests ID scanning at entrances to curb unauthorized access and increase member security

Costco, the popular bulk grocery chain, is making waves with its latest initiative aimed at tightening membership controls. After noticing patterns of membership card sharing, especially following the surge of online shopping during the pandemic, the company is testing new scanning technology at select store entrances. This change is raising eyebrows and questions among shoppers about how Costco enforces its membership policies.

Historically, Costco's membership model has been grounded in non-transferable cards, which entitle individuals or households to special pricing and privileges. Members can bring guests and even share their second household card with one other person. But as shopping habits shifted, particularly with the addition of self-checkout options, Costco found itself grappling with increased instances of unauthorized card sharing.

The first sign of this new initiative came from the Issaquah, Washington location, where shoppers reported the presence of digital scanning stations. Instead of merely flashing their membership cards to employees, customers are now prompted to scan their cards at the entrance. This process displays their photo on the screen, effectively minimizing the opportunity for non-members to slip through the cracks. Instead of manual checks where employees asked to see ID, this system streamlines entry and captures membership details right away.

Richard Galanti, CFO of Costco, explained, ""The goal is to make sure all members feel they’re getting the benefits they signed up for. We don't feel it's right for non-members to enjoy the same pricing."" This statement underscores the importance Costco places on maintaining its member-exclusive pricing advantages. The scanning trial is aimed not just at upping security but also at ensuring the shopping experience remains efficient for actual members.

Although only one location has rolled out this change so far, the Issaquah store is known for piloting policies before wider implementation. If successful, Costco could expand this scanning technique to other locations nationwide, leading to potential frustrations for those used to the old system. On Reddit, shoppers expressed mixed feelings—some applauded the crackdown, saying it allows for fairer access, whereas others declared it inconvenient and intrusive.

Alongside this entrance modification, Costco has ramped up measures at self-checkout stations as well. They’ve started implementing checks to verify members’ IDs more rigorously, which Galanti indicated was due to the notable uptick of member card abuse. Last June, manual ID checks were initiated at the self-service lanes, demonstrating the retailer's commitment to protecting its membership benefits.

Costco's approach mirrors broader trends seen across various subscription-based services, from streaming giants like Netflix to gym memberships, wherein unauthorized sharing of access has become untenable as companies seek to maximize revenue from their loyal customers. Similar policies have been observed internationally, with scanning processes already standard at several overseas Costco branches.

Access to Costco is undeniably valuable, with statistics indicating around 66 million paid members and approximately 119 million cardholders as of 2022. Not only do these members enjoy competitive pricing and access to large quantities, but they also contribute significantly to Costco's revenue through annual membership fees. Membership income plays a critical role; fees accounted for nearly three-quarters of Costco's net income within its last fiscal year, amounting to $4.6 billion in 2023 alone.

While most shoppers may not yet see this change at their own local Costco, it appears to be part of wider efforts to maintain the integrity of the membership model moving forward. Many are curious whether the scanning technology will improve the shopping experience or simply add another hurdle during entry.

Costco's approach isn't just about preventing unauthorized access; it also reflects its response to changing shopping patterns. The pandemic radically transformed consumer behavior, leading to rising card sharing where friends and families shared memberships more easily, akin to how people share television streaming passwords. Adapting to these changes is critical for Costco, which has seen substantial membership growth; they added 2.1 million paid members last year alone.

For shoppers who enjoy the treasure hunt aspect of shopping at Costco, the bulk discounts, and exclusive access, these new guidelines could strengthen their sense of community with fellow members. Yet, the minute inconvenience of scanning cards could diminish the relaxed nature of browsing through their favorite store linens or organic goods.

The balance between maintaining access and ensuring fairness for paying members remains delicate. Future shopper reactions will help Costco evaluate the effectiveness of their newly implemented measures, and whether online discussions reflect genuine shopper perspectives or pass by as though they were just another passing fad.

One could argue these kinds of changes are part of the natural evolution for membership-based businesses seeking to secure their market position amid rising competition. Costco must be careful as they navigate their changes to uphold value for their loyal customers without pushing them away, creating obstacles they're unwilling to circumvent. Whether this initiative will yield tangible benefits or have unintended consequences remains to be seen, but for now, the stores are on notice: have your membership card ready and let the scanning begin."
Costco adds membership scanners upon entry to crack down on customers sharing cards.,https://kvnutalk.com/fewer-americans-file-for-jobless-benefits-last-week-but-applications-remain-slightly-elevated/,"The number of Americans filing for jobless benefits fell last week but remain at slightly elevated though not troubling levels.

Jobless claims for the week of Aug. 3 fell by 17,000 to 233,000 last week, the Labor Department reported Thursday.

That’s fewer than the 240,000 analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting.

Continuing claims, which represent the total number of Americans collecting unemployment benefits, rose by 6,000 to 1.88 million for the week of July 27. That’s the most since the week of Nov. 27, 2021.

Weekly unemployment claims are widely considered representative of layoffs, and though they have trended higher recently, they remain at historically healthy levels.

Thursday’s report was the first snapshot of the U.S. labor market since last week’s deeply disappointing jobs data for July sent financial markets spiraling on fears that the economy might be edging toward a recession. Some analysts had suggested that the Federal Reserve might respond by accelerating its timetable for cutting interest rates or cut rates more deeply than previously envisioned.

In recent days, though, most economists have cautioned that the July jobs report did not portend a recession. They noted that by most measures, the economy, while slowing, remains resilient. Most Fed watchers still expect the central bank’s policymakers to begin cutting their benchmark rate by a modest quarter-point when they meet in mid-September.

The Fed raised its benchmark borrowing rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023 to fight the worst streak of inflation in four decades, which coincided with the economy’s powerful rebound from the pandemic recession of 2020. The Fed’s intention was to cool a hot labor market and slow wage growth.

Inflation has plummeted from its highs to near the Fed’s 2% target, and now the central bank appears more focused on the need to support the economy with gradually lower borrowing rates.

Filings for unemployment benefits have been consistently higher beginning in May. Last week’s 250,000 claims were the highest in a year. Since May, applications have averaged about 232,000 per week. In the three months before that, weekly claims averaged just 212,000.

On Friday, the government reported that U.S. employers added just 114,000 jobs in July, a sharp decline from June and well below analyst forecasts of 175,000. The unemployment rate rose for the fourth straight month, to 4.3%. That report struck fear in markets around the world because a sturdy U.S. economy has been a key driver of global economic growth.

Other recent economic data has been telling a similar story of a slowing U.S. economy. Manufacturing activity is still shrinking, and its contraction is accelerating. Manufacturing has been one of areas of the economy hurt most by high rates.

High interest rates have also taken their toll on the housing market, which has seen sales of existing homes decline for four straight months. The slump dates back to 2022, with existing home sales hitting nearly 30-year low last year.

Retail sales were flat in June from May and many retailers say that Americans are being more judicious about their spending.

None of the data necessarily portends an imminent recession, experts say, but combined it is building a case for the Fed to cut its benchmark rate in September.

Thursday’s report also said that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the weekly volatility, rose by 2,500 to 240,750.

There have been job cuts across a range of sectors this year, from the agricultural manufacturer Deere, to media outlets like CNN, and elsewhere."

What is Costco cracking down on?

Costco is cracking down on membership card sharing by requiring all cards to be scanned at the entrance. This new rule will make it harder for people to gain entry using someone else’s card.

Is a Costco membership needed for the food court?

A Costco membership is needed to buy food at Costco’s food courts. Yes, even for its outdoor courts.

In March 2024, Costco’s chief financial officer, Richard Galanti, announced that customers would no longer be able to purchase items at the company’s outdoor food courts without proof of membership.

“One of the challenges is that some of the food courts have gotten so busy, particularly if it’s near some office buildings or construction sites,” Galanti explained to Axios in an interview. “We were getting member complaints.”

Can Costco block your membership?

Yes, Costco reserves the right to block membership at its discretion and without cause. According to the company’s website, members are required to comply with its rules, privacy policies and any changes.

What are Costco’s membership prices?

On Sept. 1, Costco will be raising its membership prices for the first time since 2017.

The cheapest Costco membership, Gold Star, currently costs $60 per year, but will increase by $5 in September to $65. Like all Costco memberships, Gold Star membership includes two cards: one for the primary member and one for a household member.

Executive memberships, which give you an extra 2% on all items purchased at Costco, currently cost $120 but will increase by $10 in September to $130."

“Once deployed, prior to entering, all members must scan their physical or digital membership card by placing the barcode or QR Code against the scanner,” the announcement explained.

Members who do not have their photo on their Costco membership card will be required to provide a photo ID and are encouraged to update their card with a photo at the membership desk.

Guests will still be allowed to enter but must be accompanied by a cardholder.

The automated process has been rolled out in several locations across Washington and California and has been used in the UK for several years.

Stores in New York, Florida, Texas and Pennsylvania have confirmed that it will soon kick in there but have not announced exactly when.

Costco membership perks include free samples, discounts on food, gas, home insurance, travel and grocery items, plus an annual 2% reward on qualified purchases at its warehouses.

“We don’t feel it’s right that non-members receive the same benefits and pricing as our members,” a spokesperson previously told Business Insider.

The new scanners are also reportedly speeding up the checkout process and parking space turnover, according to the company.

The new membership card scanners come as the national chain is cracking down on membership sharing, pushing ahead with technological updates amid rising membership fees.

Leaders have shared plans to deploy more technology in-store and add options like buying online and picking up in-store.

They also announced a hike in annual membership fees for the first time in seven years for its U.S. and Canada customers, effective Sept. 1.

Costco knows you’re using your friend’s membership card. To save you the embarrassment of telling you off when you’re in the checkout line, now Costco will try to catch membership moochers before they even get in the door.

The retailer is implementing stricter policies and cracking down on non-members using other people’s cards by requiring shoppers to scan their membership cards to enter stores.

“Over the coming months, membership scanning devices will be used at the entrance door of your local warehouse,” Costco said in a statement online. “Once deployed, prior to entering, all members must scan their physical or digital membership card by placing the barcode or QR Code against the scanner.”

For members with cards that don’t have a photo, Costco says to come prepared with a valid photo ID but encourages shoppers to visit the membership counter and have their photo taken.

Costco’s new rule also requires guests to be accompanied by a valid cardholder to enter its stores, making it more difficult for non-members to sneak in using cards that don’t belong to them.

Costco did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The move comes as an extension of the system Costco tested out at some stores earlier this year, which required members to scan their cards at machines placed near the store entrance – instead of just flashing a card to employees.

Self-checkout machines were also affected by Costco’s crackdown. Last year, the company began requiring shoppers to present their membership card and a photo ID to use the registers.

“We don’t feel it’s right that nonmembers receive the same benefits and pricing as our members,” Costco said in a statement last year.

Costco’s crackdown on non-members comes after the company announced last month that it was raising its membership fees by $5 to $65 in the US and Canada – the first time since 2017. The change goes into effect on September 1.

The bulk of Costco’s profits come from annual fees. It reported last year that it earned $4.6 billion in revenue from membership fees, an 8% increase from 2022.

Costco Wholesale is installing membership scanners at the entrances of all of its locations to discourage non-members from shopping at the stores.

Soon, instead of flashing their cards at employees, Costco members will be required to scan them as they are entering, the retailer said.

""Over the coming months, membership scanning devices will be used at the entrance door of your local warehouse. Once deployed, prior to entering, all members must scan their physical or digital membership card,"" the retailer stated on its customer service page.

Guests must also be accompanied by a valid member in order to enter a store, Costco added.

The discount retailer began testing the technology earlier this year, with Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti relaying that more people had been sharing memberships since the pandemic in 2020.

The scanners also spare Costco employees from having to ask shoppers for membership cards at registers and self-checkout, speeding up the process of entering and checking out, the Galanti told CNN.

Discounted dogs for members only

Costco earlier in the year cracked down on who uses its food court to ensure that only members can capitalize on its famous $1.50 wiener-and-soda deal.

The retailer recently began asking for shoppers' membership cards, along with a photo ID, at self-checkout registers, a policy the company also applies at regular checkout lanes.

""We don't feel it's right that non-members receive the same benefits and pricing as our members,"" Costco stated at the time.

Costco said last month it was hiking its basic membership fee for the first time since 2017, increasing the annual charge to $65 from $60. The roughly 8% cost increase takes effect on September 1, the warehouse club announced. The cost of a premium membership is rising to $130 from $120. Costco also said the maximum annual 2% reward for its executive membership will rise to $1,250 from $1,000.

Revenue from the annual fees make up much of Costco's profits, according to its yearly report. The company in 2023 garnered $4.6 million from membership fees, up 8% from the year before, with membership growing to almost 128 million cardholders and Costco touting a 90% renewal rate.

The pricing change affects about 52 million memberships. Costco operates 882 warehouses, including 609 in the United States and Puerto Rico."

CALIFORNIA, CA — Costco's infamous crowds may start to thin out thanks to a crackdown on membership sharing being initiated by the warehouse giant. It's a move that is generating long lines and strong feelings. Costco executives also expect it to generate more profit.

Costco has officially started implementing new membership scanners at locations across California as the wholesale retailer continues to crack down on unauthorized membership usage. Now, members will be required to scan their membership cards before entering the warehouse store, and employees must confirm their customer ID images. Non-Costco members must be accompanied by a valid member to enter Costco, the company said in a statement.

The process, already rolled out at stores in Long Beach, Los Angeles, Burbank and Laguna Niguel, Roseville and Alhambra, have led to a chokepoint at some store entrances. “If your membership is inactive, expired, or you would like to sign up for a new membership, the attendant will ask that you stop by the membership counter prior to entering the warehouse to shop. Additionally, if your membership card does not have a photo, please be prepared to show your valid photo ID. We encourage you to stop by the membership counter to have a photo taken to have on your card,” the statement read.



The new scanners have prompted jeers and cheers at Costco stores in Laguna Niguel and Los Angeles. ""It only slows down the process to get in,"" Anastasia De Voss of Laguna Niguel wrote on Facebook. ""You have to show the card to check out, so why the redundancy?""

Other residents said the scanners were a step in the right direction. ""It's a good approach to minimize non-members just walking into the store,"" Los Angeles resident Engel Emrt wrote on Facebook. ""It also serves as a security checkpoint. Long overdue entry procedure."""

Bad news for shoppers who borrow Costco cards from relatives or friends to reap the benefits of inexpensive food court items and a wide variety of goods in bulk.

Costo has rolled out an initiative to crack down on membership card-sharing, now requiring shoppers to scan their cards at the entrance of the store, where an employee will check the card’s displayed photo of the membership holder, in order to gain access.

Costco’s new card checking policy is intended to stop non-members from taking advantage of the club’s benefits, hoping that they will purchase their own membership instead.

“Over the coming months, membership scanning devices will be used at the entrance door of your local warehouse,” Costco said in a statement. “Once deployed, prior to entering, all members must scan their physical or digital membership card by placing the barcode or QR Code against the scanner. Guests must also be accompanied by a valid member for entry.”

Along with the crackdown on card-sharing, Costco also recently announced that it would raise its membership prices, which is the first increase since 2017.

The increase is slated to take effect on September 1st, increasing the annual membership fee from $60 to $65. The higher-tier “Executive Membership” will also see a ten dollar increase in price from $120 to $130 a year.

COSTCO LEANING INTO TECHNOLOGY AS ‘REAL OPPORTUNITY’ TO IMPROVE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE

This comes after reports surfaced in January of Costco trying out the membership card scanning devices at some locations.

In early March, Richard Galanti, Costco's CFO at the time, told analysts and investors during a quarterly earnings call that Costco was ""actually doing testing on that too, in terms of having your card be scanned and reviewed when you walk in.""

Electronic membership card scanners have been used in the U.K. ""for a few years,"" he noted at the time.

Costco CEO Ron Vachris more recently touched on membership card scanners the business has been exploring in May.

He said the devices were ""speeding up our registers significantly when we get all the scanning and memberships are verified at the front door.""

COSTCO HIKING MEMBERSHIP FEES FOR FIRST TIME IN 7 YEARS

Costco says on its website generally ""only Costco members may purchase items"" at the retailer. Its footprint spans over 880 warehouses in 14 countries.

Other recent membership-related moves Costco has taken include starting to ask shoppers to present their membership cards while using self-checkout and requiring a membership to use its food courts, as previously reported by FOX Business.

Annual fees actually aren't too crazy (Costco just announced its first increase in years), but if you don't have a store near you or don't shop that often, the $65 price tag may feel steep.

In a notice posted on its website, the wholesaler announced the impending change.

""Over the coming months, membership scanning devices will be used at the entrance door of your local warehouse,"" the notice reads. ""Once deployed, prior to entering, all members must scan their physical or digital membership card by placing the barcode or QR Code against the scanner.""

While it doesn't explicitly call out those who have tried to skirt the rules, the warehouse does add that ""guests must also be accompanied by a valid member for entry.""

Photos are now a must, too. Costco says that people whose membership cards don't have photos will need to show a valid photo ID to gain entry. The wholesaler adds that existing members can visit the membership counter to have their photo taken for their card.

A door assistant will also be present to assist with questions and concerns, according to the notice. Anyone with inactive or inspired memberships, as well as those who want to sign up for a new membership, will be directed to the membership counter before entering the warehouse to shop.

If you have an active Costco membership, this shift shouldn't affect you too much (unless you still need to have your photo taken). It does, however, affect those who don't have memberships, as Costco seems to have found a way to weed them out before they start shopping.

The move expands on a system implemented at the beginning of 2024, when members were required to scan their Costco cards at a kiosk at select locations, including a warehouse in Issaquah, Washington, and another in Texas.

Before that, the retailer also attempted to crack down on membership sharing at self-checkout. In the summer of last year, Costco started requiring members to show photo IDs if their cards didn't have photos or had a photo that didn't match whoever was shopping.

""Our membership policy states that our membership cards are not transferable and since expanding our self-service checkout, we've noticed that non-member shoppers have been using membership cards that do not belong to them,"" a Costco spokesperson previously told Best Life about the self-checkout policy.

They continued, ""We don't feel it's right that non members receive the same benefits and pricing as our members. As we already ask for the membership card at checkout, we are now asking to see their membership card with their photo at our self-service checkout registers.""

To get inside of a Costco, you have to have a membership, and it seems as though over the years certain customers have been pushing the limits of the membership policy, sharing and transferring memberships even though Costco doesn’t allow this.

Corporate must’ve gotten fed up with all the card sharing, because a new policy was just instated in Costco’s across America, and customers aren’t happy. Keep reading for more information.

New Membership Policy At Costco

While needing a Costco card to shop at Costco is far from new, Costco is seemingly getting stricter with these rules. Now, at the entrance of every Costco there’s a scanner, manned by an employee. All customers must scan their Costco card at the entrance, and if the picture on the Costco card doesn’t match the person holding the card, they will be refused entry, with no exceptions.

This means, as one TikToker pointed out, that shopping for sick or elderly family members that hold a membership is now impossible. “They don’t care if you’re shopping for your grandma,” user @neybabez posted on TikTok. “I’m leaving to Sam’s!” she wrote in the caption. The Costco website confirmed this in a statement: “Guests must also be accompanied by a valid member for entry.”

Even the loyalest of Costco members are upset about the new policy, with customers sharing their gripes with the membership crackdown on social media. ""Wow they found a way to make things move along even slower and add a line at the front door!"" one person commented on an Instagram post about the policy. ""How pleasant!""

""This is ridiculous I'm thinking of canceling Costco,"" another shared.

""Not a fan,"" another agreed. ""They wouldn't let me stop and pick up my stepdad's medication right after he had surgery unless he was present. We have switched to Sam's Club and will never go back.""

The days of mooching off a friend’s Costco membership will soon be over.

In an effort to implement stricter store policies, Costco Wholesale announced it will be placing membership scanners at the entrance door to each of its locations.

Before entering the warehouse, shoppers will be required to scan the barcode on their physical membership card or the QR code on their digital Costco ID. Simply flashing a membership to an attendant will no longer be enough.

Plans to show a fraudulent membership card that does not include the owner’s photo have also been quashed by Costco, which has now instructed its employees to ask for photo ID.

In any case, Costco attendants will “encourage you to stop by the membership counter to have a photo taken to have on your card,” the company described.

The wholesaler said the scanners are expected to be implemented “in the coming months.”

Costco Wholesale Canada has yet to respond to Global News’ request for comment, but social media pages dedicated to Canadian Costco fans report that the scanners have already made their way into a handful of stores in Ontario, B.C. and Alberta.

The company first began testing membership scanners in January.

Costco’s finance chief Richard Galanti told CBS at the time that scanning memberships at the door would eliminate the need to do so at cash registers and self-checkouts.

“It speeds up the process at entry and speeds up the process at the checkout,” Galanti said.

He said more Costco shoppers have been sharing membership cards since 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to the Costco 2023 Annual Report, the wholesaler made a whopping US$4.6 billion (C$6.3 billion) in revenue from membership fees paid by their 128 million cardholders last year.

Costco members, and any new signees, will face higher fees next month when the company increases its annual membership cost by $5 to $65. The bump applies to Canadians holding an individual, business or business add-on membership.

Those with executive memberships will see a $10 increase to $130 and will also have their maximum annual rewards increased.

The annual fee was last raised in June 2017.

SEATTLE — Costco will soon require people to scan their membership cards in order to enter a warehouse store, according to the company's website.

In the coming months, card scanners will be installed at the store entrances. Once activated, all members will be required to scan their physical or digital membership card before entering.

Guests will be required to be accompanied by a valid member for entry.

If someone tries to enter a Costco store with an inactive or expired membership, attendants will be stationed at the front entrance and ask people to renew their account. People who have a membership card without a photo on it may be asked to show a valid photo ID.

According to the company's website, you don't need to be a Costco member to purchase pharmacy prescriptions online or at a warehouse. Though you need to be a member to purchase glasses or contacts at an optical center, you do not need to be a member to make an appointment with an in-house optometrist.

Costco, the third-largest retailer in the U.S. by sales volume, sells items in bulk and relies on a membership structure to keep costs down for shoppers. Last year, stores began to crack down on unauthorized card-sharing, getting stricter about asking to see shoppers' membership cards with their photo at self-checkout.

The move to require people to scan membership cards comes after the company announced it would increase the price of memberships.

On Sept. 1, the cost of a Gold Star membership will increase from $60 to $65. Executive memberships will increase from $120 to $130. The maximum annual 2% cash back reward for Executive members will increase from $1,000 to $1,250 when prices go up.

Video transcript

Turning to a trending story here today, Costco, it's cracking down.

And before you head to the store, you'll want to make sure you have your membership card with you.

The retail giant is installing membership scanning devices at the entrance of stores.

ADVERTISEMENT

So shoppers will have to verify that they are members before entering.

It's not doing much for the stock, at least in terms of any concern.

Maybe people wouldn't be shopping there as frequently.

There'd be maybe some of a push back shares are actually moving to the upside today.

So maybe this is a sign that hey, people are too frustrated with this update.

But again, this is a trending story here, Mattie at Yahoo Finance and I bring this up one just because of the popularity of Costco two because so many people are more on the hunt for deals for value something similar.

We were just talking to Berkeley's retail analyst, Adrian Yee about moments ago and, and, and, and I also wonder what this is going to do to membership numbers if it cracks down like this is ultimately going to boost membership numbers at a time when Costco is really its membership prices slightly.

It's such a great point, Shana.

But also I'm fascinated in Costco as the latest company to come out against free loaders.

Essentially.

I have certainly been guilty of joining a friend to get into Costco and you can still do that so long as your friend has their past and they badge in.

That was the first thing that I checked in terms of the me of it all impact of this particular story.

But it kind of reminds me of the price hikes and the password crackdowns, uh password sharing crackdown rather that we are seeing from some of the streamers.

Story continues

Uh Netflix came to mind for me, for example, when this story came up, it seems like as we continue to see companies having to find uh kind of creative ways to increase their pricing power to up their margins every quarter after quarter.

The thing that they're turning to is cracking down on some of the free loading activity that we are seeing in particular with Costco, Costco.

I also think that part that is the ability for consumers who may find a card that's been used by someone else.

Perhaps there's some stealing involved with that.

They do note that in particular they are wanting to make sure that each customer coming through the door has a card that matches their identification.

That's why you'll have to have a photo ID with you for that.

But I find it to be a fascinating trend that we're seeing across several companies here.

It certainly is.

And, and, and if you're asking me why this could be a catalyst for the stock, remember that the bulk of profits come from their annual fee.

So this is why this is so critical and something that the street closely washes and also why, what was it just a few weeks ago, maybe a month or two ago at this point?

It's hard to keep track.

But Costco recently raised, I believe is the last earnings report raising the, uh, membership fee by five bucks to $65 in the US and Canada, it was the first time they did that since 2017 and that is set to go into effect on September 1st."

Costco has announced that automatic scanning devices will be added to all their warehouse stores over the next few months. The announcement comes as the new card scanning system was first introduced in Washington in January.

Scanning machines also recently spotted at a number of locations in California. The wholesale retailer said in a statement that guests who wish to shop in their stores will now have to be accompanied by a member.

Members will no longer be able to lend their cards to friends or family, even to buy things on their behalf.

“Over the coming months, membership scanning devices will be used at the entrance door of your local warehouse,” the statement said.

“Once deployed, prior to entering, all members must scan their physical or digital membership card by placing the barcode or QR Code against the scanner.”

In addition, shoppers will need to show photo ID with their membership card, if it does not have a photo.

“We encourage you to stop by the membership counter to have a photo taken to have on your card,” Costco advised customers.

CEO Ron Vahris told investors in May that scanning cards at the door has made stores more efficient.

In addition, the Daily Mail reported that restricting access to stores has helped boost profits by 29% on last year.

The addition of scanning system at entrances comes as Costco announced last month that membership fees would rise from September 1 this year.

The rise in fees will be the first since 2017 and will see annual membership cost $65."

Woman dies after getting caught in baggage carousel at Chicago O'Hare.,https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/woman-found-dead-in-baggage-area-at-chicagos-ohare-airport/,"CHICAGO (CBS) — Questions swirled about a woman found dead at O'Hare International Airport Thursday morning after getting trapped in some machinery.

The woman was found trapped in a conveyor belt in Terminal 5—the international terminal—and died at the scene, according to the Chicago Fire Department.

Sources said the woman, who was 57, was in an area at Terminal 5 that the public cannot access—but her presence there would not be considered a security breach, because it did not take place in a high security area.

She was found trapped in the conveyor belt, on a piece of equipment that is used to move baggage. How she got there still wasn't known Thursday afternoon.

Fire Department personnel at O'Hare found the woman unresponsive. They say they were called at 7:45 a.m.

Sources said when airport video was reviewed, the woman was seen walking in the area as early as 2:27 a.m. The exact time as to when she got into the machinery was still not known late Thursday.

The woman was pronounced dead at the scene.

CBS News Chicago has checked with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, which said it is not investigating because the woman was not an airport employee.

Her identity remains a mystery.

An autopsy will be conducted Friday at the Cook County Medical Examiner's office to determine the cause of the woman's death."

OVER A THOUSAND DAILY FLIGHTS

Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, which opened in 1944, houses all major airlines including United Airlines, American Airlines as well as Frontier Airlines, and Spirit Airlines, per Fly Chicago.

A​s of August 2024, the airport has about ​964 daily direct flights to 171​​ U.S. cities, per Fly Chicago.

It also has approximately 129 daily direct flights to 65​ international destinations.

The international hot spots include destinations in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceania.

TERMINAL 5 EXPANSION

In January 2023, a new extension of Terminal 5, which was built in 1993, was unveiled, per O'Hare 21.

Brit tourist dies at Spanish airport after collapsing while waiting to board Ryanair plane back to UK

Construction for the project began in 2019.

The major changes were part of a $1.3 billion, multi-year investment project to expand and modernize the O'Hare gate.

O'Hare hopes the updates enhance the customer experience and create more efficiency for travelers.

Changes to the terminal included 10 new gates, an expansion of the building, and a reconfiguration of international arrivals.

It also redesigned the customs and security check area, allowed more space for shops and restaurants, and completely replaced the Baggage Handling System.

Work on the new baggage area was finished earlier this year.

The new space included new conveyance and sortation systems from when a traveler checks in to when their luggage is loaded onto the plane, per O'Hare 21.

Five new baggage screening machines allow double the baggage screening capacity.

O'Hare thought ahead about future demand as well.

It set aside enough space for another screening machine should the terminal need it.

The added screening removes the need for in-lobby baggage screening, which frees up space for more check-in desks.

CONVEYOR BELT DEATHS

In March, a Georgia woman named Alyssa Drinkard died on a conveyor belt while working at a factory for vehicles.

She dropped AirPods below the conveyor and got caught in a chain while trying to retrieve it, NBC News reported at the time.

A witness tried to get her off the conveyor but was unsuccessful.

She called 911 and told maintenance to shut the machine down, but the efforts came too late.

Emergency responders cut the metal frame that trapped her and freed her body, the police report detailed.

Drinkard still had a pulse when emergency responders pulled her from the machinery.

Drinkard's employer, Club Car, released a statement to The Augusta Press confirming she died at the hospital.

The witness spoke to NBC News and said she was traumatized from the incident.

""She was always so sweet. She was always had a smile on her face,"" she said of Drinkard."

CHICAGO (WLS) -- A woman died at O'Hare on Thursday morning, according to Chicago officials.

The Chicago Fire Department was called to O'Hare around 7:45 a.m. to reports of a woman ""pinned in machinery"" at the Terminal 5 baggage area.

The woman was entangled in the conveyer belt system used to move baggage, the fire department said. She was pronounced dead at the scene.

Chicago police said the woman, who did not work at the airport, was seen on video going into a restricted area that was unoccupied around 2:30 a.m. Her body was found hours later.

Police confirmed the woman was apparently at the airport overnight, but it remains a mystery why she snuck into the employees-only area.

Authorities said the area where the incident happened is restricted to employee access, and while considered secure, it is not considered a high security area. It is filled with conveyor belts bringing luggage to and from airplanes in the international terminal, which also go through customs inspection.

While the woman's age was initially reported to be in her 40s, police clarified she was 57 years old. Her name has not been released.

Police have not said whether they have been able to track the woman's activities between 2:30 a.m. and 7:30 a.m.

Chopper 7 was over the scene around 9 a.m. showing a large presence of first responders.

Chicago police are investigating her death. The Cook County medical examiner's office has not yet released the identity of the woman who was killed. It's unclear where she lived or why she was at the airport.

(VENTURA, Calif.) — A suspected serial killer already in custody in North Carolina for a cold case murder has been charged in the slayings of three women who were strangled to death in 1977 in California, authorities said.

Kimberly Carol Fritz, 18, was killed in May 1977; Velvet Ann Sanchez, 31, was strangled to death in September 1977; and Lorraine Ann Rodriguez, 21, was killed three months later in December, according to authorities in Ventura County, California.

The victims were all sex workers who frequented local hotels, authorities said.

Police immediately believed the strangulations were linked, but the cases went cold, Ventura County District Attorney Erik Nasarenko said at a news conference Thursday.

In 2006, detectives uploaded DNA evidence collected from the scenes into CODIS — the nationwide law enforcement DNA database — but didn’t find a match, Nasarenko said.

Last year, “a breakthrough emerged” when detectives again uploaded DNA to CODIS and found a match to 73-year-old Warren Luther Alexander, Nasarenko said.

Alexander’s DNA was in the system because in 2022 he was arrested in North Carolina in connection with a 1992 cold case murder, Nasarenko said.

The North Carolina victim, 29-year-old Nona Cobb, was also strangled to death, Nasarenko said. Alexander is still awaiting prosecution in that case, authorities said.

Alexander was charged with three counts of first-degree murder and was extradited from North Carolina to California on Tuesday, authorities said.

“The day of reckoning in Ventura County has finally arrived,” Nasarenko said.

Alexander made his first court appearance in Ventura County Superior Court and is being held in Ventura County Jail without bail, authorities said. His arraignment is set for Aug. 21.

Alexander lived in Ventura County in the late 1950s and 1960s and he returned there in the 1970s, Nasarenko said. He was a long-haul cross-country truck driver from the 1970s to the 1990s, Nasarenko said.

Nasarenko said authorities believe there are more victims and said investigators are working with the FBI to try to solve other cases.

Woman dies after getting caught in baggage carousel at Chicago O'Hare.,https://www.aol.com/news/family-members-arrested-rural-nevada-214247886.html,"RENO, Nevada (AP) — Three members of a Nevada family have been arrested in connection with a verbal altercation last week in Virginia City, where a Black man from Texas said a racial slur was directed at him.

A 74-year-old man, his 67-year-old wife and their 45-year-old daughter were arrested Wednesday. They have posted bail and have been released from the Storey County Detention Center, Undersheriff Eric Kern told The Associated Press on Thursday.

Undersheriff Kern and a spokesperson for justice court in Virginia City both said Thursday that they didn’t know if family members had a lawyer. The AP has been successful in its efforts to locate the three since their names started circulating on social media Monday. No court date has been scheduled.

The man faces misdemeanor charges of noise violation and breach of peace, with the latter charge including an enhancement for committing a crime based on race. Kern did not share any details about what led authorities to add the racial enhancement, making it a gross misdemeanor punishable by up to a $2,000 fine and a year in jail.

The mother faces one count of battery and the daughter one count of obstructing or delaying a police officer. Those simple misdemeanors are punishable by fines of up to $1,000 and six months in jail.

After video of the incident spread on social media, Kern confirmed there was at least one act of vandalism in the form of “tagging” at local business and that deputies are investigating several threats to businesses and business owners in the community.

The incident occurred Friday when Ricky Johnson was collecting signatures for a ballot measure during a popular classic car festival in Virginia City, a tourist town just south of Reno.

Johnson began recording video after the alleged racist comments were directed at him. He said the man's comments included a reference to a “hanging tree.”

In the video, Johnson demands that the man repeat those words. At no time on the video does that man utter any racial epithets. But at one point Johnson asks him the location of that “hanging tree,” and the man replies “in your backyard.”

A loud, profanity-filled argument followed before a woman told Johnson he was on her property. Johnson repeatedly asks her not to touch him as they move the conversation into the street, the video shows.

Johnson posted the video to TikTok, drawing prompt condemnation from local and state officials. The sheriff's office interviewed Johnson and others involved, then turned over evidence to the district attorney.

Storey County Sheriff Mike Cullen announced the arrests in a news release Wednesday night. He said his office was “continuing to look at all the information presented and all information preceding the initial video recording and actions of all parties and witnesses leading up to the altercation.”

“Separate from this incident the Storey County Sheriff's Office with the assistance of the state of Nevada is compiling the threatening and harassing phone calls that continue to come in to our community,” Cullen said.

The arrests drew quick praise from Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, who is Black.

“The public outcry was heard loud and clear, and steps have been taken to hold these individuals accountable for their racist and unlawful actions,” Ford said.

Johnson, who is from the Houston area, was in Virginia City working for Advanced Micro Targeting Inc., a Texas-based company that provides voter outreach and get-out-the-vote services. He was collecting signatures for a proposed Nevada state ballot initiative aimed at capping fees that attorneys collect from clients in personal injury cases.

After initially speaking with the AP by phone Monday before returning to Texas, Johnson has not responded to phone calls or texts seeking additional comment.

The verbal altercation occurred in downtown Virginia City, an old mining town that attracts tens of thousands of tourists who walk its wood-planked sidewalks filled with old saloons and stores.

Sharief Louden, 30;; Daniel McIlhenney, 37; Ryan McIlhenney, 36; Terrell Gibson, 40,; and Loai Nasser, 49, have all been arrested, with an arrest warrant issued for 29-year-old Ali Sayyam.

These suspects are accused of being leaders of a catalytic converter theft ring that operated in Montgomery, Delaware, Bucks, Chester and Philadelphia counties.

Officials say the group started targeting catalytic converters in 2022 when the value of metals found in the devices started to rise.

Rodium, which sold for as much as $31,000 an ounce during the height of COVID, is now down to $4,500 an ounce.

MORE HEADLINES:

The thefts often took place in high-traffic areas, such as malls, business parks, the Philadelphia International Airport and Drexel University.

Officials say the thieves would jack up the vehicle, cut out the catalytic converter, then lower the vehicle in less than two minutes.

The devices were reportedly sold to two salvage yards in Philadelphia: Big Head Auto Salvage, operated by defendants Daniel and Ryan McIlhenney; and Philly Auto Salvage, operated by defendants Nasser and Sayyam.

Those salvage yards would then sell the catalytic converters to New Jersey outlets, with sales ranging from $300,000 to more than $1 million, according to records."

Atlantic Superstores are getting some cosmetic changes as the company works to portray itself as a better value proposition for consumers over the next few weeks.

The supermarket chain and other subsidiaries of Loblaw have been the subject of a boycott campaign organized online since May.

Speaking at the Lower Sackville location, which has already implemented the changes, the senior vice-president of operations for Superstore said the company will now be aligned with the Real Canadian Superstore brand — but will retain its name.

Jonathan Carroll said the only outward difference on store signs will be the addition of a logo to the branding.

Carroll said new in-store signs will clearly show items on sale.

"" It's important for all Canadians that we show that value to our customers and it takes time for them to learn and educate from that,"" he said.

Brittany van Veen said she didn't even notice the changes to the store.

After exiting the store with her two children, Brittany van Veen said she didn't notice any changes to her bill.

""Both myself and my partner work good jobs, but it's still like scraping the bottom of the bucket to afford just your basics,"" van Veen said.

""It's definitely not been easy to buy groceries in Nova Scotia, that's for sure.""

Though he did not directly address the boycott, Caroll said consumers have been speaking out for several years about how they ""see value in the market.""

He said the new signs that are part of the re-branding will help direct customers in the chain's stores and help them make value choices.

According to Carroll, being part of the larger Real Canadian Superstore chain should also result in lower prices on some items that are locked in for longer.

""At 63 [it] was a little bit different, but now we're 183 Superstores. ...our retail family got a little bit bigger,"" he said.
