"U.S. men's basketball team rallies to beat Serbia in the Paris Olympics, will be able to win the gold medal.",https://apnews.com/article/2024-olympics-serbia-usa-basketball-3577f002b828e31ea5dc0311d4fceaed,"PARIS (AP) — It scored six points in two seconds. And just like that, against what looked like overwhelming odds, the U.S. Olympic men’s basketball team was on its way.

To a comeback. To a win. And to another Olympic gold medal game.

Stephen Curry scored 36 points, including a go-ahead 3-pointer with 2:16 left, and the U.S. will play for gold in the Paris Olympics on Saturday night after beating Serbia 95-91. LeBron James had the fourth triple-double in Olympic history for the U.S., which trailed by 17 points in the first half and faced an 11-point halftime deficit — the biggest one successfully overcome by an American team since NBA players were added to the Olympic mix in 1992.

“I’ve seen a lot of Team USA basketball,” Curry said. “And that was a special one.”

Serbia led by 11 with 7:19 left. The rest of the way, it was all U.S. The Americans won a game where they led for 3 minutes, 25 seconds. Serbia led for 35:12 — nearly 90% of the game.

But it’ll be the U.S. against host France for gold in a dream matchup for the host nation on Saturday, while Serbia will face Germany earlier Saturday for bronze. The gold-medal game is a rematch from the Tokyo Games three years ago, where the Americans prevailed 87-82.

“I’m really humbled to have been a part of this game,” U.S. coach Steve Kerr said, tipping his hat multiple times to Serbia. “It’s one of the greatest basketball games I’ve ever been a part of. They were perfect. They played a perfect game. Our coaches were saying, Villanova-Georgetown, for all of our older readers and viewers out there.

“But they played the perfect game, and they forced us to reach the highest level of competition that we could find. And our guys were incredible in that fourth quarter, and they got it done.”

Joel Embiid scored 19 points on 8 for 11 shooting and James added 16 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists for the U.S., which is now assured of its 20th medal in 20 Olympic appearances.

“Joel was everything,” said James, who has two of the four triple-doubles in Olympic men’s history; he also had one in 2012, while the Soviet Union’s Aleksander Belov in 1976 and Slovenia’s Luka Doncic in 2021 had the others. “Made every big shot.”

Bogdan Bogdanovic scored 20 points for Serbia, which got 17 from Nikola Jokic and 15 from Aleksa Avramovic. The Serbians were 0-3 against the U.S. this summer, getting blown out in the first two meetings and then looking poised for a win of their own on Thursday.

The whole game changed in the fourth after a wild sequence saw the U.S. score six points in two seconds. Kevin Durant made a 3-pointer while Anthony Davis was getting fouled. The U.S. got another possession, and off the inbounds Devin Booker made another 3-pointer.

Just like that, a 78-67 lead for Serbia was down to 78-73. The comeback was on, and Curry’s 3 put the U.S. up for good. He added a pair of free throws with 8.2 seconds left to make it a two-possession game and the Americans escaped.

Curry’s 36 points were the second-most in a game by a U.S. men’s player in Olympic history, one shy of Carmelo Anthony’s record 37 against Nigeria in 2012. And Anthony, sitting courtside, was Curry’s biggest cheerleader. When the Americans tied it with about 3:35 left, Curry gave Anthony a big smile. When the go-ahead 3 rattled home, Anthony leaped from his seat. And when it was over, the two shared a long embrace.

“That was a godlike performance,” Durant said of Curry.

Serbia coach Svetislav Petic kept saying the same thing all summer, that the team the U.S. put together for the Paris Games was better than any in Olympic history. Even the Dream Team, he insisted. His mind wasn’t changed after this one.

“They’re that good,” he said.

A barrage of Serbian 3-pointers had the Americans squarely on the ropes, until the game changed in the fourth. But in the end, the U.S. improved to 144-6 all-time in Olympic play, 63-4 since NBA players were added to the Olympics in 1992.

“Perseverance, hard work dedication, Chef Curry and Joel ‘Process’ Embiid,” James said. “Big-time win for us. We knew we were going to be challenged. We knew it was going to be the toughest game to date. Total effort.”

The comeback kept Durant’s hopes of becoming the first four-time Olympic men’s gold medalist very much alive, and gave the U.S. a chance to return to the international basketball mountaintop. The Americans were fourth at the World Cup last summer, a result that spurred some NBA stars like James and Curry to be part of this team.

And of all the U.S. semifinal moments, this was like few others. The four-point final margin was the second closest in American history in the Olympic semifinals; the U.S. beat Lithuania by two in the 2000 semifinals in Sydney, on the way to gold there.

They’re one win away from another.

“I’m 39 years old, going into my 22nd season, I don’t know how many opportunities and moments I’m going to get like this to compete for something, compete for something big and play in big games,” James said. “And tonight was a big game.”

The United States continued its productive 2024 Paris Olympics on Thursday, extending its lead in the overall medal count and becoming the first country to surpass 100 medals.

Team USA also maintained its lead in gold medals with 30.

Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone won gold for the second consecutive Olympics in the 400-meter hurdles, banking another world record at 50.37. This makes her the first American woman to win two Olympic gold medals in the event.

On the men's side, Noah Lyles claimed bronze in the men's 200 meters, missing out on the sprint double after winning the 100 in thrilling fashion earlier in the week. Lyles confirmed after the race that he tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday but still opted to take a chance at history. U.S. teammate Kenny Bednarek won silver, while Letsile Tebogo of Botswana won gold.

Elsewhere, the U.S. men’s basketball team staged a furious fourth-quarter rally to beat Serbia and earn a spot in Saturday's gold medal game. Steph Curry scored 36 points, and LeBron James had a triple double to enable the Americans a chance for a fifth consecutive gold medal. But make no mistake: the world is coming for Team USA, writes columnist Dan Wolken.

Paris Olympics medal count

The U.S. leads the overall medal count with 103 — 30 gold, 38 silver and 35 bronze.

USA women's water polo falls to Australia in semifinals

PARIS – Adam Krikorian never felt like a fourth consecutive gold medal was his team’s destiny, not at the start of the Olympics, not before Thursday’s semifinal match against upstart Australia and certainly not when Maddie Musselman grabbed the ball to take the final shot of the sudden-death period.

Australia goalkeeper Gabriella Palm got her right hand on Musselman’s skip shot, deflecting it wide of the net to give Australia a 14-13 win – 6-5 in the shootout – over the U.S. in women’s water polo at La Defense Arena.

Australia will play Spain in the gold-medal match Saturday, while the three-time defending Olympic champion U.S. meets Netherlands for the bronze.

The U.S. has been the dominant force in women’s water polo for more than a decade, winning gold medals in the 2012, 2016 and 2020 Olympics. — Dave Birkett

USA men's basketball completes big comeback to reach gold medal game

The U.S. was in trouble against Serbia, and its streak of consecutive Olympic gold medals looked like might at end at four.

Then, the U.S. tightened its defense, found scoring at the right time and overcame a 17-point deficit to beat Serbia 95-91 in the semifinals Thursday.

After beating Serbia twice in the past three weeks – once in a friendly and once in group play at the Summer Games – the U.S. needed a massive fourth-quarter comeback to pull out a victory and advance to the gold-medal game against France. The U.S. is going for its fifth consecutive Olympic gold.

The U.S. trailed Serbia 76-63 to start the fourth quarter and possession by possession wore down Serbia. The U.S. used a 24-8 run to take a 91-86 lead with 1:41 left in the fourth quarter.

Steph Curry was brilliant for the USA, scoring a game-high 36 points on 12-for-19 shooting, the best game of the Olympics in a game where the U.S. desperately needed his scoring. LeBron James continued his stellar Olympic play and recorded a triple-double with 16 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists. — Jeff Zillgitt

Grant Holloway claims gold in 110 hurdles

Team USA's Grant Holloway won a gold medal Thursday night in the 110-meter hurdles at the Paris Games' Stade de France with a time of 12.99 seconds.

Other medal winners were Team USA's Daniel Roberts (silver, 13.09) and Rasheed Broadbell of Jamaica (bronze, 13.09).

Holloway left little wonder why he was ranked No. 1 in the world in the 110-meter hurdles. It was a redemptive moment after he won silver at the Tokyo Games in 2021, missing out on gold by 0.05 seconds, in his first Olympic appearance.

Team USA's Freddie Crittenden, who took an odd path to qualification, recorded a 13.32 and finished sixth. — Chase Goodbread

Noah Lyles ran 200 with COVID-19

Noah Lyles said he competed in the 200-meter final – and won a bronze medal – at the Paris Olympics on Thursday while fighting COVID-19.

Lyles confirmed the news to reporters in the mixed zone after he didn’t win the 200 meters, which has long been his signature event. While wearing a mask, Lyles said he tested positive in the early morning hours of Tuesday. He finished third in the race behind Letsile Tebogo of Botswana and Kenny Bednarek, his U.S. teammate.

Lyles, who has a history of asthma, laid on the track almost immediately after crossing the finish line, which is atypical of how he usually acts after a race. He needed medical attention shortly thereafter and, on the broadcast, soon collapsed into a wheelchair. He was talking with medical aides, which had oxygen handy, but Lyles did not appear to take it. He was wheeled off the track. — Tom Schad, Tyler Dragon, Nancy Armour

Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone dominates 400m women's hurdles for gold

SAINT-DENIS, France — Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone displayed her dominance once again in the women’s 400-meter hurdles.

McLaughlin-Levrone won her second consecutive Olympic gold medal in the 400-meter hurdles, posting a time of another world record at 50.37. The world-record holder is the first American woman to win two Olympic gold medals in the event.

Anna Cockrell came in second with a personal-best time of 51.87. Netherlands' Femke Bol came in third, running a 52.15. – Tyler Dragon

Team USA wrestling on doorstep of third gold medal

The U.S. wrestling team can add a third goal medal to its total Friday when Spencer Lee faces Japan’s Rei Higuchi in the final of the freestyle 57 kg division.

It won’t be easy.

Higuchi, a silver medalist at the 2016 Olympics, looked dominant against Puerto Rico’s Darian Cruz in a 12-2 semifinals victory. Lee also looked strong in a 14-4 semifinal victory over Uzbekistan’s Gulomjon Abdullaev.

“I know he doesn’t want silver, but I don’t want silver either,’’ Lee said. “So we’re going to go out there and do our best to put on a show.’’

The Americans can win two other medals but not the preferred colors. That’s because freestyle wrestlers Helen Maroulis and Aaron Brooks both lost in the semifinals Thursday, relegating them to the bronze medal matches Friday. – Josh Peter

PARIS — It took sudden death to make it happen, but the U.S. women’s run of water polo gold medals has come to an end.

Australia beat the U.S. in sudden death in a thrilling semifinal match Thursday at La Defense Arena, 14-13 – 6-5 in a shootout – to advance to Saturday’s championship match against Spain.

The U.S. had won three straight gold medals in the sport.

Australia overcame an 8-6 deficit in the fourth period when Bronte Halligan scored two goals to tie, the last with 2:54 to play.

Both teams made their first five attempts of the penalty-shot period, sending the match to sudden death. Zoe Arancini made her second penalty shot, skipping a shot past goalkeeper Ashleigh Johnson.

Australia goalkeeper Gabriella Palm deflected the next shot by Maddie Musselman for the win.

The U.S. will play the Netherlands for the bronze medal.

Australia is unbeaten in the Olympics. – Dave Birkett

Men's 200m final: Noah Lyles finishes with bronze, Kenny Bednarek wins silver

Letsile Tebogo shocked the field on Thursday.

Botswana's Tebogo took home the gold medal in the 200-meter dash final on Thursday, beating out Team USA's Kenny Bednarek and Noah Lyles, who finished second and third, respectively.

Tebogo becomes the first African in history to win the 200m, and he wins Botswana's first-ever Olympic gold medal.

France men's basketball heads to gold medal matchup

PARIS — Significant pressure was on France 5x5 men’s basketball team to medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

That pressure subsided with France’s 73-69 victory against Germany in the semifinals Thursday at Bercy Arena, guaranteeing France will medal. Question is, will it be gold or silver? France will play the winner of USA-Serbia in the gold-medal game Saturday.

France held off a late Germany rally, and rising NBA star Victor Wembanyama split two free throws, putting France ahead 71-68 with 10.9 seconds left in the fourth quarter. Dennis Schroder made a free throw to pull Germany within 71-69, Isaia Cordinier’s two free throws with 7.4 seconds left put the game out of reach. – Jeff Zillgitt

The US women’s volleyball team is going for another gold.

Just three years after Team USA won its first gold medal in the event, the Americans will defend their gold on Sunday after stunning 5-set thriller against Brazil Thursday. The US will meet the winner of Italy-Turkey in the final.

After a tight back and forth battle in the fifth set with teams trading points, the US slowly started to pull away when they went up 12-8 on a kill from Annie Drews. Brazil reeled off two quick points but after that the U.S. looked completely in control, winning 15-11.

Drews finished with 18 points, while Kathryn Plummer led the Americans with 26. Avery Skinner recorded 19. – Lindsay Schnell

Noah Lyle, hours after he lunged past Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson to win gold in the 100-meter dash by five one thousandths of a second, saved the day for his girlfriend, Jamaican track and field star Junelle Bromfield.

According to ESPN, Lyles said that Bromfield told him at around 2 a.m. local time in Paris that she had accidentally left her running spikes at her massage therapist's Airbnb, which was close to the Olympic Village. Bromfield, as it turns out, would be running her first heats of the 2024 Paris Olympics later Monday morning, in the 400-meter race, so securing her spikes became imperative.

Enter Lyles, who made the journey to retrieve the shoes and return them to Bromfield. — Lorenzo Reyes

The 2024 Paris Olympics men's basketball tournament semifinals feature two rematches from group play, starting with the first game of the day: France vs. Germany. Team USA is set for the second semifinal match. They're set to take on Serbia starting at 3 p.m. ET at Accor Arena. Follow along live.

PARIS — LeBron James, 39, and Diana Taurasi, 42, know that by basketball standards, they’re old. They’re aware because, well, people won’t stop telling them.

But that won't stop them from chasing gold.

""I’m around a lot of young people all the time,"" Taurasi joke, ""and one thing I tell them, if there’s one thing you can’t escape in this country and this world, it’s agism.""

Team USA is into the men’s and women’s semifinals, with the men meeting Serbia Thursday at 3 p.m. ET (9 p.m. local time) and the women scheduled to play Australia on Friday, also at 3 p.m. ET. — Lindsay Schnell

Men’s 3-meter springboard final

Team USA diver Carson Tyler finished fourth in the men’s 3-meter springboard final Thursday at Olympic Aquatics Center. China’s Xie Siyi won gold (543.60) and Wang Zongyuan won silver (530.20), while Mexico’s Osmar Olvera Ibarra won bronze (500.40).

Xie and Wang also were the defending gold and silver medalists, respectively, from the 2021 Tokyo Olympics.

Tyler, a 20-year-old first-time Olympian, finished with a score of 429.25 in the six-round final, which was just shy of his 438.00 semifinals score Wednesday and not quite strong enough to earn a medal. His top-scored dive was his last one — a reverse 1 1/2 somersaults with 3 1/2 twists in the free position with a 3.5 degree of difficulty, earning him 78.75 points. — Michelle Martinelli

Breaking, no, not breakdancing, to make Olympic debut

Breaking is part of the new wave of sports that the International Olympic Committee has ushered in as part of a broader effort to appeal to younger fans and add an urban flair to the Summer Games. It follows the addition of sports such as skateboarding and surfing, which debuted at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. The competitions begin at 10:30 a.m. ET on Friday and conclude with the finals, which start at 2 p.m. ET. The men's competition will take place at the same times Saturday. — Tom Schad

≻ From the Bronx to the Paris Olympics stage

SAINT-DENIS, France — Quincy Wilson, 16, is set to make his Paris Olympics debut.

Wilson received word that he will take part in Team USA’s 4x400 relay team, a person familiar with the situation told USA TODAY Sports. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they aren’t authorized to discuss the relay team.

The men’s 4x400 relay begins Friday at 5:05 a.m. ET.

Team USA will be in the first-round heat of the 4x400 relay. Wilson is expected to run in the opening round. Wilson will become the youngest American male to have ever participated in an Olympic track and field event.

Wilson was originally selected on Team USA’s 4x400-relay pool after he finished sixth in the open 400 at the U.S. Olympic track and field trial.

The 16-year-old wonderkid broke the under-18 world record in the opening round of the 400, blazing one lap around the track in 44.66 seconds at the trials. Then Wilson bested the time in the semifinals, running a 44.59 to qualify for the finals. The high school record had stood for 42 years before Wilson shattered it twice within a matter of days. — Tyler Dragon

World's No. 1 golfer in pursuit of defending gold medal

Nelly Korda continues her pursuit of a second gold medal in Olympic golf. After an even-par finish in Wednesday's opening round at Le Golf National in Guyancourt, France, the No. 1 golfer in the world entered Thursday's round in a 13-way tie for 13th place on the leaderboard. She's moved up the leaderboard and is now in a tie for third place (-4), four strokes off the lead. Swiss golfer Morgane Metraux has the lead (-8) after shooting a 66 in round 2. France's Celine Boutier, round 1 leader, has struggled today shooting a +4 through 17 holes.

American Anna Hall going for gold in heptathlon

Team USA's Anna Hall sits in third place after the first two events of the women’s heptathlon, the 100m hurdles and high jump. Hall’s time of 13.36 seconds ranked seventh in the hurdles, while her high jump effort of 1.89m was third in the field.

Kyrgyzstan's Bekzat Almaz Uulu got a fast takedown to lead 2-0, but that's about all he would get.

Spencer Lee flashed a variety of offense to lock up a 12-2 technical fall, first with a double-leg takedown and leg lace, then a single-leg takedown and leg lace, followed by a go-around takedown and gut wrench. His par terre offense was really on display here after he was unable to have many opportunities in his first match. That, and a determined, fierce look following being taken down that even was noticeable for a guy like Lee that normally has that demeanor on the mat.

Lee advances to the semifinals. He'll face Uzbekistan's Gulomjon Abdullaev, a former Tokyo Olympian who finished seventh that cycle. Abdullaev's only world or Olympic medal comes at the junior level in 2016 with a bronze. — Eli McKown

Swimmer Katie Ledecky, a four-time Olympian and 14-time medalist, and rower Nick Mead, who earned his first medal as part of Team USA’s gold medal-winning men’s four, will lead Team USA as flag bearers at the Closing Ceremony on Aug. 11.

American climber Sam Watson set a world record of 4.74 seconds in the small final of speed climbing to earn a bronze medal.Watson lost his head-to-head heat in the semifinals when a slight slip against China’s Peng Wu cost him a spot in the finals.However, Watson earned a spot in the small final against Iranian speed climber Reza Alipour Shenazandifard and bested his own world record by 1/100th of a second. — Sandy Hooper

USA's Brooke Raboutou advances in sport climbing

LE BOURGET, France — American sport climber Brooke Raboutou advanced to the boulder and lead finals set for Saturday, Aug. 10. Raboutou, a two-time Olympian, finished semifinals in third.""I'm really happy I was able to stay calm and I just wanted to climb with my normal pace and rhythm,"" said Raboutou. ""Sometimes, in these rounds, it can be stressful to feel like you're climbing not to fall. I didn't want to do that. I wanted to feel good on the wall.""American teammate Natalia Grossman, a first-time Olympian, came into the lead portion of qualification needing a strong performance, but she fell early on the route to put her in seventh with four climbers to go.Only the top eight climbers qualified for finals, and Grossman ended the competition in 11th out of 20 climbers, missing finals. — Sandy Hooper

USA men’s 4x100 relay makes statement

SAINT-DENIS, France — The U.S. men’s 4x100-relay team made a statement in the opening round of the relay.

A team of Christian Coleman, Fred Kerley, Kyree King and Courtney Lindsey got the baton around clean and it was over from there.

The men led from start to finish as they crossed the line in 37.47 for the easy victory.

Noah Lyles and Kenny Bednarek will likely run in the final for Team USA. — Tyler Dragon

Two-time shot put world champ Chase Jackson out

SAINT-DENIS, France — American Chase Jackson failed to get out of the opening round of the women’s shot put.

Jackson scratched on her first two attempts and needed a third and final throw to advance to the final. Unfortunately for Jackson, her third throw didn’t come off her hand clean and landed at 57 feet, 9 inches – just short of a qualifying spot.

Jackson was visibly upset after her disappointing opening round. She came into Paris as a gold-medal contender in the shot put. She’s won two straight world championships in the event.

Americans Jaida Ross and Raven Saunders both advanced. — Tyler Dragon

Sha’Carri Richardson, Gabby Thomas lead Team USA to easy opening-round win in 4x100

SAINT-DENIS, France — The U.S. 4x100-relay team had a shaky exchange on the second and third leg between Twanisha Terry and Gabby Thomas that slowed them down a little. However, Sha’Carri Richardson received the baton on the anchor leg and sprinted past Germany to secure the first-round victory for Team USA in 41.94.

Germany took second, running a 42.15 and Switzerland got the last qualifying spot with a time of 42.38.

The U.S. women will have to clean up their handoffs, but they are the gold-medal favorite in the relay, especially with Jamaica’s stars not competing in the event. — Tyler Dragon

Stephen Curry saved Team USA on Thursday night in Paris.

The Golden State Warriors star led the United States out of a huge 17-point hole to beat Nikola Jokić and Serbia 95-91 in their semifinals matchup in France. That officially sent the Americans back to the championship game, where they’ll attempt to win a fifth consecutive gold medal on Saturday.

Curry dropped an Olympic career-high 36 points in the win while hitting nine 3-pointers, which is the most any player has hit in a single game throughout the entire Olympics.

Curry went off almost immediately on Thursday, too. He dropped 14 of the first 15 points for the United States and hit his career high not even halfway through the first quarter. He had 17 points at the end of the first period, but the rest of Team USA shot just 1-of-8 from the field combined in the opening 10 minutes.

Serbia took full advantage of that lull, too. They took an 11-point lead at halftime, and kept their double-digit advantage well into the fourth while shutting down every American run.

Finally, it was Joel Embiid that sparked the push Team USA needed. He went on a quick 7-0 run of his own before a blocked shot set up a drive from LeBron James that finally tied the game up.

Curry then hit a huge 3-pointer, his ninth of the night, and then he and James each followed up with a layup to suddenly put the United States up by seven, which was its largest lead of the night at the time and enough to eventually push them to the four-point win.

Embiid finished with 19 points and four rebounds while shooting 8-of-11 from the field to go with Curry’s 36-point outing. James had a triple-double with 16 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists. They were the only three players to hit double figures for Team USA.

Bogdan Bogdanovic led Serbia with 20 points in the loss, which sent them into the bronze medal game against Germany on Saturday. Jokić added 17 points and 11 rebounds, and Aleksa Avramovic finished with 15 points.

France fended off Germany 73-69 in the other semifinal game on Thursday to earn a spot in the gold medal game. Guerschon Yabusele dropped 17 points to lead France, and San Antonio Spurs star Victor Wembanyama had 11 points and seven rebounds to lift the French back to the gold medal game for a second consecutive Games. The United States beat France at the Tokyo Olympics to win a fourth straight gold."

PARIS (AP) — They scored six points in two seconds. And just like that, against what looked like overwhelming odds, the U.S. Olympic men's basketball team was on its way.

To a comeback. To a win. And to another Olympic gold medal game.

Stephen Curry scored 36 points, including a go-ahead 3-pointer with 2:16 left, and the U.S. will play for gold in the Paris Olympics on Saturday night after beating Serbia 95-91. The U.S. trailed by 17 points in the first half, plus faced an 11-point halftime deficit — the biggest one successfully overcome by an American team since NBA players were added to the Olympic mix in 1992.

Serbia led by 11 with 7:19 left as well. The rest of the way, all U.S.

It’ll be the U.S. against host France for gold on Saturday night, while Serbia will face Germany earlier Saturday for bronze.

The whole game changed in the fourth after a wild sequence saw the U.S. score six points in two seconds. Kevin Durant made a 3-pointer while Anthony Davis was getting fouled. The U.S. got another possession, and off the inbounds Devin Booker made another 3-pointer.

Just like that, a 78-67 lead for Serbia was down to 78-73. The comeback was on, and Curry's 3 put the U.S. up for good. He added a pair of free throws with 8.2 seconds left to make it a two-possession game and the Americans escaped.

USA basketball avoided an embarrassing defeat to Serbia to rally late and reach the men’s gold medal match against France at the Olympics.

Captain Steph Curry, LeBron James and Kevin Durant were among the NBA stars boosting Steve Kerr’s side, but three-time NBA MVP Nikola Jokic pushed their star-studded opponents all the way.

Curry’s 36 points and a triple double from James, with a sprinkling of Durant’s sharp shooting off the bench, were all needed to deny Serbia, who led by double figures for most of the semi-final.

Previously undefeated Germany were earlier stunned by the hosts France in the first semi-final, as Victory Wembayama inspired Les Bleus the FIBA Basketball World Cup winners in a nail-biting finish at the Bercy Arena.

That streak continued today in the women’s freestyle wrestling finals, where Elor defeated Kyrgyzstan’s Meerim Zhumanazarova to take home the gold 3-0.

Elor, 20, was heavily favored coming into the match, and she did not disappoint. Elor stayed poised at the center of the mat, staying true to her signature style reminiscent of men's Greco-Roman wrestling, which focuses on upper-body attacks.

Elor is the youngest Olympic wrestling champion in U.S. history. One day outside the cutoff, she could not compete in Tokyo in 2021. So instead, she found junior championships and won six titles in two years, including the under-20, under-23 and senior world championships.

""It's pretty much unreal. I wanted to go to Tokyo so badly, but life happens, Covid happened,"" Elor said in an interview after her win. ""My coach told me, 'Don't focus on negativity; you can't change it.'""

""Focus on training and getting better and make the next Olympics,"" she said.

She defeated her opponent in the semifinals in only one minute, 44 seconds and defeated the reigning world champion in the quarterfinals.

Elor’s parents are from Israel, where she has become an online sensation. Her path has been filled with obstacles, including the loss of her brother, who was shot and killed in a robbery in 2018.

""I'm sharing this medal with my whole entire family. I'm sharing this family with my entire country, with everyone I've met on and off the mat,"" Elor said. ""I have to do this — if not for me, then for them."""
"Noah Lyles says he tested positive for Covid-19, ran 200-miles.",https://uk.news.yahoo.com/olympics-2024-sydney-mclaughlin-levrone-195749935.html,"When Noah Lyles took on the NBA with his ‘world-champion-of-what?’ jibe, his argument was that no competition came close to matching the global reach of track and field, never mind one played almost exclusively in the US. Seldom can any view on a subject have been vindicated in a more unwelcome way.

Here in the Stade de France, Lyles was hoist by his own petard, his bid for a 100m-200m double kiboshed by Letsile Tebogo, who ran a blistering 19.46seconds in the latter sprint to win Botswana’s first ever Olympic gold medal.

Ironically, even by the NBA closed view of global supremacy, Lyles would not have been king, countryman Kenny Bednarek taking silver in 19.62. The pre-race favourite, who revealed afterwards he ran despite testing positive for Covid two days ago, managed only 19.70 for third.

But this is America, so of course, the rest of the world did not have its own way for long. In her latest mind-boggling 400m hurdles display, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone broke the world record for the sixth time in her life to claim Olympic gold for the second time.

A run of 50.37 made a race with the clock out of what should have been one of the head-to-heads of the Games, Dutch star Femke Bol fading to third after trying to match what really ought to be an unsustainable pace. Ludicrously, McLaughlin-Levrone’s time would have been ninth-fastest in the 400m flat semi-finals the day before.

Before these Games began, there was talk that if Lyles got it right, a world record might be on his agenda, too, that he might not emulate Usain Bolt’s doubles of Beijing, London and Rio, but take down his 200m best as well.

In truth, the 27-year-old has never really looked in that kind of form, perhaps partly explained by the infection that has now come to light.

Before this evening, he had run five races at these Olympics, but won only two. One of those was by just five-thousandths of a second, albeit that which mattered most, as he claimed 100m gold.

The 200m, though, is his event, or at least has been at the World Championships three times in a row. At the Olympics in Tokyo, he had taken only bronze, but then gone unbeaten for three years, until finishing second in Thursday’s semi-final, again behind Tebogo.

Usually more into Yu-Gi-Oh! than old fashioned bluff, after that loss, Lyles had kept cards close to chest, skipping media duties as the world wondered whether defeat had been at all by design. But there was no tomfoolery here, only medical precaution.

Lyles did not look a man lacking for vitality as he bounced and roared his way onto the track, the last of the runners to be introduced. Out of the blocks, too, he was explosive, quickly up on the shoulder of Erriyon Knighton. The real danger, though, was wider, in lanes seven and eight, where Bednarek had been moved to after protesting about organisers’ favouritism towards Lyles.

Lyles could not follow up his 100m gold - and it was later revealed he had COVID (AP)

The American in the white headband led off the bend but lost the lead within yards from there. In the statistical dissection of that 100m thriller last weekend, one of the nuggets to emerge was that it was actually Tebogo who had reached the highest top speed.

Then, he had peaked too late to go any further than sixth. Here, it sent him clear.

Which is exactly where McLaughlin-Levrone has spent most of her recent career. Except here was supposed to be a contest, a first meeting since 2022 with Bol, the only other woman in history to break 51 seconds and the world champion in her absence in Budapest last year.

Their distant rivalry had existed without needle. Bol had never called McLaughlin-Levrone “the American that never shows up”, though outside the States and major championships, she rarely does. McLaughlin-Levrone had never claimed she could win anything blindfolded, though it’s tempting to think she could.

Bol had never beaten McLaughlin-Levrone even with eyes open and here went all in to try. They set off stride for stride, literally for the first time: until this winter, Bol had taken 15 steps between each hurdle, but has now dropped that to 14 for the first seven to match the formula that had made McLaughlin-Levrone the greatest of all-time.

For 200 metres she kept tabs, then for 200 more paid the price.

Lord Sebastian Coe, the World Athletics chief, has suggested the women’s hurdles should be made taller to challenge McLaughlin-Levrone. You could have have put barbed wire on top of them up the home straight here, and she’d still have charged through the lot to gold."

SAINT-DENIS, France — Noah Lyles lost the Olympic 200 meters Thursday, falling to Botswana’s Letsile Tebogo, then being tended to by medics who carted him off the track in a wheelchair. Later, wearing a mask as he spoke with reporters, Lyles said he had COVID.

After crossing the line third for the second straight Olympics, Lyles fell to his back and writhed in pain, staying down for nearly 30 seconds before getting up, asking for water and getting to the wheelchair.

“It definitely affected my performance,” he said.

An hour after that shock, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone lowered her world record for the sixth time, finishing the 400-meter hurdles in 50.37 seconds for another Olympic blowout.

The hurdler expected to challenger her hardest, Femke Bol, finished third, behind American Anna Cockrell, who finished 1.5 seconds behind McLaughlin-Levrone.

This is McLaughlin-Levrone’s second straight gold and also the second straight Olympics the virus has played a major role in Lyles’ trip to the Games.

He also won the bronze in the Tokyo Olympics, and he has said the empty stands and the year-long delay before the Games led to depression that hampered his performance and inspired his road to Paris.

Lyles said he tested positive early Tuesday morning and quickly got into quarantine.

“I still wanted to run,” he said. “They said it was possible.”

The U.S. track federation released a statement saying it and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee adhered to all Olympic and Centers for Disease Control guidelines.

“After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight,” the statement said. “We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.”

The men’s 4×100 relay is set for Friday, and Lyles was expected to run the anchor leg in what many thought would be a quest for a third gold medal in Paris. He said that decision had not been made as of late Thursday.

“I want to be very honest and transparent, and I’m going to let them make the decision,” Lyles said, describing himself as being at around 90 or 95%.

In the 200, Tebogo, 21, led wire-to-wire and won in 19.46 seconds, the fourth-fastest time in history, but .15 slower than Lyles’ top time. Kenny Bednarek finished in 19.62 for his second straight silver, and Lyles, four nights after winning a close-as-can-be 100, ran the curve in 19.70.

The first sign something might be wrong came a night earlier when Lyles finished second in a lackluster semifinal, then left the track without talking to reporters to head to the medical tent. His coach said he was fine.

It became clear he was not when Tebogo and Bednarek reached the curve in the final.

Lyles was trailing as they headed into the homestretch, which is usually where he puts on a trademark closing finish that has always been the best part of this race. This time — nothing. Only a desperate push to the line then a collapse onto the purple track.

“To be honest, I knew if I wanted to come out here and win, I had to give everything I had from the get-go. I didn’t have any time to save energy. So that was kind of the strategy for today.”"

Team USA had a stunning and landmark day at the track, Tuesday at the 2024 Paris Olympics. In the space of an hour, American track and field athletes picked up two golds, a silver and two bronze medals.

The U.S. medal haul began in the men’s 1,500 meters when Cole Hocker stunned the defending gold and bronze medalists from Tokyo to win the race and his first gold medal in an Olympic record time. Hocker was joined on the podium by fellow American Yared Nuguse, who took bronze.

But that was just the first of gold-bronze finish for U.S. runners at the Stade de France. In the women’s 200, Tokyo bronze medalist Gabby Thomas stormed to victory to capture her first gold, while teammate Brittany Brown finished third to earn bronze.

Annette Nneka Echikunwoke made sure field athletes were part of the Olympic medal party, collecting silver in the women’s hammer throw. USA TODAY Sports has highlights and results from all of Tuesday’s action below.

Faulkner and teammates Jennifer Valente, Lily Williams and Chloe Dygert posted the second-fastest time in qualifying for women's team pursuit in 4:05.238.

New Zealand had the fastest qualifying time (4:04.679), and Great Britain (4:06.710) and Italy (4:07.579) rounded out the top four.

The U.S. and Great Britain, the world's most-decorated programs in the event, will race in Friday's first round. Of the eight fastest qualifiers, the teams that post the two best times in Round 1 will meet for the gold medal.

Cuban wrestler wins fifth straight Olympic gold then immediately retires

PARIS — A Cuban wrestler made Olympic history Tuesday, and perhaps put himself in the conversation as one of the greatest Olympic athletes ever.

Mijaín López became the first Summer Olympian in any individual sport to win five consecutive gold medals in the same event, a masterful feat of longevity and dominance that he reached by defeating Chile's Yasmani Acosta, 6-0, in the 130-kilogram final in Greco-Roman wrestling at Champ-de-Mars Arena.

When it was over, López picked up his coaches in a pair of bear hugs before walking to the center of the mat and untying his shoes. In the international symbol for a wrestler's retirement, he removed his shoes, left them on the mat and walked away.

Nicknamed ""El Terrible"" for his imposing figure and sheer dominance, López won his first Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Games in Beijing, when he was 25 years old. He won his fifth just a few weeks shy of his 42nd birthday. — Tom Schad

US figure skaters will get 2022 Olympic gold medals — under Eiffel Tower

The Kamila Valieva doping saga, one of the most controversial, arduous and infuriating scandals in Olympic history, reaches its long-awaited conclusion Wednesday evening at the base of the Eiffel Tower when, for the first time in history, Winter Olympians will receive their gold medals at the Summer Olympics.

Exactly 2½ years to the day after the team figure skating competition ended at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, U.S. figure skaters will get their gold medals and their Japanese counterparts their silvers at the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics

Russia dropped from first place to third after Valieva was suspended for four years and her Olympic results were disqualified, but since Russia is not allowed at the Paris Olympics due to the war in Ukraine, their skaters will not be allowed at the medal ceremony and will receive their bronze medals elsewhere, probably in Russia at some later date.

All nine skaters on the U.S. team, their coaches and several members of each of their families flew to Paris on Tuesday courtesy of the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee and the International Olympic Committee.

LYON, France — Exactly one year ago, the U.S. women’s national team was at the lowest point in its illustrious history, knocked out of the World Cup in the quarterfinals in what was the team’s earliest exit ever at a major international tournament.

On Tuesday, they reached the gold medal match at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

“It means everything,” said Sophia Smith, whose sublime goal in the 95th minute made the difference in the 1-0 win over Germany.

“We had a tough year last year. In every way possible,” Smith said. “But I feel like this is a new year and we’re really just showing the world that we didn’t ever drop off. We just needed a learning year and a growth year and we’re back. And, hopefully, on top after this next game.

Team USA's Sarah Hildebrandt advances to gold medal wrestling match

American Sarah Hildebrandt got out early in the women's 50kg wrestling semifinals with a snap-down, go-behind takedown to go up 2-0 on Mongolia's Otgonjargal Dolgorjav, a two-time world silver medalist. While Dolgorjav was in on a single-leg shot, Hildebrandt slipped out of the Mongolian's grasp and countered with a single-leg takedown of her own. After a passivity point, she led 5-0 going into the second period and held on for a victory.

Hildebrandt, despite a significant height advantage, broke free or held on for a whistle on three shots that Dolgorjav was in deep on her legs to secure a shutout victory. While Dolgorjav had gotten the best of her on two occassions at the world championships prior, Hildebrandt was the more technically sound and tougher wrestler in this match.

Hildebrandt will face India's Vinesh Phogat, who has bursted onto the scene for the first time as a three-time Olympian by defeating Japan superstar Yui Susaki (four-time world champion and Tokyo Olympic gold medalist) in the first round. She is a two-time world bronze medalist. — Eli McKown, Des Moines Register

Imane Khelif has a shot at Olympic boxing gold after semifinal win

PARIS – Imane Khelif will be fighting for gold.

The Algerian boxer advanced to the finals of the women’s welterweight division Tuesday night with a victory over Thailand’s Janjaem Suwannapheng at Roland-Garros Stadium.

It was Khelif's third victory in as many fights at the Paris Olympics, earning her a spot in the gold medal match Friday despite being dragged into a controversy over gender eligibility.

Khelif, 25, previously beat Thailand’s Suwannapheng in the semifinals of the 2023 world championships. Soon after that bout, Khelif was disqualified for allegedly failing gender eligibility tests, according to the International Boxing Association (IBA), a discredited group that has no role in the Olympics.

The IOC said Khelif and Taiwan's Lin Yu-Ting, another female boxer disqualified at the 2023 world championships, both met all criteria to participate in the women's competition. They also competed at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.

Like Khelif, Lin has excelled here inside the ring. She won each of her two fights by unanimous decision and has advanced to the semifinals in the women’s featherweight division. — Josh Peter

U.S. men's basketball team cruises to Olympic semifinals

PARIS – If U.S. men’s basketball coach Steve Kerr hammered home his points of emphasis against Brazil to reporters, imagine what he told his team ahead of Tuesday’s quarterfinals matchup.

Defend and rebound, and the rest will take care of itself, Kerr said in a variety of ways after the U.S. completed group play and advanced to the knockout stage.

His players listened.

The U.S. did exactly that on its way to a 122-87 victory against Brazil, advancing to Thursday’s semifinals where it will face Serbia. The winner will play the winner of France-Germany for the gold medal.

The U.S. outrebounded Brazil when it mattered, held Brazil to 42% shooting and relied on its offensive firepower to put up points.

Devin Booker led the U.S. with 18 points, and Joel Embiid finished with 14 points and seven rebounds. Kevin Durant scored 11 points, and LeBron James added 12 points, nine assists and three steals. The U.S. shot 58% from the field and 48% on 3-pointers

Bruno Caboclo scored a game-high 30 points for Brazil. — Jeff Zillgitt

Brazil beats Spain in women's soccer semifinal, will face USWNT for gold

Brazil earned a date with the U.S. women's national team this weekend with Olympic gold on the line.

Brazil jumped out to a big 3-0 lead over Spain in the second women's soccer seminal before putting away the defending World Cup champions 4-2. Brazil and the USWNT will face off Saturday, Aug. 10 at 11 a.m. ET in the gold-medal match.

Brazil took a 2-0 halftime lead into the locker room after goals by Irene Parades and Gabi Portilho. Brazil surged to a 3-0 lead on a headed goal by Adriana, before Spain finally got on the board late in regulation on Salma Paralluelo's goal. Brazil made it 4-1 with a breakaway goal in the first minute of extra time. Kerolin's timely interception left her unguarded and sprinting towards goal. She fired the ball between Spanish keeper Cata Coll's legs to give Brazil a three-goal lead.

But Spain wasn't done and neither was Salma Paralluelo. After scoring her team's first goal in the 85th minute, notched her second of the match in the 12th minute of stoppage time. But the deficit was too much to overcome for Spain, who will now face Germany for the bronze medal.

USA falls in women's beach volleyball quarterfinals

No Americans are left in women's beach volleyball after the pair of Sara Hughes and Kelly Cheng fell to Tanja Hueberli and Nina Brunner of Switzerland in the quarterfinals.

The Swiss won the first 21-18 after falling behind early in the match. And, despite a late rally by the Americans in the second set to tie it at 19-all, Hueberli and Brunner scored two straight points to get the decisive second set win.

The only U.S. pair left in beach volleyball at the Paris Olympics is on the men's side. Miles Partain and Andrew Benesh will play in the quarterfinals on Wednesday. — Jordan Mendoza

Brazil dominating Spain in women's soccer semifinal

Brazil jumped out to a huge 3-0 lead over Spain in the second women's soccer semifinal of the 2024 Paris Olympics before the defending Women's World Cup finally got on the board in the closing minutes of regulation.

An attack by Brazil leads to mayhem in front of the goal, but Adriana's header off a headed pass from Gabi Portilho put As Canarinhas up 3-0 in the 72nd minute. Spain countered with a goal by Salma Paralluelo in the 85th minute, off an assist by Jennifer Hermoso, to make it 3-1.

The winner of this match plays the United States in the gold medal match on Saturday. The loser faces Germany for bronze.

U.S. men's basketball team up big on Brazil at halftime of quarterfinal

PARIS — Joel Embiid hears the boos from the French fans. It doesn’t bother him. Or at least it didn’t in the first half of the U.S. quarterfinals game against Brazil.

Embiid scored a team-high 14 points and had seven rebounds as the U.S. took a 63-36 lead into halftime against Brazil.

Brazil had a trimmed a 19-point deficit to 42-34, but the U.S. the half on a 21-4 run. LeBron James had 10 points and eight assists, and his final assist of the half came on an out-of-bounds alley-oop to Jayson Tatum just before the buzzer. Devin Booker had nine points for the U.S. which had 11 of its 12 players who played in the first half score points.

The U.S. shot 59% from the field and 50% on 3-pointers and held Brazil to 34% from the field and 29% on 3-pointers. The U.S. also limited Brazil’s offensive rebounds to four, and it entered the game as the best offensive rebounding team in the tournament at 13 per game.

Right now, it’s too many defenders, rebounders and scorers for Brazil to handle. — Jeff Zillgitt

Amit Elor wins gold for USA, cements her status as rising wrestling star

PARIS — Team USA's Amit Elor won the first gold medal of her promising wrestling career Tuesday at the 2024 Paris Olympics, crushing her latest opponent in the women's 68-kilogram weight class − Meerim Zhumanazarova of Kyrgyzstan − just like she has crushed almost everyone else who has stepped onto the mat with her over the past four-plus years.

Elor's 3-0 victory in the gold-medal match at Champ-de-Mars Arena gives her 41 consecutive victories at the international level, across age divisions, dating back to 2019. It also makes Elor, 20, the youngest Olympic gold medalist in the history of U.S. wrestling and just the third American woman to take gold, joining two of her idols: Helen Maroulis and Tamyra Mensah-Stock.

Elor has won eight world championships in three different age divisions − including senior, under-23 and under-20 titles in each of the past two years. — Tom Schad

Gabby Thomas wins gold, Brittany Brown bronze for USA in women's 200

SAINT-DENIS, France — The gold medal in the women’s 200 is coming back to the U.S.

Gabby Thomas took an early lead around the curve and had a comfortable advantage after 100 meters. Thomas sprinted toward the finish line down the home stretch and crossed the line in 21.83, a few meters ahead of everyone else. She was the only sprinter to run a sub-22 in the race.

Saint Lucia’s Julien Alfred, the gold medalist in the 100, took the silver medal at 22.08 and Team USA’s Brittany Brown got bronze, running a 22.20.

American McKenzie Long finished seventh at 22.42.

USA defeats Hungary to reach women's water polo semifinals

NANTERRE, France — Team USA women’s water polo defeated Hungary, 5-4, in the last quarterfinal match on Tuesday to keep its Olympic run alive. Playing for a fourth consecutive Olympic gold medal, the Americans won to advance to the semifinals match against Australia, which topped Greece, 9-6, earlier in the day.

In a hard-fought contest, the two teams were fairly even throughout the match, and Team USA had a 3-2 lead after two quarters. Tied at 4-4 midway through the fourth quarter, a goal from Rachel Fattal delivered the go-ahead score and ultimately sealed the victory for the Americans.

Team USA’s captain Maggie Steffens led the team with two goals, and goalkeeper Ashleigh Johnson made 17 saves on 21 shots on the day at Paris La Défense Arena.

The winner of this match plays the United States in the gold medal match, Saturday in Paris.

USA's Annette Nneka Echikunwoke wins silver in women's hammer

SAINT-DENIS, France — American Annette Nneka Echikunwoke is an Olympic medalist.

The 28-year-old, whose previous best finish at a world championship with 12th, had her greatest day of 2024, throwing a season-best 75.48 meters (247 feet, 7¾ inches) to earn the silver medal in the women's hammer throw at the Paris Games.

Echikunwoke’s silver gives the Americans medals in each of the throwing events so far, after Ryan Crouser won men’s shot put for the third consecutive Olympics, and Valarie Allman won women’s discus gold for the second consecutive Games. Neither javelin final has happened yet.

Canada’s Camryn Rogers, who competed at the University of California in college, won gold with a throw of 76.97 (252 feet, 6¼ inches), which she tossed on her fifth attempt. Until that heave, it looked like Echikunwoke would might win.

The bronze went to Jie Zhao of China, who threw 74.27 (243 feet, 8 inches).

The other American in the final, Deanna Price, finished 11th with a throw of 71.00 (232 feet, 11¼ inches). — Lindsay Schnell

Americans Cole Hocker, Yared Nuguse take gold and bronze in men's 1,500

SAINT-DENIS, France — Cole Hocker stunned Great Britian’s Josh Kerr and Norway’s Jakob Ingebrigtsen to win the men's 1,500 in dramatic fashion.

Hocker was in fourth place during the final lap but had one final kick left with roughly 60 meters to go and shockingly ran by favorites Kerr and a fading Ingebrigtsen as the crowd cheered.

Hocker crossed the line in first and immediately threw his hands up in jubilation as the scoreboard displayed that he had run an Olympic record 3:27.65 to win gold. Hocker becomes just the fourth American to win an Olympic gold medal in the 1,500.

Kerr finished second in a nation record 3:27.79 and fellow American Yared Nuguse snuck in to get the bronze, running a personal-best 3:27.80. It's the first time Team USA has had two medalists in the men's 1,500 in 112 years.

Ingebrigtsen took a disappointing fourth place and was in disbelief at the finish. Ingebrigtsen won gold at the Tokyo Olympics and Kerr got the bronze. This year’s 1,500 was supposed to be a showdown between the two, but Hocker stole the show and set the Olympic record. — Tyler Dragon

Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone leads three Americans into women's 400 hurdles final

Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone looks like her usual spectacular self, and that’s bad news for everyone else.

McLaughlin-Levrone easily won her heat — what else is new? — in the women’s 400 hurdles semifinals Tuesday evening at Stade de France, turning in a 52.13 in a race where she barely looked like she was trying. McLaughlin-Levrone is the world record holder (50.65), and heavy gold medal favorite. In this race, everyone is basically running for silver. She turned in the best semifinal time by more than fourth-tenths of a second.

McLaughlin-Levrone has said she wants to go below 50 seconds, and given her history of world records on the biggest stages, anything seems possible in Thursday’s final. At the very least it seems like a given that McLaughlin-Levrone will set a new Olympic record, which currently sits at 51.46. She set that in Tokyo three years ago.

American Jasmine Jones also qualified, finishing second in her semifinal at 53.83. The third American hurdler, Anna Cockrell, also advanced to the final, using a strong kick to pull in front of Jamaica’s Shiann Salmon. Cockrell finished in 52.90. — Lindsay Schnell

USWNT beats Germany to reach soccer's gold medal match

LYON, France — The United States women’s national soccer team defeated Germany, 1-0, in the semifinals on Tuesday to advance to the gold medal match at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Sophia Smith scored a goal in overtime, assisted by Mallory Swanson, to keep the Americans’ chances of winning their first gold since 2012 alive. Goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher made an incredible save with her foot deep into extra time to keep Germany off the board.

The USWNT will face the winner of Spain vs. Brazil, which kicks off at 3 p.m. ET, on Saturday in Paris. — Nancy Armour

France lineup change pays off vs. Canada in men’s basketball quarterfinal

PARIS – French coach Vincent Collet made a massive lineup change ahead of France’s quarterfinal game against Canada, a game in which the loser was knocked out without a chance to medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics. Collet benched Rudy Gobert and Evan Fournier, who each started the three games in group play, and the jolt worked.

France advanced to the semifinals with an 82-73 victory against Canada Tuesday at Bercy Arena. It will play Germany Thursday for a spot in the gold-medal game.

Frank Ntilikina, Nic Batum, Isaia Cordinier, Victor Wembanyama and Guerschon Yabusele started for France, which took an early 19-5 lead. The defense forced Canada to miss 10 of its first 12 shots and commit five turnovers.

Yabusele scored 22 points, Cordinier scored 20 and Fournier added 15, and Gobert logged just four minutes.

France phenom Victor Wembanyama did not have a great offensive game (just seven points on 2-for-10 shooting), but he had 12 rebounds, five assists, three steals and one block and kept Canada’s guards from scoring at will in the paint.

Canada shot 38% from the field, 24% on 3-pointers and put France on the line 42 times. France outscored Canada 33-18 from the free throw line. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led Canada with 27 points, and RJ Barrett had 16 points. — Jeff Zillgitt

U.S. women's volleyball team sweeps Poland to reach semifinals

The United States women's volleyball team made short work of Tuesday's quarterfinal, sweeping Poland 25-22, 25-14, 25-20 to move into Thursday's semifinal against powerhouse Brazil.

The Brazilians haven't dropped a set in four matches in these Olympics. They swept the Dominican Republic in a quarterfinal earlier Tuesday.

Against Poland, the U.S. rolled through the first two sets in a total of only 45 minutes of playing time. The Americans then overcame a 7-1 deficit to start the third set, rallying to take the lead at 15-14 and eventually close out the match to advance within one victory of another Olympic medal.

The U.S. has earned a medal in women's volleyball in each of the past four Olympics, including a gold in Tokyo. Brazil beat Team USA for gold medals in the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, while the Americans won the final match against Brazil in 2021.

In pool play in 2024, the Americans lost their first match of the Olympics against China but rebounded to edge Serbia 3-2 in a critical second match. From there, the U.S. hasn't lost a set, sweeping host France and Poland. — Gentry Estes

All three Americans qualify for 400 final

SAINT-DENIS, France — Quincy Hall looks ready for the 400 final.

Hall raced around the track and had a clear lead ahead of all the other sprinters at the 300-meter mark. Down the homestretch, Hall maintained a five-meter lead over his competitors and cruised to the finish line in 43.95 to win his semifinal heat.

Hall won the U.S. Olympic track and field trials in the event. His season-best of 43.80 is the second fastest time in the world this year.

Grenada’s Kirani James ran a season-best 43.78 to win the second heat. While U.S. sprinter Christopher Bailey finished third, running a 44.31. Bailey’s time was good enough to advance to Wednesday’s final.

In the third and final semifinal heat, Great Britian’s Matthew Hudson-Smith took his foot off the gas with 20 meters remaining and coasted to a 44.07 to win. Hudson-Smith has the fastest time in the world this year (43.74).

Michael Norman finished second in the heat (44.26) to secure the other automatic qualifying spot.

The top two in each heat, plus the next two fastest times advanced to the 400 final.

Olympic wrestling: American Sarah Hildebrandt heads to gold medal match

At the Tokyo Olympics, Sarah Hildebrandt tasted Olympic glory. Now, she has an opportunity to make it sweeter.

Hildebrandt, the reigning Olympic 50kg bronze medalist in women's wrestling, will grapple in the final on Wednesday. The 2021 Games medalist defeated Mongolia's Otgonjargal Dolgorjay to advance to the final.

Skateboarder Bryce Wettstein finishes outside of medal range

PARIS — Bryce Wettstein nearly made history Tuesday in the women’s park final by becoming the first American woman to medal in skateboarding at an Olympic Games. Instead, the American women will have to wait until the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.

Wettstein ended up sixth in the eight-person final after finishing the preliminaries second overall. Her score of 88.12, which came on her first run, wasn’t enough in a finals in which the women threw down. Wettstein fell in the second and third rounds.

Australia’s Arisa Trew, 14, took gold; she entered Paris as the No. 2 park rider in the world. No. 1-ranked and defending silver medalist Hiraki Cocona, who will turn 16 later this month, of Japan repeated with silver.

Great Britain’s Sky Brown, who at 13 years old won bronze in Tokyo three years prior, took bronze again.

Trew took the lead in the final round with a splendid 45 seconds of skating. The judges rewarded her with a 93.18 to move into first. Hiraki’s final run bumped her ahead of Brown but she could not leapfrog Trew. – Chris Bumbaca

Simone Biles discusses 'pin trading' with husband Jonathan Owens

Jonathan Owens seems to have gotten the full taste and experience of the 2024 Paris Olympics — including some inside pin trading.

Thanks to the Chicago Bears granting him some time away from training camp, Owens was able to watch his wife, decorated women's gymnast Simone Biles, win several Olympic medals, including helping the USA women's gymnastics team return to gold in the team-all-around event.

And while the first-year Bears safety was able to take in the excitement and history of Biles becoming of the most decorated U.S. Olympic gymnast (both men or women), Biles told TODAY's Hoda Kotb Tuesday morning that he was just as excited to pin trade at the Paris Games.

""He was so excited. He was more excited to pin trade,"" Biles said. ""He was loving to pin trade. I didn't think he would but I did warn him that pin trading was really huge. So he absolutely loved that."" – John Leuzzi

Olympic basketball: Nikola Jokic, Serbia hold off Patty Mills and Australia in OT

PARIS – Trailing by 24 points in the second quarter against Australia, Serbia chipped away at the deficit until it took a fourth-quarter lead – only to watch Patty Mills force overtime on a jump shot with two seconds left in the fourth quarter.

However, Serbia has three-time NBA MVP Nikola Jokic. The Serbian star scored consecutive buckets in the final 67 seconds of overtime, lifting Serbia to a 95-90 victory over Australia in a their men’x 5x5 basketball quarterfinals game Tuesday.

Jokic (Denver Nuggets) had 21 points, 14 rebounds, eight assists and four steals, and Bogdan Bogdanovic (Atlanta Hawks) had 17 points, six assists and five rebounds for Serbia. Mills (free agent) scored 20 of his 26 points in the first half, and teammate Josh Giddey (Chicago Bulls) scored 25 points for Australia.

Australia led 44-20, bit Serbia cut that to 54-42 at halftime and took a lead in the third quarter.

Serbia will play the USA-Brazil winner in the semifinals Thursday. – Jeff Zillgitt

PARIS — Before her third and final run of the women’s park skateboarding preliminaries, Bryce Wettstein wished she could slow down time.

“I think when you work that hard to get here, and you’re like, ‘I’m here, I need to enjoy it,’” Wettstein said. “So I’m feeling out of this world … that was my dream run.”

Wettstein laid down a run oozing with confidence, difficulty and skill that resulted in a 85.65 from the judges. But before the score even showed up on the video board at Place de Concorde on Wednesday, the 20-year-old pumped both of her arms through the air.

The score placed her in second place entering finals, which took place later in the day.

Wettstein fell early in her first run and posted a 75.22 in the second, which would have left her on the cusp of making finals. She told herself to remove the doubts and go full swing. − Chris Bumbaca

SAINT-DENIS, France — The Canadian Olympic Committee has revoked the accreditation of Rana Reider, the personal coach for track and field athlete Andre de Grasse, on its Olympic team, amid recent allegations of sexual and emotional abuse. Reider also coaches Italian Olympian Marcell Jacobs and American Trayvon Bromell.

Three lawsuits have been filed in Broward County, Florida against Reider and the track club he runs, among a list of other defendants.

The first complaint, which was filed in December 2023, lists the plaintiff as Jane Doe and includes an allegation of rape. The other two cases were filed in June by a 35-year-old retired long jumper from Great Britain and a 28-year-old American sprinter, who allege that Reider sexually harassed them by grabbing their buttocks or making suggestive comments about their appearances, among other claims.

USA TODAY does not identify individuals who allege sexual abuse without their permission. Attorneys for Reider did not immediately reply to messages seeking comment Tuesday. − Chase Goodbread

Serena Williams claims she was denied by a Paris restaurant

Stars, they're just like us: They post negative reviews of restaurants online too. Even during the Paris Olympics.

Just look at Serena Williams' tweet from earlier this week: ""Yikes @peninsulaparis I’ve been denied access to rooftop to eat in a empty restaurant of nicer places but never with my kids,"" the tennis champion posted on X. ""Always a first.""

The restaurant, for its part, offered statements to media outlets apologizing to Williams while claiming it was fully booked. It replied to her tweet: ""Please accept our deepest apologies for the disappointment you encountered tonight. Unfortunately, our rooftop bar was indeed fully booked and the only unoccupied tables you saw belonged to our gourmet restaurant, L’Oiseau Blanc, which was fully reserved.""

It's unclear exactly what happened, though as is usually the case in incidents of this nature, people on both sides have weighed in. − David Oliver

Americans go head-to-head in sport climbing

LE BOURGET, France — Due to their time seeding, two American speed climbers had to go head-to-head in the first elimination run of speed qualifications at sport climbing.

American Sam Watson set a new world record time 4.75 seconds, a record he held and lost a few runs earlier in seeing to Indonesia’s Veddriq Leonardo. “Taking (the world record) back after I lost it by a couple thousandth of a second definitely means a lot,” said Watson after the competition.

American teammate Zach Hammer was eliminated.

Only seven climbers who won their elimination heats and one lucky loser with the fastest time advanced to the quarterfinals on Thursday, Aug. 8. − Sandy Hooper

Day two of six has begun for wrestling at the Olympics early Tuesday.

Hildebrandt secured a spot in the semifinals, pushing Team USA to a strong start in women's freestyle. However, Bey has been eliminated while Rau needs a win from his opponent in the round of 16 to stay alive. − Eli McKown

French crowd motivates Americans in sport climbing

LE BOURGET, France − In the boulder round of the women’s sport climbing semifinal, the tops were plentiful, unlike the men’s qualification round the day before.

Reigning gold medalist Janja Garnbrett finished the four boulder problems with an almost perfect score of 99.6 points out of 100 for first place. “It should be (one) hundred,” Garnbrett said jokingly after the competition.

Americans Brooke Raboutou finished qualification in third with 83.7 points and Natalia Grossman finished fifth with 69.2. Grossman had one of two flashes (no falls) on boulder number 2.

France’s two athletes Oriane Bertone and Zelia Avezou got the loudest cheers from the majority French crowd, which appeared to distract the rest of the climbers. “It was distracting to hear all that cheer, but it was also motivating,” said Raboutou.

The women’s semifinal will continue on Thursday with the lead event. The climber’s scores for both boulder and lead will be combined, and the top eight finishers will move on to finals. − Sandy Hooper

Men's diving 3m springboard prelims: Two Americans advance

Team USA divers Carson Tyler and Andrew Capobianco both finished among the top-18 divers in Tuesday’s men’s 3-meter springboard prelims to advance to the semifinals on Wednesday.

In the six-round prelims, Tyler, 20, finished with a score of 389.80 to qualify in 10th place, while Capobianco, 24, was 15th with a score of 382.05.

A first-time Olympian, Tyler finished strong with his fifth- and sixth-round dives: first a reverse 3 1/2 somersaults in the tuck position with a 3.5 degree of difficulty, followed by a reverse 1 1/2 somersaults with 3 1/2 twists in the free position, also with a 3.5 degree of difficulty. Each dive earned Tyler a score of 73.50, his highest of prelims.

Two-time Olympian Capobianco also had his prelims high score on his final dive, a forward 4 1/2 somersaults in the tuck position with a degree of difficulty of 3.8, which got him a score of 79.80. That was strong enough to move him inside the top 18 ahead of Wednesday’s semis.

At the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, Capobianco finished 10th in the men’s 3-meter springboard, but he earned a silver medal in the men’s synchronized 3-meter springboard competition.

Men’s 3-meter springboard semifinals are set for Wednesday at 4 a.m. ET. − Michelle Martinelli

Three Americans qualify for long jump final

SAINT-DENIS, France — American Tara Davis-Woodhall is going into the long jump final as a confident jumper. Her jump of 22 feet, 7¾ inches leads all jumpers into the final.

Jasmine Moore is sixth going into the final with a leap of 21 feet, 10¼ inches and Monae' Nichols has the eighth best mark at 21 feet, 9½ inches.

The opening round did have a little bit of drama. Defending Olympic champion Malaika Mihambo scratched her first two attempts and needed her third jump to qualify into the final.

On Mihambo’s third attempt, she took off over 30 centimeters behind the board and still qualified for the final with a mark of 22 feet, 6¼ inches. − Tyler Dragon

400 hurdles: U.S. runner qualifies through repechage round

SAINT-DENIS, France — Trevor Bassitt shook off a bad round Monday and advanced in the men’s 400 hurdles via the repechage round.

Bassitt led for almost the entire race and crossed the finish line in 48.64 to win his heat. Bassitt will now have a chance to run in Wednesday’s semifinal.

U.S. hurdler Rai Benjamin has the top time in the world this year in the event at 46.46. − Tyler Dragon

Kendall Ellis bounces back in women’s 400

SAINT-DENIS, France — Kendall Ellis rebounded following a tough time around the track on Monday.

Ellis easily won her 400 heat in the repechage round to advance to Wednesday’s semifinal.

The U.S. Olympic track and field trials champion finished fifth in the first round and didn’t initially advance to the semifinal. — Tyler Dragon

Freddie Crittenden advances in 110 hurdles in repechage round

SAINT-DENIS, France — U.S. hurdler Freddie Crittenden took full advantage of his second chance.

Crittenden got first place in his repechage heat of the men’s 110 hurdles. His first-place finish gives him a chance to race in the semifinals of the 110 hurdles.

The Paris Olympics introduced the repechage round. It allows runners who don't initially qualify from the first round to the semifinals to have a chance to rescue their Olympic dreams via the repechage rounds.

The semifinals for the 110 hurdles are set for Wednesday. USA track and field team co-captain Grant Holloway is the gold-medal favorite in the event. — Tyler Dragon

Faith Kipyegon, three Americans qualify for 1,500 semis

SAINT-DENIS, France — A day after being re-issued her silver medal in the 5,000, Kenya’s Faith Kipyegon was back on the track to defend her Olympic title in the women’s 1,500. The world-record holder and two-time Olympic champion in the 1,500 got through safely in the event, taking fourth place in the second heat with a time of 4:00.74.

Three American middle-distance runners will join Kipyegon in the 1,500 semis.

Emily Mackay grabbed the sixth and final qualifying spot in the first heat, running a 3:59.63. Nikki Hiltz ran a solid race and finished third in the second heat at 4:00.42. While Elle Purrier St. Pierre crossed the finish line at 4:03.22 to take third in the final heat.

The women will take to the track again on Thursday for the 1,500 semifinals. — Tyler Dragon

Olympic track today: What to watch

The final event of the night will be the women’s 200 meters. American Gabby Thomas won silver at the 2023 world championships, followed by Sha’Carri Richardson, who took the bronze. Jamaica’s Shericka Jackson, the reigning world champion, is ranked No. 1 in the world as of late May.

U.S. sprinter Noah Lyles rang it after winning a gold medal in the men's 100-meter final. So did the United States women's rugby sevens team after winning an unprecedented bronze medal.

The large bell stationed at Stade de France, which hosts track and field events and rugby sevens, has become an instant hit at the 2024 Paris Olympics, with athletes hoping to have their chance to ring in the new Paris tradition after earning a gold medal.

The bell is engraved with ""2024 Paris,"" and will continue to be a part of the city's history in the time following the 2024 Games.

Fans have wondered what the bell's importance is, and why so many Olympic athletes have gravitated toward it after finishing their respective events. — Austin Curtright

We invented basketball. Name the form of it: 5x5, 3x3, Streetball, Slamball, HORSE. Doesn’t matter. We have the deepest pool of talent in the world to draw from. We’re supposed to win. We don’t celebrate bronze medals around here, and if this were a sport USA Basketball were actually serious about, everyone involved in the men’s 2-5 showing in Paris (after not even qualifying for Tokyo) would be fired.

But I’m here to tell you something after watching it up close in Paris: The effort isn’t worth it. — Dan Wolken

Olympic skateboarding today: What to watch

In the women’s park event, expect to see a battle of teenage stars. At the Tokyo Olympics, held in 2021 due to COVID, Kokona Hiraki made history at age 12 as Japan’s youngest Summer Olympian. She won silver in women’s park behind her teammate Sakura Yosozumi. Hiraki is back, ranked No. 1 in the world leading up to the Paris Olympics, with 14-year-old Arisa Trew of Australia ranked No. 2.

Olympic wrestling today: What to watch

In women’s freestyle wrestling, American Amit Elor is a medal contender at 68 kilograms despite this being her first Olympics. The 20-year-old has taken the international wrestling scene by storm, winning eight world titles over various age divisions in the last three years.

Algerian boxer Imane Khelif is headed back into the ring Tuesday at the Paris Olympics.

She’ll be fighting for a chance to win a silver or gold medal despite an ongoing ordeal during the Games, and she'll be facing a familiar opponent. — Josh Peter

Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone breaks 400m hurdles world record to win gold.,https://time.com/7009273/sydney-mclaughlin-levrone-400m-hurdles-gold-world-record/,"American hurdling phenom Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone won her second consecutive Olympic gold medal in the 400-m event, breaking her own world record in the Olympic final for the second consecutive Games. She crossed the finish in 50.37 seconds, two places ahead of her rival, Femke Bol of the Netherlands. Anna Cockerel of the U.S. won silver.

“Grateful to be healthy and to come out of it in one piece,” said McLaughlin-Levrone afterward. “There was a lot of anticipation leading up to this race, but just grateful for all that has taken place. God has been good to me.”

McLaughlin-Levrone breaks her own world records—on giant stages such as the Olympics—with admirable nonchalance. “I crossed the line, I was definitely grateful for that time,” she said. “I was hoping it was a little faster. I’m sure there are some things in the middle there we can clean up. Walking away from this, I'm happy, I'm encouraged, and there's always more work to do.”

Hype for the McLaughlin-Levrone-Bol bout reached a fever pitch going into this race. The Stade de France crowd was wearing more orange than usual, as thousands of Dutch fans filed in to cheer on Bol, whose stunning kick in the last lap of the 4x400-m mixed relay on Saturday night, which gave the Dutch team gold, seemed to send a message to the McLaughlin-Levrone camp. Bol—whose delightful high-pitched voice has received its fair share of attention—was a threat.

McLaughlin-Levrone, however, ultimately dismissed it. She had thought about running the mixed relay too, but having to run 400-m heats the next morning ultimately scared her off. “We just didn't want to risk it,” she said. “But definitely something in the future, we’ve talked about wanting to do maybe in the years to come. It seems like a fun relay.”

The victory for the Dunellen, N.J., native justified the strategy of passing on an ambitious attempt to run both the hurdles and flat events. Ever since McLaughlin-Levrone skipped last year’s world championships with “a minor knee issue,” she said at the time, defending her gold in this race, on this night at the Olympics in Paris, was the paramount goal.

Bol dismissed the notion that running the mixed relay last week wore her legs out for her matchup with Laughlin-Levrone. “I'm used to racing a lot,” said Bol. “I think if I would have maybe put my race up differently, I could have run faster.”

McLaughlin-Levrone will almost definitely run the 4x400 relay this upcoming Saturday night, like she did in Tokyo. The American women are the overwhelming favorite in that race; a victory would give McLaughlin-Levrone her fourth career Olympic gold medal.

Much like Katie Ledecky in the pool, McLaughlin-Levrone is a lower-key presence on the track than, say, Noah Lyles, who took bronze in the 200-m race earlier in the night despite having COVID-19. “Sydney McLaughlin possesses a quiet confidence,” Felix wrote about McLaughlin-Levrone in TIME in 2021, “that demands your attention.” (McLaughlin and her husband, former NFL player Andre Levrone Jr., wed in 2022.) She wrote a book released in January— Far Beyond Gold: Running From Fear to Faith—that detailed her struggles to live up to expectations. She doesn’t seem to particularly enjoy doing interviews or crave commercials. “I love to sleep,” she enthused in a Women’s Health cover story that ran before the Games. Her talent, however, alights the track, nearly every time out. This repeat Olympic title was years in the making. McLaughlin-Levrone is the daughter of runners; her father, Willie, reached the 400-m semifinals at the 1984 Olympic trials, and her mother, Mary, ran in high school. “Track and field has always been part of our lives,” McLaughlin-Levrone told the Olympic Channel Podcast. At the 2016 Rio Olympics, McLaughlin, then 16, became the youngest athlete to make the U.S. Track and Field team since 1972. In 2017, McLaughlin became the first person to be named Gatorade High School Athlete of the Year for two straight years. She spent a year at the University of Kentucky before turning pro.

Now, every time McLaughlin-Levrone hits the starting blocks, she’s a threat to push her sport to new limits. Whether she’s lining up against Bol or all other comers, mark your calendar for Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, and embrace her greatness—with reporting by Alice Park/Saint-Denis"
Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone breaks 400m hurdles world record to win gold.,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5688911/2024/08/08/sydney-mclaughlin-levrone-400-meter-hurdles-olympics-gold/,"SAINT-DENIS, France — Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone is a privilege. A splurge. The immense entertainment from watching her underscores the infrequency of the pleasure.

And perhaps in her scarcity, McLaughlin-Levrone is teaching, whether coincidentally or intentionally. In a culture of instant gratification, fueled by relentless consumption, she refuses to be governed by greed masked as adoration.

She’s her own woman, with her own plan. While she no doubt appreciates the love, she remains unaltered by sports’ obsession with greatness. So when she does appear, rather than lament the infrequence, it’s better to savor.

Thursday, the world indulged. And Sydney, a day after turning 25, obliged the thirst for her excellence.

She not only defended her Olympic crown in the 400-meter hurdles, besting Netherlands’ star Femke Bol in a much-anticipated showdown. But McLaughlin-Levrone delivered the race of her life.

She broke the world record for the sixth time: 50.37 seconds. She only needed 300 meters to end the suspense. Really 200 meters. By the time she rounded the final curve, it was her against the clock. She came ever-so close to getting under 50 seconds.

“I wasn’t looking at the clock,” she said. “I crossed the line and was definitely grateful for that time. Was hoping it was a little faster … I’m sure there are some things in the middle there we can clean up.”

It was a dominant performance that left zero doubt about her superiority. A masterpiece on the track in the City of Art. Le Louvre has Mona Lisa. Thursday night, Stade de France had Sydney Michelle.

There’s NO catching Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone! She adds ANOTHER 400m hurdles gold medal and WORLD RECORD to her collection. #ParisOlympics pic.twitter.com/RJ7reApKfV — NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) August 8, 2024

In her third Olympics, she earned her third gold medal, second in her preferred discipline. She’s the first woman ever to repeat as Olympic champion of the 400-meter hurdles. Only Glenn Davis has won consecutive golds on the men’s side, in 1956 and 1960. Edwin Moses won in 1976 and 1984, with the U.S. boycotting the 1980 Games in Moscow.

The prodigy McLaughlin-Levrone — who won the under-18 world championship at 15, made her Olympic debut at 16, won an NCAA title at 18 and turned pro at 19 — has grown into the all-time great her talents suggested. In the six years since signing an eye-popping seven-figure deal with New Balance in 2018, she has racked up 10 major championships as a pro: four U.S. Championships, three World Championships and now three Olympic golds. She said she’ll run in the women’s 4×400 relay, so it may well be 10 golds by the weekend.

She has one silver.

That came in 2019 at the 2019 World Championships in Doha, Qatar, when Dalilah Muhammad set a world record at 52.16 seconds. And .07 seconds behind Muhammad was a 19-year-old Sydney. She hasn’t lost a 400-meter hurdles race since.

She’d probably win gold in the 400, the 200 and the 800 if she wanted to. She’s that good. She already opened the door to doing the mixed relays in the future, saying it looks like a fun event. But she wouldn’t reveal any plans about more events.

“All I know is today is Thursday,” she said with a smile. “And tomorrow is Friday.”

That’s what made Thursday so intriguing. Not just the chance to watch McLaughlin-Levrone, but the real threat of a worthy competitor. Bol, 24, entered the night as the only other woman in history to run the 400-meter hurdles in less than 52 seconds, posting a 50.95 in Switzerland last month. Bol — now famous for swallowing America’s monster lead to deliver gold to the Dutch in the 4×400 mixed relay earlier this week — was the only thing sensational enough to make it close.

But McLaughlin-Levrone ended any notion Bol was an equal. Trying to keep up with Sydney’s historic pace exhausted Bol. American Anna Cockrell, who also ran the race of her life, swooped past Bol over the final hurdle and down the stretch. Her personal-best 51.87 earned Cockrell a silver.

“It’s hard to put into words right now,” Cockrell said after winning her first Olympic medal. “Y’all know I’m a yapper. So the fact that I am very much speechless right now. I’m a little bit in shock. I don’t know if it’s from the joy or the exhaustion.”

Bol took bronze in 52.15. Jasmine Jones, the other American in the race, took fourth in 52.29.

If a knock on the Sydney experience exists, it’s in the lack of a rival. Since surpassing Muhammad in Tokyo, McLaughlin-Levrone has been alone. No one to push her to the brink. No one to provoke those seismic moments adversity tends to produce from legends. She’s so good, whatever drama exists before her races evaporates shortly after the gun goes off and it becomes clear the tension was manufactured.

Sydney’s truest foe is her past feats. Her toughest challenge is discovering what she can pull off before finally hitting the ceiling of her ability.

It would add to her lore if she were aligned against other legends. She might have to switch to the 200-meter dash, or compete in multiple individual events, for something daunting. Fortunately, just watching her perform is captivating on its own.

The pre-battle intensity of Mike Tyson. The explosiveness of Serena Williams. The glide of Randy Moss. The regality of Allyson Felix. The competitiveness of Michael Jordan.

To watch Sydney run is to want more. Like eating ice cream. Like slipping on a dope new pair of sneakers. She is the track-and-field illustration of why test drives work. A taste of speed and power and refinement can be intoxicating.

This is why people clamor for another glimpse at, another window into, another moment with McLaughlin-Levrone. Because who knows when she’ll breeze past again.

This was her first international championship since the 2022 World Championships in Eugene, Ore. She withdrew from the 2023 Worlds citing a minor knee injury. Since then, it’s been a laser focus on Paris. Most of her 12 meets in those 24 months, save for the U.S. Olympic trials, were tuneups and prep work for the grand stage of the Paris Games.

Maybe Sydney has this figured out. Maybe the low-supply, high-demand approach is best practice in a sport where the intermittent spotlight chews up athletes who dare maximize it. Maybe she understands brilliance is best appreciated when experienced in moderation, so as not to diminish its marvel. Or maybe she’s learned this is the best way to manage the anxieties and pressures she discusses in her autobiography “Far More than Gold.” Maybe this is the way she can be around, and be great, for longer.

Advertisement

Or maybe, she has decided this is all she’ll give, that her purpose is greater than the fleetness of her feet. If any superstar athletes could walk away from it all, Sydney figures to be high on the list.

That only makes Thursday night’s performance all the more valuable. In an environment that will go down as one of the best in the sport’s history — the venue, the vibe and the volume — one of the greatest of all time did her thing. Satiating the moment’s appetite for spectacular.

Better to savor.

Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone breaks 400m hurdles world record to win gold.,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/aug/08/sydney-mclaughlin-levrone-400m-hurdles-world-record-paris-olympics,"She looked almost lonely in the final stretch, gliding effortlessly over the last couple of hurdles and through the tape nearly 10 metres clear of her closest rivals, a woman alone. The word that comes to mind watching Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone in the 400m hurdles is unbothered, existing in a place beyond the roars of 68,000 spectators in full throat and the eight rivals in her distant wake, an embodiment of poise and technique and steely concentration. She doesn’t even look like she’s running that fast.

The 100th medal for the United States at these Paris Olympics may have been simultaneously the most and least riveting of them all. The pride of New Brunswick, who is so plainly touched by the divine unlike any New Jersey native since Whitney Houston, delivered a breathtaking Olympic performance on Thursday night, reducing a final that was billed as a showdown with Femke Bol of the Netherlands into Secretariat at Belmont. Seeing McLaughlin-Levrone break free from the Dutch star over the last curve and fly through the tape a yawning 1.5sec ahead of US teammate Anna Cockrell only reaffirmed what everyone deep down already knew going in: her only competition is herself.

Let’s start with the basics. McLaughlin-Levrone, who turned 25 on Wednesday, first broke the 400m hurdles world record at the 2021 US Olympic trials, shattered it at the Tokyo Games and has lowered it four more times since, including by nearly three-tenths of a second on Thursday night. In doing so, she became the first American to retain an Olympic title in an individual track race since Michael Johnson’s back-to-back 400m golds in 1996 and 2000. Her winning time of 50.37sec would have been good for third in the second 400m flat semi-final on Wednesday. The owner of seven of the 400m hurdles’ 13 fastest times ever, it’s been more than five years since she lost in the event. No one since Allyson Felix has run more beautifully.

The sport has been so thirsty to find a successor to Usain Bolt that it commissioned the makers of F1 docuseries Drive to Survive to help the cause. Turns out they were looking in the wrong place all along. Whether it’s because the 400m hurdles fell so late in the program or because so many of her teammates were devouring the spotlight and leaving no crumbs on an almost nightly basis, McLaughlin-Levrone has been curiously overlooked throughout the Paris Olympics. But when it comes to star wattage, McLaughlin-Levrone removed all doubt on Thursday night with a pièce de résistance that produced Bolt levels of awe and establishes her as the face of the sport.

At an Olympics billed as an American clapback after an underwhelming showing in Tokyo, especially on the men’s side, the stacked bill on Thursday night was bursting with star-spangled promise, the hottest ticket of the 11-day, 21-session meet with the worst seats fetching upwards of €800 on the official resale platform. Within a dizzying 75-minute span, three of the four Americans tipped for gold made good. In addition to Sydney’s stunning romp, Tara Davis-Woodhall won the long jump, taking a victory lap as James Brown’s Living in America played, while three-time world champion Grant Halloway blew away the field in the 110m hurdles for a long-sought Olympic gold. The one who didn’t was Noah Lyles, who still managed a bronze despite a Covid diagnosis that immediately dwarfed everything else on the track.

Yet somehow the night belonged alone to McLaughlin-Levrone alone, who has come a long way since her Olympic debut at the Rio Games as the youngest US track athlete in more than four decades. She’s since admitted that she deliberately tanked her 400m hurdles semi-final at the Estádio Olímpico Nilton Santos that year due to crippling anxiety and fear of failure. These days? If she’s not already the world’s most dominant athlete, she is surely on the shortlist. And the scary thing is, there’s no telling where this whole thing is headed with a home Olympics in four years’ time.

One of the most enigmatic stars in any sport, McLaughlin-Levrone has consistently teased the world with her broader potential; she has raced in five different disciplines in five events this year, the 100m and 400m hurdles, the 200m and 400m flat and the 4x100m relay, posting world-class times across the board. Only right before the US Olympic trials did she confirm that she was narrowing her focus to her defense of 400m hurdles gold, the event she calls her “first love”.

McLaughlin-Lavrone typically prefers to save herself for the global championship meets. She previously took a one-year break from the 400-meter hurdles, embracing the challenge of focusing on the open 400 for the first time in her career.

McLaughlin-Levrone has been one of the ascendant stars in American track and field since her mid-teens. As a 15-year-old, McLaughlin was the 2015 World youth champion. In 2016, she became the youngest athlete since Denean Howard in 1980 to qualify for the U.S. Olympic track team, having placed third at the U.S. Olympic Trials, with the current world under-18 best of 54.15.

SAINT-DENIS, France — Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone once again broke her own world record, powering over the 400-meter hurdles in 50.37 seconds on Thursday night to defend her Olympic title.

The 25-year-old American has now lowered the world record six times. She was in the lead around the corner and breezed down the home stretch to beat teammate Anna Cockrell by 1.50 seconds.

McLaughlin-Levrone had set the old record, 50.65 seconds, on June 30 at the U.S. Olympic trials.

This was billed as one of the must-see races at the Stade de France, given the rivalry between McLaughlin-Levrone and Femke Bol of the Netherlands. Cockrell crashed the party, with Bol finishing third. She walked down the track, shaking her head.

McLaughlin-Levrone will make competitors do that. There was no catching her once she got up to speed.

Once she crossed the finish line, McLaughlin-Levrone looked up at the scoreboard and gave a quick smile. She makes breaking records look almost easy.

McLaughlin-Levrone moved to 3-0 in races against Bol. She beat Bol, the standout from the Netherlands, at the Tokyo Games in 2021 (Bol finished third) and again a year later at world championships in Oregon.

McLaughlin-Levrone was hurt last season and didn’t race when the world championships were in Budapest. It opened the the door for Bol to win her first world crown.

Coached by Bobby Kersee, McLaughlin-Levrone has been steadily building toward this moment for two years. Mostly out of the spotlight, too. She’s been racing in sprints at 200 and 400 meters and also in the short hurdles — 100 meters, and 60 meters indoors — to gain experience, speed and technique.

It all paid off Thursday in front of a packed house.

She burst on the scene as a teenager, the runner with the unique ability to juggle while riding a unicycle. She competed in the 2016 Olympics at age 17.

More Olympic gold for U.S. in track

American track and field star Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone set a new world record and claimed the gold medal in the 400-meter hurdles final Thursday, repeating her win in Tokyo. American Anna Cockrell nabbed the silver in an upset over world champion Femke Bol of the Netherlands, who finished third for the bronze.

McLaughlin-Levrone finished the race in 50.37 seconds, beating out her own previous world record time of 50.65 seconds, which she set back in June at the U.S. Olympic trials. This was the sixth time she had set the world record for the 400-meter hurdles.

McLaughlin-Levrone went head-to-head with Bol at the 2024 Paris Olympics final — just the third matchup between this generation's two top female hurdlers. McLaughlin-Levrone, the reigning Summer Games champion, has kept breaking the world record, over and over. Bol is the reigning world champ — it probably helped that the American was injured and not there — and already picked up a gold in Paris with a terrific last leg for the Dutch in the 4x400-meter mixed relay on Saturday.

The olympian initially set the world record for the event at the Tokyo Games before beating it in June with a time of 50.65 seconds. Her time during the Paris Games improved on that – setting her new pace and world record at 50.37 seconds.

McLaughlin-Levrone was joined on the podium by her teammate Anna Cockrell and Netherlands athlete Femke Bol, who placed as silver and bronze, respectively. Cockrell ran in a time of 51.87 seconds and Bol in 52.15 seconds.

This marks the third gold medal in McLaughlin-Levrone’s collection. Alongside her pair for the 400-meter hurdle, she also earned one for the 4×400-meter relay in Tokyo.

Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone tore another chunk off the 400m hurdles world record in a stunning defence of her Olympic crown at the Stade de France in Paris.

The race was billed as a showdown between the American and her Dutch rival Femke Bol, the only two women in history to break the 51-second barrier. But McLaughlin-Levrone was on another plane, winning gold in 50.37 sec, well clear of the rest.

In doing so she shaved nearly three tenths of a second off the record mark she set at the US trials in June. Few athletes have ever delivered physics-defying brilliance with the consistency of McLaughlin-Levrone, who has now run the fastest time in history in all of her last six major championship finals.

Behind her, Bol settled for bronze in 52.15 sec after she was beaten down the home straight by USA’s Anna Cockrell, who clocked 51.87 sec for silver.

To understand what she is doing to this event, consider the women’s flat 400m final due to take place on Friday night. Only two of the eight Olympic finalists have ever run faster than McLaughlin-Levrone’s winning time here. Had she been in the third 400m semi-final, with 10 hurdles in her way, she would have won the race.

She had signed up to run the 200m and 400m events at June’s US trials, before pulling out of both when she realised how congested her schedule would be in Paris. Instead she chose to concentrate on the 400m hurdles – “my first love” – and defending her Olympic title won in Tokyo. She did it by bursting through to a whole new time zone.

“I’m grateful to God for this opportunity, grateful to be celebrating my birthday like this,” said McLaughlin-Levrone, who turned 25 on Wednesday. “Just a super opportunity, you can’t even imagine. My whole family’s here. We’re going to celebrate, we’re going to enjoy this time and get ready for the relay too.

“It’s amazing to see our sport continue to grow, for people to want to watch the 400m hurdles, it’s amazing. Just a lot of hard work put in this year. I knew it was going to be a tough race. An amazing competition all the way round.”

Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone crosses the line to win gold ( AP )

Despite her achievements, there was still an element of mystery coming into the race. McLaughlin-Levrone had only raced Bol twice before and not at all for more than two years.

She ran a world record 50.65 sec in the trials to book her place in Paris, but Femke Bol responded with a 50.95 sec at a pre-Games meeting in Switzerland, and the seeds of rivalry were sown.

Dutch fans certainly believed. Pockets of orange filled the Stade de France and the roar that greeted Bol’s arrival let her know they were here.

Bol got off to a good start and there wasn’t much to choose between the favourites entering the back straight. But there McLaughlin-Levrone settled into a rhythm, looking perfectly balanced, taking each hurdle like a mild inconvenience rather than a 76cm-high barrier.

Bol faded, and afterwards revealed her frustration with a time more than a second shy of her sub-51 ran last month.

“All you want to do in an Olympic final is to put up your best race,” she said. “I screwed it up. I’m not sure where I made the mistake. I just got so much lactic acid with 300m to go. I’m not sure why, I really have no explanation. This is just a bad race. I’ll look at the positives, I’ll talk to my coach. I’ll try to enjoy the bronze.”

Cockrell was the benficiary of Bol’s lacklustre race, although she gave most of the credit to Beyonce.

“I’m just overwhelmed, I’m overcome,” said the 26-year-old from California. “There’s not much you can say when you have a PB and you win a medal. It all came together in the best possible way. My coach just told me to have fun, be myself, go out there and be Beyonce.

“I was singing Love On Top in the call room, so shout out to Beyonce. I’m really happy. I’m ugly crying, but I’m really happy.”

By the time she crossed the line, McLaughlin-Levrone was already off celebrating. What more ground can she break? The 400m flat is a target and it is not hard to imagine her attempting both events in Los Angeles in four years’ time.

Perhaps there was a clue as to her next trick in the replays of this win. She dipped five metres too early and was already lurching back upright when she crossed the line. McLaughlin-Levrone left time on the road, and that means the 50-second barrier is not safe."

McLaughlin-Levrone destroyed her prior record crossing the finish line in 50.37 seconds, a full 1.5 seconds clear of the field and nearly 1.8 seconds seconds faster than the previous record holder.

American Anna Cockrell took silver in the race, her first Olympic medal.

McLaughlin-Levrone also became the first track athlete in history to break six world records in the same event. She beat her prior mark, set at the U.S. Track & Field Team Trials in June, by 0.28 seconds in Paris.

In addition to becoming the first to win two gold medals in the 400-meter hurdles, McLaughlin-Levrone was also the first to do so in consecutive Olympics after finishing first in the 2020 Summer Games. In Tokyo, she turned in a time of 51.46 seconds to land atop the podium in the event.

McLaughlin-Levrone has had a knack for breaking her own world records in recent years. She has done so six times in the last three years, according to World Athletics.

It’s an apt hobby for the woman who continues to rewrite her sport’s record book.

The 25-year old McLaughlin-Levrone authored a stunning new chapter to her already decorated career Thursday by winning the Paris Olympic gold medal 400-meter hurdles final in a new world record of 50.37 seconds. She easily beat her top rival, Femke Bol of the Netherlands, to turn what was expected to be a duel into a runaway victory for the New Jersey native.

Even with Bol at 250 meters, McLaughlin-Levrone pulled far ahead as she entered her favorite point of the race — between the seventh and eighth hurdles of the 10-hurdle competition, which comes right as she comes off the final turn, into the last straightaway.

American Anna Cockrell won silver in 51.87, while Bol faded to third in 52.15. She appeared holding back tears after the finish, shaking her head, while McLaughlin-Levrone posted with an American flag.

When McLaughlin-Levrone established her first world record in June 2021, she ran 51.90 seconds. Within 13 months, she lowered it to 51.46, then 51.41, then a 50.68 to win the 2022 world championship that Seb Coe, the president of track and field’s global governing body, described as “jaw dropping.” No woman had ever before broken the 51-second barrier.

After racing the open 400 meters last year and ending the year with a knee injury, she returned to the hurdles this spring to prepare for Paris and lowered her world record again to 50.65 at the U.S. Olympic trials, a time so jaw-dropping, again, that it would have finished sixth at the championships’ open 400 — the race that doesn’t include 10 hurdles.

Yet in July, McLaughlin-Levrone had company. Bol became the second to dip under 51 seconds when she ran 50.95.

With the exception of pole vaulter Mondo Duplantis, who set the world record for the ninth time en route to winning gold, no other track and field athletes had distanced themselves from their competition to the degree of McLaughlin-Levrone, who turned 25 the day before the final, and Bol, 24.

The American held a 2-0 lifetime record against Bol, but they had not raced against one another in two years. That scarcity, combined with the fast times each had produced while racing others, built the anticipation for Thursday’s showdown inside Stade de France. Ultimately, the final reasserted McLaughlin-Levrone’s control over the event by improving her winning streak to 25 consecutive races, a streak that began in August 2019."

Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone world records

McLaughlin-Levrone has set the world record in the 400-meter hurdles a whopping six times in her career. All have come over a three-year span during which she has shown unprecedented dominance in the event.

Here's what to know about McLaughlin-Levrone's six record-setting performances.

51.90

Date : June 27, 2021

: June 27, 2021 Event: U.S. Olympic trials

McLaughlin-Levrone's first record-breaking run came less than two years after Dalilah Muhammad clocked a world-best 52.16-second run in the event.

McLaughlin-Levrone shaved 0.26 seconds off that time at the 2021 U.S. Olympic trials. That set the stage for her to dominate at the 2021 Olympics in an event that was quickly turning into her signature.

51.46

Date : Aug. 4, 2021

: Aug. 4, 2021 Event: Tokyo Olympics

Just 38 days after breaking the 400-meter hurdles world record for the first time, McLaughlin-Levrone did it again. She dominated at the 2021 Olympics, knocking 0.44 seconds off her best time en route to a gold medal.

Impressively, McLaughlin-Levrone achieved this despite facing tough competition from Muhammad, who logged a personal-best 51.58 in the race. That was just 0.12 seconds slower than McLaughlin-Levrone's but 0.32 seconds better than her previous world record.

51.41

Date : June 25, 2022

: June 25, 2022 Event: U.S. Championships

McLaughlin-Levrone didn't settle for smashing the world record during her Olympic run. Less than a year later, she participated in the U.S. Championships and cut 0.05 seconds off her best time from Tokyo, breaking her own world record for a second time.

This run marked the third time in two years that McLaughlin-Levrone had broken the world record. That matched the same number of times that the record was broken over a nearly 24-year period from September 1995 to July 2019.

50.68

Date : July 22, 2022

: July 22, 2022 Event: World Athletics Championships

Less than a month after her record-breaking run in the U.S. Championships, McLaughlin-Levrone returned to Eugene, Ore. to compete in the World Athletics Championships. This time, she cut 0.73 seconds off her time, an incredible feat for less than 30 days between events.

The record made McLaughlin a world champion once again and established herself as one of the best hurdlers in history at the young age of 23.

50.65

Date : June 30, 2024

: June 30, 2024 Event: U.S. Olympic trials

McLaughlin-Levrone once again broke her own world record as she battled for a spot on the 2024 USA Olympic team. She faced decent competition from Anna Cockrell, but McLaughlin-Levrone put together an excellent run and cut 0.04 seconds off her world record time.

That got McLaughlin-Levrone into her second Olympics and she became favored to do what no woman had done before: earn two gold medals in the 400-meter hurdles.

50.37

Date : Aug. 8, 2024

: Aug. 8, 2024 Event: Paris Olympics

McLaughlin achieved her golden dreams on Aug. 8 in an epic fashion. She outraced Cockrell and Femke Bol of the Netherlands to win her signature event in dominant fashion.

The result? McLaughlin-Levrone cut another 0.28 seconds off her record. It marked her sixth world record and continued her steady march toward a sub-50-second mark in the event.

McLaughlin-Levrone is still just 25 and has shown no signs of slowing down. She seems likely to continue participating in this event, and with her 1.5 seconds better than Cockrell, it may take some time before anyone is able to truly challenge the two-time Olympic gold medalist's top mark.

And even if she does slow down, McLaughlin-Levrone has still shaved a massive 1.79 seconds off the world record during her dominant three-year run. That alone will establish her in USA track lore as an all-time great.

McLaughlin-Levrone, 25, now owns three Olympic medals -- all gold. Her other Olympic title came in the women's 4x400m relay at the pandemic-delayed 2020 Tokyo Games.

Team USA accounted for the top two spots on the 400m hurdles podium in Paris as Anna Cockrell won silver. The San Ramon, California, native finished in 51.87 seconds to earn her first Olympic medal.

The Netherlands' Femke Bol, who was viewed as McLaughlin-Levrone's top challenger in the final, took bronze for a second straight Olympics, finishing in 52.15. Earlier in the Games, Bol powered the Dutch to a thrilling comeback win over the U.S. in the mixed 4x400m relay.

That’s the only way to describe Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone’s performance in the Olympic 400-meter hurdle final on Thursday.

Racing alongside her rival, Femke Bol of the Netherlands, at the Stade de France, McLaughlin-Levrone tore out of the blocks, taking the lead by the first hurdle and never relinquishing it. She crossed the line in 50.37, breaking her own world record of 50.65.

Bol would ultimately take bronze in 52.15, while American Anna Cockrell finished strong on the home straight to claim silver, in a personal best of 51.87.

While the matchup between McLaughlin-Levrone—who turned 25 on Wednesday—and Bol, 24, has been building in recent years, it reached another level this season.

On June 30, McLaughlin-Levrone, a three-time Olympian for Team USA, broke the world record for the fifth time when she won the U.S. Olympic Trials. Two weeks later, Bol responded with a breakthrough 50.95 at the Resisprint La Chaux-de-Fonds meeting in Switzerland. As a result, she became just the second woman in history to break 51 seconds in the event.

Last year, McLaughlin-Levrone didn’t contest the 400 hurdles due to a knee injury. In her absence, Bol won the 2023 world title.

The anticipation continued to build in the days leading up to the Olympic final. The day prior to the first round of the 400-meter hurdles, Bol anchored Belgium’s mixed gender 4x400-meter relay team to gold with a blazing 47.93 seconds on the last lap.

Both sprinters cruised through their respective heats in the first and second round, picking up speed as the meet went on in Paris. “Iron sharpens iron,” McLaughlin-Levrone said to the media after running 52.57 seconds in the semifinals. “It’s always fun racing the best, and I know we’re going to push each other.”

Paris marked the first time McLaughlin-Levrone and Bol competed against each other since the 2022 world championships in Eugene, Oregon, where the four-time U.S. national champion lowered the previous world record to 50.68.

McLaughlin-Levrone seems to thrive on the world’s biggest stage.. At the 2016 U.S. Olympic Trials, she finished third at the age of 16 and became the youngest American track and field athlete to qualify for the Olympics. She made it to the semifinals in Rio that summer. Three years later, she broke the world record while winning gold at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games.

Now, she is the first athlete in history to repeat as Olympic champion in the event.

It was yet another world record-breaking performance for Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone at the 2024 Paris Olympics on Thursday.

The former University of Kentucky star has now broken the world record in the 400-meter hurdles six times after finishing in 50.37 seconds. She also won the gold medal in the 400 hurdles in Tokyo, the only woman to do so twice in that event at the Olympics.

McLaughlin-Levrone’s previous world record was 50.65 seconds, set at this year’s U.S. Olympic Trials. She is expected to run in the 4x400-meter relay later this week.

“I’m always here if they need me,” she said afterward.

Expectations were as high for American runner Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone as for perhaps any other athlete entering the 2024 Paris Olympics. And after Thursday’s women’s 400-meter hurdles final, everyone is realizing those expectations weren’t high enough.

McLaughlin-Levrone pulled away while rounding the backstretch to blow away the field, win by more than a second, and set a new world record with an incredible run of 50.37 seconds. Anna Cockrell of the United States nabbed the silver while Femke Bol of the Netherlands took bronze.

GOLD IN WORLD RECORD TIME🥇@GoSydGo is an Olympic champion once again!#ParisOlympics pic.twitter.com/cLOouNgIGx — Team USA (@TeamUSA) August 8, 2024

McLaughlin-Levrone, who turned just 25 on Wednesday, already has three Olympic Games under her belt and now three Olympic gold medals to her name. She has now set a new world record six times in the 400m hurdles over the past five years, the most recent one before Thursday’s race coming less than two months ago at the U.S. Olympic Trials (50.65 seconds). She is widely considered one of the most popular female track stars in American history, and she’s a regular on national television commercials and one of the faces of Team USA.

She’s become an international superstar all while remaining a boldly yet gracefully unashamed follower of Christ.

After her semifinal run of the 400m hurdles in Paris, McLaughlin-Levrone talked about her trust in God in an interview with NBC’s Lewis Johnson.

“You work all year to get here, but what you’ve done is what keeps you here,” she said. “So it’s just about executing that, trusting the process, trusting the plan, and ultimately, trusting God.”

McLaughlin-Levrone also credited her husband, Andre Levrone Jr., for being “my best friend, my biggest supporter, my personal pastor. I love him more than life itself.” The couple married in May 2022.

McLaughlin-Levrone writes that she is “resting in Jesus’ grace” in her X bio, and she declares that “Jesus is Lord” on Instagram. She talks openly and often about her faith in Christ on both social media platforms.

“Let me start off by saying, what and honor it is to be able to represent not only my country, but also the kingdom of God,” she captioned an Instagram post after the Tokyo Olympics. “What I have in Christ is far greater than what I have or don’t have in life. I pray my journey may be a clear depiction of submission and obedience to God. Even when it doesn’t make sense, even when it doesn’t seem possible. He will make a way out of no way. Not for my own gratification, but for His glory.

“I have never seen God fail in my life. In anyone’s life for that matter. Just because I may not win every race, or receive every one of my heart’s desires, does not mean God had failed. His will is PERFECT. And He has prepared me for a moment such as this. That I may use the gifts He has given me to point all the attention back to Him.”

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone (@sydneymclaughlin16)



Away from the track, McLaughlin-Levrone wrote a book called “Far Beyond Gold: Running From Fear to Faith,” which was released in January. In the book, she shares her testimony and talks about how her relationship with Christ has helped her battle perfectionism and anxiety.

In addition to her numerous public comments about her faith, McLaughlin-Levrone was featured in the Summer 2024 Edition of the Sports Spectrum Magazine and has been a guest on the Sports Spectrum Podcast multiple times, first in 2021 and again this past January.

“There’s been a lot of talk that I’ve received just about, you know, ‘you might not want to talk so much about [faith]. You might lose endorsements, you might lose deals, this, that, and the third,'” McLaughlin-Levrone said on the podcast in 2021. “But, I mean, I don’t live for the approval of people, so I don’t have to worry about any of those things. And even if an endorsement or something wants to leave, I know that God will provide for me in the way He sees fit. So I’m not going to compromise the truth just to make people feel more comfortable.

“… I continue to speak the truth because I know it’s what I’m called to do, and just grateful to have community around me and supports me through that even if all the people outside of that don’t.”

“In a sport where you’re literally chasing gold all the time, I would take my love for Christ and that relationship over a gold medal any day,” she said later in the podcast.

For the rest of her life, McLaughlin-Levrone will be known as one of the best track athletes in American history. She’ll be known as a three-time gold medalist (with maybe more to come) and someone who held a world record. Still, she knows that all of it pales in comparison to her identity in Christ.

“For a long time, track was who I was,” she said on the podcast in 2021. “But now more than ever, first and foremost I’m a child of God, and track is not who I am, it’s what I do.”

Advertising Read more

The 25-year-old added another entry into her catalogue of broken barriers on Thursday as she stormed to gold in the 400m hurdles with a world record-breaking display to become the first woman ever to win back-to-back Olympic titles in the event.

The American track darling blew away reigning world champion Femke Bol of the Netherlands to take gold in 50.37sec at the Stade de France, bettering her own world record of 50.65sec set in Eugene in June.

It was just the latest milestone in a dazzling career that has seen McLaughlin-Levrone redefine notions of what was previously thought possible in her event.

In the space of three years, McLaughlin-Levrone has smashed the world 400m hurdles record no fewer than six times, including Thursday's latest jaw-dropping display.

She became the first woman in history to run under 52 seconds for the event in 2021 when she clocked 51.90sec at the US Olympic trials in Eugene, Oregon.

She followed that by shaving a massive 0.44sec off her record when she powered to her first Olympic gold at the Tokyo Games in 51.46sec.

Not content with breaking the 52-second barrier, McLaughlin-Levrone then created more history by ducking under 51 seconds in Eugene in 2022 with a time of 50.68sec -- a record she lowered again at this year's US trials.

Thursday's Olympic title also extends a remarkable five-year winning streak.

Her last defeat over the 400m hurdles came in the final of the 2019 World Championships in Doha, where she was pipped for victory by her compatriot Dalilah Muhammad.

While she has some way to go before matching Edwin Moses' nine-year, nine-month unbeaten run between 1977 and 1987, there is little argument McLaughlin-Levrone can now comfortably lay claim to being the greatest women's 400m hurdler in history.

Teenage breakthrough

US' Sydney Mclaughlin-Levrone crosses the finish line to win the women's 400m hurdles at the Olympics on Thursday © Jewel SAMAD / AFP

Born in New Jersey in 1999, track and field was embedded in McLaughlin-Levrone's DNA.

Her father, Willie McLaughlin, reached the semi-finals in the 400m at the US trials for the 1984 Olympics, while her mother Mary was a respectable half-miler.

As a young girl, McLaughlin-Levrone watched the 2008 Beijing Olympics, and her idol Allyson Felix, and determined that she would one day perform on the same stage.

After qualifying for her first Olympics as a teenager in 2016, McLaughlin-Levrone's progression continued steadily before her breakthrough Olympic crown in 2021, her improvements coming rapidly after linking up with new coach Bobby Kersee in 2020.

In Tokyo, she added another gold medal after forming part of the relay 4x400m relay squad, where she raced in a quartet alongside Felix.

""Since I was eight years old, that's something I had aspired to do, and for it to finally come to fruition felt like a weight off my shoulders,"" McLaughlin-Levrone said of her 2021 gold.

Thursday's stunning victory in Paris raises the prospect of McLaughlin-Levrone targeting a third straight Olympic gold in four years time in Los Angeles, where she lives and trains.

While 2028 remains a long way distant, McLaughlin-Levrone says she sees herself running well beyond this summer.

""It does get harder as the years go by,"" she said in a recent interview.

""You're pushing your body to its limits. It's a part of sports that can be physically draining, mentally draining, and that's why taking breaks and remembering why you love it is so important.

""Track is not going to last forever, so I'm trying to continue to enjoy it. I don't want to take anything for granted.""

Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone breaks 400m hurdles world record to win gold.,https://www.newsday.com/sports/olympics/2024-olympics-o16034,"PARIS — The latest updates from track and field events at Stade de France on Thursday at the Paris Olympics.

U.S. sprinter Noah Lyles missed out on the double in the 200-meter final. Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone of the United States went head-to-head with Femke Bol of the Netherlands in the 400-meter hurdles final.

McLaughlin-Levrone is the world record holder and reigning Olympic champion. She beat Bol at the Tokyo Olympics, then again at 2022 world championships. Bol, the reigning world champion, ran an inspired anchor leg for the Dutch to win gold in the 4x400-meter mixed relay on Saturday.

Lyles had chills, aches, sore throat from COVID

American sprinter Noah Lyles says COVID-19 left him at less than his best for the 200-meter final that ended with bronze instead of gold.

Lyles says he was diagnosed with COVID on Tuesday morning. He dealt with chills, aches and a sore throat. He says he was feeling better by the time he ran onto the track at Stade de France. Lyles estimates he was about 90-95 percent by the time the starting gun went off.

Lyles says he never thought of not competing, adding he hasn’t made up his mind on whether to race for the U.S. in the men’s 4x100 final scheduled for Friday.

Grant Holloway finally gets his Olympic gold

The American hurdler cruised to victory in the men’s 110-meter final. The three-time world champion and silver medalist in Tokyo three years ago exploded out of the blocks to win going away.

Holloway finished at 12.99 seconds, well clear of teammate Daniel Roberts in second at 13.09. Roberts out-leaned Rasheed Broadbell of Jamaica, who finished with bronze.

Gold for McLaughlin-Levrone, who breaks her own world record

American sprinter Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone broke her own world record in winning the women’s 400-meter hurdle final.

McLaughlin-Levrone ran away from the rest of the field, posting a time of 50.37, easily breaking the Olympic mark of 51.46 she set in Tokyo three years ago and just ahead of the 50.65 she put up at the U.S. Olympic trials earlier this year.

Anna Cockrell of the U.S. was second at 51.87, with Femke Bol of the Netherlands in third at 52.15.

Both were well behind McLaughlin-Levrone, who was around 10 meters in front of everyone else when she hit the tape.

Lyles had been diagnosed with COVID, AP source says

American sprinting star Noah Lyles is dealing with COVID-19.

The men’s 100-meter champion was diagnosed with COVID two days before the 200-meter final, a source close to the situation told the AP.

Lyles seemed to be his typical amped-up self during introductions. He couldn’t quite keep pace with gold medalist Letsile Tebogo or American teammate Kenny Bednarek, who grabbed silver.

Lyles held on for bronze then fell to the track afterward.

No double for Noah Lyles, settles for bronze in 200

There will be no golden double for American sprinter Noah Lyles.

The 100-meter champion could only salvage bronze in the men’s 200-meter final.

Letsile Tebogo of Botswana earned the gold with a time of 19.46. Tebogo was in control the whole way, beating silver medalist Kenneth Bednarek by a stride.

Lyles, who raced out onto the track trying to amp up the crowd, held on for third. He fell to the track in the immediate aftermath and was tended to by trainers before getting up and walking over to a nearby bench.

Lyles had edged out Jamaica’s Kishane Thompson by five-thousandths of a second in the 100. He was a heavy favorite in the 200 — his better race — though he trailed Tebogo in Wednesday’s qualifying heat.

Mihambo’s challenge: Winning consecutive golds in long jump

Defending Olympic long jump champion Malaika Mihambo of Germany has history working against her as she looks to defend her title in the women’s final.

No woman has won consecutive golds in the event since it was introduced at the 1948 London Games.

German great Heike Drechsler is the only two-time Olympic champion. She reached the top of the podium in 1992 in Barcelona and again in Sydney eight years later. Drechsler began her Olympic career with a silver in 1988 while competing for East Germany.

The long jump final is part of a busy night at Stade de France that will include the men’s 200-meter and women’s 400-meter hurdles final.

Sha’Carri Richardson to the rescue

Sha’Carri Richardson bailed out the U.S. women out from a near collapse earlier Thursday in the Olympic 4x100 relay, overcoming a German runner in the anchor leg to help the Americans win their heat and move to the gold-medal race.

The U.S. men, who haven’t won a medal in this event since 2004, advanced easily despite a small hiccup. In the strangest twist of all, it was Jamaica’s men who struggled with the baton and will be sitting on the sideline for Friday’s final.

In the women’s race, Richardson was about three steps behind after receiving the baton from Gabby Thomas, who earlier nearly misconnected on her exchange with Twanisha Terry.

That put Richardson in a hole against Rebekka Haase, but the 100-meter silver medal winner was looking back at Haase by the finish. The U.S. won in 41.94 seconds, .19 ahead of the Germans."

Open Extended Reactions

LeBron James, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone and Noah Lyles were some of the most recognizable names who competed Thursday at the Paris Games.

Lyles, the men's 100-meter gold medalist, earned a bronze medal in the 200-meter dash with a time of 19.70 seconds. Kenny Bednarek captured silver with 19.62 seconds.

The United States men's basketball team stormed back against the Serbian national team and three-time NBA MVP Nikola Jokic for a berth in the gold medal game. The U.S. faced a deficit of as much as 17 points, but outscored Serbia 32-15 in the fourth for a win.

While that game was ongoing, McLaughlin-Levrone won gold in the women's 400-meter hurdles final, setting a new world record for the sixth time. On the men's side, Grant Holloway won the men's 110-meter hurdles, while Daniel Roberts finished with a silver.

Here's what you missed on Thursday.

Team USA storms back for comeback win

Facing their biggest deficit of the 2024 Paris Games, the U.S. needed a furious comeback to defeat Serbia 95-91 and advance to the gold medal match.

Stephen Curry led Team USA with 36 points, the second most by a U.S. men's player at the Olympics all time, trailing Carmelo Anthony vs. Nigeria in 2012 (37), according to ESPN Stats & Information. LeBron James had 16 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists, his second triple-double ever at an Olympics. He is the first player with multiple triple-doubles at the Olympics in men's basketball.

The U.S. trailed for 35:12 in the game, while only leading for 3:25. They took the lead in the fourth behind a 3-pointer from Curry with 2:24 remaining and never relinquished it.

Grant Holloway left no doubt in the 110-meter hurdles, jumping out of the gate for gold with a time of 12.99. It's Holloway's first gold -- he won silver in Tokyo -- and Team USA's 20th gold in the event and first since Aries Merritt in 2012.

The United States' Daniel Roberts took home silver, while Jamaica's Rasheed Broadbell won bronze.

3:46 p.m. ET -- U.S. men's hoops in trouble vs. Serbia at halftime

After blowing past Serbia in the group stage, the U.S. faced a different challenge in the semifinal. Team USA trailed by 11 going into halftime and by as much as 17 points, its largest deficit of the 2024 Olympics.

The last time the U.S. trailed at halftime of an Olympic game was the semifinal in Tokyo.

Stephen Curry had 20 points in the first half, more than his point total of any game in Paris. No other U.S. player was in double digits.

Aleksa Avramović led Serbia with 15 points, while Bogdan Bogdanović had 12 points. Reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokic had nine points and seven assists.

3:29 p.m. ET -- Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone wins gold in 400-meter hurdles with WR

America's Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone broke the world record in the women's 400 meters -- for the sixth time -- to win another gold medal. And she obliterated her previous mark with a 50.37. The 25-year-old absolutely owns this event.

In what was billed as one of the great showdowns of these Olympic games -- Netherland's Femke Bol versus McLaughlin-Levrone -- it was never really close. McLaughlin-Levrone led the entire time, breezing down the stretch while defending her Olympic gold medal. American teammate Anna Cockrell posted her personal best at 51.87 to win the silver while Bol won bronze at 52.15.

There's NO catching Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone!

McLaughlin-Levrone and Bol are considered their generation's best female hurdlers, but they have only faced off three times against each other. McLaughlin-Levrone -- who owned a 2-0 head-to-head record heading into Thursday's final -- has embraced the challenge, saying iron sharpens irons. Now she is 3-0 against the Netherlands star.

At U.S. trials, McLaughlin-Levrone broke the world record with a 50.65, her fifth time breaking it. The world record had stayed the same from 2003 to 2019. Then the flood gates broke open, beginning with Team USA's Dalilah Muhammad breaking the record twice in 2019.

There was a sea of orange in Stade de France today, with Bol garnering a ton of support from her home country. But it's the USA on top of the podium yet again, as McLaughlin-Levrone and Cockrell hugged after the finish line.

3:09 p.m. ET -- Steph Curry has scorching hot start vs. Serbia

With a spot in the gold medal match on the line, Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry came to play. He erupted for 17 quick points in the first quarter against Serbia, already his most in a game at the 2024 Paris Games.

At one point, Curry had more points than the entire Serbian team. However, the U.S. couldn't capitalize on Curry's strong start -- the rest of the team had just five points with 3:29 remaining in the first. Serbia had a 31-23 lead after the first.

2:42 p.m. ET -- Kenny Bednarek, Noah Lyles grab silver and bronze medals in 200m final

Noah Lyles wanted to come to the Olympics to prove he was the world's fastest man. For now, that's just in the 100-meter dash, as the sprinter won a bronze medal in the men's 200-meter final. Team USA's Kenneth Bednarek won the silver medal for the second straight Games.

But it was Botswana's Leslie Tebogo, 21, -- who had finished ahead of Lyles in their semifinal heat on Wednesday -- who won gold in 19.46 seconds, the African record. Bednarek posted a 19.62 and Lyles ran 19.70.

Afterward, Lyles got wheeled off into the tunnel. He was shown on the videoboard before he came out of the tunnel wearing a mask, an indication he might be sick.

The 27-year-old has emerged as a huge character this Olympic cycle, not afraid to show off his boisterous personality -- most notably chirping NBA players for calling themselves world champions. But all he ever wanted was recognition as the world's fastest man and the true world champion. When Lyles came out of the tunnel, he put on a show: clapping, skipping and hyping up the crowd, similar to what you see from an NFL player on Sundays. He knocked over the starting blocks and was given a yellow card afterward for violating a technical rule. A USA chant broke out before the gun. The PA announcer had to shush the crowd before they began.

Bednarek kicked it in for the last 90 meters. It was down to him and Tebogo in the end, but the 25-year-old Wisconsin native won silver for the second straight Olympics. -- Emily Kaplan

2:20 p.m. ET -- Team USA men's basketball ready for semifinal action

LeBron James and Team USA already got a taste of Serbia. In group play, the United States ousted Serbia 110-84, when Phoenix Suns forward Kevin Durant caught fire with 23 points, missing only one shot through his nine field goal attempts.

For the first time since the 2008 Redeem Team, Team USA has won all four of its games by 15 points or more in Paris, according to ESPN Stats & Information.

James will need to score 9 points to pass Carmelo Anthony for second on the Team USA men's Olympic basketball all-time scoring list.

The United States-Brazil volleyball rivalry runs deep, but the U.S. proved to be the better group in its semifinal match. Though the U.S. had a few defensive struggles midway through the match, its offensive strategy and rotations came through when it mattered most.

Playing to five sets, Kathryn Plummer hit a walk-off kill shot to help the Americans advance to the final with a 3-2 (25-23, 18-25, 25-15, 23-25, 15-11) win over Brazil. Team USA will play the winner of Turkey-Italy in the Sunday final.

11:33 a.m. ET -- Discus gold medalist has former NFL ties

There was an NFL connection to the Olympic gold medal winner in the men's discus throw -- even if most barely remember it. Jamaica's Roje Stona set an Olympic record Wednesday with a throw of 70.00 meters to break the previous mark of 69.97 meters set earlier in the competition.

What does that have to do with the National Football League?

Stona, who did not play college football but attended both Clemson and Arkansas for track and field, was invited to two NFL tryouts during rookie minicamps last spring with the Green Bay Packers and New Orleans Saints.

He was listed on the Packers' minicamp roster as a defensive lineman wearing No. 64, but when asked if he remembered Stona, coach Matt LaFleur said Thursday: ""No, not really."" -- Rob Demovsky

9:36 a.m. ET -- Could pickleball become an Olympic sport?

Pickleball is one of the fastest-growing and most popular sports in the U.S., but it isn't in the Olympic Games. However, pickleball could be making its way to the Olympic scene in the future. There are 13.6 million players in the United States, according to the Sports & Fitness Industry Association. The Olympic charter will require one governing body to regulate pickleball worldwide. The sport currently has three potential governing bodies: Seymour Rifkin's World Pickleball Federation, the International Pickleball Foundation, and the Global Pickleball Federation. Here's how we could see pickleball in a future Olympic games. -- READ MORE

8:47 a.m. ET -- Sam Watson does it again

American climber Sam Watson broke the speed climbing world record yet again in Thursday's bronze medal race, lowering it to 4.74 seconds. It was quite the consolation after the 18-year-old made a mistake near the top of the wall in his semifinal heat against China's Wu Peng and lost by .08 seconds, ending his bid for gold.

Indonesia's Veddriq Leonardo won the gold medal race in 4.75, a personal best, over Peng, who registered a personal best 4.77. This is Indonesia's first gold medal of the Paris Games and the first non-badminton Olympic gold in the country's history.

""No regrets,"" Watson said. ""I don't think the pressure really got to me or anything like that. I think just a tiny little stumble at the top, just a few millimeters off a certain hold allowed me to get less power out of it and slow down a lot.""

Watson's world record is one one-hundredth faster than the record of 4.75 he set in qualifications Tuesday, which is .04 faster than the world-record time of 4.798 he set at a World Cup in April.

Before April 2023, no climber had broken the sub-5-second mark in speed climbing. It was the sport's 4-minute mile. Then Leonardo clocked 4.984 in a World Cup semifinal and then a 4.900 in the final, a record that held for a year until Watson broke it twice at a World Cup in Wujiang, China, in April, taking it to 4.798.

Here in Paris, that time has been matched or lowered six times.

In the quarterfinals, three athletes clocked times under 5 seconds, and Watson wasn't even one of them. Leonardo won the gold medal race with a time of 4.75, the world record just two days ago and one one-hundredth slower than the new world record set moments earlier in the bronze medal race.

""I'm really excited for the future,"" Watson said. ""I really do want to get under 4.6 seconds. If you don't know how the sport works, the reaction time off the ground must be at least point one. So, under 4.6 means that you do the route in under 4½ seconds. That really does mean a lot to me. That was my next goal after sub-5 proved to be possible and now decently easy for all these athletes. So just keep going, no limits.""

The duo was selected by a voting process consisting of Team USA athletes, led by the Team USA Athletes' Commission.

Ledecky earned four medals in Paris -- two golds in the women's 1,500 meters and 800-meter freestyle, a silver in the women's 4x200 freestyle relay and bronze in the 400-meter freestyle. Mead earned a gold medal in the men's four rowing.

The American hurdler set a new world record — breaking her own time set at the Olympic Trials — en route to comfortably winning the 400m hurdles at the 2024 Paris Olympics. This is her third gold medal, and it’s the sixth time she’s set a new world record since 2019.

While her time on its own is impressive, it’s the manner in which she has been winning races that really stands out.

McLaughlin-Levrone’s top contender, the Netherland’s Femke Bol, who had won her last 40 races, couldn’t match McLaughlin-Levrone’s pace, taking bronze in 52.15, behind fellow American Anna Cockrell, who won silver in a personal best of 51.87.

McLaughlin-Levrone and Bol had not raced head to head since 2022.

McLaughlin-Levrone returned to the hurdles this year after a knee injury forced her to sit out the 2023 season. She didn’t let this hold her back; at the U.S. Olympic Trials in June, she set a new world record of 50.65, smashing her previous record from 2022. Her time was so fast that it even obliterated the Olympic standard for the 400m event without hurdles.

Cockrell, who was a two-time medallist in the 2019 Pan American Games is making her Olympic debut, and ran a personal best in the final.

Bronze-medallist Bol claimed the world title in Budapest last year. Last week in Switzerland, she ran under 51 seconds for the first time, setting a European record of 50.95. She followed that up with a 51.30, her second-fastest time ever, at the London Diamond League.

On Saturday, the Netherlands took the Olympic crown in the 4×400 mixed relay. Bol, who headed into the final 200m of the race in fourth position, passed three other athletes, edging out Team USA’s Kaylyn Brown by one-hundredth of a second.

Savannah Sutherland of Borden, Sask., took seventh place in 53.88. She had snagged one of two non-automatic qualifying spots in her semi-final with a time of 53.80 seconds to get a spot in Thursday evening’s final.

“It’s overwhelming–the atmosphere out there was insane, and it really pushed some girls to some really fast times. It was unlike anything I’ve ever experienced,” Sutherland told media post-race.

Sutherland, who is in her final year at the University of Michigan, emphasized how grateful she was to have her name in conversation with the best 400m hurdles athletes in history. “It’s a position I never really imagined that I would be in, and I’m just so grateful for that,” she said. “Even in stiff competition, the bounds and limits are always being tested by these amazing athletes, so it’s a really exciting time to be a 400m hurdler. It’s a historic moment for all of us, and I think that we keep pushing each other to be faster and faster.”

Sutherland will run in the heats of the 4x400m relay on Friday morning."

It’s a packed Olympics schedule on Day 13 of the Paris 2024 Games with Team GB keen to add to its medal collection.

Letsile Tebogo stormed to victory in the 200m final to deny Noah Lyles, the 100m champion, a sprint double at the Olympics. Botswana’s Tebogo won a dominant race in 19.46s, with Kenny Bednarek in second and Lyles adding bronze to his 100m gold. Lyles left the track in a wheelchair with the US Track and Field team revealing he ran the race with Covid-19.

Great Britain’s heptathlon star Katarina Johnson-Thompson was also in action and started strongly with season’s bests in the 100m hurdles and high jump this morning. She backed up those performances with a personal best in the shot put and a heat winning run in the 200m to lead the standings overnight.

In cycling, Emma Finucane added to her Paris medal tally following up her gold in the women’s team sprint by clinching bronze in the women’s keirin in the velodrome.

Earlier, Britain’s Ellie Aldridge became the first ever Olympic gold medallist in kitesurfing with a brilliant performance in Marseille, but there was disappointment for a clutch of medal contenders elsewhere.

Diver Jack Laugher missed out in men’s diving 3m springboard final, while sailors Anna Burnet and John Gimson were disqualified from the mixed multi-hull medal race.

Taekwondo star Jade Jones also suffered a shock first-round defeat to end her bid for a historic third gold medal, having entered the Games amid a drugs test controversy earlier this year and Cindy Ngamba, of the Refugee Olympic Team, saw her boxing run come to an end in the bronze medal semi-final where she was defeated by Panama’s Atheyna Bylon.

“It has been a tricky week,” said Aldridge, “As soon as we knew we were competing at Marseille, we knew it was going to be tough, we knew the wind was going to be light, we knew it would be one of the worst places we’ve ever kited.”

This meant that only those who could adapt would survive and Aldridge did exactly that to be crowned Olympic champion in the inaugural women’s kite event.

Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone smashed the 400m hurdles world record again in a stunning defence of her Olympic crown at the Stade de Francein Paris.

The race was billed as showdown between the American and her Dutch rival Femke Bol, the only two women in history to break the 51-second barrier. But McLaughlin-Levrone was far too good, winning gold in 50.37 sec, well clear of the rest.

In doing so she shaved nearly three tenths of a second off the record mark she set at the US trials in June. McLaughlin-Levrone has now delivered the fastest time in history in all of her last six major championship races.

Noah Lyles raced Olympic 200m final after testing positive for Covid

22:30 , Chris Wilson

Noah Lyles, the 100m Olympic champion, finished third in the men’s 200m final as he chased a historic sprint double at the Paris 2024 Games after testing positive for Covid-19.

The American was quick out of the blocks and took the bend well but couldn’t maintain his pace as Botswana’s Letsile Tebogo pulled away over the final 50m to finish in a time of 19.46 sec.

Lyles’ US teammate Kenneth Bednarek made a late surge and claimed silver forcing Lyles into third with a time of 19.70sec, well short of his personal best 19.31.

Immediately after the race, the 27-year-old, was seen sitting in a chair and wheeled off the track as questions over his fitness were touted.

Letsile Tebogo stuns Noah Lyles to win Olympics 200m gold in tribute to late mother: ‘I was carrying her’

22:20 , Chris Wilson

So lightning does not strike twice. Noah Lyles stormed from behind to win gold in the 100m on Sunday night but was given no chance to do so in the 200m final by Botswana’s Letsile Tebogo in a major upset at the Stade de France. Tebogo had time to thump his chest as he crossed the line in a new personal best of 19.46 seconds, ahead of the USA’s Kenny Bednarek and with Lyles in third, a bronze adding to his 100m gold.

For Lyles, the dream of emulating Usain Bolt and winning both 100m and 200m titles at the Olympics did not materialise. It may have been over before the race, with the 27-year-old leaving the track in a wheelchair to alert suspicions that he was suffering from an illness. Within moments, US track and field officials confirmed Lyles had tested positive for Covidbefore the race but ran anyway. He was around half a second down on his personal best.

But even a fit and firing Lyles may have been powerless to stop Tebogo. The 21-year-old won Botswana’s first gold medal at the Olympics and did so while dedicating a dominant victory to his late mother, who passed away in May. After crossing the line, Tebogo removed one of his orange spikes and held it up to the camera, revealing that they were adorned with the date of his mother’s birthday.

‘Life is not a fairytale’: Bradly Sinden abandons quest for Taekwondo medal after knee injury

22:08 , Mike Jones

“Life is not always a fairytale,” said Bradly Sinden – and, at the Grand Palais, he certainly found that out the hard way.

The taekwondo fighter admits he broke down in tears after pulling out of his Olympic bronze medal match due to a knee injury he suffered in his quarter-final bout.

The 68kg fighter, who won Olympic silver in Tokyo three years ago, fears he has torn the medial cruciate ligament in his left knee and was unable to take on China’s Liang Yushuai in the third-place play-off.

Record-breaking Arshad Nadeem finally returns Pakistan to Olympic glory

21:54 , Mike Jones

Arshad Nadeem has watched Pakistan’s sports system crumble around him and still lifted it to unimaginable heights.

Nadeem is his country’s first Olympic champion in 40 years, winning gold in the men’s javelin with an Olympic record.

Pakistan last won an Olympic title in men’s field hockey at LA 1984, dominating that sport before astroturf replaced grass and they fell away.

That is emblematic of the withering of Pakistan’s sporting infrastructure and the Games has shown just how far they have fallen behind - until now.

That’s it.

Cindy Ngamba’s Olympic run comes to an end as a split decision goes in favour of Panama’s Atheyna Bylon. She did more than enough in the third round to clinch the win.

Ngamba, a shining light for the Refugee Olympic Team will take home a bronze medal. It’s the first one ever won by a refugee representative and the achievement it huge.

21:41 , Chris Wilson

Bylon is trying to use her experience her, making Ngamba work and holding where necessary.

Bylon lands a big shot as Ngamba lunges, and she follows it with a big right hand too. Could that pull the tie in her way?

But trouble for Bylon as the referee takes a point for holding!

She tries to claw back the advantage with an uppercut, but she gets another warning for holding...

Ngamba lands a good right hand before a flurry of shots to the head, though she had to stand up to a couple of jabs at the end there.

The bell goes, and this’ll be very close...

The referee gives Bylon a talking to for holding on early in round two. Both are trading blows in a heated exchange, before they separate.

Plenty of holding in this round, with Ngamba landing a solid right hand. Bylon tries to retaliate with that looping hook, but it’s Ngamba in the ascendency here as we enter the final 10 seconds.

The bell goes and it looks like Ngamba edged that one – it looks to have gone to her, though not unanimously.

The bell goes and we’re underway in round one.

Some early success with the combinations, working it on the inside, with a few early jabs making contact with the head.

Both trade blows with Bylon landing an uppercut to the body, though she’s not connecting with a few too.

Ngamba slips but it’s not a knockdown - she’s soon back up as Bylon comes again, landing a couple of shots including some looped efforts just before the bell goes.

The scorecards are unanimously in favour of Bylon for that round.

A good start from both and Bol leads down the back straight.

They don’t stay level for long though, as McLaughlin-Levrone picks up the pace around the bend and by the time everyone’s out of the bend, McLaughlin-Levrone has enough of a lead that she looks like she might already have won!

She extends her lead and down the final 50m it’s just a battle with herself for a new world record. There’s plenty of distance as she crosses the line...in a new world record time of 50.37 seconds!

Bol comes in third in the end, with Anna Cockrell of the USA taking silver.

Regarding the 200m she says it was “really frustrating” as she “wanted as close to 23s as possible, but you know what, I’ll take it”.

Britain’s Ellie Aldridge became the first ever Olympic gold medallist in kitesurfing with a brilliant performance in Marseille.

The discipline, which sees competitors fly above the water at up to 40 knots powered by huge kites, is making its Games debut

And 27-year-old Aldridge, from Dorset, powered her way to gold by winning two races in the final series on Thursday.

A point apiece early in the deciding round, before Zaid Kareem takes an inadvertent push to the chin, prompting a pause. The officials are happy that it’s not penalisable, and Kareem strikes a blow.

Or does he? Bradly Sinden and his team want a look at the footage and challenge the referee’s decision. Unsuccessful. And Kareem extends his advantage inside the final ten seconds.

Scores again! The Jordanian raises his arms aloft triumphantly, bringing them down only to shake Bradly Sinden’s hand. Superb striking from Zaid Kareem, securing an upset victory over the world champion!

Ellie Aldridge has done it!

A second race win in this women’s kite final and she secures the gold medal ahead of France’s Lauriane Nolot. She won a silver medal in the world championships but she’s now become the Olympic champion!

It was a wonderful move at the first mark which saw her sweep into the lead as her opponents get tangled up behind her. That’s the three wins she needs.

It’s a first Olympic gold in the kite for Team GB.

Over at the Marseille Marina the women’s kite sailing final is underway and it’s a perfect start for Great Britain’s Ellie Aldridge who triumphed in race one.

She edged out her main rival for the gold medal and current world champion France’s Lauriane Nolot.

The first to three wins takes the gold with Great Britain and France on two apiece. One more win for either will see them clinch the top prize.

Olympics 2024: Diving - Jack Laugher and Jordan Houlden miss out on 3m springboard medal

15:29 , Harry Latham-Coyle

Jordan Houlden finishes in fifth, a strong result in his first Olympic final and an experience from which he will learn a great deal. “It is a great achievement to finish fifth, and be in the final,” he tells the BBC. “That was my main aim and I did it. I came in here with guns blazing, but I got a bit nervous and fidgety. I think I did alright with the nerves.

“I know I can do a lot better in there. There were some dives that could have been a bit sharper, but fifth at the Olympics is not too bad.”

And here’s Jack Laugher: “I’m sad. I think I just let today get the better of me. Today, I had excellent training and I got a little bit too far ahead of myself. The crowd noise was phenomenal today. I’m really proud of this Olympics - with four Olympic medals, it’s hard to be sad, but right now I’m devastated.

“Obviousy every time I dive I try to stick to my own routine, but today I let emotion get the better of me. It wasn’t pressure, it wasn’t nerves, I just had so much adrenaline coursing through me. On that third dive, I just went over. I’m glad there are no underwater microphones because I said some horrible things.

“I’ve got to pass the baton on at some point. I’m getting towards 30 and [Osmar Olvera] is just 20 years old, he’s a fantastic athlete. I’m honoured to be among such incredible athletes. Obviously the dream was to get two medals, and after training I thought I could do something extremely special today. But it wasn’t to be, and I’ll try and learn from it and move forward.”

It's a 5⃣th on Olympic debut for Jordan Houlden in the men's 3M Springboard

The Tokyo Olympic champion has reclaimed her spot atop the world of hurdles after sitting out the 2023 World Athletics Championships.

After the race ended, she was hugged by her friends and family and a tiara was placed on her head as queen of the track for the night.

Anna Cockrell of the United States took home silver in the event and the Netherlands' Femke Bol won bronze.

She was out in front of everyone in the 400m hurdles - beating her old record by three-tenths

With this win, McLauglin-Levrone has now set the last six world records in the event dating back to the first one she set at US Olympic Trials in 2021 before the Tokyo Games.

She then broke that record by nearly half a second at that year's Olympics - upgrading the record from 51.9 to 51.46.

In the summer of 2022, McLaughlin-Levrone would break the record twice on the same track - Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon.

It was at that same track that this past June, she'd break the world record again with a run of 50.65.

Now, she's shattered her own record once again in Paris with a 50.37 that was exactly 1.5 seconds faster than second place.

As for Cockrell, she won her first Olympic medal in this event after being disqualified in Tokyo for her seventh place finish due to a lane violation.

It’s a packed Olympics schedule on Day 13 of the Paris 2024 Games with Team GB keen to add to its medal collection.

Letsile Tebogo stormed to victory in the 200m final to deny Noah Lyles, the 100m champion, a sprint double at the Olympics. Botswana’s Tebogo won a dominant race in 19.46s, with Kenny Bednarek in second and Lyles adding bronze to his 100m gold. Lyles left the track in a wheelchair with the US Track and Field team revealing he ran the race with Covid-19.

Great Britain’s heptathlon star Katarina Johnson-Thompson was also in action and started strongly with season’s bests in the 100m hurdles and high jump this morning. She backed up those performances with a personal best in the shot put and a heat winning run in the 200m to lead the standings overnight.

In cycling, Emma Finucane added to her Paris medal tally following up her gold in the women’s team sprint by clinching bronze in the women’s keirin in the velodrome.

Earlier, Britain’s Ellie Aldridge became the first ever Olympic gold medallist in kitesurfing with a brilliant performance in Marseille, but there was disappointment for a clutch of medal contenders elsewhere.

Diver Jack Laugher missed out in men’s diving 3m springboard final, while sailors Anna Burnet and John Gimson were disqualified from the mixed multi-hull medal race.

Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone breaks 400m hurdles world record to win gold.,https://www.cnn.com/sport/live-news/paris-olympics-news-2024-08-08/index.html,"The Unites States tug-of-war team in action during the 1908 London Olympics at White City Stadium. Topical Press Agency/Getty Images

By now, you’ve probably heard that breaking is one of the newest competitive Olympic events at the 2024 Paris Olympics. That’s sparked a lot of debate about what activities should be classified as an Olympic sport.

Here’s a look at some of the stranger Olympic sports in modern history:

Tug of war: For 20 years, tug of war was a fiercely contested Olympic event. It was last featured in the 1920 Antwerp Games, with the UK team — made up of City of London police — claiming gold.

Live pigeon shooting: Shooting targets at the Olympics have historically been inanimate objects, but organizers of the 1900 Paris Games decided to go in another direction. Competitors lined up to shoot as many live pigeons as they could, with around 300 reportedly killed in the event.

Pistol dueling: Organizers came up with pistol dueling – in which two competitors shot at each other – for the 1908 Games in London. Luckily for all involved, the duels weren’t deadly. Competitors were dressed in protective clothing, and the pistols were loaded with wax rounds.

Obstacle course swimming: This particular competition from the 1900 Paris Games might not look out of place at a modern water park. The event, in which swimmers traveled 200 meters down the River Seine while making their way through a series of obstacles, only made one appearance at the Olympics.

Motorboat racing: The Olympics has long banned sporting events that depend on mechanical propulsion, which is why you don’t see auto racing at the Games.

But in 1908, motorboat racing was an Olympic heat. Boaters raced a course at the Games that year, and the heavy seas “made racing an enterprise of some considerable risk and robbed it of all its enjoyment, except to the most confirmed enthusiasts,” according to a Games report.

Art: From 1912 to 1948, Olympic medals were awarded not just for sport, but also for artistic endeavors such as literature, architecture, music, sculpture and painting.

Solo synchronized swimming: In what might sound like an oxymoron, solo synchronized swimming was a competitive heat at three consecutive Games.

Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone breaks 400m hurdles world record to win gold.,https://sportstar.thehindu.com/olympics/paris-2024/news/paris-olympics-sydney-mclaughlin-levrone-world-record-womens-400m-hurdles/article68503205.ece,"From the moment she qualified for her first Olympic Games as a 16-year-old high school student, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone has never paid much attention to conventional wisdom.

The 25-year-old added another entry into her catalogue of broken barriers on Thursday as she stormed to gold in the 400m hurdles with a world record-breaking display to become the first woman ever to win back-to-back Olympic titles in the event.

The American track darling blew away reigning world champion Femke Bol of the Netherlands to take gold in 50.37sec at the Stade de France, bettering her own world record of 50.65sec set in Eugene in June.

It was just the latest milestone in a dazzling career that has seen McLaughlin-Levrone redefine notions of what was previously thought possible in her event.

In the space of three years, McLaughlin-Levrone has smashed the world 400m hurdles record no fewer than six times, including Thursday’s latest jaw-dropping display.

She became the first woman in history to run under 52 seconds for the event in 2021 when she clocked 51.90sec at the US Olympic trials in Eugene, Oregon.

She followed that by shaving a massive 0.44sec off her record when she powered to her first Olympic gold at the Tokyo Games in 51.46sec.

Not content with breaking the 52-second barrier, McLaughlin-Levrone then created more history by ducking under 51 seconds in Eugene in 2022 with a time of 50.68sec -- a record she lowered again at this year’s US trials.

Thursday’s Olympic title also extends a remarkable five-year winning streak.

Her last defeat over the 400m hurdles came in the final of the 2019 World Championships in Doha, where she was pipped for victory by her compatriot Dalilah Muhammad.

While she has some way to go before matching Edwin Moses’ nine-year, nine-month unbeaten run between 1977 and 1987, there is little argument McLaughlin-Levrone can now comfortably lay claim to being the greatest women’s 400m hurdler in history.

Teenage breakthrough

Born in New Jersey in 1999, track and field was embedded in McLaughlin-Levrone’s DNA.

Her father, Willie McLaughlin, reached the semi-finals in the 400m at the US trials for the 1984 Olympics, while her mother Mary was a respectable half-miler.

As a young girl, McLaughlin-Levrone watched the 2008 Beijing Olympics, and her idol Allyson Felix, and determined that she would one day perform on the same stage.

After qualifying for her first Olympics as a teenager in 2016, McLaughlin-Levrone’s progression continued steadily before her breakthrough Olympic crown in 2021, her improvements coming rapidly after linking up with new coach Bobby Kersee in 2020.

In Tokyo, she added another gold medal after forming part of the relay 4x400m relay squad, where she raced in a quartet alongside Felix.

“Since I was eight years old, that’s something I had aspired to do, and for it to finally come to fruition felt like a weight off my shoulders,” McLaughlin-Levrone said of her 2021 gold.

Thursday’s stunning victory in Paris raises the prospect of McLaughlin-Levrone targeting a third straight Olympic gold in four years time in Los Angeles, where she lives and trains.

While 2028 remains a long way distant, McLaughlin-Levrone says she sees herself running well beyond this summer.

“It does get harder as the years go by,” she said in a recent interview.

“You’re pushing your body to its limits. It’s a part of sports that can be physically draining, mentally draining, and that’s why taking breaks and remembering why you love it is so important.

“Track is not going to last forever, so I’m trying to continue to enjoy it. I don’t want to take anything for granted.”"

What a day of action, with a big track world record from Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone to cap things!

Don't forget to read all the recaps and reaction from today on Olympics.com.

We've now completed 13 days of the Olympic Games and three days remain. Here's what you can expect on Day 14, 9 August, with a bumper 35 gold medals on offer.

They include the 4x100m relay finals in athletics, while Karsten Warholm will look to defend his men's 400m hurdles title (9:45pm) against a strong chasing pack including Alison dos Santos and Rai Benjamin, with potentially the world record on the line.

Elsewhere, women's beach volleyball holds its medal matches (9pm, 10:30pm) in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower at the Eiffel Tower Stadium, sure to leave a lasting impression on both players and fans. And the men's football competition concludes (6pm) at the Parc des Princes, home to Paris Saint-Germain, with hosts France in action against neighbours Spain.

Breaking - First Olympic medallists to be decided

For the first time, there will be Olympic medals awarded in the sport of breaking. The B-Girls competition will take place on 9 August, with the qualified athletes battling it out at the La Concorde Urban Park from 4pm.

Japan's B-Girl Ayumi will be looking to become the Olympic champion at age 41 – more than double the age of some of her opponents. And she has a good chance, too, after finishing first and second at the two Olympic Qualifier Series events.

Indeed, a Japanese one-two may be on the cards: B-Girl Ami finished second and first in those same qualifiers.

Table tennis - Ma Long ready to bow out

There's a changing of the guard in table tennis. The two-time defending singles champion Ma Long hasn't been selected for the singles event this time, and as the legend – and arguably the sport's greatest of all time – prepares to wind down his career, this could be his last Olympic Games final.

The men's team gold medal match (3pm) features the People's Republic of China, which has dominated Olympic table tennis, against Sweden. And Ma remains the figurehead of the team, even as he has been overtaken in the world (and domestic) ranks by Wang Chuqin and Fan Zhendong, his teammates.

With Ma already announcing that the 2024 World Championships would be his last, will this be his final Olympic appearance too?

The 25-year-old American has now lowered the world record six times. She was in the lead around the corner and breezed down the home stretch to beat teammate Anna Cockrell by 1.50 seconds.

“Obviously, there are people next to you and they’re going to push you but it doesn’t matter if you don’t focus on the barriers in front of you,” McLaughlin-Levrone explained.

“That was my focus, trying to be as efficient as I could over my 10 hurdles and trying to lower that time every time.”

McLaughlin-Levrone had set the old record, 50.65 seconds, on June 30 at the US Olympic trials.

This was billed as one of the must-see races at the Stade de France, given the rivalry between McLaughlin-Levrone and Femke Bol of the Netherlands. Cockrell crashed the party, with Bol finishing third. She walked down the track, shaking her head.

“I screwed it up,” Bol said. “I’m not sure where I made the mistake. I just got so much lactic acid with 300 metres to go. I’m not sure why, I really have no explanation. This is just a bad race.""

Once she crossed the finish line, McLaughlin-Levrone looked up at the scoreboard and gave a quick smile. She makes breaking records look almost like a stroll in the park.

And while she knows there are things she can clean up, it was inching closer to a perfect race — and to breaking into 49-second territory.

“It’s just building up that capacity in your legs to handle going that fast,” said McLaughlin-Levrone, who married Andre Levrone Jr, a former NFL football player, in 2022.

McLaughlin-Levrone moved to 3-0 in races against Bol. She beat Bol, the standout from the Netherlands, at the Tokyo Games in 2021 (Bol finished third) and again a year later at world championships in Oregon. McLaughlin-Levrone was hurt last season and didn’t race when the world championships were in Budapest. It opened the the door for Bol to win her first world crown.

After this race, McLaughlin-Levrone gave Bol a consoling hug and some encouraging words.

“I was like, ‘You are amazing',” she said. “She just started the hurdles not too long ago, so I think she’s doing great.”

Cockrell, too, who lowered her personal-best time by 0.77 seconds.

“I've always called myself a showtime girl,” Cockrell said. “When the lights come on, I come out to play.”

Coached by Bobby Kersee, McLaughlin-Levrone has been steadily building toward this moment for two years. Mostly out of the spotlight, too. She’s been racing in sprints at 200 and 400m and also in the short hurdles — 100m, and 60m indoors — to gain experience, speed and technique.

It all paid off with another record-breaking performance in front of a packed house.

“I knew this was possible,” said McLaughlin-Levrone, who celebrated her birthday this week. “I knew it was probably going to take a world record to win this race.”

Afterward, she paraded around the track wearing a tiara her sister-in-law brought for her to wear.

“I just was hoping it would be a race worthy of holding (the tiara) up,” McLaughlin-Levrone cracked.

She burst on the scene as a teenager, the runner with the unique ability to juggle while riding a unicycle. She competed in the 2016 Olympics at age 17.

The sprinter from New Jersey who went to the University of Kentucky and now lives in Los Angeles also has a gold medal from Tokyo as part of the women's 4x400 relay.

After crossing the line third for the second straight Olympics, Lyles fell to his back and writhed on the ground trying to catch his breath. He got to one knee and stayed there for nearly 30 seconds before getting up, asking for water and getting to the wheelchair.

""It definitely affected my performance,"" he said.""But I mean, to be honest, I'm more proud of myself than anything for coming out and getting the bronze medal with COVID.""

He also won the bronze in the Tokyo Olympics, and he has said the empty stands and the year-long delay before the Games led to depression that hampered his performance and inspired his road to Paris.

Lyles said he tested positive early Tuesday morning and quickly got into quarantine, though the U.S. track federation (USATF) said he tested positive on Monday.

""I still wanted to run,"" he said. ""They said it was possible.""

The USATF released a statement saying it and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee adhered to all Olympic and Centers for Disease Control guidelines.

""After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight,"" the statement said. ""We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.""

The men's 4x100 relay is set for Friday, and Lyles was expected to run the anchor leg in what many thought would be a quest for a third gold medal in Paris. He said that decision had not been made as of late Thursday.

""I want to be very honest and transparent, and I'm going to let them make the decision,"" Lyles said, describing himself as being at around 90 or 95 per cent.

WATCH | Botswana's Tebogo upsets American stars to win 200m gold:

Botswana's Letsile Tebogo spoils the American party by winning Olympic 200m gold Duration 6:58 Letsile Tebogo won Botswana's first-ever Olympic gold medal, by winning the men's 200-metre race ahead of Americans Kenny Bednarek, Noah Lyles and Erriyon Knighton.

In the 200, Tebogo, 21, led wire-to-wire and won in 19.46 seconds, the fourth-fastest time in history, but .15 slower than Lyles' top time. Kenny Bednarek finished in 19.62 for his second straight silver, and Lyles, four nights after winning a close-as-can-be 100, ran the curve in 19.70.

""It was really a beautiful race for me,"" Tebogo said after his victory.

""When we made it to the final, my coach just told me, now my job is done, it's up to you to see what you can do. Whether it's a medal or not, just finish the race healthy. That's all I could've wished for. I'm happy I finished the race healthier than before.""

The first sign something might be wrong came a night earlier when Lyles finished second in a lackluster semifinal, then left the track without talking to reporters to head to the medical tent. His coach said he was fine.

It became clear he was not when Tebogo and Bednarek reached the curve in the final.

Lyles was trailing as they headed into the homestretch, which is usually where he puts on a trademark closing finish that has always been the best part of this race. This time — nothing. Only a desperate push to the line then a collapse onto the purple track.

""To be honest, I knew if I wanted to come out here and win, I had to give everything I had from the get-go. I didn't have any time to save energy. So that was kind of the strategy for today.""

Lyles was crowned the ""Fastest Man Alive"" by edging out Jamaica's Kishane Thompson by five-thousandths of a second in the the 100m champion on Sunday.

McLaughlin-Levrone breaks own world record in 400m hurdles

An hour after that shock, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone lowered her world record for the sixth time, finishing the 400m hurdles in 50.37 seconds for another Olympic blowout.

The hurdler expected to challenge her hardest, Femke Bol, finished third, behind American Anna Cockrell, who finished 1.5 seconds behind McLaughlin-Levrone.

This is McLaughlin-Levrone's second straight gold and also the second straight Olympics the virus has played a major role in Lyles' trip to the Games.

Canada's Savannah Sutherland finished seventh.

The 25-year-old blew away reigning world champion Femke Bol of the Netherlands to take gold in 50.37sec at the Stade de France.

Anna Cockrell of the United States took silver in 51.87sec while Bol finished third to claim bronze in 52.15sec.

The winning time bettered McLaughlin-Levrone’s own world record of 50.65sec set at the US Olympic trials in Eugene in June.

The victory extended McLaughlin-Levrone’s remarkable five-year unbeaten streak in the discipline and cemented her status as the greatest women’s 400m hurdler of all time.

An elated McLaughlin-Levrone said afterwards she had simply focused on the 10 hurdles in front of her — and revealed she was now targeting breaking the 50-second barrier.

“Every race is you against 10 hurdles,” she told reporters. “Obviously there’s people next to you that are going to push you, but it doesn’t matter if you don’t focus on the barriers in front of you.

“So that was my focus – me trying to be as efficient as I could over those 10 hurdles and me trying to lower that time every time.

“There was a lot of anticipation leading up to this race specifically, rightfully so…But you channel those nerves into excitement.”

Asked if she had run the perfect race, McLaughlin-Levrone replied: “There’s always things you can improve.

“There’s no such thing as a perfect race but the closer and closer we can get to 49 (seconds) — I feel like we’re inching there. It’s just building up the capacity in your legs to get you there.”

Bol had been desperate to claim a first victory over McLaughlin-Levrone after taking a bronze in the Tokyo Olympics three years ago and a silver behind the American at the World Championships in Eugene, Oregon in 2022.

But McLaughlin-Levrone — who missed last year’s Budapest World Championships won by Bol due to injury — was not going to be denied.

Drawn in lane five with Bol outside her, McLaughlin-Levrone quickly began making inroads on the Dutchwoman who blazed out of the blocks.

Just after the 200m mark the American star made her move, accelerating past Bol to head into the final straight with a clear lead.

With Bol tiring and Cockrell steaming past her, McLaughlin-Levrone was in a race against the clock and she duly dug deep over the final metres to smash her own world record.

McLaughlin-Levrone basked in the adulation from the crowd after another jaw-dropping performance, and she was soon wrapped in a US flag and wearing a glittering tiara as she saluted her fans.

Bol meanwhile looked distraught as she crossed the finish line, and could be seen slapping herself in apparent frustration.

Later the Dutchwoman said she had “screwed it up”.

“All you want to do in an Olympic final is to put up your best race,” Bol said.

“I screwed it up. I’m not sure where I made the mistake. I just got so much lactic acid with 300m to go. I’m not sure why, I really have no explanation.

“This is just a bad race. I’ll look at the positives, I’ll talk to my coach, I’ll try to enjoy the bronze.”

McLaughlin-Levrone however had words of consolation for Bol following the loss.

“I have so much respect for sure,” McLaughlin-Levrone said. “There’s nothing but respect there. We’re just trying to be the best we can be. She’s great, she’s continuing to get better and she pushes me to be my best.”

Some quotes from Lyles on his Covid diagnosis from Ian O’Riordan:

On his health:

“I do have Covid. I tested positive around 5am on Tuesday morning. I woke up in the middle of the night feeling real chills, aching, sore throat, and those were a lot of the symptoms I’ve had right before getting Covid.

“We tested it, came back positive and we quickly quarantined in a hotel nearby the (Olympic) Village. Tried to get me on as much medication as we legally could to make sure my body could keep the momentum going. I still wanted to run, it was still possible, we just stayed away from everybody. I knew that if I wanted to come out here and win, I had to give everything I have from the get-go. I didn’t have any time to save energy. That was the strategy.”

On how he feels:

“I’ve had better days, but I’m walking around again. I was quite light-headed after that race. Shortness of breath, chest pain, but after a while I could catch my breath and get my wits about me. I’m a lot better now.”

On whether Covid-19 affected his performance:

“It definitely affected my performance. I’ve had to take a lot of breaks… I was coughing through the night. I’m more proud of myself than anything, coming out here to get a bronze with Covid.”

On who knew he had Covid-19:

“We were trying to keep this close to the chest. The people who knew were the medical staff, coach, my mum. We didn’t want everybody going into a panic, we wanted them to be able to compete. We wanted to make this as free as possible. I’m competitive. Why would you give them an edge over you?”

On whether not competing in the 200m final was a consideration:

“I was going to compete. If I didn’t make it to the final, that would’ve been the sign not to compete.”

Katarina Johnson-Thompson had the best time in the 200m. O’Connor is 19th overall after the 200m.

So a twist in the story of the 200m final. Noah Lyles had Covid but still ran:

A comfortable win by the Botswana sprinter, accelerated through and couldn’t be beaten. Bednarek from the US was second in 19.62 and Lyles third in 19.7. Lyles was .4 off his personal best.

It is Botswana’s first ever gold medal! Great stuff.

David Gorman taking over the blog. In golf:

Leona Maguire endured another difficult day at Le Golf National in the Olympics golf competition which left her 21 shots off the lead of Switzerland’s Morgane Metraux and with nothing to play for over the final two days but pride.

Maguire’s 79 added up to 13-over-par 157 over two rounds and tied 57th of 60 players, Meadow marginally better at eight over after a 74 on day two, but also well off the pace and tied 52nd.

Maguire had hopes of medal contention having won on the Ladies European Tour in London last month. But her mixed year continued having missed the cut at three of the four Majors. The Cavan woman has been left scrambling for any resemblance of form ahead of the final Major of the year, the Women’s Open at St Andrews in two weeks’ time.

Maguire’s tournament has been a case of disastrous holes after two double bogeys or worse in round one, she double bogeyed the 12th hole in her second round and finished with a quadruple-bogey nine on the treacherous 18th hole where she hit into the water three times.

We’ve hit that midday lull, so we’ll take a look at some of the main events coming up at Stade de France this evening.

The semi-finals of the women’s 1500m will be run from 6.35pm. That’s the event Ireland’s Ciara Mageean unfortunately had to pull out of on Monday due to injury. The first semi-final will include Kenya’s Faith Kipyegon, who had her silver medal from Monday’s 5000m final reinstated after she was disqualified for a brush with another runner during the race. Just FYI, Kipyegon is the world and Olympic record-holder in the event and is the reigning champ from Tokyo.

There are also a number of medal events on the agenda, including the women’s long jump (7pm) and men’s javelin throw (7.25pm) finals.

Back on the running track, Team USA’s Noah Lyles will be looking to pick up a historic sprinting double when he competes in the men’s 200m at 7.30pm. Lyles took victory in the 100m final on Sunday after a photo finish, denying Jamaica’s Kishane Thompson the gold by just five thousandths of a second.

At 8.25pm, the middle lanes of the women’s 400m hurdles final will likely see the battle for gold play out between the Netherland’s Femke Bol and USA’s Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, followed by the men’s 110m hurdles final at 8.45pm.

There’s no Irish involvement in any of the evening’s finals, but don’t forget Kate O’Connor still has two event’s left in day one of the heptathlon. She’s in the shot put at 6.35pm and the 200m at 7.55pm.

“I am of course thrilled to have a connection to our Irish Olympic heroes because I went to school with Rhasidat Adeleke,” Emer McLysaght writes in today’s column.

“Well, we went to the same primary school. Two decades apart. Look, maybe she once sat in the same classroom as my six-year-old ghost. Let me have that at least.”

“It was at St Mark’s Primary School in Springfield, Tallaght, that Adeleke’s talent was first spotted by a teacher. Many Olympians start on their path to greatness at an early age.

“Simone Biles started taking gymnastics at six years old. US Olympic gold medallist Katie Ledecky was also six when she started swimming. It’s probably too late for any of us to get into training for the Los Angeles Games in 2028. Or is it?”

It has been another nightmare day for Leona Maguire at Le Golf National, a quadruple bogey 9 on the final hole rounding off a difficult round of 79 to go with her 78 in round one. She is 59th of 60 golfers and is left only playing for pride.

She warned us, we just didn’t want to believe her. Kellie Harrington has confirmed her retirement.

Marie O’Halloran writes: Olympic boxing champion Kellie Harrington confirmed she is hanging up her boxing gloves after her second gold medal in the women’s lightweight division.

The double gold winner, who after her victory on Tuesday night in the Roland Garros stadium in Paris said she was “98 per cent” sure she was retiring, confirmed the decision on Thursday.

She is also hoping to support other Irish athletes including Rhasidat Adeleke in the 400m sprint final and Daniel Wiffen in the 10,000m open water swim, and “decompress” before “heading home to the madness” of victory celebrations.

Team Ireland may be far from finished in Paris, put preparations are already well under way to give our athletes a warm welcome home.

A free homecoming event will be held on Monday, August 12th outside the GPO on O’Connell Street in Dublin city centre, starting at 12.30pm.

And if you’re in the city on Saturday or Sunday evening, swing by the Samuel Beckett Bridge to see a special message to mark Ireland’s success over the last fortnight.

At Le Golf National, it’s already proving to be a better day for Ireland’s golfers.

Both Leona Maguire and Stephanie Meadow are currently level par. Maguire’s thru 11 holes while Meadow is on the 10th.

They’re both looking to claw their way back from the 78s they shot during Wednesday’s opening round.

Quick update on the heptathlon, Ireland’s Kate O’Connor is now 19th overall after the opening two events with 1,908 points.

Great Britain’s Katarina Johnson-Thompson leads on 2,197 points.

Good news for tomorrow, the men’s marathon swim event is due to go ahead in the Seine and Ireland’s Daniel Wiffen is set to take part.

Johnny Watterson has this update from Paris:

Daniel Wiffen, who has already won swimming medals for Ireland with a gold in the 800m freestyle event and a bronze in the 1500m freestyle will compete in the men’s Marathon race, a 10km event taking place in the River Seine on Friday.

It will be Wiffen’s first time taking part in an Olympic marathon swim making him the first Irish Olympian to have participated in the event.

A unique course has been designed in the heart of the capital on the stretch of river by the Pont Alexandre III bridge, where 33 athletes will compete for only the fifth gold medal. The event first became part of the Olympic roster at the 2008 Games in Beijing.

Heptathlon: After three attempts at 1.80, Ireland’s Kate O’Connor finishes up in the high jump. She did however bag a season best of 1.77 along the way.

No other athlete in group A managed to make the height either, so she sits top of the group for the event, giving her another 941 points.

In Group B, Belgium’s Nafissatou Thiam and GB’s Katarina Johnson-Thompson both cleared 1.92, each earning 1,132 points for their effort.

There are two types of people in this world – those who love to strike up a conversation with people on a plane, and those who avoid it at all costs.

Luckily for two of Ireland’s Olympic gold medallists, Kieran Duggan is the former.

“It is not everyone can say they went to the Olympics and brought home two gold medallists, but that’s exactly what Kieran Duggan found himself doing this week when he gave champion rowers Paul O’Donovan and Fintan McCarthy a lift home to Co Cork,” Barry Roche writes.

“Limerick native Kieran had watched on television on Friday as the pair won the men’s lightweight double sculls. Two days later he flew to Paris with friends to see the equestrian events at Versailles, and he was flying back on Tuesday when he found himself seated near McCarthy on the plane.

Heptathlon: The high jump is ongoing and Kate O’Connor is competing in group A.

She’s cleared 1.71, currently putting her joint first in this event.

As we’ve mentioned, Kate O’Connor has become Ireland first ever heptathlete, so how about we go over what the heptathlon entails.

The heptathlon involves seven events. For women they’re the 100m hurdles, high jump, shot put, 200m, long jump, javelin throw and 800m. The first four take place on day one, followed by the remaining three the next day.

The heptathlon follows a points system, with athletes awarded points based on how they fare in each event. The scoring system was dreamt up by a mathematician so I might spare you the explanation. In simple terms it’s: Do well, get more points. The athlete with the most points after the seven events wins gold.

And even if you think you know nothing of the heptathlon, you’ve very likely heard of Team GB’s Jessica Ennis. She won gold in London 2012 and is considered one of the greats.

Earlier, O’Connor came seventh in heat one of the 100m hurdles, posting a time of 14.08, earning her 967 points. For comparison, Switzerland’s Annik Kaelin clocked the fastest time across the three heats (12.87) to take 1,144 points.

Good morning everyone! Muireann Duffy here, I’ll be keeping you up to date on all the antics from day 13 at the Olympic Games in Paris.

It’s a quiet day for Team Ireland, just three of our athletes are competing today.

At Le Golf National, Leona Maguire will get her second round in the women’s stroke play event under way shortly before 9.30am, followed by Stephanie Meadow who tees off just before 10am.

And in athletics, Ireland now has our first Olympic heptathlete after Kate O’Connor started her campaign earlier this morning. She placed seventh in heat one of the 100m hurdles, the first of four events taking place in the heptathlon today.

And for anyone who missed yesterday’s big result, Rhasidat Adeleke booked a spot in the women’s 400m final on Friday, placing second in her semi-final behind Bahrain’s Salwa Eid Naser.

“Coming into the homestretch, right where the stagger unwinds, Rhasidat Adekele had an Olympic 400 metres final at her beckoning, only some signs of concern were already there,” Ian O’Riordan writes from Stade de France in Paris.

“Salwa Eid Naser from Bahrain had got a clear run on her, and suddenly Adeleke was struggling, losing her form and it seemed some hope too, before holding on second place. Plenty good for now.

“Still her time of 49.95 seconds appeared laboured, and something clearly was off. The Olympics do take a different sort of physical toll, and this race had taken more out of her than she would have liked.”"

PARIS (AP) — The latest updates from track and field events at Stade de France on Thursday at the Paris Olympics.

U.S. sprinter Noah Lyles missed out on the double in the 200-meter final. Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone of the United States went head-to-head with Femke Bol of the Netherlands in the 400-meter hurdles final.

McLaughlin-Levrone is the world record holder and reigning Olympic champion. She beat Bol at the Tokyo Olympics, then again at 2022 world championships. Bol, the reigning world champion, ran an inspired anchor leg for the Dutch to win gold in the 4x400-meter mixed relay on Saturday.

Lyles had chills, aches, sore throat from COVID

American sprinter Noah Lyles says COVID-19 left him at less than his best for the 200-meter final that ended with bronze instead of gold.

Lyles says he was diagnosed with COVID on Tuesday morning. He dealt with chills, aches and a sore throat. He says he was feeling better by the time he ran onto the track at Stade de France. Lyles estimates he was about 90-95 percent by the time the starting gun went off.

Lyles says he never thought of not competing, adding he hasn’t made up his mind on whether to race for the U.S. in the men’s 4x100 final scheduled for Friday.

The American hurdler cruised to victory in the men’s 110-meter final. The three-time world champion and silver medalist in Tokyo three years ago exploded out of the blocks to win going away.

Holloway finished at 12.99 seconds, well clear of teammate Daniel Roberts in second at 13.09. Roberts out-leaned Rasheed Broadbell of Jamaica, who finished with bronze.

Gold for McLaughlin-Levrone, who breaks her own world record

American sprinter Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone broke her own world record in winning the women’s 400-meter hurdle final.

McLaughlin-Levrone ran away from the rest of the field, posting a time of 50.37, easily breaking the Olympic mark of 51.46 she set in Tokyo three years ago and just ahead of the 50.65 she put up at the U.S. Olympic trials earlier this year.

Anna Cockrell of the U.S. was second at 51.87, with Femke Bol of the Netherlands in third at 52.15.

Both were well behind McLaughlin-Levrone, who was around 10 meters in front of everyone else when she hit the tape.

Lyles had been diagnosed with COVID, AP source says

American sprinting star Noah Lyles is dealing with COVID-19.

The men’s 100-meter champion was diagnosed with COVID two days before the 200-meter final, a source close to the situation told the AP.

Lyles seemed to be his typical amped-up self during introductions. He couldn’t quite keep pace with gold medalist Letsile Tebogo or American teammate Kenny Bednarek, who grabbed silver.

Lyles held on for bronze then fell to the track afterward.

No double for Noah Lyles, settles for bronze in 200

There will be no golden double for American sprinter Noah Lyles.

The 100-meter champion could only salvage bronze in the men’s 200-meter final.

Letsile Tebogo of Botswana earned the gold with a time of 19.46. Tebogo was in control the whole way, beating silver medalist Kenneth Bednarek by a stride.

Lyles, who raced out onto the track trying to amp up the crowd, held on for third. He fell to the track in the immediate aftermath and was tended to by trainers before getting up and walking over to a nearby bench.

Lyles had edged out Jamaica’s Kishane Thompson by five-thousandths of a second in the 100. He was a heavy favorite in the 200 — his better race — though he trailed Tebogo in Wednesday’s qualifying heat.

Mihambo’s challenge: Winning consecutive golds in long jump

Defending Olympic long jump champion Malaika Mihambo of Germany has history working against her as she looks to defend her title in the women’s final.

No woman has won consecutive golds in the event since it was introduced at the 1948 London Games.

German great Heike Drechsler is the only two-time Olympic champion. She reached the top of the podium in 1992 in Barcelona and again in Sydney eight years later. Drechsler began her Olympic career with a silver in 1988 while competing for East Germany.

The long jump final is part of a busy night at Stade de France that will include the men’s 200-meter and women’s 400-meter hurdles final.

Sha’Carri Richardson to the rescue

Sha’Carri Richardson bailed out the U.S. women out from a near collapse earlier Thursday in the Olympic 4x100 relay, overcoming a German runner in the anchor leg to help the Americans win their heat and move to the gold-medal race.

The U.S. men, who haven’t won a medal in this event since 2004, advanced easily despite a small hiccup. In the strangest twist of all, it was Jamaica’s men who struggled with the baton and will be sitting on the sideline for Friday’s final.

In the women’s race, Richardson was about three steps behind after receiving the baton from Gabby Thomas, who earlier nearly misconnected on her exchange with Twanisha Terry.

That put Richardson in a hole against Rebekka Haase, but the 100-meter silver medal winner was looking back at Haase by the finish. The U.S. won in 41.94 seconds, .19 ahead of the Germans.

Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone breaks 400m hurdles world record to win gold.,https://www.self.com/story/sydney-mclaughlin-levrone-olympic-games-2024,"Sydney Mclaughlin-Levrone may only have just turned 25, but standing on the start line at the Olympic stadium is nothing new for her.

As a 16-year-old, the New Jersey native broke the 400-meter hurdle world junior record with a time of 54.15 at the 2016 US Olympic Trials. That punched her ticket to the Rio Games, where she made it to the semifinals. She returned even stronger at the Tokyo Games; she won the 400-meter hurdles, outkicking American teammate Dalilah Muhammad by 0.12 seconds. She was also a member of the gold-winning 4x400-meter relay team in Tokyo with Muhammad, Alison Felix, and Athing Mu.

And in the lead-up to the Paris Games, McLaughlin-Levrone continued to bring it. She set the new world record in the 400-meter hurdles—a blistering 50.65 seconds—at the 2024 Olympic Trials in Eugene, Oregon, on June 30. And in Paris, she not only won gold, but shattered her own world record in the process. All in all, she has already lowered the world mark six times.

There’s more to McLaughlin-Levrone than what we see on the track, though. She’s outspoken about her faith, has a fascinating family background, and she’s on a mission to push the sport of sprinting further. Here are nine things to know about the world’s fastest 400-meter hurdler.

1. McLaughlin-Levrone comes from a family of talented runners.

Everyone in McLaughlin-Levrone’s immediate family has competed on the track. Her dad, Willie McLaughlin, was a three-time NCAA All-American in the 400-meter and nearly made the Olympic team himself in 1984. He was inducted into the Manhattan College Athletic Hall of Fame in 1997. Mary McLaughlin, Sydney’s mom, ran on the boys’ track team in high school, as People reports.

McLaughlin-Levrone and her three siblings had an active childhood. “Track and field has always been part of our lives,” McLaughlin-Levrone said in an interview with the Olympic Channel Podcast. But it wasn’t all running all the time. “Our parents let us choose what we wanted to do,” she said, and she dabbled in basketball, soccer, and dance, but, she added, “for all of us, track kind of stood out.”

Naturally, she was fueled by some healthy sibling competition. Her brother Taylor ran Division I track at the University of Michigan and won silver at the World Junior under-20 championships in the 400-meter hurdles (apparently a popular event among the McLaughlins).

2. She was inspired by Sanya Richard-Ross.

McLaughlin-Levrone caught the Olympic bug when she was nine years old. She distinctly remembers watching Sanya Richards-Ross compete at the 2008 Beijing Games, where the American sprinter won bronze in the 400-meter and closed a huge gap in the 4x400-meter relay for gold. As McLaughlin-Levrone said on the podcast, “I remember turning to my mom and being like, ‘I want to do that.’”

3. Qualifying for her first Olympics was a surprise.

By middle school, it was clear that McLaughlin-Levrone was ahead of other runners her age, but the extent of her talent wasn’t fully on display until her first Olympic trials ahead of the 2016 Games in Rio. “When we went to the trials in 2016, we were really just going for the experience,” McLaughlin-Levrone told the Olympic Channel Podcast. Just 16 at the time, she remembers thinking that there was “no way” she would qualify for Team USA in the 400-meter hurdles, which would require at least a third-place finish at the Trials. She didn’t just qualify for the team—she also beat the fourth-place finisher by over half a second (which is significant in a 54-second race!).

4. The University of Kentucky was her home away from home for a year.

After her standout high school career, McLaughlin-Levrone had a choice between going straight to the pros or running in the NCAA. She decided to attend the University of Kentucky in 2017, where she spent a year she described as “very pivotal” for her athletic career. She was exposed to more intense training and higher expectations from coaches, which she said, “really gave me an inside look into what it’s like to be a professional,"" as she told the Olympic Channel Podcast.

5. Candy is her race fuel of choice.

A self-proclaimed “candy connoisseur,” McLaughlin-Levrone credits at least some of her speed to a prerace meal of gummy bears, Jolly Ranchers, and Starbursts. “If there’s candy in my house, it’s not staying for more than 24 hours,” she said in an interview with GQ. If only we could all break world records on a bag of gummy bears, McLaughlin-Levrone would be facing a lot more competition.

6. Add “published author” to her accolades.

As if Olympic medals aren’t enough of an accomplishment, McLaughlin-Levrone also released her first book in January. The book, Far Beyond Gold: Running from Fear to Faith, describes how McLaughlin-Levrone managed the fear and mental health struggles she faces as a professional runner. In it, she discusses how her faith helped her come to terms with her identity and deal with perfectionism, anxiety, and impostor syndrome."

What a day of action, with a big track world record from Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone to cap things!

Don't forget to read all the recaps and reaction from today on Olympics.com.

We've now completed 13 days of the Olympic Games and three days remain. Here's what you can expect on Day 14, 9 August, with a bumper 35 gold medals on offer.

They include the 4x100m relay finals in athletics, while Karsten Warholm will look to defend his men's 400m hurdles title (9:45pm) against a strong chasing pack including Alison dos Santos and Rai Benjamin, with potentially the world record on the line.

Elsewhere, women's beach volleyball holds its medal matches (9pm, 10:30pm) in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower at the Eiffel Tower Stadium, sure to leave a lasting impression on both players and fans. And the men's football competition concludes (6pm) at the Parc des Princes, home to Paris Saint-Germain, with hosts France in action against neighbours Spain.

Breaking - First Olympic medallists to be decided

For the first time, there will be Olympic medals awarded in the sport of breaking. The B-Girls competition will take place on 9 August, with the qualified athletes battling it out at the La Concorde Urban Park from 4pm.

Japan's B-Girl Ayumi will be looking to become the Olympic champion at age 41 – more than double the age of some of her opponents. And she has a good chance, too, after finishing first and second at the two Olympic Qualifier Series events.

Indeed, a Japanese one-two may be on the cards: B-Girl Ami finished second and first in those same qualifiers.

Table tennis - Ma Long ready to bow out

There's a changing of the guard in table tennis. The two-time defending singles champion Ma Long hasn't been selected for the singles event this time, and as the legend – and arguably the sport's greatest of all time – prepares to wind down his career, this could be his last Olympic Games final.

The men's team gold medal match (3pm) features the People's Republic of China, which has dominated Olympic table tennis, against Sweden. And Ma remains the figurehead of the team, even as he has been overtaken in the world (and domestic) ranks by Wang Chuqin and Fan Zhendong, his teammates.

With Ma already announcing that the 2024 World Championships would be his last, will this be his final Olympic appearance too?

The problem with exceeding expectations is that new expectations crop up in place of the old ones. This is the reality facing Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, the defending Olympic gold medalist in the women’s 400-meter hurdles. In all five of the championship races she’s run over the past three years — the U.S. championships, world championships, and Olympic Games — the 25-year-old has broken the world record. She set her last one, 50.65 seconds, in June while winning the U.S. Olympic Trials by nearly two full seconds, an unheard-of margin of victory. Amazingly, this time would have been good for seventh place in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics women’s flat 400 meters — that is, a race run without ten hurdles in the way.

The expectation now is that McLaughlin-Levrone will break yet another world record at this year’s Olympics, quite possibly finishing under 50 seconds in Thursday’s final. To get within a few strides of this extraordinary feat, though, McLaughlin-Levrone first had to lose — which took her years to do.

As a freshman at Union Catholic High School in Scotch Plains, New Jersey, McLaughlin-Levrone (whose surname was McLaughlin until she married Andre Levrone Jr. in 2022) arrived nearly fully grown, at five-foot-eight, one inch shorter than she stands today.

She was also very fast. Right away, with seemingly no effort at all, she ran training times that Mike McCabe, who coached McLaughlin-Levrone throughout high school, would expect only from state champions. At the end of her freshman year, when she was 14, McLaughlin-Levrone finished second in the 400-meter hurdles at the USA Track & Field Junior National Championships, losing by less than a quarter of a second to that year’s NCAA champion — who was five years her senior.

“We got to a point after a year or two of high school where I really thought she might be the best sprinter ever. And I still believe that’s where she’s going,” McCabe says. At that point of her high-school career, he continues, “I became more cautious with her, and I would lessen the intensity of some of her workouts because she could still race very fast without doing a ton of work. And I wanted to preserve that for college and her post-collegiate career.” This didn’t hamper McLaughlin-Levrone’s high-school performances. After fewer than a handful of defeats in her freshman year, she never lost a high-school race again.

McLaughlin-Levrone’s freshman year of college, at the University of Kentucky, wasn’t as easy; it took her time to adjust to the enormous pressure and competitiveness of NCAA sports. She joined a training group that included professional athletes such as Kendra Harrison, then the 100-meter hurdles world-record holder. McLaughlin-Levrone improved her personal best at the 400-meter hurdles by more than a second that year, set the collegiate record, and won the NCAA championship, but she didn’t gel with her coach, Edrick Floréal.

Floréal thought McLaughlin-Levrone had mastered neither the event’s multiple linked components nor the work ethic needed for an athlete at her elite level. “You get an athlete that good, you have expectations that the person is gonna be educated at a certain level,” he told the Dayton Daily News near the end of the season.

McLaughlin-Levrone made strides in both directions after going pro at the end of the season. In the fall of 2018, she moved to Los Angeles, where she began to train with Joanna Hayes, the 2004 Olympic gold medalist in the 100-meter hurdles. She was then introduced to Ralph Mann, the silver medalist in the 400-meter hurdles at the 1972 Olympics, who had worked with Hayes before. After his running career, Mann got a Ph.D. in sports biomechanics, and he specialized in hurdling.

The history of track and field is littered with technical obsessives. Bill Bowerman famously created the contemporary long-distance running shoe in 1974 after experimenting with his wife’s waffle iron. Seventy-year-old Bobby Kersee, who has coached some of the greatest sprinters in American history, including Florence Griffith-Joyner and Allyson Felix, refers to the track as his “lab,” and his runners call him the “mad scientist.” Mann’s work in biomechanics fits within this tradition. He spent decades filming the best sprinters in the world and creating computer models that used a glorified stick figure to define the most efficient running form for sprinters and hurdlers. When he came to L.A. to meet McLaughlin-Levrone, Mann recorded video of her running, superimposed it over his ideal sprinter, and compared the results.

”There are two types of athletes in the 400-meter hurdles,” Mann said by phone from his home in Bend, Oregon. “The first group is what we call the running jumpers.” These athletes enter a race with no gameplan and rely solely on their speed and natural ability. When they reach a hurdle, they often have to stutter-step or overstride because they’ve allowed themselves either too much room or too little. They never know which leg, their dominant or nondominant one, they’ll employ to clear the hurdle. Then there are the technicians. These runners know exactly how many steps they’ll take to the first hurdle and how many they’ll take between hurdles in the middle of the race, and at the end, when they begin to tire and fatigue. McLaughlin-Levrone, he said, fit the first group. “Sydney had problems. She couldn’t hurdle with her opposite leg. With her primary leg, she was mediocre at best. And her training wasn’t to the point where she could handle the last three hurdles.”

“The problem with this is that no athlete likes to work on their weaknesses,” Mann added. “What convinced her is that she hates to lose.”

At the U.S. National Championships in 2019, defending Olympic champion Dalilah Muhammad set a world record while beating McLaughlin-Levrone by more than half a second. It was one of the worst margins of defeat she’d ever suffered. Two months later, at the world championships, McLaughlin-Levrone broke the world record herself. But Muhammad did too, beating McLaughlin-Levrone by .07 of a second.

Mann was on the track’s infield that day, and after the race was over, McLaughlin-Levrone approached. “What the hell do I have to do to beat her?” she asked him. “It’s kind of hard to tell the athlete that just ran the second-fastest time of all time in the event that something’s wrong,” he says. But he did. She shook her head and walked away.

“In order to find yourself, you must lose,” McLaughlin-Levrone wrote on Instagram later that day. “Lose races, lose people, lose hope.” When the Olympics were postponed the following year because of the COVID-19 pandemic, McLaughlin-Levrone cut ties with Hayes and hired the mad scientist, Bobby Kersee, as her new coach.

Mann met with Kersee and McLaughlin-Levrone in L.A. four or five times that year. He and Kersee had dinner before he left town after the first visit and discussed the situation. “Jesus,” they said to each other, according to Mann. “This is incredible. She’s got so many things wrong. If she can get this stuff and we can fix these things, it’s going to be a miracle.”

The next day, Kersee and McLaughlin-Levrone got to work. The most important step a hurdler takes is the one just before they leap, and McLaughlin-Levrone had trouble landing that step in the right spot. She and Kersee worked on it in practice endlessly, with Kersee tasking his assistants to place tape on the track in front of hurdles to mark the spot McLaughlin-Levrone had to hit. “He used a lot of tape,” Mann says.

Kersee began to enter McLaughlin-Levrone in 100-meter hurdle races, and he made her run each hurdle with her nondominant leg until she’d improved enough that she could do it seamlessly over the course of 400 meters. “That resulted in her getting her ass kicked a lot of times,” Mann says. “She hated it, but she did it anyway.”

Kersee worked on her start, on her hurdling form, on her stride. And he set up her race plan to run 14 steps in between each of the first seven hurdles, alternating the leg she hurdles with, and then switching to 15 steps for the final three hurdles, using her dominant leg.

When she faced off against Muhammad at the Olympic trials in 2021, McLaughlin-Levrone finally turned the tables and won, setting a new world record in the process. In Tokyo later that summer, the pair ran one of the greatest races in Olympics history, with both of them crushing the previous world record again. McLaughlin-Levrone passed Muhammad in the race’s final 20 meters to win by .12 of a second.

For McLaughlin-Levrone, the victory seemed to reset what was possible in the event. At the world championships the following year, McLaughlin-Levrone broke her world record yet again by an awe-inspiring .78 of a second.

“Iron sharpens iron,” McLaughlin-Levrone said before the Tokyo Olympics final, referring to the way her competition with Muhammad had brought out the best in her. She faces another formidable rival in Paris: 24-year-old Dutch standout Femke Bol. To compete with McLaughlin-Levrone, Bol has reduced her steps in between the race’s first seven hurdles to 14, just as McLaughlin-Levrone did, and she has lowered her personal best to within three-tenths of a second of McLaughlin-Levrone’s.

McLaughlin-Levrone’s dominant performance in Tuesday’s semifinal set the stage for a Thursday final that could surpass even the 2020 Olympics duel. Those pesky expectations, in other words, are running high. But McLaughlin-Levrone has put in enough hard work and won enough hard races that it would hardly be a surprise if she leapt over them yet again."

She confirmed her mastery in an event in Stade de France on Thursday night in which she broke the world record six times when she easily beat strong Dutch star Femke Boll (52.15) into third place. USA’s Anna Cockrell took silver in 51.87.

McLaughlin-Levrone is expected to run in the 4x400m relay this weekend, where she could win the third Olympic gold of her career.

Along with gold, Michael Johnson’s 400m in 1996 and 2000.

Earlier in the evening, the Americans won two medals in the 200 meters: Noah Lyles took bronze in the 100 meters and Kenny Bednarek won gold behind Letzile Teboko of Botswana who took silver. It was revealed after the race that Lyles had contracted Covid.

The United States won another gold when Grant Holloway won the men’s 110m hurdles ahead of teammate Daniel Roberts late Thursday. Jamaica’s Rasheed Bradbell won bronze.

She confirmed her mastery in an event in Stade de France on Thursday night in which she broke the world record six times when she easily beat strong Dutch star Femke Boll (52.15) to third place. USA’s Anna Cockrell won silver in 51.87.

“I’ve sacrificed a lot, my family has sacrificed a lot,” Cockrell said. “To do this today, when it counts the most, on the biggest stages, here with my whole family, we’re all crying with our eyes closed. I am truly a talker, I have no words.

McLaughlin-Levrone didn’t break a sweat when he came home by a huge margin. When the world record was confirmed, she looked up at the video board. At this point, such feats are almost routine for her. He is expected to run in the 4x400m relay this weekend, where he could win the third Olympic gold of his career.

Along with Jupiter’s gold, Michael Johnson’s 400m in 1996 and 2000.

It was a perfect birthday present for McLaughlin-Levrone, who turned 25 on Wednesday.

“Thank you for celebrating my 25th birthday like this. It was yesterday, a super opportunity, you can’t even imagine,” she said. “My whole family is here. We’re going to celebrate, we’re going to enjoy this time and get ready for the relay.

Ball was distraught after the race and admitted she had got her tactics wrong, although it was unclear what she could have done to prevent McLaughlin-Levron from winning gold.

“I screwed it up,” Boll said. “I don’t know where I went wrong. With 300m to go I got lactic acid. I don’t know why, I have no explanation. It was a bad race.

Previously a coach with the Kansas City Royals, Grifol lasted just over a season and a half at the helm in Chicago. The White Sox will now seek the franchise's 43rd skipper.

While it's unfortunate that Grifol lost his job, that's the business of being a big-league manager: you get credit for the highs, and blame for the lows. As is tradition here at CBS Sports whenever a skipper finds themselves ousted, we've decided to throw some names out there about who could be the next in line -- it's a guessing game, basically, and one that allows us to highlight common tropes that come with these processes.

With that in mind, here are five names who we think could pop up in relation to the White Sox's managerial opening.

1. Skip Schumaker, Marlins manager

It's fair to write that Schumaker's second season at the helm in Miami has not gone as swimmingly as his first one did. Still, the residual shine of last year's surprise playoff run will make him an interesting free agent at season's end for teams seeking a new skipper. (The Marlins agreed to void their club option on him after overhauling their front office.) Schumaker remains on the younger side (he's 44) and he's won 45.8% of his games with the Marlins to date. The questions are whether or not Schumaker will be willing to babysit another young, developing roster -- and if he'll have much choice.

2. Grady Sizemore, White Sox interim skipper

We originally had Charlie Montoyo, Chicago's bench coach, slotted in here. Montoyo was also fired, however, paving the way for Sizemore to become the interim skipper. We'll include him instead for the same basic reasons: he's already in place, and this White Sox club is prone to bending to intertia. Remember, they didn't hire a single external candidate before promoting Getz to GM in the first place.

3. Fredi González, Orioles bench coach

Baseball is a copycat league. Losing teams often look to winning teams for inspiration. Sometimes that means hiring individuals directly from those clubs, hoping that their institutional knowledge of a good franchise can rub off. González makes sense on those grounds, and he also makes sense as someone who has been there and done that as a manager. He's captained a big-league club in parts of 10 seasons already, and has interviewed for other gigs since being dismissed by the Braves in 2016. González isn't going to thrill the locals or anything, but his credentials are worth acknowledging. Some other names worth keeping in mind in this mold: Twins bench coach Jayce Tingler; Mets front office member Andy Green; and Yankees bench coach Brad Ausmus.

4. Rickie Weeks Jr., Brewers associate manager

Hiring someone like González, an experienced hand with potentially newfound knowledge, is one way losing teams pluck from winning teams. Another way is hiring fresh faces with the hopes that they can help build something special elsewhere. Weeks would qualify. He's served as Pat Murphy's right-hand man this season, giving him plenty of insight into how to get the most from a roster. It's possible that Weeks isn't ready for his own gig yet, and it's also possible that he would prefer to stick with the Brewers, a franchise he's long been identified with. Both are fair considerations. If not Weeks, we could see the White Sox filling this candidate type by inquiring about Guardians coaches Craig Albernaz or Kai Correa; Dodgers coaches Danny Lehmann and Clayton McCullough; and/or Pirates bench coach Don Kelly.

5. Ozzie Guillén, television analyst

Guillén, of course, used to manage the White Sox. He won more than 52% of his games from 2004-11, and he even raised the World Series trophy in 2005. He hasn't managed in the majors since a disastrous one-year stint with the Marlins back in 2012, but he's stayed close to the game (and specifically the White Sox) by doing television work. If nothing else, we think Guillén's name will come up because he'll bring it up himself. Beyond that? Who knows. It's not like Jerry Reinsdorf has shied away from hiring managers from the past -- remember the second Tony La Russa era?"

Rondale Moore’s debut with the Atlanta Falcons will have to wait another year.

The Falcons ruled Moore out for the entire 2024 campaign Thursday afternoon, just one day after he went down with a season-ending knee injury in a joint practice with the Miami Dolphins.

Specifics of his injury are not yet known, but the Falcons placed him on the season-ending injured reserve list Thursday.

Moore went down near the end of practice in Miami Gardens, Florida, on Wednesday during 11-on-11 drills. Moore was on the opposite side of the play when he went down suddenly in the end zone, which led to him being carted off the field in an aircast. It’s unclear if there was any contact when Moore fell.

Practice ended about 40 minutes early after Moore’s injury.

Moore had 352 receiving yards and one touchdown last season with the Arizona Cardinals, who first selected him in the second round of the 2021 NFL Draft out of Purdue. Moore was dealt to the Falcons earlier this offseason in exchange for quarterback Desmond Ridder. Moore was entering the final year of his initial four-year, $6.9 million deal this season.

Moore joined a Falcons team attempting to make the playoffs for the first time in seven seasons under new quarterback Kirk Cousins, whom they signed to a four-year, $180 million deal in March. Atlanta also selected former Washington star Michael Penix Jr. with its first pick in the draft earlier this spring.

Open Extended Reactions

The Atlanta Falcons placed wide receiver Rondale Moore on the reserve/injured list Thursday due to a season-ending knee injury.

Moore was carted off the field during a joint practice Wednesday with the Dolphins in Miami. An air cast was placed on Moore's right knee, and he was taken to an on-site medical facility.

The injury happened on a passing play, when rookie quarterback Michael Penix Jr. hit wide receiver Josh Ali in the right side of the end zone during 11-on-11 drills.

The pass was incomplete and the play seemingly inconsequential until Moore was seen down in the opposite side of the end zone.

Moore, 24 was acquired in a trade with the Arizona Cardinals in March for quarterback Desmond Ridder, who was Atlanta's primary starter under center in 2023.

On the first Falcons depth chart of 2024, Moore was listed as the fourth wide receiver on the team and second in the slot. He had developed early chemistry with Penix with the second-team offense.

In a corresponding move Thursday, Atlanta re-signed punter Ryan Sanborn, who had spent most of the offseason with the Falcons."

Falcons wide receiver Rondale Moore to miss season after knee injury in training camp.,https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/2024-nfl-training-camp-injuries-puka-nacua-week-to-week-with-knee-injury-falcons-rondale-moore-out-for-year/,"Training camps are underway across the NFL, and unfortunately, so are summer injuries. While some prominent names entered camp already in recovery, indefinitely sidelined on reserves lists like physically unable to perform (PUP), others have been dinged up since taking the field for their first camp reps.

Here's a roundup of notable names to go down during training camp, with updates on their status:

Offensive players

Star Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert suffered a plantar fascia injury in his right foot. He will be in a walking boot for two weeks before beginning a return-to-play protocol, but should be ready for the regular season. Backup Easton Stick will take first-team reps in the meantime.

Andy Dalton is out for at least a couple of weeks after suffering a quad injury during practice. The Panthers are looking to bring in another quarterback while he's on the mend.

The reigning Offensive Player of the Year suffered a calf injury in early August, coach Kyle Shanahan told reporters, and will likely miss a few weeks of practice. The star running back is also unlikely to take any preseason snaps before the start of the 2024 campaign.

Panthers head coach Dave Canales told reporters on Saturday that he expects rookie running back Jonathon Brooks to be ready around Week 3 or Week 4 of this season. Brooks, a second-round pick out of Texas, is recovering from an ACL tear he suffered last November against TCU.

Ty Johnson, who has been rotating in the No. 2 running back spot with rookie Ray Davis, is sitting out of Tuesday's practice with a hamstring injury. First-stringer James Cook recently returned to practice after missing one session for personal reasons.

A 2023 third-round pick out of TCU, Miller left the Saints' first camp practice with a hamstring injury, one year after appearing in just eight games as a rookie reserve. Head coach Dennis Allen was blunt when addressing the injury, suggesting Miller needs to ""figure out how to stay healthy.""

Nacua enters Year 2 with high expectations after winning Offensive Rookie of the Year in 2023. He suffered a knee injury at Saturday's practice, however, and is now considered week-to-week, per ESPN. Veteran reserves Demarcus Robinson and Tutu Atwell are in line for more snaps as he recovers.

DeAndre Hopkins is set to miss four to six weeks after suffering a knee injury earlier this week. It's a blow to the Tennessee offense, which is expected to be more pass-oriented this season under new head coach Brian Callahan.

The second-year starter was helped off the practice field Aug. 7 with an apparent ankle injury, and ESPN reports Downs is dealing with a high-ankle sprain, which could sideline him for weeks.

Panthers first-round pick Xavier Legette didn't finish practice Sunday. Head coach Dave Canales didn't have any more information on the situation, but did say it wasn't related to the hamstring injury the wide receiver suffered in OTAs. The X-Rays were negative, per NFL Network. He's considered day-to-day.

Rookie wide receiver Jermaine Burton sat out Friday's Bengals practice after suffering what is believed to be a minor ankle injury. He's competing with Andre Iosivas and Trenton Irwin for the No. 3 receiver job behind Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins.

With Deshaun Watson sitting out due to rest and Jerry Jeudy limited with a knee issue, the Browns lost another offensive starter during Friday's practice as Elijah Moore entered the concussion protocol. Like Harrison, he will need to be cleared by an independent neurologist.

A three-time Super Bowl champion who had a career-high 460 receiving yards as one of Patrick Mahomes' reserve targets in 2023, Watson left a recent Chiefs camp practice after suffering a foot injury. His absence could lead to additional reps for Skyy Moore, with rookie Xavier Worthy also banged up.

Oft-injured Ravens wideout Rashod Bateman exited Monday's practice after taking a hit to the rib/stomach area, but coach John Harbaugh described the issue as merely soreness.

Bears guard Nate Davis has missed the last several training-camp sessions with an undisclosed muscle strain, though head coach Matt Eberflus has described has status as day-to-day.

The Buccaneers have lost an offensive lineman for the season. Guard Sua Opeta, a free agent acquisition, suffered a torn ACL during training camp and will be out for the year, via the Tampa Bay Times. Opeta signed a one-year deal with Tampa Bay and won't be able to play during that year. After the team lost Matt Feiler and Aaron Stinnie this offseason, there was a hole at left guard that Opeta and Ben Bredeson were competing for. Bredeson has taken reps with the starters during practice.

Jaguars tackle Cam Robinson left Friday's practice due to a shoulder injury, via Pro Football Talk. Robinson played only nine games last season after serving a four-game suspension for violating the league's performance-enhancing drug policy and later going on injured reserve when dealing with a knee issue. The severity of the shoulder injury is not yet known.

The Jaguars' other starting tackle, Anton Harrison, left practice after being placed in the concussion protocol. He will need to pass through the protocol and be cleared by an independent neurologist before returning to the field.

Chiefs tackle Wanya Morris also left practice with a shoulder injury, according to head coach Andy Reid. Morris is competing this offseason with second-round pick Kingsley Suamataia for the starting left tackle job.

A pair of Rams offensive linemen left practice due to injuries this week. Sean McVay described free-agent signee Jonah Jackson as ""week to week"" with his shoulder injury, but it was reported that he could miss up to six weeks with a bruised scapula. McVay said he believed Havenstein may have just gotten his foot stepped on during practice.

Moore suffered a season-ending injury after injuring his knee during Wednesday's practice. Prior to the injury, the 24-year-old wideout was having a strong training camp and was vying to be the team's No. 3 wideout alongside Drake London and Darnell Mooney.

Defensive players

Cowboys edge rusher Sam Williams went down with an apparent torn ACL during Sunday's practice session. He will be placed on injured reserve and miss the 2024 season. The third-year defensive end was expected to provide supplementary pass rush behind Micah Parsons and Demarcus Lawrence, but Dallas may now have to look outside the organization for additional depth.

Bengals edge rusher Sam Hubbard left Sunday's practice on a cart after suffering a knee injury, but it is not believed to be serious. That's a relief for Cincinnati, which counts on Hubbard as its primary complement to Trey Hendrickson.

Samson Ebukam suffered a torn Achilles tendon during Monday's practice session. He will be placed on injured reserve and is expected to miss the entire 2024 season.

Lions defensive end John Cominsky suffered a torn MCL and will go on injured reserve. According to ESPN, he could possibly be back for the playoffs, assuming the Lions make it there.

Former All-Pro linebacker Demario Davis suffered a hamstring injury during individual drills on Wednesday, but head coach Dennis Allen did not provide any additional details about his status or a timeline for his return to the field, according to NOLA.com.

A tackle machine at the heart of the Chiefs' defense, Bolton left Wednesday's practice early with an apparent arm injury, per NBC Sports. He also missed time in 2023 due to wrist surgery.

Buccaneers edge rusher YaYa Diaby left practice on Thursday with what NFL Media reported is a high-ankle sprain. Diaby was carted off the field following the injury, so the sprain diagnosis is something of a relief. Coming off a 7.5-sack rookie season, Diaby is expected to play a big role in Tampa's pass rush once he returns.

A candidate for starting reps in the Rams' remade secondary alongside Darious Williams and Tre'Davious White, the third-year veteran likely suffered a torn ACL during Los Angeles' opening practices, per ESPN.

A 2023 third-round pick in line for a potential starting role alongside veteran corners Byron Murphy and Shaq Griffin, Blackmon suffered a season-ending ACL tear during Minnesota's first practice, per NFL Media. The team recently added journeyman Duke Shelley, who started five games for the Vikings back in 2022.

Darious Williams, who returned to the Rams in free agency earlier this offseason, is out with a hamstring strain. Head coach Sean McVay said the team will not rush him back and will take is ""a week at a time."""

Moore was injured in the second half of a two-hour joint practice between the Falcons and Dolphins in Miami on Wednesday. The two teams stopped the practice early after the injury, and Moore’s teammates immediately sensed the seriousness of the injury. They gathered around him as he was taken from the field on a cart with a towel covering his face and then knelt for a prayer.

“It’s unexpected and heartbreaking, not much of a heartbreak like it,” said Falcons defensive tackle Grady Jarrett, who missed nine games last year due to a torn ACL.

The former Purdue Boilermaker was acquired by Atlanta in the offseason in a trade with Arizona for former Falcons starting quarterback Desmond Ridder. Moore, a second-round pick, had 135 catches for 1,201 yards in three seasons with the Cardinals.

He was expected to be a starting receiver for the Falcons at the time of the trade but had been supplanted by another offseason acquisition Ray-Ray McCloud during training camp. Moore was working with the second-team offense for most of training camp and was with that group when the injury occurred. Moore’s injury was non-contact and suffered on the opposite side of the field from the throw.

His new team, the Atlanta Falcons, placed him on injured reserve on Thursday following a knee injury in practice earlier in the week that forced him to be carted off the field.

The Cardinals traded Moore, their second-round draft pick in 2021, in the offseason to the Falcons in exchange for quarterback Desmond Ridder.

In three seasons with the Cardinals, Moore caught 40 passes for 352 yards and a touchdown. He also rushed for 249 yards and a touchdown.

Injuries plagued him for two seasons before playing in all 17 games in 2023 and after his trade to the Falcons, he had hamstring issues in the offseason. Now his season ends and he will be a free agent next offseason.

The Falcons immediately ended practice, informing players Moore was being taken to a local hospital in the Miami Gardens, Fla., area. The injury occurred during the 11-on-11 practice period. With all the action directed toward the right corner of the end zone, Moore collapsed in the opposite corner, where he was tended to by doctors and trainers.

Moore was carted off with an air cast on his leg during the Falcons joint practice with the Miami Dolphins. The Falcons have placed Moore on the reserve/injured list.

The Atlanta Falcons traded for Moore during the offseason in a deal that sent quarterback Desmond Ridder to the Arizona Cardinals. Moore was listed as a backup wide receiver on the depth chart and also a kickoff returner.

Rondale Moore was set to be a contributor for the Falcons

Rondale Moore was set to play in different spots for the Atlanta Falcons after being a solid contributor for the Arizona Cardinals in his career. In 2023, Moore caught 40 passes for 352 yards and one touchdown. His best season was in 2021 when he caught 54 passes for 435 yards and one touchdown.

With the addition of Kirk Cousins, the Falcons were looking to unlock more of Moore's skillset, with his speed being the thing that separates him from many receivers. Drake London and Darnell Mooney were solidified as the top two receivers on the team, and Moore was battling to take the third spot. Ray-Ray McCloud III, who the Falcons signed in free agency, will probably be the No. 3 receiver now with Moore out for the season.

This was also a contract year for Moore, and it will be interesting to see what his market looks like next season and if he can return fully healthy by 2025.

The Falcons will most likely be looking for more depth at the receiver position during training camp and the preseason, and this also means the other receivers will have a chance to showcase their skills and earn a roster spot."

Bears coach Matt Eberflus said Thursday that Williams will join the team's other healthy starters in competing in a ""range of plays"" in the exhibition game. Eberflus, however, stopped short of noting exactly how many snaps Williams and the others will play against the Bills. ""We want to see a good flow and a good rhythm to it,"" Eberflus said. Williams did not play in last Thursday's Hall of Fame Game against the Houston Texans. Eberflus, however, said Thursday that he feels Williams is ready to take the field. ""He's right where he needs to be right now,"" Eberflus said. ""He's having some good days, some good periods, and then some other ones that he's learning from adversity and a setback. I told him to just lean into that. When you have a setback or have adversity, don't shy away from it. Lean into it and then learn from it and then get better from it. ""A lot of people want to hide and shrink away from adversity. That's not what we do. We lean into it and get better from it, invest our time, grow and improve, and that's what he's been doing. He's got some moments out there today that he's gonna need to do that in today's practice, and I'm sure he's gonna have some in the game."" Williams, 22, was the first of six quarterbacks drafted during the opening round in April. Live repetitions are impossible to simulate in the NFL, which is the reason Bills coach Sean McDermott plans to put Allen and most of Buffalo's starters on the field Saturday. ""It's an important step, hard to simulate the speed of the game and so getting that in preseason is important, going through warm-ups and the energy that comes with playing a game in front of fans, and being able to manage that. So, there's a lot of reasons for it, like I said, it's just another step,"" McDermott said Thursday. Allen sat out the preseason opener in 2023, but the Bills are getting the offense up to speed with a number of new receivers. Rookie Keon Coleman projects as a top-of-the-depth chart option for Allen following the offseason trade of Stefon Diggs to the Texans. No. 2 wide receiver Gabe Davis left for Jacksonville in free agency. ""There's a number of new faces on our offense also, including his receiving corps, and so some of that is baked into this,"" McDermott said. Allen said Wednesday that he is happy with the ""guys we brought in,"" a cast of new options with veterans Curtis Samuel, Marquez Valdes-Scantling, Mack Hollins, K.J. Hamler and Chase Claypool among them. The receiver Allen has the most reps with is third-year wideout Khalil Shakir. He averaged 15.7 yards per reception on 39 grabs for 611 yards with two touchdowns in 2023 after a 10-catch rookie season in 2022.

(AP) — Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Rondale Moore was carted off the field with a leg injury during the team’s joint practice with the Miami Dolphins on Wednesday.

Athletic trainers placed an air cast on Moore’s leg as both teams immediately rushed to be near the injured player. Falcons players knelt while Moore received attention. The practice, nearing its conclusion, ended and Moore was transported to a nearby facility for evaluation.

“Thoughts and prayers are with Rondale,” Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins said after practice. “Not really sure what’s going on but hope it’s not serious.”

But there's always a necessary amount of precaution one should take before starting any fantasy football draft. For one, you have to know if a player you're going to take is injured. That, or if their situation might be complicated by someone else's injury. No one wants to overzealously draft a potential bust because they didn't keep track of everyone's health.

It's the worst feeling in the world. Believe me.

With that in mind, as the 2024 NFL preseason unfolds, we'll keep track of every notable injury you should know before drafting in fantasy football. And yes, we'll keep updating this as more news rolls in.

Hopkins has a knee injury and will miss at least 4-6 weeks, according to Titans reporter Paul Kuharsky. That puts his regular season debut in doubt, at minimum. And his absence would be a big hit to anyone actually leaning on players like Will Levis.

Yes, you're not going to draft a guard in fantasy, but Davis' ongoing questionable injury status during training camp potentially throws any Bears offensive skill players into flux. That means Caleb Williams, D.J. Moore, Keenan Allen, and Rome Odunze. Just be wary that the Chicago offensive line is not exactly a strong unit overall, especially without a starting guard on paper.

Nacua is ""week to week"" with a knee injury, which Sean McVay characterized as a burst bursa sac. That's not the biggest deal per se, but Nacua and Matthew Stafford managers should be wary.

If Brandon Aiyuk really does leave the Bay Area, Pearsall is an easy candidate to try and fill the All-Pro's role. Well, he's currently dealing with a shoulder injury in his all-important rookie training camp. Anyone still drafting Pearsall (or quarterback Brock Purdy) -- watch out.

We're not entirely sure why anyone would draft a Patriots offensive player in 2024, but Bourne is expected to be one of rookie Drake Maye's top targets. For the time being, he's on the PUP list as he recovers from a torn ACL suffered halfway through last season.

A Pro Bowl-caliber tight end at his best, Hockenson is still recovering from a torn ACL suffered last season. He's ahead of schedule but has no timeline for a return yet. Anyone who manages Sam Darnold or J.J. McCarthy should be careful and operate accordingly.

Rondale Moore’s Atlanta Falcons debut will have to wait another year.

The Falcons placed Moore on the season-ending injured list on Thursday, just one day after he was stretchered off the field during practice with a knee injury. Details surrounding the injury are not yet known, but he will be sidelined for the entire 2024 campaign.

Moore, the team said, went down on the other end of a play Wednesday during a joint practice with the Miami Dolphins, which ended early after Moore was carted off the field.

Moore had 352 receiving yards and one touchdown last season with the Arizona Cardinals. The former Purdue star, who was selected by the Cardinals in the second round of the 2021 draft, was traded to the Falcons last offseason for quarterback Desmond Ridder.

Quincy Hall comes from behind to win gold in the Olympic men's 400-meter race.,https://www.npr.org/2024/08/07/g-s1-15858/quincy-hall-olympic-400m-gold-paris,"Quincy Hall wins the Olympic 400-meter race, bringing gold back to the U.S.

SAINT-DENIS, France — The American runner Quincy Hall won the men's 400-meter final at the 2024 Summer Olympics, reestablishing a U.S. claim on the event it once dominated.

It was another dramatic comeback at the Stade de France for the American runners. For much of the race, it seemed impossible that Hall could win it. He spent most of the first 200 meters race visibly lagging in sixth place.

Even as he came around the bend, with just 100 meters remaining, he was still in fourth place. But he labored to catch up — finally overtaking Great Britain's Matthew Hudson-Smith just before the finish line.

""I don't give up, man. I just grit. I grind. I got determination. Anything I can think of that's gonna get me to that line, I think of it,"" Hall said afterward.

It wasn't that Hall had come off the block slowly, he said afterward. Instead, it was his competitors — especially Hudson-Smith, who won silver, and bronze medalist Muzala Samukonga of Zambia — who had opened the race at a torrid pace.

""I knew these guys were gonna get out and they were gonna come for blood early. They were going to go out and try to see who they could throw off the race,"" Hall said.

At last year's World Championships, it had been the Brit who bested Hall. ""I knew that the last 50 was going to determine who wins the Olympics,"" said Hudson-Smith after the race Wednesday. ""He got that one step on me in the last 50, and that's all she wrote.""

In the end, the three top times in the final were also the three fastest times recorded worldwide this year. And they now make up three of the seven fastest times ever recorded at an Olympics.

""Quincy's one hell of an athlete,"" said Hudson-Smith. ""I've been saying all year, 'If you're going to win, you've got to take it from me,' and that's exactly what he did.""

For decades, the U.S. had dominated the men's 400-meter race, winning seven Olympics in a row from 1984 through 2008. But since then, American runners had struggled in the event, placing third only once. Now, the gold is back in American hands, for the 20th time in Olympic history.

Hall's mark of 43.4 seconds was a personal best for the 26-year-old runner, and it was the fifth-fastest time ever recorded. Afterward, Hall removed his shoes and did a victory lap around the stadium, with an American flag draped over his shoulders.

Asked by a reporter at what point he knew he'd won, Hall answered confidently: ""As soon as they shot that gun, I knew I had it.""

The comeback has become a signature feature of the men of Team USA here at the Paris track and field events. Earlier in the week, sprinter Noah Lyles won gold in the 100-meter after spending the first 30 meters in last place. Then, in Tuesday's 1500-meter final, Cole Hocker seized an unlikely window of opportunity to snatch the win from the race's two favorites.

Hall once competed primarily as a hurdler. As a runner at the University of South Carolina, he was an NCAA champion in the 400-meter hurdles. Over the past two years, he has put his energy into the 400-meter race instead.

On Wednesday, he called the switch ""the best decision of my life.""

Hall will compete in one more event at this Olympics, the men's 4x400-meter relay race. The relay heats begin Friday, and the final is on Saturday."
Quincy Hall comes from behind to win gold in the Olympic men's 400-meter race.,https://www.teamusa.com/news/2024/august/08/quincy-hall-blazes-to-400-meter-gold-with-come-from-behind-victory-kenneth-rooks-surprise-silver-in-3000-meter-steeplechase,"SAINT-DENIS, France — World No. 1 Quincy Hall surged and overtook Matthew Hudson-Smith over the final strides to win the men's 400-meter gold, clocking a sizzling time of 43.40 seconds.

The 26-year-old Hall ran the second fastest Olympic 400-meter time of all time, ahead of Michael Johnson’s 43.49 from the Olympic Games Atlanta 1996 and only second to Wayde van Niekert’s World and Olympic record of 43.03, set at the Olympic Games Rio 2016. It was a personal best time for Hall.

Hall nipped Great Britain’s Hudson-Smith by 0.04 seconds, on Wednesday night, at Stade de France.

""This means a lot – I’ve been putting a lot of work in,” Hall said, after the biggest victory of his career. “I told you guys I was going to get a gold medal this year and I guess I just showed you I did,” he said, addressing journalists.

""I know I can win – I knew it today,"" Hall said. ""That’s what I’ve been doing my whole career.""

It was a last gasp effort by Hall that worked out well.

""I don’t give up. I just grit, I grind. I’ve got determination,” Hall said. “Anything I think will get me to that line, I think of it. A lot of hurt, a lot of pain.”

Hall became the first men’s U.S. 400-meter runner to race to gold since LaShawn Merritt at the Olympic Games Beijing 2008. Between 1984 and 2008, U.S. men had won seven consecutive gold medals in the event.

""For the next four years, I can say I’m an Olympic champion,” Hall said.

The race marked the second consecutive evening that a Team USA runner caught a British competitor at the last instant in dramatic fashion. The men’s 400m finale played out eerily similar to Cole Hocker overtaking Josh Kerr in the men’s 1,500-meter on Tuesday night.

The Gainesville, Florida, athlete added to his major championship medal collection having won gold in the men’s 4x400-meter relay and bronze in the open 400m at the 2023 World Athletics Championships.

Hall previously focused on the 400-meter hurdles – becoming the 2019 NCAA champion in the event – before a calculated switch to the open 400m.

""That decision changed my life,” he said."

Just three days after Noah Lyles became the fastest man in the world with his photo finish in the 100-meter dash, Quincy Hall charged in the final quarter of the 400-meter race to record a personal best and win a gold medal.

Hall finished the race in 43.40, which was four one-hundredths of a second faster than Matthew Hudson-Smith of Great Britain. Hudson-Smith, however, appeared poised to win the race, holding a small lead into the final stretch, until Hall emptied his tank and came from behind to slip ahead of the field just before crossing the finish line.

Who is Quincy Hall?

Quincy Hall, 26, is a Raytown, Missouri native who is making his Olympic debut at the 2024 Paris Games. He ran collegiately at the University of South Carolina and won bronze on the 400m and gold in the 4x400m relay at the 2023 World Championship in Budapest.

Hall and Lyles had a brief online war of words after the two exchanged comments about Lyles' desire to be on the 4x400m relay, although Lyles omitted Hall on his ideal relay team."

Hall celebrated his improbable comeback by collapsing on the track and making a snow angel motion.

""I've got determination,"" Hall said. ""That's what got me to that line. A lot of hurt, a lot of pain.""

Hall is the first American since LaShawn Merritt in 2008 to capture gold in the one-lap race. His victory came an evening after American Cole Hocker came from far behind late to beat the favorites in the men's 1,500.

Hall, the 26-year-old who breeds dogs and loves riding horses, looked out of the running in a race that's all about pace and, more often than not, the problem is going too fast too soon.

He was 5 meters behind Hudson-Smith and 2012 champion Kirani James, both to his left, and as they rounded the final curve, and was making up ground on Jareem Richards to his outside for what looked like would be a good battle for bronze.

By the end, James and Richards were afterthoughts, Hall was thrusting his chest at the line to beat the Brit and Samukonga had also come from out of nowhere to take third.

Never count Quincy Hall out.

The Team USA track and field athlete left everyone in shock at the 2024 Paris Olympics after a stunning come-from-behind finish during the men's 400-meter finals to take home gold Aug. 7.

However, around the 300-meter mark, he surged to the front of the heat, finishing first with a time of 43.40 seconds. Great Britain's Matthew Hudson-Smith earned silver and Zambia's Muzala Samukonga won bronze.

""I have never seen anyone run the 400-meter like that,"" NBC Olympics track and field commentator and Olympian Sanya Richards-Ross explained during the livestream.

“This means a lot,” Hall told the media after his race. “I’ve been putting in a lot of work. I told you guys I was going to get a gold medal this year, and I guess I just showed you I did it. I know I can win. I knew it today.

“That’s what I’ve been doing my whole career.”

In about fourth position at the curve, Hall grimaced and braced himself for a come-from-behind win. His time is the fourth fastest ever.

“I was just thinking, ‘Get home, sir. Get home, sir,’” Hall said, reflecting on his dramatic finish.

Heading into Paris, Hall owned the third fastest time in the 400 this year (43.80, per World Athletics). He ran a 44.17 at the U.S. Olympic Trials in June to qualify for his first Games. Hall won both his preliminary and semifinals heats in Paris, running a 44.28 and a 43.95, respectively.

Hall was a member of Team USA’s gold-medal winning 4×400-meters relay at the 2023 World Championships. He finished third in the individual 400 at the same event.

Kenneth Rooks won silver in the steeplechase with 8:06.41, coming behind Soufiane El Bakkali of Morocco. It's only the second time an American athlete has medaled in the event since 1984.

In the pole vault, Katie Moon — the reigning champion from the Tokyo Games — took silver.

One day after welterweight Imane Khelif of Algeria reached her weight division’s final with a third straight victory in Paris, Lin defeated Esra Yildiz Kahraman of Turkey 5:0.

Lin will fight for gold on Saturday.

Lin and Khelif have dominated all of their Olympic bouts despite the massive distractions created by the fallout from the Olympic-banished International Boxing Association’s decision last year to disqualify both fighters from the world championships for allegedly failing an eligibility test.

Both fighters have responded to this unwelcome spotlight by making two of the best tournament runs of their lengthy amateur careers.

They soared to a big early lead on New Zealand in their head-to-head showdown, then held on through a ragged finish to finally win the gold medal.

The Americans led by more than a second a quarter of the way through the 4,000-meter race, and they stretched the gap at one point to nearly two seconds. When they began to come apart from their single-file, aerodynamic draft with about two laps to go, they had to fight to the finish to hold off Ally Wollaston, Bryony Botha, Emily Shearman and Nicole Shields.

In the final of the men’s pursuit, Sam Welsford, Oliver Bleddyn, Conor Leahy and Kelland O’Brien of Australia beat Britain in a close final at the Vélodrome National de Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines to win gold for the first time in two decades.

U.S. weight off his shoulders

Hampton Morris became the first U.S. men’s weightlifter to earn an Olympic medal in four decades, taking bronze in the 61-kilogram division. It had not happened since Mario Martinez and Guy Carlton at the 1984 Los Angeles Games, notably boycotted by several communist countries.

The 20-year-old Morris, trained by his dad in the garage at their home in Marietta, Georgia, finished third in a competition won again by Li Fabin of China. Li defended his title from the Tokyo Games in 2021 and set an Olympic snatch record.

U.S. figure skaters finally get their medal

A touch of winter came to the Summer Games when the United States figure skating team finally got their gold medals as 2022 Olympic champions.

The special medal ceremony allowed the nine Americans to receive the medals exactly 2½ years after the figure skating team event ended at the Beijing Olympics. A doping saga from the winning Russian team led to the Americans being declared the winner.

All nine American skaters came to Paris: Karen Chen, Evan Bates, Nathan Chen, Madison Chock, Zachary Donohue, Brandon Frazier, Madison Hubbell, Alexa Knierim and Vincent Zhou. Seven of the eight members of the Japan team came to get their silver medals — an upgrade from their third-place result in Beijing.

A Russian appeal trying to win back the Olympic team title was dismissed at the Court of Arbitration for Sport just before the Paris Games opened. The title had been stripped in January when a different CAS panel disqualified Russian teenager Kamila Valieva for doping with a banned heart medication. She also was banned for four years.

China dominates artistic swimming

China took gold in the artistic swimming team event, dominating in the absence of Russia, which had won every gold medal in artistic beginning with the 2000 Sydney Games.

It was a big medal for China, and also a step forward for the sport, which changed its name from synchronized swimming several years ago to update its image. Some swimmers still call it “synchro.”

China finished with 996.1389 points, ahead of the United States and Spain. It was the first U.S. medal in the sport since 2004.

Men had an opportunity for the first time to compete in artistic swimming at the Olympics, but no men were picked by any of the teams. There is consideration to add a mixed duet team event for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, which would create more space for men to compete.

Quincy Hall comes from behind to win gold in the Olympic men's 400-meter race.,https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/08/07/quincy-hall-wins-mens-400-meter-gold-medal/74709313007/,"SAINT-DENIS, France – That Quincy Hall considers himself “a dog” doesn’t make him unique among athletes in the 21st century, especially millennials.

What separates Hall, who won gold in the 400-meter dash at the 2024 Paris Olympics on Wednesday, from the rest of the so-called “dogs” is that he means it quite literally.

“Can’t outrun a dog,” Hall said after his thrilling comeback victory, which he finished in 43.40 seconds, a personal best and fifth-fastest time in the event. “The dog will chase you forever.”

Chase he did. Hall found himself in fourth entering the final turn of the race. He looked labored. The top-ranked 400 runner in the world looked destined to finish off the podium.

“If you don’t get far away enough I’m going to catch you,” the Raytown, Missouri native said. “Every time.”

2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.

Planning to leave that much ground to make up over the final 100 meters is bold. But that’s what Hall has become known for in track circles.

Call it courage. Call it naiveté.

“Call it whatever you want,” said Grenada’s Kirani James, who won his country’s first medal at the 2012 London Games in the 400-meter dash and finished fifth Wednesday.

“He has a strong finish,” James added.

The game plan paid off. Hall surged past those ahead of him and crossed the finish line .04 seconds ahead of Great Britain’s Matthew Hudson-Smith. Zambia’s Muzala Samukonga took bronze.

Hall's confidence in chasing down his competition never wavered.

“Soon as they shot that gun I knew I had it,” Hall said. “You can’t get far enough.”

Now he has a gold medal to match the gold grills he wore for the semifinals and finals.

Hall executed similarly at the U.S. Track and Field Trials last month. Wait, plod, kill. At the time, his 43.80 seconds was the fastest time in the world this year.

“He’s a special human being,” said Christopher Bailey, Hall’s American teammate who finished sixth (44.58). “He’s a good person. And he really deserved this.”

All Hall could think while racing the final straightaway was “get home, son.” He thought about the practices in the heat, doing it by himself with his coach, Curtis Allen, instructing him over the phone.

“I don’t give up, man. I just grit, I grind. I got determination,” Hall said. “Anything I could think of that’s going to get me to that line I think of – all the hurt, all the pain.”

Two of Hall’s brothers died young, he said. That alone is his reason to run hard. He also has two daughters, ages 7 and 2, and they are even more of a motivation.

Allen and Hall met when the runner attended College of the Sequoias Community College in 2017.

“That’s where I feel like I found myself being the dog I say I am,” he said.

There was no cafeteria, no free housing. He had two jobs and paid for school on his own dime.

“Everything you do,” Hall said, “you have to do it yourself.”

Then he ran – sometimes three events in one meet. Allen was the one who taught Hall about the biomechanics of the sport and put Hall’s training program on the Olympic path.

“I don’t think I’d be where I’m at right now if I didn’t have junior college,” Hall said.

It was during those “JUCO” days Hall would run the 400 and jog across the field to do the 400-meter hurdles 20 minutes later.

“When I have to come down and do one event, it’s not that bad,” he said.

Hall transferred to the University of South Carolina and won the 2019 NCAA championships in 400-meter hurdles. Until last year, Hall juggled hurdles events. Switching to the straight-up 400 was the “best decision of my life,” he said.

“He works for it,” Bailey said. “It’s just him and his coach. Nobody else.”

When Hall finally caught Hudson-Smith, in the final steps of the race, the Brit let out a frustrated roar.

“If you’re going to win, you got to take it from me,” Hudson-Smith said. “That’s exactly what he did.”

Hudson-Smith’s coaches had been harping on him that the gold medal would come down to the final 50 meters. They were right.

“I thought I had it,” he said.

Hall took third in the 400 at last year’s world championships in Budapest, Hungary. He was also part of the mixed 4x400-meter relay team that won gold at that meet.

But the story for Hall, 26, entering these Games was his online war of words with countryman Noah Lyles, the 100-meter gold-medalist.

Last month, Lyles said during a podcast appearance that Hall – who he referred to as the “current U.S. champion” – would not make his ideal 4x400 team. Lyles instead installed himself because “I don’t think he (Hall) would be a starter.”

Hall did not take kindly to that and responded in a social media post.

“I don’t do the little slick comments and remarks,” Hall wrote, tagging Lyles, on July 19. “I line up.”

Lyles had been vocal about being part of the 4x400 squad at the Paris Games but was not included in the final pool to be selected.

“I feel like using him on the first leg would just be almost like a waste to his talent,” Lyles added.

Hall mostly went the diplomatic route when the interaction was brought up Wednesday. He called Lyles a great athlete.

“That was just to stir the pot a little bit before the Olympic Games,” said Hall, adding: “Maybe he can see me in the 400.”

The Americans can continue trash talking – but with both having individual Olympic gold medals to their names now.

Quincy Hall comes from behind to win gold in the Olympic men's 400-meter race.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/08/07/quincy-hall-gold-400-meter-olympic-track-field/,"SAINT-DENIS, France — Quincy Hall sprinted around the final turn of the Paris Olympics 400 meters behind three men, his two gold chains and a grill of gold teeth sparkling under the Stade de France lights. The first 300 meters had been run at a blistering pace — “hell,” one of the runners later called it. No one would have guessed Hall could catch them.

Hall did not think he would close the gap. The pain in his 26 years of life and the training he had put himself through had conditioned him otherwise: He knew.

“As soon as they shot that gun, I knew I had it,” Hall said Wednesday night. “You can’t get far enough.”

A track and field outsider from Kansas City, Mo., whose path wound through a California junior college, Hall surged from fourth place over the final 100 meters and won the gold medal in one of the fastest, most feverish men’s 400-meter races in Olympic history. Limbs flailing, jaw clenched, chin jutting, Hall caught and passed Britain’s Matthew Hudson-Smith with five meters left and careened across the line in 43.40 seconds — the fourth-fastest time ever and 0.04 seconds ahead of Hudson-Smith.

Across the Channel, an unsettling déjà vu set in: One night after 1,500-meter champion Cole Hocker stunned British favorite Josh Kerr, Hall had done the same.

“He’s the better man,” Hudson-Smith said. “He did what he had to do. I’ve been saying if you’re going to win, you got to take it from me. And he did.”

The latest American track hero of the Paris Olympics was self-made. Hall attended College of the Sequoias out of high school. He trains without partners, often by himself while talking to the coach he met at junior college, Curtis Allen, on the phone. Hall switched full-time from the 400-meter hurdles to the 400 meters just two years ago. On Wednesday night, as he ran a victory lap in bare feet, he considered it the best decision of his life.

“I don’t give up, man,” Hall said. “I grit. I grind. I got determination. Anything I can think of that’s going to get me to that line, I think of it. All the hurt. All the pain.”

Hall brought it with him to the start line of a race of contrasting styles. Hudson-Smith knew Hall would close strong: He had watched Hall’s wicked kick at the U.S. Olympic trials, and his coach had told him the race would be determined in the final 50 meters. Hall knew Hudson-Smith would attempt to bait him early.

“You knew it was going to be a [game of] cat and mouse,” Hudson-Smith said.

The race began as promised: “I got the f--- out,” Hudson-Smith said. Trinidadian Jereem Richards pushed the pace, too, creating a gap between him and the field on the backstretch. Hudson-Smith closed it first. Kirani James of Grenada came with him.

“It was more than fast,” Zambia’s Muzala Samukonga said. “It was hell on the track.”

Hall waited, saving energy for the finish. He had developed his stamina back in Kansas City. He won a youth national championship at 800 meters. At Raytown South High, Hall ran cross-country in the fall, and in the spring he sometimes would enter the 200, 400, 800 and 1,500 in the same meet. In junior college, he would sometimes win a 400 hurdles race, then 20 minutes later run the 400.

So Hall stayed calm as Hudson-Smith took command and Richards and James also led him with 150 meters left. He still waited to make his move.

“Courage, naiveté — call it whatever you want,” James said.

Out in Lane 8, Hall still trailed three men when he reached 100 meters. He had spotted Hudson-Smith about 15 meters. Hall accessed the full extent of his speed. He said he began to think about “the reasons I run hard and why I bring myself home.” He thought about all the hurt and all the pain.

Hall thought about the people who doubted him. He thought about his two brothers who died young. He thought about the mother who raised him — “his heart,” high school coach Caesar Morales said. He thought about his two daughters — Abri, 7, and A’lani, 2. He thought about the hot practices running by himself. He remembered how it felt when he worked two jobs to pay tuition at a junior college.

“You got to get your own food,” Hall said. “No cafeteria, no study hall, none of that. You can find out how to be a dog by yourself.”

As Hall kicked, the stadium roared. He still remained out of podium position, but his acceleration made his intentions clear. He gained on Richards with ferocity and passed him with 40 meters to go. He mowed down James a few meters later. Only Hudson-Smith, two lanes to his left, remained.

“I thought I had him,” Hudson-Smith said.

Hall kept thinking about all that had brought him there. “Get home, son,” he told himself.

His long, powerful stride devoured the purple track. The gap between him and Hudson-Smith shrank. Hall caught Hudson-Smith with 10 meters left. Hudson-Smith did not feel him before it was too late. Hall passed him and became a champion.

“I just won,” Hall said. “It’s over.”

He held up his hands and shook his head, eyes wide. He lay down on his back and made a snow angel on the track.

In one staggering lap, Hall had become a new star, the first American man to win 400 meters since LaShawn Merritt in 2008. He has bigger plans: He said he plans to enter a new event soon and “cause chaos in that.”

But that could wait. He thought late Wednesday night about Abri and A’lani. They had been watching at home. A’lani may not have been old enough to understand what happened, but Hall had no plans to explain what he had done."

NPR is in Paris for the 2024 Summer Olympics. For more of our coverage from the games head to our latest updates.

SAINT-DENIS, France — The first shocker came when Noah Lyles, the fastest man on Earth, won bronze in his specialty event, the 200-meter. Then, moments after race on Thursday night, the other shoe dropped: Lyles said he’d tested positive for COVID two days earlier.

After crossing the finish line, Lyles looked ill, bent down to the ground, struggled to control his breath, and called for water. He was later seen rolling out in a wheelchair.

Letsile Tebogo of Botswana won gold with a time of 19.46 seconds. Kenneth Bednarek came in second place at 19.62 seconds for silver, ahead of his American teammate. Lyles' time was 19.70.

It wasn't revealed until after the race that Lyles -- fresh off winning the 100-meter sprint on Sunday -- had tested positive for COVID on Tuesday.

On the NBC broadcast after the race, Lyles appeared wearing a mask and confirmed the diagnosis.

""I woke up early, about 5 a.m. on Tuesday morning just feeling really horrible,"" he told the Olympics broadcaster. ""Unfortunately, it came back that I was positive for COVID.""

""My first thought was not to panic, you know, thinking I've been in worse situations — worse conditions, I've felt,"" he said.

Lyles later told reporters that he'd felt light-headed after crossing the finish.

“Shortness of breath, chest pain, but after a while I could catch my breath and get my wits about me. I’m a lot better now,” he said.

He said he was put on ""as much medication as we legally could to make sure my body could keep the momentum going.""

Despite his symptoms, he came out with his signature energetic showmanship after his introduction.

“I already had a bunch of energy,” he said. “This is by far the best day I’ve felt out of the last three days. Still not 100% but closer to 90 to 95%.""

He said he never considered skipping out on the race.

""We quickly quarantined in a hotel nearby the (Olympic) Village,"" he said. ""I still wanted to run, it was still possible.

""If I didn’t make it to the final, that would’ve been the sign not to compete.""

He said COVID hurt his performance, but he's happy to have done as well as he did. ""I’m more proud of myself than anything, coming out here to get a bronze with COVID.”

He said that, going into the race, his competitors didn’t know he had COVID.

“We were trying to keep this close to the chest,"" he said. ""The people who knew were the medical staff, coach, my mom. We didn’t want everybody going into a panic, we wanted them to be able to compete. I’m competitive. Why would you give them an edge over you?”

USA Track & Field confirmed Lyles’ diagnosis in a statement to NPR after the race.

""In response, [the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee] and USATF swiftly enacted all necessary protocols to prioritize his health, the wellbeing of our team, and the safety of fellow competitors,” the organization said, adding that it has been following CDC guidelines to prevent the illness’ spread.

“Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete. After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight. We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.”

Lyles has one final event — the men's 4 x 100m relay on Friday — but said he hasn't decided yet whether he will stay in the race.

""I’m going to be very honest and transparent with the coaches, and I’ll let them make the decision,"" he said. ""No matter what happens, this 4x100m team can handle everything. I’ve been with them in practice, I know they can come out with a win, break as many records as they put their mind to.”

Before the crowd of 80,000 at the Stade de France, the 27-year-old was hoping to go down in sprint double history -- aiming to be just the 10th man to win the 100- and 200- meter races in a single Summer Games.

Only nine men have pulled off the sprint double this before. One of those men — Jamaican Usain Bolt — did it at three straight Olympics. The last time an American managed the sprint double was Carl Lewis 40 years ago in 1984.

After winning his 100-meter race, Lyles posted a motivational message to his social media:

“I have Asthma, allergies, dyslexia, ADD, anxiety, and Depression,” he said. “But I will tell you that what you have does not define what you can become. Why Not You!”

The American, 26, took off from the gun and quickly pulled ahead as he jumped over all 10 hurdles cleanly before holding on in the final stretch for first.

Holloway finished in 12.99, a full 0.10 seconds ahead of countryman Daniel Roberts, who took silver. Jamaican hurdler Rasheed Broadbell rounded out the podium with nearly the same time as Roberts, a 13.09, to take bronze.

Holloway improved on his 2020 Tokyo Olympics finish with the win, after previously taking silver.

Holloway's run capped off a huge night for Team USA in athletics, where they've been dominant all week, often with surprising wins. Along with Holloway and Roberts' 110-meter hurdles medals, the U.S. picked up six others — gold and bronze for Tara Davis-Woodhall and Jasmine Moore, respectively, in the women's long jump; silver and bronze for Kenny Bednarek and Noah Lyles (who later said he had COVID) in the men's 200-meter; and gold and silver for Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone and Anna Cockrell in the women's 400-meter hurdles.

McLaughlin-Levrone set a world record (beating her own previous world record) in the process, with her time of 50.37 seconds.

While most of those medals went to the favorites, Lyles' third-place finish in his best event was unexpected. Lyles was expected to earn his second gold of the Paris Olympics in the 200-meter, but couldn't respond when Botswana's Letsile Teboyo pushed for gold, and Bednarek followed to take silver.

Lyles later said that he had tested positive for COVID days before the race, but decided to compete anyway.

""My first thought was not to panic. I was thinking, I've been in worse situations. You know, I've run in worse situations, I felt,"" he said. ""We just took it day by day, tried to hydrate as much and quarantine. It's taken its toll for sure.

SAINT-DENIS, France — Arms pumping, legs churning, face twisted in a grimace, Quincy Hall kept coming even when he appeared hopelessly far behind.

Hall was a distant fourth place in the Olympic 400 meters final and he was running out of purple track between him and the finish line.

With 50 meters to go, he charged past fading former Olympic champion Kirani James. With 40 meters to go, he ran down Jereem Richards like the Trinidadian’s shoes were made of cement. Only pre-race favorite Matthew Hudson-Smith of Great Britain remained ahead of him, and Hall was reeling him in too.

“You can’t outrun a dog,” Hall said. “A dog is going to chase you forever.”

Hall captured Olympic gold on Wednesday night with a display of never-say-die resilience that won’t soon be forgotten. He overtook a stunned Hudson-Smith with 10 meters to go, leaned at the finish line and then stared at the video board to make sure what he thought he had just experienced was real.

NEVER doubt Quincy Hall. 😱



A EPIC comeback to win 400m GOLD! #ParisOlympics



📺 NBC & Peacock pic.twitter.com/qQJqfxrH9n — NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) August 7, 2024

Hall's winning time was a personal-best 43.40 seconds, the fourth fastest a man has ever run 400 meters. That was four-hundredths of a second faster than Hudson-Smith, now the fifth fastest in history over 400 meters.

Five of the eight men in the final clocked a sub-44-second time. Zambia's Muzala Samukonga ran a 43.74 to take bronze, his country’s second-ever medal and first since 1996.

When Hall was asked when he knew he’d win, he deadpanned, “As soon as they shot that gun.”

“You can’t get far enough,” he said matter-of-factly. “That’s what I’m known for. If you don’t get far enough away, I’m going to catch you every time.”

The grit that has become Hall’s trademark is a byproduct of the obstacle-laden path he’s taken to the top of his sport. Out of high school, he attended College of Sequoias, a California community college that Hall said had no student housing and no cafeteria. He worked two jobs to pay for tuition, food and a room to sleep at night.

“That’s where I feel like I found myself becoming the dog I say I am,” Hall said.

As a pro, Hall trains without partners — and sometimes by himself. Curtis Allen, the coach he met in junior college, will shout instructions to him by phone.

Hall, a former NCAA champion in the 400 hurdles at South Carolina, began his pro career focusing on that event. For two years, his best 400 hurdles times were fast, but not in the same class as the likes of Rai Benjamin, Karsten Warholms and Alison Dos Santos.

Earlier this summer, Hall told Olympics.com that he was “wasting time” running that event as a pro. On Wednesday night, he called switching his focus to the open 400 two years ago the “best decision of my life.”

As Hall earned a bronze medal at the World Championships in Budapest last year and ran his first sub-44-second times this summer, he developed a reputation for a fearsome kick. He had developed his stamina when he was younger. In high school, he ran everything from the 200, to the 400, to the 800, to the 1,500. Occasionally, he’d do them all at the same meet. In junior college, he’d win the 400, then 20 minutes later line up for the 400 hurdles.

Hudson-Smith said that his coaches had warned him about Hall’s kick over the last 50 meters of a race. As a result, as he put it, he ""got the f—- out,"" pushing the pace early and building a lead on the back stretch.

Blind to the rest of the field in lane eight on Wednesday night, Hall got out faster than he usually does, but it still wasn’t fast enough. The pace was so quick that Hall left himself a lot of ground to make up entering the final 100 meters.

As Hall ran, he said to himself, ""Get home, son."" He thought about all those grueling practices running by himself. He thought about putting himself through junior college. He thought about his two brothers who died young, his mom and his two young daughters.

Hudson-Smith admitted that he was caught off guard by Hall’s heroic last-gasp charge.

“I thought I had it,” Hudson-Smith said. “If you’re going to win, you’re going to have to take it from me. That’s exactly what he did.”

Last month, during a podcast appearance, Noah Lyles mulled which sprinters he’d include on his dream American 4x400-meter relay. Conspicuously absent from the selections that Lyles made was Hall, the man who won the U.S. title in the 400 at Olympic Trials this past June.

Christopher Bailey was Lyles’ choice to lead off. Lyles designated himself the best option for the second leg, even though he’s primarily known as a short sprinter. Michael Norman and Benjamin were Lyles’ choices for the second-to-last leg and the anchor position.

“The only reason I wouldn’t use the current U.S. champion is that I just don’t think he’d be a starter,” Lyles explained. ""Using him on the first leg would almost be like a waste of his talents.""

On July 19, Hall tagged Lyles in a post on X and wrote, “My blocks ready anytime you feel like you can beat me in the 400.”

“You was talking [too] much on my name on yo little podcast,” Hall added. “I don’t do the little slick comments and remarks. I line up.”

It’s probably safe to assume Lyles wouldn’t omit Quincy Hall again if he could have a do-over. Hall lined up against seven of the world’s best quarter-milers, spotted a few of them a lead and then roared back to beat all of them."

Open Extended Reactions

SAINT-DENIS, France -- Quincy Hall became the latest American to electrify Olympic track and field with an out-of-nowhere comeback Wednesday night, sprinting from far behind in the 400 meters to reel in three runners and capture the gold medal.

Hall, buried in fourth place as the runners rounded the last bend, outran the runner on his outside, then two more to the inside to cross the line in 43.40 seconds, the fourth-fastest time ever, then dropped to the track to do snow angels to celebrate.

""I've got determination,"" Hall said. ""That's what got me to that line. A lot of hurt, a lot of pain.""

Hall beat Britain's Matthew Hudson-Smith by .04 seconds -- that's now the fifth-fastest time in history -- and Muzala Samukonga of Zambia finished third for bronze.

Hall is the first American since LaShawn Merritt in 2008 to capture gold in the one-lap race. His victory came an evening after American Cole Hocker came from far behind late to beat the favorites in the men's 1,500 meters.

Add in Noah Lyles, whose only lead in his 100-meter thriller came when he crossed the finish line, and these Americans are turning into quite the comeback kids.

Hall's win came about an hour after Lyles advanced to the final of the 200 meters despite finishing second to Letsile Tebogo in his semifinal. Lyles will race in the final on Thursday.

Hall, the 26-year-old who breeds dogs and loves riding horses, looked out of the running in a race that's all about pace and, more often than not, the problem is going too fast too soon.

He was 5 meters behind Hudson-Smith and 2012 champion Kirani James, both to his left, and as they rounded the final curve, and was making up ground on Jareem Richards to his outside for what looked like would be a good battle for bronze.

By the end, James and Richards were afterthoughts, Hall was thrusting his chest at the line to beat the Brit and Samukonga had also come from out of nowhere to take third.

""I just won. It's over,"" Hall said. ""Next four years, I can say I'm Olympic champion.""

Also on the track Wednesday, Soufiane El Bakkali defended his gold in the men's 3,000-meter steeplechase for Morocco's first medal of the Games.

El Bakkali clocked a time of 8 minutes, 6.05 seconds to become the first back-to-back winner of the event since Finland's Volmari Iso-Hollo in 1932 and 1936.

American Kenneth Rooks ran a personal best of 8:06.41 to win the silver medal, while Kenya's Abraham Kibiwot claimed bronze.

Rooks had the lead heading into the homestretch and was looking to pull off a massive upset, but El Bakkali overtook him. Rooks still beat his personal best by almost 9 seconds to capture the second silver over three Olympics in the event for America.

Ethiopian world record-holder Lamecha Girma suffered a late fall after hitting one of the barriers. He landed hard on the track and was carried off on a stretcher.

Earlier, Jamaica's Roje Stona won gold in men's discus with an Olympic-record throw of 70 meters, upsetting Lithuania's Mykolas Alekna, the world record-holder who had hoped to follow in his father's footsteps to become Olympic champion.

The 21-year-old Alekna, whose throw of 69.97 meters broke his father's mark, had to settle for silver, while Australia's Matthew Denny, who finished fourth in Tokyo, claimed the bronze.

In women's pole vault, Australia's Nina Kennedy soared to the gold medal, clearing the bar at 4.90 meters to beat American Katie Moon, who won the gold in Tokyo and shared the title with Kennedy at this year's world championships.

Moon cleared 4.85 meters for the silver, while Canada's Alysha Newman went over the same height but was awarded bronze due to more missed jumps.

Quincy Hall delivered the comeback of all comebacks to win the men's 400 meters at the 2024 Summer Olympics.

The American looked like he would finish nowhere close to the medal stand through the first 300 meters, but he exploded down the final stretch to win another gold medal for Team USA in track and field.

Hall's massive burst of speed resulted in a personal best time of 43.40 seconds and a clear win ahead of Great Britain's Matthew Hudson-Smith.

Results

1. Quincy Hall (United States) - 43.40 seconds

2. Matthew Hudson-Smith (Great Britain) - 43.44

3. Muzala Samukonga (Zambia) - 43.74

4. Jereem Richards (Trinidad and Tobago) - 43.78

5. Kirani James (Grenada) - 43.87

6. Christopher Bailey (United States) - 44.58

7. Samuel Ogazi (Nigeria) - 44.73

8. Michael Norman (United States) 45.62

Hall produced one of the most incredible final stretches to a race you will ever see.

The American was clearly in fourth place a few strides behind the leaders as they made the turn for the final 100 meters.

Then Hall produced a kick of speed that few athletes can deliver and not only won but took first place four-hundredths of a second clear of the silver medalist.

Hall's incredible run brought the men's 400-meter title back to the United States. LaShawn Merritt in 2008 was the last American winner of the race and he extended a streak of seven straight wins for Team USA.

Get home, son!”

Quincy Hall got home in first, then fell to the ground and did snow angels.

Just another routine day in a come-from-behind kind of Olympics for the U.S.A.

Hall reeled in three runners down the stretch of the 400-meter final Wednesday to deliver another heart-stopping win for his country at the Stade de France. He finished in 43.40 seconds, beating Britain’s Matthew Hudson-Smith by .04 seconds; they are now the fourth- and fifth-fastest men in history at the distance.

Hall’s late push came the evening after American Cole Hocker rocked his sport by coming from way back to beat the favorites in a memorable men’s 1500.

Add in Noah Lyles, whose only lead in his 100-meter thriller Sunday came at the exact point he crossed the finish line, and it’s easy to see a pattern.

“I’ve got determination,” Hall said. “That’s what got me to that line. A lot of hurt, a lot of pain.”

The win came about an hour after Lyles advanced to the final of the 200 meters despite finishing second to Letsile Tebogo in his semifinal. Lyles will race for the gold medal Thursday.

Things did not look good for Hall with 100 meters to go

Things looked bad for Hall, a 26-year-old who starred at South Carolina and who breeds dogs, as the eight sprinters approached the final curve.

He was 5 or so meters behind Hudson-Smith and 2012 champion Kirani James, both to his left, and as they rounded the bend, Hall was making up ground on Jareem Richards to his outside. It looked to be shaping up as a good battle for bronze.

With his arms pumping low and wide and his head bobbing, Hall passed them all, then thrust his chest out to beat the Brit. Hall fell to the ground and scissored his arms and legs back and forth — snow angels in 80-degree weather on the bright purple track.

“I just wanted to keep doing what my coach told me to do, just keep driving and keep driving and get home,” Hall said.

Lost in that chaos was Samukonga, the Zambian, who also came from nowhere to take third.

Hall is the first American since LaShawn Merritt in 2008 to capture gold in the one-lap race that the country dominated for decades before that. He joins the likes of Michael Johnson, Jeremy Wariner and Lee Evans among the champions the United States has produced in the most tactical sprint on the track program.

“I knew these guys would get out try to see who they could throw off their race,” he said.

Turns out, not him.

The new champ’s reaction when he crossed the line: “I just won. It’s over. Next four years, I can say I’m Olympic champion.”

US takes silver and almost pulls upset in steeplechase

Morocco’s Soufiane El Bakkali defended his title in men’s steeplechase, finishing in 8 minutes, 6.05 seconds for a .36-second win over America’s Kenneth Rooks.

Rooks had the lead heading into the homestretch and was looking to pull off a massive upset, but El Bakkali overtook him.

Rooks still beat his personal best by almost 9 seconds to capture the second silver over three Olympics in the event for America.

Evan Jager finished second in 2016.

Australia reaches new heights with pole vault win

Nina Kennedy’s title in pole vault gave Australia its 18th gold medal of the Paris Games, an Olympic record for the country.

Kennedy cleared 4.95 meters to beat defending champion Katie Moon of the U.S.

France in the mix in 400 hurdles but must face Warholm

One of France’s up-and-coming track stars, Clement Ducos, outraced Tokyo bronze medalist Alison dos Santos to the line to finish second in the semifinals of the men’s 400 hurdles.

The prize for Ducos: A rematch with world-record holder Karsten Warholm of Norway, who won that heat easily in 47.67.

Warholm and American Rai Benjamin are expected to vie for the title in Saturday’s final. Dos Santos, the Brazilian bronze medalist in a super-fast final three years ago in Tokyo, will also be in the lineup.

“Completely crazy what I’ve done here,” Ducos said. “I’m not scared of anything. There are people around me racing really well and posting really good times, but I have to believe I can get a medal.”

Jamaica wins another medal ... in the field

Roje Stona won gold for Jamaica in the men’s discus, setting an Olympic record with a personal-best of 70 meters (229 feet, 8 inches) on his fourth attempt. That gives traditional sprint powerhouse Jamaica four medals in field events so far at the Paris Games — compared to just one on the track.

SAINT-DENIS, France — Arms pumping, legs churning, face twisted in a grimace, Quincy Hall kept coming even when he appeared hopelessly far behind.

Hall was a distant fourth place in the Olympic 400 meters final and he was running out of purple track between him and the finish line.

With 50 meters to go, he charged past fading former Olympic champion Kirani James. With 40 meters to go, he ran down Jereem Richards like the Trinidadian’s shoes were made of cement. Only pre-race favorite Matthew Hudson-Smith of Great Britain remained ahead of him, and Hall was reeling him in too.

“You can’t outrun a dog,” Hall said. “A dog is going to chase you forever.”

Hall captured Olympic gold on Wednesday night with a display of never-say-die resilience that won’t soon be forgotten. He overtook a stunned Hudson-Smith with 10 meters to go, leaned at the finish line and then stared at the video board to make sure what he thought he had just experienced was real.

NEVER doubt Quincy Hall. 😱



A EPIC comeback to win 400m GOLD! #ParisOlympics



📺 NBC & Peacock pic.twitter.com/qQJqfxrH9n — NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) August 7, 2024

Hall's winning time was a personal-best 43.40 seconds, the fourth fastest a man has ever run 400 meters. That was four-hundredths of a second faster than Hudson-Smith, now the fifth fastest in history over 400 meters.

Five of the eight men in the final clocked a sub-44-second time. Zambia's Muzala Samukonga ran a 43.74 to take bronze, his country’s second-ever medal and first since 1996.

When Hall was asked when he knew he’d win, he deadpanned, “As soon as they shot that gun.”

“You can’t get far enough,” he said matter-of-factly. “That’s what I’m known for. If you don’t get far enough away, I’m going to catch you every time.”

The grit that has become Hall’s trademark is a byproduct of the obstacle-laden path he’s taken to the top of his sport. Out of high school, he attended College of Sequoias, a California community college that Hall said had no student housing and no cafeteria. He worked two jobs to pay for tuition, food and a room to sleep at night.

“That’s where I feel like I found myself becoming the dog I say I am,” Hall said.

As a pro, Hall trains without partners — and sometimes by himself. Curtis Allen, the coach he met in junior college, will shout instructions to him by phone.

Hall, a former NCAA champion in the 400 hurdles at South Carolina, began his pro career focusing on that event. For two years, his best 400 hurdles times were fast, but not in the same class as the likes of Rai Benjamin, Karsten Warholms and Alison Dos Santos.

Earlier this summer, Hall told Olympics.com that he was “wasting time” running that event as a pro. On Wednesday night, he called switching his focus to the open 400 two years ago the “best decision of my life.”

As Hall earned a bronze medal at the World Championships in Budapest last year and ran his first sub-44-second times this summer, he developed a reputation for a fearsome kick. He had developed his stamina when he was younger. In high school, he ran everything from the 200, to the 400, to the 800, to the 1,500. Occasionally, he’d do them all at the same meet. In junior college, he’d win the 400, then 20 minutes later line up for the 400 hurdles.

Hudson-Smith said that his coaches had warned him about Hall’s kick over the last 50 meters of a race. As a result, as he put it, he ""got the f—- out,"" pushing the pace early and building a lead on the back stretch.

Blind to the rest of the field in lane eight on Wednesday night, Hall got out faster than he usually does, but it still wasn’t fast enough. The pace was so quick that Hall left himself a lot of ground to make up entering the final 100 meters.

As Hall ran, he said to himself, ""Get home, son."" He thought about all those grueling practices running by himself. He thought about putting himself through junior college. He thought about his two brothers who died young, his mom and his two young daughters.

Hudson-Smith admitted that he was caught off guard by Hall’s heroic last-gasp charge.

“I thought I had it,” Hudson-Smith said. “If you’re going to win, you’re going to have to take it from me. That’s exactly what he did.”

Last month, during a podcast appearance, Noah Lyles mulled which sprinters he’d include on his dream American 4x400-meter relay. Conspicuously absent from the selections that Lyles made was Hall, the man who won the U.S. title in the 400 at Olympic Trials this past June.

It was another dramatic comeback at the Stade de France for the American runners. For much of the race, it seemed impossible that Hall could win it. He spent most of the first 200 meters race visibly lagging in sixth place.

Even as he came around the bend, with just 100 meters remaining, he was still in fourth place. But he labored to catch up — finally overtaking Great Britain's Matthew Hudson-Smith just before the finish line.

""I don't give up, man. I just grit. I grind. I got determination. Anything I can think of that's gonna get me to that line, I think of it,"" Hall said afterward.

It wasn't that Hall had come off the block slowly, he said afterward. Instead, it was his competitors — especially Hudson-Smith, who won silver, and bronze medalist Muzala Samukonga of Zambia — who had opened the race at a torrid pace.

""I knew these guys were gonna get out and they were gonna come for blood early. They were going to go out and try to see who they could throw off the race,"" Hall said.

At last year's World Championships, it had been the Brit who bested Hall. ""I knew that the last 50 was going to determine who wins the Olympics,"" said Hudson-Smith after the race Wednesday. ""He got that one step on me in the last 50, and that's all she wrote.""

In the end, the three top times in the final were also the three fastest times recorded worldwide this year. And they now make up three of the seven fastest times ever recorded at an Olympics.

""Quincy's one hell of an athlete,"" said Hudson-Smith. ""I've been saying all year, 'If you're going to win, you've got to take it from me,' and that's exactly what he did.""

For decades, the U.S. had dominated the men's 400-meter race, winning seven Olympics in a row from 1984 through 2008. But since then, American runners had struggled in the event, placing third only once. Now, the gold is back in American hands, for the 20th time in Olympic history.

Hall's mark of 43.4 seconds was a personal best for the 26-year-old runner, and it was the fifth-fastest time ever recorded. Afterward, Hall removed his shoes and did a victory lap around the stadium, with an American flag draped over his shoulders.

Asked by a reporter at what point he knew he'd won, Hall answered confidently: ""As soon as they shot that gun, I knew I had it.""

The comeback has become a signature feature of the men of Team USA here at the Paris track and field events. Earlier in the week, sprinter Noah Lyles won gold in the 100-meter after spending the first 30 meters in last place. Then, in Tuesday's 1500-meter final, Cole Hocker seized an unlikely window of opportunity to snatch the win from the race's two favorites.

Hall once competed primarily as a hurdler. As a runner at the University of South Carolina, he was an NCAA champion in the 400-meter hurdles. Over the past two years, he has put his energy into the 400-meter race instead.

On Wednesday, he called the switch ""the best decision of my life.""

Hall will compete in one more event at this Olympics, the men's 4x400-meter relay race. The relay heats begin Friday, and the final is on Saturday."

Team USA leads the overall medal count and the gold medal tally at the 2024 Paris Olympics after a stellar day of competition on Wednesday.

U.S. sprinter Quincy Hall claimed gold in the 400-meter dash by way of a dramatic finish after trailing early in the race. He’s not the only one runner with a spectacular finish on the track to make the podium. Distance runner Kenneth Rooks put up a personal best in the men's 3,000-meter steeplechase to take silver in a shocking turn of events.

Meanwhile, Team USA picked up its second gold in as many days in wrestling after Sarah Hildebrandt defeated Cuba’s Yusneylys Guzmán, 3-0, in the 50-kilogram final. Cyclist Kristen Faulkner picked up her second gold medal of the Games after leading Team USA to its first-ever gold in the Women’s Team Pursuit.

The U.S. men’s water polo team and the U.S. women’s basketball team both advanced to the semifinals while the U.S. men’s volleyball team’s hopes of winning its first gold medal since 2008 ended with a quarterfinal loss to Poland.

USA figure skaters finally awarded their gold medals

PARIS — What started in disgrace exactly two and a half years ago in the cold and darkness of a dismal Beijing COVID winter ended Wednesday in delight at the foot of the Eiffel Tower under a sparkling Parisian summer sky.

The right team received the Olympic gold medal. This was the glorious end of the Kamila Valieva doping saga, the Russian scandal that forced the original medal ceremony to be canceled and triggered an infuriating series of international delays and appeals, finally ending with a Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruling less than two weeks ago that paved the way for Wednesday’s unique celebration.

As the Eiffel Tower rose over the shoulders of the nine American gold medalists — the entire 2022 U.S. Olympic figure skating team — families, friends and spectators gathered around a runway inside Champions Park, roaring with joy.

“Absolutely, it was definitely worth the wait,” U.S. team co-captain and ice dancer Madison Chock said, her 2022 gold medal around her neck. “I could never in my wildest dreams have imagined that we would get our Winter Olympic medal at the Summer Olympics in Paris let alone underneath the Eiffel Tower. Paris is one of my favorite cities ever since I was a little girl so this is a dream come true in many ways.” - Christine Brennan

Noah Lyles, Olympian girlfriend to celebrate anniversary after Games

SAINT-DENIS, France - Noah Lyles’ noteworthy summer extends off the track, too. Monday marks Lyles’ two-year anniversary with his girlfriend, Jamaican sprinter Junelle Bromfield. She qualified for the semifinals in the women’s 400, but didn’t advance to the final.

The two haven’t formally celebrated their anniversary – they are quite busy at the moment – but the fastest man in the world has “big plans” after he officially crosses the finish line.

“I got pretty big plans for a celebration. I’m trying to give her a little more time,"" Lyles said. ""Last year, we kind of went on a Noah Lyles campaign. Unfortunately, that cut into a lot of our vacation time, so I’m trying to be a better boyfriend and give her a lot more time for us to be a couple.” - Tyler Dragon

Ethiopia's Lamecha Girma stretchered off after steeplechase

Ethiopian runner Lamecha Girma was stretchered off the track at Stade de France on Wednesday during the men's 3,000-meter steeplechase final.

As the defending silver medalist in the event from the Tokyo Olympics was approaching a hurdle in the race, he tripped over the hurdle, resulting in a hard fall to the ground. He was placed in a neck brace and stretchered off by medical personnel. L'Equipe reported that Girma regained consciousness and was sent to the hospital for tests. - John Leuzzi

USA women's basketball team beats Nigeria

PARIS — The U.S. women's basketball team defeated Nigeria, 88-74, to advance to the semifinals at the 2024 Paris Olympics. A'ja Wilson led the U.S. in scoring with 20 points. Jackie Young added 15, Breanna Stewart put up 13 and Brittney Griner scored 11.

The Americans will face Australia in the semifinal on Aug. 9 for a spot in the gold medal game, which is on Aug. 11. They are going for their eighth consecutive gold medal and have not lost an Olympic game since 1992.

Andre De Grasse says allegations against coach were distraction

SAINT-DENIS, France — Canadian sprinter and defending Olympic 200 champion Andre De Grasse attempted to defend his title Wednesday while his coach Rana Reider is embroiled in controversy.

De Grasse finished third in the first heat of the men’s 200 semifinal and failed to qualify for the final. After the race, De Grasse said he was running at less than 100% after aggravating an old injury. When asked directly if the allegations of abuse levied against his coach were a distraction, he said, ""Yeah, of course.""

“I try to keep my head and stay mentally strong. It’s always tough not having your coach out there with you,” De Grasse told reporters. “He kind of leads you through these Games, and been with him all year. It’s definitely a tough one.” - Tyler Dragon

The U.S. is rolling with a 76-48 lead through three quarters. Four players have scored nine points or more, led by Jackie Young’s 15. And every player has scored at least one point, and the Americans are shooting 60% from the field. It’s safe to say Australia is counting on playing the U.S. at this point.

USA women's basketball vs. Nigeria score at halftime

The Americans lead 52-33 at halftime in the women's basketball quarterfinals. They shot 59% from the field, 36% from 3. Breanna Stewart led the U.S. with 13 points, A'ja Wilson putting up 10 and Brittney Griner adding 5.

US wrestler Sarah Hildebrandt wins gold medal

PARIS — Over the past four years, Sarah Hildebrandt has established herself as one of the best wrestlers in the world in her weight class. She won a bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics. Then silver at the 2021 world championships. Then another bronze, at worlds. Then another.

Yet on Wednesday night, Hildebrandt wasn't one of the best. She was the best.

And the Olympic gold medal draped around her neck was proof.

Hildebrandt gave Team USA its second wrestling gold medal in as many nights (following Amit Elor) at the 2024 Paris Olympics, defeating Yusneylys Guzmán of Cuba, 3-0, in the 50-kilogram final at Champ-de-Mars Arena. It is the 30-year-old's first senior title at the Olympics or world championships – the gold medal she's been chasing after disappointment in Tokyo. - Tom Schad

Kenneth Rooks wins silver in steeplechase

SAINT-DENIS, France - American Kenneth Rooks, ranked 24th in the world in the men's 3,000-meter steeplechase, shocked the field with a silver medal Wednesday, clocking a personal-best 8:06.41. After 1,000 meters, Rooks trailed 11 racers, and was running just ninth after 2,000 meters. From there, however, Rooks found another gear and passed the entire field to take the lead with a few hundred meters remaining.

He was overtaken by gold medalist Soufiane El Bakkali of Morocco (8:06.05), and Rooks barely beat bronze medalist Abraham Kibiwot of Kenya (8:06.47). Rooks, the only American in the race, earned Team USA's first men's steeplechase medal since Evan Jager won silver in the 2016 Rio Games. - Chase Goodbread

Jourdan Delacruz falls short of medal in women's weightlifting

PARIS — U.S. women’s weightlifter Jourdan Delacruz significantly improved on her finish from the 2021 Tokyo Olympics but fell short of a medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics Wednesday.

Competing in the 49 kilograms weight class, Delacruz placed fifth, lifting a combined weight of 195 kilograms, which is nearly 430 pounds – 185 pounds in snatch and 244 pounds in the clean and jerk.

Delacruz, who won bronze at the 2023 world championship, finished last in Tokyo after she unable to complete a lift for the clean and jerk. She had no problem completing her lift in Paris.

""I’m not 100% sure yet, but I do think this may be one of my last competitions,"" Delacruz said. ""It was just a moment to thank the barbell for everything that it’s taught me and for the person I’ve become in the last 10 years. It was just a moment to acknowledge the sport. Aside from what happened on stage, that barbell has taught me a lot.

""I wish it went better. I had higher expectations. I thought I’d be on that podium today, but I’m actually surprisingly not as sad as I thought I’d be. I think that’s just because my family is here, and I’ve had such an amazing Olympic experience so far. This is something I’ll remember forever.”

China’s Hou Zhizui won gold (206 kilograms or 454 pounds) and set an Olympic record in clean and jerk, lifting 117 kilograms (258 pounds). Romania’s Mihaela Valentina Cambei earned silver and Thailand’s Surodchana Khambao took bronze. – Jeff Zillgitt

Quincy Hall wins men's 400m in thrilling finish

SAINT-DENIS, France – Take that, Noah Lyles.

United States runner Quincy Hall won the gold medal in the men’s 400-meter dash Wednesday – besting Great Britain's Matthew Hudson-Smith and Zambia's Muzuala Samukonga and posting a time of 43.40 to set a personal best.

Team USA wins artistic swimming medal for first time in 20 years

SAINT-DENIS, France — Team USA artistic swimmers won their first Olympic medal in the team competition in 20 years, winning silver behind China with gold (996.1389) and ahead of Spain with bronze (900.7319). They entered Wednesday night’s team acrobatic routine and overall final ranked second behind the gold medalists and held on to finish second with a total score of 914.3421.

Team USA’s most recent Olympic medal in the team competition was bronze at the 2004 Athens Games.

The last time Russia (or athletes competing under the Russian Olympic Committee) did not win Olympic gold in artistic swimming’s team competition was at the 1996 Atlanta Games, when Team USA finished first in the event’s Olympic debut.

The team competition is broken into three routines: the team technical routine, the team free routine and the team acrobatic routine. Following the acrobatic routine Wednesday night, the scores from all three routines are added together to determine the final rankings.

After the team technical routine Monday, Team USA was ranked fourth (282.7567) behind China, Spain and Japan. But the Americans stunned in the team free routine Tuesday, finishing second (360.2688) behind China and setting themselves up to contend for their first Olympic medal in 20 years. – Michelle R. Martinelli

PARIS — Standing outside the park venue Wednesday after American Tom Schaar won the silver medal, skateboarding legend Tony Hawk said he’s been pushing as hard as he can for more forms of skateboarding to be included in the 2028 Los Angeles Games.

“It’s LA,” he said. “It’s what people consider the birthplace of modern skateboarding. We should celebrate all styles of skateboarding.”

That includes, of course, his hope that the International Olympic Committee will add a vert competition – the style of skateboarding most associated with Hawk’s tricks.

“I’ve been trying my best to have words with them at every turn here,” Hawk said. – Dan Wolken

There are many things athletes look forward to when hanging out in the Olympic Village.

Unfortunately for one British swimmer, food isn't one of them.

“The catering isn’t good enough for the level the athletes are expected to perform. We need to give the best we possibly can,” Adam Peaty, who won a silver medal in the 100-meter breaststroke, said to Inews this week.

Peaty said in other Olympic stops, like Tokyo and Rio, the food was excellent.

“I like my fish and people are finding worms in the fish. It’s just not good enough,"" Peaty said. “The standard, we’re looking at the best of the best in the world, and we’re feeding them not the best.""

American CJ Allen runs out of gas, fails to qualify for 400m hurdle finals

SAINT-DENIS, France — Rai Benjamin cruised through the men’s 400-meter semifinals to Wednesday to secure his spot in the Friday-night finals.

Benjamin won his heat – almost too easily – with a time of 47.85 second. His best time this season is 46.46 seconds.

During heats, Benjamin jogged the end of his run – conserving fuel for the races to come. The defending Olympic silver medalist in the event won a gold in Tokyo as part of the men’s 4x400-meter relay team.

Benjamin took his time out of the gates but dialed it up at about the one-third mark and essentially jogged the straightaway once again.

CJ Allen of the USA took an early lead into the straightaway during the second heat. But he ran out of steam and finished fourth. Allen, the American indoor 400-meter record-holder, did not make the final with a time of 48.44.

American Trevor Bassitt, the eighth-ranked 400-meter hurdler per the world rankings, also finished fourth in the first heat and didn’t make the finals either.

Norway’s Karsten Warholm, who set the world record in the event at the Tokyo Olympics, won the first heat with a time of 47.67 seconds. Warholm also had the fastest time during heats.

Frenchman Clement Ducos took second in the first heat to make the finals, much to the delight of the crowd at Stade de France. – Chris Bumbaca

She quite didn't make her way to the podium, but either way, French track and field athlete Alice Finot was the one giving out hardware.

After she set a European record but just missed out on a medal Tuesday in the 3000-meter steeplechase, Finot went over to her partner, Bruno Martínez Bargiela, and got down on one knee to propose. But, instead of a ring, she unhooked an Olympic pin that she wore during the race and offered it to him as they embraced to the cheering of the crowd at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis. – Lorenzo Reyes

SAINT-QUENTIN-EN-YVELINES, France – The more celebrated Nelly Korda becomes as a golfer, the more noticeable it is when she seeks to experience life as something else.

It’s all amplified for her. The tournaments in which she doesn’t play. The interviews she doesn’t give. This idea that it’s her responsibility, more than any peer, to expand the LPGA Tour’s popularity.

She may be a reluctant sports star at times, but she's the biggest one going in the women's game. And it’s not that the world’s No. 1 player is burned out on golf, she explained after Wednesday’s opening round at the Paris Olympics. It’s that she doesn’t want to become burned out.

“As important as it is to sometimes grind it out,” Korda said, “it's also important to just put your clubs away and just be a regular human being. ... It feels nice when you're in a groove, but when you play under pressure and you're in the final group and you feel the emotions that you do, it takes a toll on you mentally.” – Gentry Estes

Team USA snares elusive gold in women's team pursuit

SAINT-QUENTIN-EN-YVELINES, France — The U.S. finally has its elusive gold medal in women’s team pursuit.

The U.S. team of Kristen Faulkner, Chloe Dygert, Lily Williams and Jennifer Valente beat New Zealand in the gold medal match of the cycling race Wednesday at the National Velodrome, finishing in 4:04.306.

New Zealand was about 6/10ths of a second behind in 4:04.927, while Great Britain beat Italy for the bronze.

The U.S. is one of the world’s leading powers in team pursuit having medaled in the event in each of the first three Olympics the sport was a part of in 2012, 2016 and 2020. But until this year, the American had never struck gold.

On Wednesday, the U.S. beat Great Britain in a tight first-round heat before nipping New Zealand in the final.

Dygert and Valente also were a part of the U.S.’s silver medal-winning team in 2016 and the group that took in 2020. Dygert also won Olympic bronze in the time trial in road cycling this year, while Faulkner heads home with two golds in her first Olympics after winning the road race on Sunday.

The U.S. won silver in team pursuit at the 2021 Tokyo Olympic Games.

Great Britain also has medaled every year team pursuit has been part of the Olympics. Just three other countries have a medal in the sport: Germany, Canada and now New Zealand. – Dave Birkett

Katie Moon, Noah Lyles, Kenny Bednarek and others are in action this afternoon as Olympic track and field events continue. USA TODAY Sports will provide live updates, highlights and more for all of Wednesday's happenings.

PARIS — A gold medal escaped the U.S. men’s volleyball team again.

After taking a 2-1 set lead against world No. 1 Poland in the semifinals, the U.S. dropped the final two sets and Poland advanced to the gold-medal game with a 25-23, 25-27, 14-25, 25-23, 15-13 victory in five thrilling sets Wednesday in an energetic, music-filled environment at South Paris Arena.

Poland will play the winner of Italy-France for gold, and the U.S. will play the loser for bronze.

In the fourth set, the U.S. had a 16-14 lead but could not hold off Poland for the victory and fell short of the gold medal game. Poland carried momentum from its fourth-set win into a strong fifth-set performance. The U.S. trailed 14-10 and made it 14-13 in the fifth set before Poland closed out the game.

In Paris, the U.S. men were 3-0 in preliminary play and beat rival Brazil in the quarterfinals.

The U.S. won bronze at the 2016 Rio Olympics but finished 10th at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The U.S. hasn’t won gold since the 2008 Beijing Olympics. – Jeff Zillgitt

PARIS — Dallas Oberholzer came to Paris knowing he would finish last in the men’s park skateboarding competition. He’s 49 years old, for goodness sakes, competing in a sport ruled by Gen Z. He’s also from South Africa, a country where skateboarding has no infrastructure or funding. He’s spent decades traveling the world, funding this journey himself, often barely scraping by in search of the next good vibe.

Before the sport went corporate, before the Olympics, before Tony Hawk and Shaun White, that’s what skateboarding was really all about.

But being here hasn’t been all bad. Even as he approaches his 50th birthday he’s still growing, still learning. He even went to visit an osteopath in the Olympic Village the other day because, well, the knees don’t feel so good these days coming off the board. – Dan Wolken

USA adds skateboarding park silver medal

PARIS — American Tom Schaar can add Olympic medalist to his long list of skateboarding accomplishments.

The youngest-ever X Games gold medalist and the first skateboarder to successfully pull off a trick with 1,080 degrees of rotation in competition, Schaar took silver at the men’s park competition on Wednesday.

Though he had two successful runs, he slightly trailed Australia’s Keegan Palmer. With one more chance to post the best score, Schaar upped the ante but came off the board toward the end of his run, ensuring the gold medal for Palmer.

Palmer’s winning run was scored 93.11, just barely ahead of Schaar’s 92.23. Brazil’s Augusto Akio took the bronze medal.

Palmer also won the first-ever Olympic gold in park three years ago when he was just 14 years old.

Tate Carew, Team USA’s other medal hope, finished fifth.

This event concludes the skateboarding competition for Paris. Team USA will have to wait four more years to Los Angeles to take home its first skateboarding gold. – Dan Wolken

PARIS — A female wrestler from India was disqualified from her gold-medal bout at the Paris Olympics on Wednesday morning after weighing in about 100 grams above the maximum limit for her weight class.

For context: That's about 0.22 pounds or 3.5 ounces − roughly the weight of a bar of soap.

The shocking news not only knocked Vinesh Phogat out of the 50-kilogram Olympic final against American Sarah Hildebrandt, where she would've been guaranteed to win no worse than a silver medal. Under international wrestling rules, Phogat's failure to make weight resulted in a full disqualification. She will technically finish dead last. – Tom Schad

PARIS — For the first time in 40 years, an American man has won an Olympic medal in weightlifting.

Hampton Morris, a 20-year-old who trains primarily out of the garage at his family's Georgia home, ended the decadeslong drought by winning bronze at the 2024 Paris Games on Wednesday.

Morris was sitting in fifth place after his snatch but he leapfrogged into medal position thanks to the second lift of competition, clean and jerk, where he is the reigning world-record holder in his weight class. Between the two lifts, the 135-pound Morris hoisted a combined weight of 298 kilograms, which is about 657 pounds. – Tom Schad

Team USA women's springboard divers fail to qualify for semifinals

Both Team USA divers Sarah Bacon and Alison Gibson failed to qualify for the women’s 3-meter springboard top-18 semifinals after finishing 19th and 28th, respectively, in Wednesday’s prelims.

Gibson had a scary start to her prelims and struggled to recover from a rough zero-score first-round dive, finishing with a total score of 198.30.

A two-time Olympian, Gibson’s first dive was an inward 2 1/2 somersaults in the pike position. But mid-air at the end of her final rotation, the 25-year-old diver smacked her feet on the board and fell into the water. Thankfully for her, she only hit her feet, and she was able to continue competing. But it was a frightening moment that left at least her right foot a little cut up and bloody.

Gibson received zeros across the board for the dive, essentially leaving her to try to qualify for the semifinals in her only Olympic event on four dives when everyone else had scores for five.

Meanwhile, Bacon’s best of her five rounds was her first dive, earning a score of 64.50 off an inward 2 1/2 somersaults in the pike position with a 3.0 degree of difficulty. But a low-scoring third round ensured it would be difficult for her to qualify for the semifinals, finishing with a score of 264.40.

Bacon, a 27-year-old first-time Olympian, previously won silver at the Paris Olympics in the women’s synchronized 3-meter springboard with partner Kassidy Cook.

China’s Chen Yiwen qualified first with a score of 356.40, while Australia’s Maddison Keeney was second (337.35) and Mexico’s Aranza Vazquez Montano was third (321.75). – Michelle R. Martinelli

51-year-old Andy Macdonald puts on Tony Hawk-approved skateboard showing

If you grew up on the X-Games, ""Tony Hawk's Pro Skater"" or maybe even picked up a board yourself, Andy Macdonald is a name that conjures up some nostalgia.

The very same and now 51-year-old skateboarder qualified for the 2024 Paris Olympics and participated in the men's park preliminaries on Wednesday. Fellow skateboarding legend Tony Hawk was in attendance, and clapped his hands and pumped his fists in approval of Macdonald's run.

Macdonald will finish out his run with a 77.66 for 18th place in the heat. He wouldn't make the final, but he would make plenty of skateboarding fans smile.

What were you doing during the summer when you were 11 years old?

Chances are you were not competing on the world's biggest stage at the Olympics trying to win a medal, but that's exactly what 11-year-old skateboarder Zheng Haohao is doing. And to think, she only took up the sport five years ago, soaring through the rankings to earn her spot at the Olympics.

Zheng is representing China during the 2024 Paris Games and was the youngest athlete competing, in becoming her country's youngest Olympian. She doesn't turn 12 until Sunday and is currently 26th in the World Skateboarding Ranking. − Scooby Axon

PARIS — The track and field bromance that took center stage at the Tokyo Olympics is once again in the spotlight three years later.

Gianmarco Tamberi of Italy and Qatar's Mutaz Barshim shared the gold medal in the high jump at the last Summer Games. The pair, whom are adversaries on paper but also friends thanks to nearly 15 years of competing against one another in the same meets, decided to share the gold rather than do a jump-off to decide a winner – taking advantage of a loophole in the World Athletics rulebook.

The reaction was priceless, with Tamberi leaping onto Barshim and wrapping himself around the Qatari.

On Wednesday, during high jump qualifying, the duo was back at it in the heartwarming sense. Barshim began his run for liftoff over the bar but pulled up lame and immediately grabbed for his left calf. Tamberi was the first person to Barshim's side on the ground and helped him stretch the calf.

The extent of Barshim's injury is unknown, but he did qualify for the final by clearing 2.27 meters. − Chris Bumbaca

PARIS – Some skateboarding experts thought the Americans had a chance to sweep the podium in the men’s park skateboarding event, but only two of the three Team USA members advanced to the finals that will be held later Wednesday.

Tate Carew, a 19-year old from San Diego, came into the Paris Games ranked No. 1 in the world in park and didn’t have to sweat too much as his best score of 90.42 was enough for fourth in qualifying, comfortably within the top-eight needed to make the finals.

Tom Schaar, a 24-year old from Malibu, Calif., who made his X Games debut when he was just 12, posted the second-highest qualifying score at 92.05. This is his first Olympics.

The big upset was Gavin Bottger, ranked No. 3 in the world, failing to reach the finals. Bottger, 17, only finished one error-free run in his three attempts. His score of 86.95 looked like it might be enough to hold up for the eighth spot, but he got passed by skaters in the third head and dropped below the qualifying line to 10th place.

The Americans will have to deal with No.2-ranked Keegan Palmer from Australia, who posted the top qualifying score, and three strong Brazilian skaters if they want to make the podium.

Alex Sorgente, who was born in Florida but has dual citizenship through his father, is competing for Italy and also made the finals. − Dan Wolken

SAINT-DENIS, France — Some athletes adopt the mindset that they don’t lose, they learn. Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson is one of those athletes.

Thompson, who still owns the best 100 time in the world this year, came into the Paris Olympics as a gold-medal favorite. But he came in second behind Noah Lyles by five-thousandths of a second in the most competitive men's 100 final in Olympics history during which all eight runners finished under 10 seconds for the first time ever, according to World Athletics.

The race was so close that Lyles thought Thompson had won.

""I did think Thompson had it at the end,"" Lyles said. ""I went up to him when we were waiting and I said, 'I think you got that one big dog.'""

Thompson told USA TODAY Sports, that he wasn’t sure who had won immediately after the race.

""Honestly, I wasn’t sure if I won. I knew it was close between first and second,"" Thompson said. ""I know I cleared the person on my exact right, and I saw I was in front of the person on my left. But I wasn’t too sure if I got it. It was that close.""

Nobody inside Stade de France knew who won until the photo view results were displayed on the video board seconds after the race. − Tyler Dragon

US women advance to gold medal in team pursuit

SAINT-QUENTIN-EN-YVELINES, France – The U.S. is guaranteed to keep its medal streak alive in women’s team pursuit.

The U.S. team of Kristen Faulkner, Chloe Dygert, Lily Williams and Jennifer Valente beat Great Britain in the third heat of the first round at the National Velodrome on Wednesday to advance to the gold medal match later today.

The U.S finished the 4,000-meter race in 4:04.629 and will meet New Zealand in the finals. The time was just short of Germany's world record (4:04.242) set at the Tokyo Olympics.

Great Britain will race against Italy for the bronze after finishing in 4:04.908.

New Zealand finished its heat Wednesday in 4:04.818.

Both the U.S. and Great Britain have won medals in women’s team pursuit every year since it started as an Olympic sport in 2012. The U.S. won silver in 2012 and 2016, and bronze in 2020.

Dygert and Valente were on the 2016-20 teams and can tie Great Britain’s Laura Trott-Kenny as the only three-time medalists in the sport. − David Birkett

Nelly Korda looks to defend her Olympic gold medal

Nelly Korda, the women's world No.1 player and defending gold medallist, headlines a strong field in Paris. But it's Lilia Vu of the US who has stormed atop the leaderboard (-3) through nine holes at Le Golf National. She is tied with Celine Boutier of France for the lead. Korda is even par thru 17 holes.

PARIS — An Australian athlete has been taken into custody by French authorities for attempting to buy cocaine, according to reports.

The Paris Public Prosecutor's Office told 9News Australia an unidentified member of the men's field hockey team was involved in an alleged ""cocaine transaction at the foot of a building in the city's 9th arrondissement"" Tuesday. Police officers witnessed the incident, according to the 9News report.

The Australian Olympic Committee confirmed an arrest to Reuters but did not confirm the player's identity. − Chris Bumbaca

American runner shows grit to earn a spot in the 800m final

SAINT-DENIS, France - With a time of 1:46.15, Hobbs Kessler of Team USA finished third in his heat to advance to the semifinals of the men's 800-meter event at the Paris Olympics' track and field venue at Stade de France. In a preliminary that required a top-three finish to automatically qualify, Kessler found himself in fourth place and trailing Italy's Simone Barontini halfway through the race, but overtook Barontini to earn the qualification.

Also qualifying was American Bryce Hoppel, who opened an early lead in the event's final heat and finished second with a time of 1:45.24. Kessler and Hoppel will compete in semifinals Friday morning, and if they advance, in medal finals Saturday night.

Americans who qualified in other events at the morning session included Shelby McEwen (men's high jump), Alaysha Johnson, Masai Russell and Grace Stark (women's 100m hurdles), and Graham Blanks and Grant Fisher (men's 5,000m). − Charles Goodbread

PARIS — The term GOAT is so often tossed around in sports. Not always carelessly, but frequently enough that it’s diminished the original meaning behind the greatest of all time acronym.

But in some instances, GOAT truly applies, and few would disagree that Michael Phelps deserves the label. GOAT swimmer. GOAT Olympian.

There will never be another — at least not in this lifetime.

Over the years, especially since Phelps retired following the 2016 Rio Games, many have been deemed “the next Michael Phelps.” At one point, it was American Caeleb Dressel. At the Paris Olympics, it’s France’s Léon Marchand.

However, there’s a huge difference between a superstar and “the next Michael Phelps,” and Dressel agreed, calling Phelps “not even a once-in-a-lifetime” swimmer but “maybe once in a, I don’t know, end-of-the-world type guy.” − Michelle Martinelli

American sport climber advances to men's final

American sport climber Colin Duffy has advanced to the men's boulder-and-lead finals set for Friday at the Paris Olympics.

Duffy, a 20-year-old from Colorado, entered the competition Wednesday in 11th place after the boulder semifinals on Monday. His strong performance in lead lifted him into seventh place overall, and the top eight climbers qualified for the finals.

“Just very proud,’’ said Duffy, who finished seventh at the Tokyo Games in 2021 in sport climbing’s Olympic debut. “I wanted to go out and give a climb that I could be proud of and I was able to do that.’’

Fellow American Jesse Grupper, a 27-year-older from New York making his first appearance at the Olympics, finished 18th among the 20 climbers in the boulder-and-lead semifinals.

Also, Poland’s Aleksandra Miroslaw won the gold medal in the women’s speed climb while China’s Lijuan Deng took silver and Poland’s Aleksandra Kaluka took bronze Wednesday. American Emma Hunt reached the quarterfinals but slipped during her heat and failed to advance to the semifinals. – Josh Peter

Greek pole vaulter out of Olympics after doping test

Greek pole vaulter Eleni-Klaoudia Polak has been provisionally suspended after testing positive at the Paris Olympics, according to the IOC.

Polak, 27, competed in qualifying, clearing a jump of 13 feet, 9 ¼ inches but didn’t advance to the final. Paris was her second Olympics as she didn’t make it out of qualifying at the Tokyo Games.

At the world championships, Polak’s best result was 22nd at the 2022 worlds held in Eugene, Oregon. According to her bio on the IOC web site, she took up the sport at age 14 after a coach saw her training in gymnastics and encouraged her to try pole vault.

Carson Tyler earns spot in men's 3m springboard diving finals

Team USA diver Carson Tyler improved significantly from his prelims performance and finished seventh in Wednesday’s men’s 3-meter springboard semifinals, advancing to the final among the top-12 divers.

Tyler, a 20-year-old first-time Olympian, finished with a score of 438.00 – his prelims score was 389.80 – and will try to make the podium in the final set for Thursday. His highest-scoring dive came in the fifth and sixth rounds, the final two – first a reverse 3 ½ somersaults in the tuck position with a 3.5 degree of difficulty, followed by a reverse 1 ½ somersaults with 3 ½ twists in the free position with a 3.5 degree of difficulty – earning him scores of 78.75.

Two-time Olympic diver Andrew Capobianco, 24, placed 15th with a final score of 407.65, missing the cut for the final. The 24-year-old American struggled through the semifinals, but he earned his best score of 83.60 on his sixth-round dive: a forward 4 ½ somersaults in the tuck position with a degree of difficulty of 3.8.

At the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, Capobianco finished 10th in the men’s 3-meter springboard, but he earned a silver medal in the men’s synchronized 3-meter springboard competition.

The divers to beat in the men’s 3-meter springboard are the three defending Olympic medalists from the 2021 Tokyo Games: Xie Siyi, who won gold, Wang Zongyuan with silver and Jack Laugher with bronze.

Wang and Xie, representing China, enter finals ranked first (537.85) and second (505.85), respectively, while Great Britain’s Laugher is ranked third (467.05).

American duo move on to men's 5000m finals

SAINT-DENIS, France — Americans Graham Blanks and Grant Fisher advanced to the medal finals of the men's 5,000-meter race at the Stade de France track and field venue of the Paris Games on Wednesday. Blanks made up some critical ground over the last 1,000 meters to finish sixth in a time of 14:09.06 in Heat 1. He made his move just early enough to avoid a calamitous tumble that occurred right behind him, as one racer tripped, fell, and triggered falls for three others.

The top eight in each of two heats qualified for the finals, and Blanks was running 10th after 4,000 meters. In Heat 2, Fisher finished fourth with a time of 13:52.44 to give Team USA two runners in a medal-finals field of 16. American Abdihamid Nur was in fourth place after 4,000 meters, but a late fall cost him a last-place finish of 14:15.00. — Chase Goodbread

Three Americans advance to semis for women's 100m hurdles

There will be a heavy Team USA presence Friday in the semifinals of the women's 100 hurdles event at the Paris Games' Stade de France venue for track and field. Three of four Americans competing earned automatic qualifications in the preliminaries on Wednesday, including Alaysha Johnson, Masai Russell and Grace Stark.

Johnson placed second in Heat 1 with a 12.61 clocking, while Russell tied for the win in Heat 3 (12.53, same as the Netherlands' Nadine Visser). Stark ran in the final heat and posted a 12.72 time to finish third.

Team USA's Ebony Morrison ran a 12.93 to finish sixth in Heat 2.

Medal finals in the event are scheduled for Saturday. — Chase Goodbread

India's Vinesh Phogat out of gold medal bout vs. American after failing to make weight

Indian wrestler Vinesh Phogat was disqualified before the women's 50kg freestyle final at the Paris Olympics on Wednesday after failing to make weight, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) said.

Phogat had been set to lock horns with Sarah Hildebrandt of the United States for the gold medal.

""It is with regret that the Indian contingent shares news of the disqualification of Vinesh Phogat from the women's wrestling 50kg class,"" the IOA said in a statement.

""Despite the best efforts by the team through the night, she weighed in a few grams over 50kg this morning.""

The disqualification means Phogat will not receive a medal.

PARIS — If the United States is about to relinquish its stranglehold on Olympic men’s basketball this week, they’ve nicely hidden the plot twist.

Watching this U.S. team at full force inspires nostalgia for simpler NBA times, back in the days you knew before the season started that Golden State and Cleveland were going to be in the Finals. It also keeps a thought in the back of your mind: This is an end more than a beginning. — Gentry Estes

LYON, France — Exactly one year ago, the U.S. women’s national team was at the lowest point in its illustrious history, knocked out of the World Cup in the quarterfinals in what was the team’s earliest exit ever at a major international tournament.

On Tuesday, they reached the gold medal match at the 2024 Paris Olympics, where they will face Brazil, which beat Spain 4-2 to advance.

In exactly 366 days — 2024 is a leap year, you know — the Americans have gone from the despair of that shocking exit to playing for another major title. What a difference a year makes. — Nancy Armour

Quincy Hall comes from behind to win gold in the Olympic men's 400-meter race.,https://www.kccu.org/u-s/2024-08-07/quincy-hall-wins-the-olympic-400-meter-race-bringing-gold-back-to-the-u-s,"Updated August 07, 2024 at 18:08 PM ET

SAINT-DENIS, France — The American runner Quincy Hall won the men's 400-meter final at the 2024 Summer Olympics, reestablishing a U.S. claim on the event it once dominated.

It was another dramatic comeback at the Stade de France for the American runners. For much of the race, it seemed impossible that Hall could win it. He spent most of the first 200 meters race visibly lagging in sixth place.

Even as he came around the bend, with just 100 meters remaining, he was still in fourth place. But he labored to catch up — finally overtaking Great Britain's Matthew Hudson-Smith just before the finish line.

""I don't give up, man. I just grit. I grind. I got determination. Anything I can think of that's gonna get me to that line, I think of it,"" Hall said afterward.

It wasn't that Hall had come off the block slowly, he said afterward. Instead, it was his competitors — especially Hudson-Smith, who won silver, and bronze medalist Muzala Samukonga of Zambia — who had opened the race at a torrid pace.

""I knew these guys were gonna get out and they were gonna come for blood early. They were going to go out and try to see who they could throw off the race,"" Hall said.

At last year's World Championships, it had been the Brit who bested Hall. ""I knew that the last 50 was going to determine who wins the Olympics,"" said Hudson-Smith after the race Wednesday. ""He got that one step on me in the last 50, and that's all she wrote.""

In the end, the three top times in the final were also the three fastest times recorded worldwide this year. And they now make up three of the seven fastest times ever recorded at an Olympics.

""Quincy's one hell of an athlete,"" said Hudson-Smith. ""I've been saying all year, 'If you're going to win, you've got to take it from me,' and that's exactly what he did.""

For decades, the U.S. had dominated the men's 400-meter race, winning seven Olympics in a row from 1984 through 2008. But since then, American runners had struggled in the event, placing third only once. Now, the gold is back in American hands, for the 20th time in Olympic history.

Hall's mark of 43.4 seconds was a personal best for the 26-year-old runner, and it was the fifth-fastest time ever recorded. Afterward, Hall removed his shoes and did a victory lap around the stadium, with an American flag draped over his shoulders.

Asked by a reporter at what point he knew he'd won, Hall answered confidently: ""As soon as they shot that gun, I knew I had it.""

The comeback has become a signature feature of the men of Team USA here at the Paris track and field events. Earlier in the week, sprinter Noah Lyles won gold in the 100-meter after spending the first 30 meters in last place. Then, in Tuesday's 1500-meter final, Cole Hocker seized an unlikely window of opportunity to snatch the win from the race's two favorites.

Hall once competed primarily as a hurdler. As a runner at the University of South Carolina, he was an NCAA champion in the 400-meter hurdles. Over the past two years, he has put his energy into the 400-meter race instead.

On Wednesday, he called the switch ""the best decision of my life.""

He did just that on Wednesday, racing his best time in the event and taking home the gold medal.

In a highly competitive race that came down to a difference of .04 seconds, Hall finished with a personal best time of 43.40 seconds, good enough for first place.

Great Britain's Matthew Hudson-Smith finished just behind Hall with a time of 43.44 for the silver medal and Zambia's Muzala Samukonga took the bronze with a time of 43.74.

Hall, 26, was a favorite to medal in the event after earning a world bronze medal in 2023 and winning the title at the U.S. Olympic Trials in June.

USA's Michael Norman was also a favorite for the podium but he was flagged for improper contact and finished last with a time of 45.62. Chris Bailey finished in sixth with a time of 44.58 seconds.

In the trials in June, Hall finished first with a time of 44.17 seconds, followed by Norman with 44.31 seconds.

Quincy Hall became the latest American to electrify Olympic track and field with an out-of-nowhere comeback, sprinting from far behind in the 400 meters Wednesday night to reel in three runners and capture another gold medal for the U.S.

Hall, buried in fourth place as the sprinters rounded the last bend, outran the runner on his outside, then two more to the inside to cross the line in 43.40 seconds, the fourth-fastest time ever. He dropped to the track to do snow angels to celebrate.

Hall beat Britain’s Matthew Hudson-Smith by .04 seconds — that’s now the fifth-fastest time in history — and Muzala Samukonga of Zambia finished third.

Hall is the first American since LaShawn Merritt in 2008 to capture gold in the one-lap race. His victory came an evening after American Cole Hocker came from far behind late to beat the favorites in the men’s 1500.

Add in Noah Lyles, whose only lead in his 100-meter thriller came when he crossed the finish line, and these Americans are turning into quite the comeback kids.

The win came about an hour after Noah Lyles advanced to the final of the 200 meters despite finishing second to Letsile Tebogo in his semifinal. Lyles will race for the gold medal on Thursday.

Hall, the 26-year-old who breeds dogs and loves riding horses, looked out of the running in a race that’s all about pace and, more often than not, the problem is going too fast too soon.

He was 5 meters behind Hudson-Smith and 2012 champion Kirani James, both to his left, and as they rounded the final curve, and was making up ground on Jareem Richards to his outside for what looked like would be a good battle for bronze.

By the end, James and Richards were afterthoughts, Hall was thrusting his chest at the line to beat the Brit and Samukonga had also come from out of nowhere to take third.

Former College of the Sequoias standout Quincy Hall drove that mentality to the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Representing the United States, Hall placed first in the men's track 400-meter race on Wednesday to bring home an Olympic gold medal.

Hall competed on the COS track and field team for two seasons (2017-18) and was a two-time California state junior college champion in the 400-meter and 400-meter hurdles. He also helped the Giants win the 2017 California Community College Athletic Association men's track and field team championship.

COS hosted a watch party for Hall inside the Ponderosa building on the Giants' campus. More than 100 COS supporters cheered on Hall, including COS athletic director Brent Davis and Giants track and field coach Kenny Jackson.

Hall won the gold medal with a personal-best time of 43.40 seconds, besting Great Britain's Matthew Hudson-Smith and Zambia's Muzuala Samukonga.

The 2018 COS grad trailed early but reeled off a spectacular straightaway sprint allowing him to run down Hudson-Smith.

As Hall crossed the finish line, COS supporters erupted into jubilation, including college president Brent Calvin and Jackson.

""Words can't express a feeling like this,"" Jackson said. ""I just thank God for allowing me to kind of be a part of this journey with Quincy. Words can't express a feeling like this. It's unbelievable.""

More:COS sprinter Quincy Hall has Olympic aspirations

Jackson has been the COS track and field coach since 2018.

During Hall's sophomore season with Jackson in 2018, the Missouri native repeated as the state's junior college 400-meter and 400-meter hurdles champion.

Hall went on to run at South Carolina after COS.

""It was a privilege,"" Jackson said. ""It's an honor to be a part of it — to be able to coach him, train him and mentor him. I'm still very connected with him. We're like friends more than mentor, [coach].""

Magic was in the air on the COS campus as Hall captured an Olympic gold medal.

""It was an unbelievable experience to watch that race, but even more, is how he did it,"" Davis said. ""I think coming around that last turn, he was maybe fifth or sixth place, but he came back and took the lead with maybe a yard to go so that was unbelievable.""

A former COS track athlete competing at the Olympics is nothing new.

Deajah Stevens ran for the U.S. at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro and finished seventh in the women's 200-meter race.

Tulare native Richard Torrez Jr. enrolled at COS after winning a silver medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

What's it like to see Hall excel on the world stage?

""Absolutely thrilled,"" Davis said. ""One of the best parts of working with young people is you get to see them when they come in, especially at this level, 18-, 19- years old, now he's 26, you get to watch him grow up and you know all the hard work he's put in behind the scenes, and everything he put into it, and to see him get rewarded like that on the biggest stage on the planet, is just unreal."""

American sprinter Quincy Hall was in fifth place halfway through the men's 400m final on Wednesday before a late burst of speed pushed him into gold medal position at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

The official split times for the race showed how Hall orchestrated his comeback by running the final 100 meters in 11.59 seconds.

Hall is the first American man to win the 400-meter race since LaShawn Merritt claimed gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

Hall was at no point any higher in the pack than fourth place prior to the 300-meter mark.

The American sprinter then found another gear to push to the front and finish the race in 43.40 seconds.

That mark shattered Hall's previous personal best, the 44.17-second run he completed to qualify at the U.S. Olympic Trials in June.

That mark is also the fastest time recorded since Wayde van Niekerk of South Africa set the world record in 2016, as well as the fifth-fastest in the event's Olympic history.

British sprinter Matthew Hudson-Smith crossed the finish line just four one-thousandths of a second later to claim the silver medal.

The comeback was particularly notable given that Hall was focused on different race two years ago. The sprinter previously specialized in the 400m hurdles, the event in which he won an NCAA title at South Carolina in 2019, and only shifted to the 400m flat last year.

That decision paid off with a bronze at the 2023 World Championships, followed by Wednesday's historic comeback gold.

Hall's run marks one of several viral comeback efforts from Team USA in this week's slate of track and field events.

Noah Lyles, who was in seventh place halfway through the 100-meter race, surged in the back half of the run to earn a photo-finish gold.

Cole Hocker set an Olympic record with his own comeback effort in the 1,500-meter race, which saw him go from the middle of the group to gold medal position in the final stretch."
Quincy Hall comes from behind to win gold in the Olympic men's 400-meter race.,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5687341/2024/08/07/quincy-hall-olympic-400m-results/,"SAINT-DENIS, France — Quincy Hall’s kick feels like a fight against an invisible foe. Against the pain of a grueling lap. Against the will of his opponents. Against the hovering bubble of obscurity in which he’s been embedded.

But Hall wants that smoke. He lives for it. He strains and punches and grimaces not because he’s at his limits, but because his body is responding to his mindset. All his life, he had to fight. So when he came out of the final turn in the men’s 400 meters, in fourth place, looking in trouble, he knew victory was his. Because he is convinced, always, he’s got the most fight in him.

“I don’t give up, man,” Hall said. “I’ve got grit. I grind. I’ve got determination. Anything that I can think of that’s gonna get me to that line, I think of it. All the hurt. All the pain.”

NEVER doubt Quincy Hall. 😱 A EPIC comeback to win 400m GOLD! #ParisOlympics 📺 NBC & Peacock pic.twitter.com/qQJqfxrH9n — NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) August 7, 2024

One by one, Kansas City’s finest picked them off. First Grenada’s Kirani James. Then Jereem Richards of Trinidad and Tobago, who jumped out early and led most of the way. Then, finally, he blew past Great Britain’s Matthew Hudson-Smith. The Olympic rookie looked anything but. They were fading. Hall was getting stronger.

Advertisement

He posted a personal best of 43.40 seconds — the fourth-fastest time ever — in a come-from-behind win to snatch the gold away. Because it had to be snatched.

Hall prides himself on his kick. In the 400, the final 50 meters is as much a question of resolve as one of speed. That’s where Hall excels. Wednesday, he ran the final 50 meters in 5.94 seconds, the best in the field.

Sure, he’s fast. He’s technically proficient. He’s talented. But, most important, he’ll fight you for it. Hall ran the final 50 meters in 5.94 seconds, the fastest of anyone in the field. He ran the final stretch faster than the first 50 meters (6.16 seconds). Compare that 0.22-second improvement to silver medalist Hudson-Smith, who ran the final 50 meters 0.24 seconds slower than his first 50 meters.

“That’s what I’m known for. I’m known to finish,” Hall said. “If you don’t get far away from me enough, I’m gon’ catch you. Every time.

“As soon as they shot that gun,” he added, “I knew I had it. You can’t get far enough.”

Validation has been a long time coming for Hall, who showed promise after getting a bronze in last year’s World Championships. He’s been dominant at every level in his career but hasn’t gotten a chance to shine on the big stage.

It was 40 years ago when Alonzo Babers won the men’s 400 meters at the Los Angeles Summer Games. It sparked a ridiculous run of seven straight Olympic cycles of Team USA gold.

But that run ended after LaShawn Merritt’s win in 2008. Those Beijing Games were the second consecutive American sweep in the 400. Since then, the American men have managed one bronze — Merritt in 2016 — in the 400 meters.

The quarter-mile is an American institution. One medal in 16 years is a disgrace to the name of the legendary Michael Johnson. It’s been a long quest for someone to return 400-meter glory to its rightful home.

Advertisement

Quincy Hall is about that life.

Before this gold medal, he was the definition of unheralded. He’s battled with injuries. He’s new to the Olympic stage. He doesn’t do much to bring attention to himself. He’d much prefer to “go fishing and ride my horse” or spend time caring for the pitbulls who have his heart. Such doesn’t garner the spotlight. But know this: Hall is elite.

It seemed as if the men’s 400-meter race was wide-open this year, especially with Jamaican Antonio Watson, the reigning world champion, not in Paris.

Hudson-Smith is ranked No. 2 in the world and he bested Hall in the 2023 World Championships. James is the first-ever with three Olympic medals in the 400, including gold in 2012, and he had the best time in the semifinals. Muzala Samukonga from Zambia set a national record in the semis (and wound up with a bronze medal). Even American Michael Norman looked really good leading to the finals. A bunch of possibilities figured to be in play.

But Hall is a different breed. He started at the community college level. He races with a gold grill in his mouth. He wears long, loose boxers under his kit. No bunch was going to bother him.

America needed a real one to go take what belongs to it in a race that’s been begging for an American star. Hall seemed to be built for it.

“Oh, that’s where that grit comes from,” Hall said of his JUCO days at the College of the Sequoias. “When you have no food. You’ve got to get your own food. No cafeteria. No study hall. None of that. You find out how to be a dog by yourself.”

Hall is often by himself practicing.

At South Carolina, he did the 400-meter hurdles along with the flat 400 meters. But after 2022, he dropped the hurdles and focused on the flat race. He said it was the best decision of his life. Harnessing his grind, focusing it, turned him into the best in the world.

“A lot of work,” he said. “A lot of hot, hot practices, being out there by myself, having to talk to my coach through the phone. And he’s just telling me, ‘Keep going. Keep going.'”

That work continues. Hall is a lock on the 4×400 relay team, where he could earn another gold medal.

Last month, Noah Lyles snubbed Hall from his ideal 4×400 relay team — of which Lyles said he’d run the second leg. He picked Rai Benjamin, the favorite in the 400-meter hurdles, to be the anchor in this hypothetical relay team.

Hall responded by challenging Lyles to a race in the 400. He reissued Wednesday, with gold medal credibility behind it. Because Hall is always down for a fight.

“He’s the Olympic champion in the 100,” Hall said of Lyles. “He may be the Olympic champion in the 200. So maybe he can see me in the 400. The Olympic champion in the 400.”

Quincy Hall comes from behind to win gold in the Olympic men's 400-meter race.,https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/08/07/olympics-track-and-field-noah-lyles-highlights-results/74706105007/,"Americans had a big day in track and field on Wednesday at the Paris Olympics, with Quincy Hall pulling off a stunning comeback to win gold in the men's 400.

Katie Moon (women's pole vault) and Kenneth Rooks (men's 3,000 steeplechase) earned silver medals, while other Team USA runners including Noah Lyles and Alexis Holmes advanced to the 400 finals.

Here's how Wednesday night unfolded at the State de France:

Katie Moon wins silver in women's pole vault

SAINT-DENIS, France — Katie Moon added to Team USA's medal count Tuesday with a silver medal in the women's pole vault event at the Stade de France venue of the Paris Olympics. Moon vaulted 15 feet, 11 inches in her final successful attempt to reach the podium.

Nina Kennedy of Australia took the gold medal (16 feet, ¾ inches), while Canada's Alysha Newman won bronze.

Moon cleared her first four vaults without a failed attempt, one of only two competitors, along with Angelica Moser of Switzerland, to do so.

Team USA's Kenneth Rooks wins silver in 3,000 steeplechase

SAINT-DENIS, France - American Kenneth Rooks, ranked 24th in the world in the men's 3,000-meter steeplechase, shocked the field with a silver medal Wednesday at the Paris Games, clocking a personal-best 8:06.41. After 1,000 meters, Rooks trailed 11 racers, and was running just ninth after 2,000 meters. From there, however, Rooks found another gear and passed the entire field to take the lead with a few hundred meters remaining.

He was overtaken by gold medalist Soufiane El Bakkali of Morocco (8:06.05), and Rooks barely beat bronze medalist Abraham Kibiwot of Kenya (8:06.47). Rooks, the only American in the race, earned Team USA's first men's steeplechase medal since Evan Jager won silver in the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games.

Quincy Hall wins gold in men's 400

SAINT-DENIS, France — United States runner Quincy Hall won the gold medal in the men’s 400-meter dash Wednesday – besting Great Britain's Matthew Hudson-Smith and Zambia's Muzuala Samukonga and posting a time of 43.40 to set a personal best.

Hall trailed early but a spectacular straightaway dash allowed him to catch Hudson-Smith steps before the finish line.

The Raytown, Missouri native took third in the event at last year’s world championships. He was also part of the mixed 4x400-meter relay team that won gold at that meet.

But the story for Hall, 26, entering these Games was his online war of words with Lyles, the 100-meter gold-medalist.

Women's 400: Team USA's Alexis Holmes qualifies for finals

SAINT-DENIS, France - Team USA's Alexis Holmes qualified for the finals of the women's 400 meters with a 50.00 time at the Paris Games' Stade de France venue for track and field.

The top two finishers in each of three heats, plus the next two fastest times, qualified for medal finals. Holmes finished second in her heat, behind Marileidy Paulino of the Dominican Republic (49.21). The medal race is scheduled for Thursday night.

Team USA's Aaliyah Butler finished sixth in Heat 1 with a 51.18, while Kendall Ellis failed to qualify with a 50.40 in Heat 3.

Noah Lyles reaches 200 finals with second-place finish

SAINT-DENIS, France — As expected, Noah Lyles advanced to the Olympic final in the men’s 200-meter sprint. However, he took second in the semifinals.

In semifinal heat two, Lyles ran out of lane six. Lyles sped around the turn, but he was behind Letsile Tebogo of Botswana. Lyles attempted to catch Tebogo but the Botswanan sprinter was too far in front as he crossed the line a stride ahead of Lyles.

Tebogo's winning time was 19.96. Lyles came in second at 20.08 to get the second automatic qualifying spot.

Lyles is trying to become the first American to win the Olympic sprint double (100 and 200) in 40 years. He won gold in the 100 in a dramatic photo finish.

Rai Benjamin advances to 400 finals

SAINT-DENIS, France – Rai Benjamin cruised through the men’s 400-meter semifinals to Wednesday to secure his spot in Friday's finals.

Benjamin won his heat – almost too easily – with a time of 47.85 seconds. His best time this season is 46.46 seconds. During heats, Benjamin jogged the end of his run – conserving fuel for the races to come. The defending Olympic silver medalist in the event won a gold in Tokyo as part of the men’s 4x400-meter relay team.

Benjamin took his time out of the gates but dialed it up at about the one-third mark and essentially jogged the straightaway once again.

CJ Allen of the USA took an early lead into the straightaway during the second heat. But he ran out of steam and finished fourth. Allen, the American indoor 400-meter record-holder, did not make the final with a time of 48.44.

American Trevor Bassitt, the eighth-ranked 400-meter hurdler per the world rankings, also finished fourth in the first heat and didn’t make the finals either.

Norway’s Karsten Warholm, who set the world record in the event at the Tokyo Olympics, won the first heat with a time of 47.67 seconds. Warholm also had the fastest time during heats.

Frenchman Clement Ducos took second in the first heat to make the finals, much to the delight of the crowd at Stade de France.

Going for gold: Grant Holloway heavy favorite in 110 hurdles

SAINT-DENIS, France — Grant Holloway is entering the men’s 110 hurdles final as the clear favorite.

Holloway cleared all 10 hurdles and won his semifinal heat easily, running a time of 12.98. He crossed the line a few strides ahead of Spain’s Enrique Llopis, who ran a 13.17 to place second.

Tokyo Olympic champion Hansle Parchment of Jamaica finished third with a time of 13.19.

Holloway has dominated the 110 hurdles in 2024 and is undefeated in the event this year. He’s won three consecutive world championship golds but he took silver at the Tokyo Olympics in the event, losing to Parchment.

The three-time world champ will be joined in the finals by fellow U.S. hurdlers Freddie Crittenden and Daniel Roberts. Crittenden finished second in his semifinal heat with a time of 13.23 to advance and Roberts took second in the third heat, running a 13.10.

The 110 hurdles final is set for Thursday.

Tebogo didn't let up on the back stretch of the men's 200-meter final at the 2024 Paris Olympics, charging ahead and holding off Americans Lyles and Kenny Bednarek to win gold.

Tebogo won with a time of 19.46, edging out Bednarek by 0.06. Lyles finished third in 19.70, and received a code of conduct warning. It was not immediately clear why the warning was issued.

Lyles came into the Paris Games with bravado, World Championship golds and claims of being the ""fastest man in the world,"" but was lacking that Olympic gold after earning bronze at the 2020 Tokyo Games. He earned a huge win in the 100-meter final on Aug. 4, but couldn't complete the double in the 200-meter, traditionally his best event.

Bednarek, meanwhile, repeated his silver medal in the 200-meter from the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

This is 21-year-old Tebogo's first Olympic Games. He's previously earned a silver medal in the 100-meter and bronze in the 200-meter at the 2023 World Championships.

Lyles was feeling confident after his 100-meter win on Sunday.

""To be honest, I just believed in myself,"" Lyles told reporters, including PEOPLE, of how he was able to recover from a slower start to win gold. ""That goes to prove that reaction time does not win races.""

The Adidas star added to reporters that he knew ""every step of the way it was not 2021,"" referring to his disappointing finish at the Tokyo Games.

""I'm still constantly moving forward, moving forward, moving forward, and I knew that when the time came, for me to be able to say, 'This is the final, this is where I need to put it together,' I was gonna do it,"" he said.

It was a night full of drama at the Stade de France, with four gold medals up for grabs, top rivals going against one another and even some family drama hanging in the balance.

Here are five takeaways from a thrilling night of track and field:

Quincy Hall’s stunning charge in the 400 meters

It was as wide open a 400-meter race as the Olympics had seen in years. But, judging by his breezy performances in qualifying, American Quincy Hall appeared to be the favorite before the final began.

Running out of lane eight, Hall seemed to barely get out of a jog during qualifying for this race and felt likely to challenge for a new world record.

That didn’t come to pass, but Hall did end up with the gold after a truly incredible effort to hunt down the leaders in the final stretch to take the gold.

A massive roar from the Stade de France crowd came after the gun sounded, as 80,000 watched the first gold medal race of the evening.

Hall trailed through most of the race and was in sixth as the runners came around the final curve. But suddenly he made his move, sprinting into the final straightway. Charging down the stretch, Hall made up ground quickly — the effort written on his face — and he was suddenly passing runners.

“I was just thinking, ‘Get home, sir. Get home, sir,’” Hall said afterward.

In the final meters, Hall overtook Great Britain’s Matthew Hudson-Smith in a thrilling finish, beating the Team GB runner to the line by .04 seconds.

“When it was too late,” Hudson-Smith said of when he knew Hall was coming up behind him. “I thought I had it. We knew coming into this that it was going to come down to the last 50 meters.”

He added, “There’s only going to be one winner. He’s a better man. I can’t complain because I ran the fifth-fastest time overall. I always say, if you want to win, you’ve got to take it from me, and he did. I’m going to lower that time. It’s just the start.”

It was an incredible moment for the American, who ran a personal best and led for only a tenth of a second in the race, leaning across the finish line to take the gold from Hudson-Smith. Zambia’s Muzala Samukonga took the bronze.

Hall rang the victory bell in the northern end of the Stade de France and took off his shoes to pose for a photo. Grabbing Old Glory, he went for a shoeless victory lap around the track to massive cheers.

“This means a lot. I’ve been putting a lot of work in. I told you guys I was going to get a gold medal this year and I guess I just showed you I did it. I know I can win. I knew it today. That’s what I’ve been doing my whole career,” he said. “A lot of work, being hard on myself. I’ve been talking to my coach on the phone, and he just told me, ‘Keep going, keep going.’

“I don’t give up. I just grit, I grind. I’ve got determination. Anything I think will get me to that line, I think of it. A lot of hurt, a lot of pain. I just won. It’s over. For the next four years, I can say I’m an Olympic champion.”

Mykolas Alekna breaks his father’s Olympic record – and still has to settle for silver

The top-ranked discus thrower in the world and the owner of the world record, Mykolas Alekna of Lithuania came into Wednesday the overwhelming favorite to win the gold medal. Beyond that, he had an even bigger aim: beating the Olympic record that his father, Virgilijus Alekna, set at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens.

On his second throw of the night, Alekna did it, throwing the discus 69.97 meters. It was .08 meters longer than his father’s throw in Athens and now the son looked set to take home the gold medal, the Olympic record and family bragging rights.

He ultimately had to settle for just the bragging rights.

Minutes after Alekna’s record-setting toss, Rojé Stona of Jamaica stepped into the circle and delivered a stunning 70-meter throw to push Alekna into second place – both in Wednesday’s competition and the Olympic history books.

Stona, who finished 19th in last year’s world championships and is ranked No. 11 in the world, was suddenly crashing the Aleknas’ family party here outside Paris.

“It’s a very special night. It’s everything I wanted, but for it to actually happen, it’s a very good feeling,” Stona said. “In practice, leading up to the competition, I felt great. So I believed in myself and I know that I had it in me. Just went and release it, no pressure, I was already in the top eight, so I had nothing to lose.”

He added, “I’ve done some things that I didn’t know I was capable of doing. But I believed, and I had faith, so I was in the moment and I enjoyed it.”

Alekna had a few more attempts at getting his record and his gold medal back but couldn’t get close to his Jamaican counterpart. The stage seemed set for him to seize the moment with his final throw, but a disappointing effort hit the netting, leaving him to have to settle for the silver. Yet the Lithuanian star will only be 25 when LA 2028 rolls around, so expect to see him back on this big stage, looking for gold.

Aussie tops American in a battle of the world’s best in pole vault

It was largely anticipated that the women’s pole vault final would come down to Nina Kennedy of Australia and Katie Moon of the United States.

As the largest women’s pole vault final field ever winnowed from 20 to single digits and then even smaller, the top-ranked pole vaulters in the world seemed to simply fly over the bar. And as their rivals melted away, it was in fact No. 1 Kennedy vs. No. 2 Moon at the end.

Kennedy cleared the 4.90-meter bar with ease on her first attempt. Moon, however, couldn’t do the same. And rather than risk taking failing two more attempts at clearing the 4.90-meter bar, Moon decided to pass on the height and move on to 4.95 meters.

It was a gamble – one that ultimately did not pay off.

By passing on the 4.90-meter bar, Moon only received two chances to clear 4.95 meters instead of the normal three. She failed on her first attempt, as did Kennedy.

The drama was set as Moon needed to clear 4.95 meters on her second attempt and force Kennedy to match her height. If she hit the bar, then she would have to settle for silver and her rival would take the gold.

Moon ran down the runway to the roars of the Stade de France, planted her pole … and hit the bar. The night belonged to the Aussie.

Kennedy celebrated with her family in the stands and broke into joyous tears over the result. The world’s top-ranked pole vaulter was the favorite going into Wednesday, but she and Moon decided to share the gold medal at last year’s world championship so she knew that it would be close.

“I’ve thought about the Olympic Games every single day since Budapest last year, when Katie and I shared the gold,” she said. “It’s just so amazing that I had so many friends and family and my team (here). We had a job tonight, and we went out there to get it.”

In the end, it was one of the few disappointments for Team USA on Wednesday night.

Three Americans set for men’s 200-meter race

Earlier in the night, three semifinal heats in the men’s 200-meter race set the field for the Thursday night final – and three Americans will be on the starting line.

Noah Lyles, who won the men’s 100-meter race on Sunday, qualified for the final with a second-place finish. It was an eyebrow-raising result given that the 200 meters is Lyles’ signature race, the one in which he won bronze in Tokyo. But the American finished second in both of his qualifying heats before the men’s 100-meter sprint and took gold in that race, so he likely won’t be losing too much sleep over the finish.

Americans won the other two semifinal heats on Wednesday, meaning Team USA will be well-represented in the 200-meter final.

Erriyon Knighton and Kenneth Bednarek both won their races and will compete alongside Lyles at 2:30 p.m. ET Thursday at the Stade de France.

Moroccan charges in the final lap of 3,000m steeplechase to eke out a win over American

Soufiane El Bakkali of Morocco came into the 3,000-meter steeplechase as the top-ranked competitor in the world. He showed exactly why in the final 200 meters of the race that closed the evening at the Stade de France.

For most of the race, the three Ethiopians – Samuel Firewu, Getnet Wale and Lamecha Girma – led the pack. But as the final lap began, American Kenneth Rooks made his move.

Rooks, who is ranked No. 49 in the world in the race, looked for a while like he was about to pull off an absolutely incredible upset. And when Girma tripped on one of the final barriers of the race, landing in a heap on the track and breaking the stride of much of the pack, it seemed like the American was closing in on a famous victory.

But El Bakkali was not to be denied. He charged after the final water obstacle of the race, surging past Rooks in the straightaway and crossing the finish line .36 seconds ahead of the American.

It’s a second gold medal in this event for El Bakkali as he defended the honor he won in Tokyo. But it seemed all the sweeter the second time around – he celebrated with a sizeable contingent of Moroccan fans long after the race had ended and much of the stadium was clear, even going for a dip in the water obstacle in which he made his surge."

Hall finished the race in 43.40, which was four one-hundredths of a second faster than Matthew Hudson-Smith of Great Britain. Hudson-Smith, however, appeared poised to win the race, holding a small lead into the final stretch, until Hall emptied his tank and came from behind to slip ahead of the field just before crossing the finish line.

Here's a look at the thrilling finish of the men's 400-meter race:

Who is Quincy Hall?

Quincy Hall, 26, is a Raytown, Missouri native who is making his Olympic debut at the 2024 Paris Games. He ran collegiately at the University of South Carolina and won bronze on the 400m and gold in the 4x400m relay at the 2023 World Championship in Budapest.

Hall and Lyles had a brief online war of words after the two exchanged comments about Lyles' desire to be on the 4x400m relay, although Lyles omitted Hall on his ideal relay team.

Most athletes enter the Olympics to try and take home the gold, but USA sprinter Quincy Hall arrived at the 2024 Summer Olympics with gold in hand. Or, rather, in his mouth. Those who've watched the Games play out couldn't help but notice that he has a mouthful of gold thanks to his grill, but why does Quincy Hall have gold teeth, exactly?

Quincy is in good company with something that makes him stand out among the other athletes. Like Raven Saunders's mask, which they have become known for. Or Gabby Thomas's arm sleeve, which fans have also taken notice of. But unlike those accessories, are Quincy's gold teeth actually permanent?

Why does Quincy Hall have gold teeth?

When Quincy won the gold medal in the mens' 400 meter race at the Olympics, he took several photos holding up his gold medal and smiling with a mouth of gold teeth. He's wearing a grill, though it doesn't look like it's permanent since there are photos on social media where his actual teeth are present. But his gold teeth have become a thing for him at the Olympics.

Gold grills are made to be attached to one or more teeth by being snapped into place, almost like a plastic retainer. But unlike retainers, gold grills can cause dental health issues down the line. If the temporary grill is worn too often, bacteria can be trapped between the interior of the grill and the teeth it covers.

Quincy Hall comes from behind to win gold in the Olympic men's 400-meter race.,https://www.letsrun.com/news/2024/08/quincy-hall-is-latest-american-to-earn-come-from-behind-gold-winning-olympic-400m-in-43-40/,"PARIS – This is getting ridiculous.

First, Noah Lyles surged from last to first over the final 60 meters to claim the men’s 100 on Sunday night. Two days later, Cole Hocker unleashed a beast of a kick in the home straight to win an upset gold in the 1500 meters. And here we were, on Wednesday night in the Stade de France coming off the last turn in the men’s 400 meters, with another American, Quincy Hall, in position to launch an unlikely comeback in an Olympic final. Surely it could not happen again.

We use the term “in position” loosely here. For most sprinters, fourth place and five meters back of the gold off the turn means goodbye, try again in four years. Not Hall. He calls himself a dog. That means no quitting, no matter how big the deficit.

“Can’t outrun a dog,” Hall said. “A dog will chase you forever.”

Hall had a lot of chasing to do. Trinidad & Tobago’s Jereem Richards (20.46) and Great Britain’s Matthew Hudson-Smith (20.62) ran the hell out of the first 200 meters. And while Richards would eventually falter in the home straight, Hudson-Smith, who led off the turn, held on brilliantly. Just like his countryman Josh Kerr last night, Hudson-Smith would run one of the fastest times in history. And just like Kerr, he would find himself outkicked at the death by an American who ran even faster. Yes, it had happened again.

It is tempting to say Hall wanted it more. His running form, with its furrowed brow, gnashed, golden-grilled teeth, bobbing head, and torso lurching from side to side, is the picture of grit.

It would also be inaccurate. This is the Olympic final. Everyone wants it. Hall won because, on this night, he was the better athlete. Indeed, there have been fewer better performances – or races – in the history of the event. Hall’s time of 43.40 is the fifth-fastest 400m ever run and the best by an American since Michael Johnson’s 43.18 in Seville in 1999, a time that stood as the world record for nearly 17 years. Hudson-Smith’s 43.44 is tied for the #6 performance ever and ranks, by some margin, as the fastest non-winning time ever.

Heck, Zambian bronze medalist Muzala Samukonga’s 43.74 was the fastest third-place time ever. No race before had ever seen four men under 44 seconds. This one had five.

“I just lost to the better man on the day and honestly I can’t complain,” said Hudson-Smith. “I did everything, left it all on the table. I’ve been saying all year, if you’re going to win, you’ve gotta take it from me, and that’s exactly what he did.”

Those were Hudson-Smith’s thoughts an hour after the race. But in the immediate aftermath, he only had one. As he looked up at the scoreboard and saw 43.44 in the time column but 2 in the place column, he screamed: FUCK! Then he composed himself, slapped hands with Hall, and congratulated the new Olympic champion.

From Missouri to California junior college to South Carolina to Olympic champion

Like last night’s gold medalist Hocker, Hall has long been known for his kick. And like Hocker, it was there when he needed it tonight, even at a faster pace than he had ever run. Though Hall was the Worlds bronze medalist last year, his personal best at the start of 2024, 44.37, was nearly a full second slower than he ran tonight. Until he ran 43.80 in Monaco on July 12, he had never broken 44 seconds. In Paris, he did it on back-to-back days: 43.95 in Tuesday’s semis, then 43.40 tonight in the final.

“We do a lot of hard practices,” Hall said. “And we focus on coming home at the end of each practice. So that was nothing more than just me trying to go hard. Just harder than what I’m used to doing.”

When asked about the source of his kick, Hall credited the cross country he ran as a youth – no, seriously – for helping develop strength. Hall, 26, is something of a nomad. He said he dealt with a lot of “doubters and distractions” growing up and endured the death of two brothers. At Raytown South High School south of Kansas City, his best event was the 400 but he ran the 110 and 300 hurdles as well. He worked two jobs to pay his way through the College of the Sequoias, a community college in Visalia, Calif., where in 2018 he quadrupled in the 400, 400 hurdles, 4×400, and 4×100 at the California state juco championships, winning all but the 4×100 (his team placed second).

That stint garnered the eye of the coaches at South Carolina, where he won the 2019 NCAA title in the 400 hurdles, the event he specialized in until last year. But after analyzing his gait, Wilson and his coach Curtis Allen — who also coached him at Sequoias – felt he was more suited for the 400. It didn’t hurt that the 400 was in a recession at the world level compared to the 400 hurdles, which has never been stronger. In 2022, the winning time at the World Championships (44.29) was above 44 seconds for the first time since 2011. In 2023, it happened again (44.22).

That recession is now over. If an Olympic final like that cannot kickstart this event, nothing can.

Just one problem. Hall may not be sticking around much longer.

“Sooner or later, we’re going to move to a different event,” Hall said. “I won’t say it now, but we’ll move to a different event and try to go make chaos over there.”

A history lesson: the last global 400m gold medalist to abandon the event, 2022 world champ Michael Norman, came back to the 400 just one year later after a failed experiment in the 100. So don’t be too eager to leave just yet, Quincy. The 400 needs you and your beautiful chaos.

Quincy Hall comes from behind to win gold in the Olympic men's 400-meter race.,https://www.kctv5.com/2024/08/07/raytown-south-graduate-quincy-hall-wins-olympic-gold-mens-400-meter-race/,"PARIS (KCTV) - A global track star who hails from Kansas City is now an Olympic gold medalist.

Quincy Hall, a 2016 graduate of Raytown South High School, won the men’s 400-meter dash on Wednesday with a time of 43.40 seconds.

Hall was not the favorite to win, with Great Britain’s Matthew Hudson-Smith expected to take home the gold.

As the athletes rounded the track for the final 100-meter straightaway, Hall was securely in fourth place. Hudson-Smith appeared to be neck-and-neck for first place with Jereem Richards, competing for Trinidad and Tobago.

With the finish line approaching, however, Hall surged forward and passed Hudson-Smith just in time to take the gold, with Hudson-Smith trailing by only 0.04 seconds.

Zambia’s Mazula Samukonga took third place and Richards took fourth.

Team USA’s other 400-meter competitors, Christopher Bailey and Michael Norman, finished in sixth and eighth place, respectively.

Born and raised in Kansas City, Hall attended Raytown South High School from 2012-2016. There, he was the 2016 Missouri State champion in the 400-meter dash and still holds the record for the state’s second-fastest time.

When Hall graduated from Raytown South in 2016, he attended the College of the Sequoias and won the California Community College Athletic Association Championship in the 400-meter dash, 400-meter hurdles and 4x400-meter relay.

After two seasons with the College of the Sequoias, he attended the University of South Carolina. There, he picked up several National Championships in the 400-meter hurdles and 4x400-meter relay.

In 2023, Hall attended the World Championships, where he contributed to a gold medal in the 4x400-meter relay and won himself a bronze medal in the 400-meter dash.

The 26-year-old crossed the finish line ahead of Team GB's Matthew Hudson-Smith and Muzala Samukonga of Zambia in dramatic fashion, charging from behind to knip the gold away from the Great Britain athlete.

Hall ran an exceptional race, finishing the race with a time of 43.40 - 0.04 seconds ahead of the British sprinter.

The American's stellar performance in the final earned a shoutout from the current 'fastest man in the world' and fellow Team USA member Noah Lyles.

Lyles who won gold in the 100m final on Sunday took to the social media platform 'X' to state that his compatriot was a certified DAWG.

The impressive victory earned a shoutout from fellow Team USA star and Olympic champion Noah Lyles

Following Lyle's social display of support, a resurfaced interview clip from a podcast which Lyles was on has gone viral.

Prompting many fans to ask Lyles to take back previous comments he made about his fellow American sprinter.

The current 100m Olympic and world champion featured on the 'Track World News' podcast in late July, just before he departed for Paris.

On the podcast Lyles was asked to select his ideal 4x400m relay team.

Lyles who is arguably the most recognised sprinter in the world right now opted to leave Hall off his ideal relay team.

Instead deciding to go with Chris Bailey, Michael Norman, Rai Benjamin, and himself.

A clip of Lyles seemingly dissing Hall has resurfaced following the American's impressive run

The clip features Lyles on the 'Track World News' podcast where he says he wouldn't include Hall in his 4x400m relay team

Citing that he believed other athletes would be a better fit for his team, the 100m Olympic champion suggested that using Hall in the first leg of a 4x400m relay would be a waste as he didn't see him as a starter.

Going further to imply that he didn't believe Hall's talents would be well optimised in any leg of the relay.

'The only reason I wouldn’t use the current U.S. champion is that I just don’t think he’d be a starter,” Lyles said.

'Using him on the first leg would almost be like a waste of his talents.'

The slight diss warranted a response from Hall who took offence to the exclusion.

He responded on 'X' with a tweet of his own which read 'Noah Lyles, I don’t bother nobody, but my blocks ready anytime you feel like you can beat me in the 400,

'You was talking to much on my name on yo little podcast, Track World News, I don’t do the little slick comments and remarks I line up.' he added.

A short time after his initial response, Hall doubled down on his comments posting a minute-long video to 'X' after some said he was overreacting and Lyles' comments weren't meant as a diss.

One 'X' user wrote 'What is Noah Lyles going to say now?

'Looks like Quincy Hall was ready for the 400-meter

On Wednesday, Hall delivered a remarkable performance in the 400 meters, turning a fourth-place position into a stunning first-place finish in Saint-Denis.

The 26-year-old sprinted past Jereem Richards of Trinidad and Tobago before overtaking Britain's Matthew Hudson-Smith and Zambia's Muzala Samukonga, achieving a personal-best time of 43.40 seconds.

This time places Hall as the fourth-fastest man ever to run the 400 meters.

""I just won,""Hall said to reporters.

""It's over. Next four years, I can say I'm Olympic champion.""

Hall's victory was achieved by a mere 0.04 seconds ahead of Hudson-Smith, whose second-place finish at 43.44 seconds is now the fifth-fastest time ever recorded in the event.

USA's dominant streak in track continues

This incredible win comes just a day after Cole Hocker secured gold for the Americans in the men's 1500 meters with a similarly dramatic finish.

Noah Lyles had also set the stage on Sunday with a gold in the 100 meters, coming from behind to win by the slimmest of margins.

With his sensational performance, Hall became the first American to win Olympic gold in the 400 meters since LaShawn Merritt in 2008.

Reflecting on his journey, Hall attributed his success to his determination and resilience.

""I've got determination,""Hall said.

""That's what got me to that line. A lot of hurt, a lot of pain.""

Hall's journey to the top has been marked by significant challenges.

Initially focusing on the 400-meter hurdles, Hall decided to switch to the open 400 meters two years ago.

This decision has clearly paid off, as he has since emerged as one of the elite runners in the event.

His breakthrough came in 2023 when he represented the U.S. at the World Championships in Budapest, earning a bronze medal and steadily lowering his career-best times."

Quincy Hall pulled off a stunner on Wednesday by sprinting from fourth place around the final bend to cross the finish line in first place in the finals of the men's 400 meters at the 2024 Olympics.

Speaking to reporters after his thrilling come-from-behind win to earn a gold medal, Hall said ""you can't outrun a dog"" and credited his ""determination"" for pushing him over the finish line.

""I've got determination,"" Hall said. ""That's what got me to that line. A lot of hurt, a lot of pain.""

Hall won the race with a time of 43.4 seconds, just .04 seconds ahead of Great Britain's Matthew Hudson-Smith. Hall's winning time was a personal best for him in the race and fourth-fastest time in the history of the men's 400 meters.

Michael Johnson in 1999 (43.18 seconds) and Butch Reynolds in 1988 (43.29 seconds) are the only American men to post a faster time than Hall did on Wednesday.

This is the second thrilling finish in a race involving an American man. Noah Lyles won gold in the 100 meters on Sunday by chasing down Jamaica's Kishane Thompson in a photo finish. Lyles crossed the finish line in 9.784 seconds, .005 seconds ahead of Thompson (9.789).

Hall recorded a time of 43.40, which is the fastest time recorded in the event across all professional track and field meets in 2024. He narrowly beat Great Britain’s Matthew Hudson-Smith, who finished in second with a time of 43.44, in the final stretch of the race.

“The race was anyone’s at that point. I just wanted to keep doing what my coach told me to do. Just keep driving, keep driving and get home,” Hall said. “Just grind. Determination. We do a lot of hard practices, and we focus on coming home at the end of each practice. That was nothing more than just me trying to go hard. Just harder and harder, like I’m used to doing.”

Because of this, finishing races has become a staple of his running strategy, Hall said.

“That’s what I’m known for. I know to finish,” Hall said. “If you don’t get far away from the left, I’m going to catch you — every time.”

[Newsletters: Get breaking news and analysis from GamecockCentral]

The South Carolina track and field alumnus has been among the world’s best in the men’s 400 this calendar year. Ahead of the Olympics, Hall recorded a then-world-best time in the event at a Diamond League meet in Monaco. He finished the race in just 43.80 seconds on Friday, June 12.

Hall has continued that run of dominance in the Olympics, where he has been a top finisher at each stage of the event. He won his preliminary heat on Sunday, Aug. 4, with a time of 44.28 and followed that up with a semifinal heat-best time of 43.95 on Tuesday, Aug. 6.

With the win, Hall became the first American to win a gold medal in the men’s 400 since LaShawn Merritt finished first in the event at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. He was also the first South Carolina track and field student-athlete to earn a medal since Jason Richardson did so in 2012. Richardson won the medal competing in the men’s 110-meter hurdles at the Summer Olympics in London, England.

“It means a lot,” Hall said. “I’ve been putting a lot of work in. It’s my second year running the 400. Last year, I told you guys I was going to get better and better this year. And I guess I got Olympic gold — Olympic champion.”"

There is simply never a dull moment at this year’s Olympics.

What started off as a routine heat in the men’s 5000m event, ended in utter chaos as multiple athletes were left strewn over the track.

The race had been heating up slowly and then sprung into action as the runners approached the final lap.

Just as the athletes took the bell, Canada’s Mohammed Ahmed fell down, leaving him way behind the leading group which raced on frantically to the finish line.

But that was just a taste of things to come.

As the leaders swung around the bend onto the home straight, four men were sent flying to the track.

The incident seemed to start with a tussle between Team GB’s George Mills and France’s Hugo Hay, and resulted in the British runner bumping into two runners on his outside. All three men fell to the track, tripping up another runner behind them.

“I got stepped out on. I was about to kick in the home straight and, boom, the French lad took me down,” Mills told BBC Sport after the race.

Mills was clearly annoyed at Hay and angrily confronted his rival at the finish line, shrugging off the Frenchman’s attempts at reconciliation.

When asked what he said to his opponent, Mills added: “I’m probably not allowed to say.”

Hay finished seventh and was one of eight men to qualify for the final, while Mills eventually crossed the line in 18th after picking himself up off the floor.

After a series of appeals, Mills, Mike Foppen, Thierry Ndikumwenayo and Dominic Lokinyomo Lobalu have all since been added to the final after the falls.

Quincy Hall comes from behind to win gold in the Olympic men's 400-meter race.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/08/07/us-track-and-field-paris-olympics-medal-count/,"SAINT-DENIS, France — A track and field meet is not for the slow and inattentive. Different events are being waged at every corner of the stadium, with athletes leaping, running and throwing, and the Olympics’ entire five-ring circus keeps spectators’ heads spinning. But no matter where one looks at Stade de France during this Olympic meet, they’re sure to see one thing: Americans winning.

The United States picked up three more medals during an action-packed Wednesday night — Quincy Hall’s gold in the 400 meters, Katie Moon’s silver in the pole vault and Kenneth Rooks’s thrilling second-place finish in the 3,000-meter steeplechase — and is putting on a dominant showing here.

“It has been really inspiring,” Rooks said. “It's been electric.”

American track and field athletes have hauled in 19 medals, six of them gold. No other country has more than six total medals or more than two golds. The U.S. track and field team needs only one more gold to match the seven it won in 2021, and it is creeping up on its 26-medal total from Tokyo.

And perhaps just as noteworthy, the American men, who failed to find the top of the podium once in the track events at the Tokyo Olympics, have already won three gold medals here. With Noah Lyles racing the 200 meters and Grant Holloway the 110-meter hurdles Thursday, more are likely on the way.

Six days into the nine-day meet at Stade de France, the U.S. athletes say they’re feeding off their teammates’ successes, whether they’re watching from the stands, in the call room or back in the Olympic Village. Rai Benjamin, who goes for gold Friday in the 400-meter hurdles, watched Lyles win the 100-meter race Sunday with other U.S. athletes. “It was bananas in there after,” he said.

“I feel it’s like a subconscious thing where we’re just feeding off each other,” he said.

But it’s not all subconscious. Rooks said Benjamin went out of his way to encourage the steeplechase runner before Wednesday’s final.

“He said he was going to warm up the track for me,” said Rooks, who hit the start line barely an hour after Benjamin’s semifinal race Wednesday night. “So he did a good job warming up the track.”

The tide of medals has created a momentum that has yet to wane. American track stars leaped and screamed together in the village watching Cole Hocker’s late push steal the 1,500 meters on Tuesday night. A day later, Benjamin joked he couldn’t talk because he’d lost his voice screaming for Hocker.

“I’ve been itching to run, just because I’ve seen everyone do their thing — get gold medals, get unexpected gold medals,” said Masai Russell, one of the favorites in a stacked 100-meter hurdles field, after her semifinal Wednesday. “I was thinking about that when I woke up this morning. I was like, ‘USA is doing a big one.’”

Not counting the 1904 St. Louis Games — when the United States won 67 of 74 possible medals and only 11 countries competed — the U.S. standard for Olympic track and field success remains Los Angeles 1984. On home soil, the Americans won 16 gold medals and 40 total.

Could the Americans challenge that? To match 1984, they need 10 more. Scroll down the list of events, and it’s possible: The men’s 200, men’s 110 hurdles, women’s 100 hurdles, women’s 400 hurdles, women’s shot put, women’s long jump, men’s 400 hurdles, heptathlon and all four relays present potential chances for gold.

Wednesday encapsulated what the Americans are doing at this Paris meet: finding the podium in events in which they’re favored while turning in surprising finishes in those in which they might have been overlooked.

Moon won gold at the Tokyo Olympics and sought to defend her title here. But she missed on two tries to clear 4.95 meters, which would have matched her personal best.

There was one point where Moon was at the tail end of her competition, celebrating Hall’s come-from-behind win in the 400 race while Rooks was walking onto the track and finding the start line. Moon still had a big attempt coming but was giddy with the latest U.S. gold.

“I mean, just I love track and field. I love the Olympics,” she said later. “So I am genuinely watching and cheering for all the teammates. … It really did give me kind of that second wind.”

The steeplechase race provided an exciting finish to the night. Rooks, the 24-year-old BYU product, had posted only the world’s 37th-best time this year and not many expected him to be among the leaders. He certainly wasn’t changing any minds in the race’s early stages. In fact, he was still running in last around 4 minutes 40 seconds into the race with barely 3¼ laps to go.

He started making his way through the pack around the 5:20 mark. As the last lap began, about seven minutes in, he found a new gear and charged to the front. He led at the final water jump and as the leaders turned for the final stretch.

This was not the race anyone expected, not with Morocco’s Soufiane El Bakkali, who won the gold at the Tokyo Olympics, and Ethiopa’s Lamecha Girma, the world record-holder who took silver in Tokyo, both in the field.

Sure enough, El Bakkali passed Rooks, but chaos erupted behind them. Girma’s knee clipped the final hurdle and he crashed headfirst onto the ground. He appeared to be motionless on the track. He eventually was taken away on a stretcher and transported to a hospital to be evaluated.

Meanwhile, Rooks managed to stave off a late push from Kenya’s Abraham Kibiwot and crossed the finish line second in 8:06.41, 0.36 seconds behind El Bakkali and a full 10 seconds better than any time he’d ever posted.

“It’s just a dream,” he said. “Sometimes, like when you’re going to bed, you think about moments like this, and to be able to live it is just incredible.”"

PARIS (AP) — Quincy Hall became the latest American to electrify Olympic track and field with an out-of-nowhere comeback Wednesday night at the Paris Olympics.

Hall sprinted from far behind in the 400 meters to reel in three runners and capture the gold medal. Hall, buried in fourth place as the runners rounded the last bend, outran the runner on his outside, then two more to the inside to cross the line in 43.40 seconds, the fourth-fastest time ever.

Hall then dropped to the track to do snow angels to celebrate.

Matthew Hudson-Smith of Britain finished second and Muzala Samukonga of Zambia finished third.

Hall is the first American since LaShawn Merritt in 2008 to capture gold in the one-lap race. His victory came an evening after teammate Cole Hocker came from far behind late to beat the favorites in the men’s 1,500.

The win came about an hour after Noah Lyles advanced to the final of the 200 meters despite finishing second to Letsile Tebogo in his semifinal heat. Lyles will race for the gold medal Thursday.

U.S. takes silver and almost pulls upset in steeplechase

Soufiane El Bakkali of Morocco defended his title in the men’s steeplechase with a .36-second win over American rival Kenneth Rooks.

Rooks had the lead heading into the homestretch and was looking to pull off a massive upset, but El Bakkali overtook him. Rooks still beat his personal best by almost 9 seconds to capture the second silver in three Olympics in the event for the United States.

Lin Yu-ting advances to gold-medal bout

Boxer Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan advanced to the gold-medal bout in the women’s featherweight division. She won her third consecutive bout while dealing with widespread scrutiny regarding misconceptions about her gender.

One day after welterweight Imane Khelif of Algeria reached her weight division’s final with a third straight victory in Paris, Lin defeated Esra Yildiz Kahraman of Turkey 5:0.

Lin will fight for gold on Saturday.

Lin and Khelif have dominated all of their Olympic bouts despite the massive distractions created by the fallout from the Olympic-banished International Boxing Association’s decision last year to disqualify both fighters from the world championships for allegedly failing an eligibility test.

Both fighters have responded to this unwelcome spotlight by making two of the best tournament runs of their lengthy amateur careers.

U.S. women's basketball keeps winning

Breanna Stewart also had 13 points for the Americans, who haven’t lost since the 1992 Barcelona Games and are now two victories away from an unprecedented eighth consecutive gold medal. They will face a familiar foe in Australia in the semifinals on Friday night.

The loss ended a historic run by Nigeria, which became the first African country to reach the Olympic basketball quarterfinals.

Americans win gold in women's team pursuit

The U.S. changed that at the Olympic velodrome when road race champion Kristen Faulkner, time trial bronze medalist Chloe Dygert, Jennifer Valente and Lilly Williams finally took that last step up.

They soared to a big early lead on New Zealand in their head-to-head showdown, then held on through a ragged finish to finally win the gold medal.

The Americans led by more than a second a quarter of the way through the 4,000-meter race, and they stretched the gap at one point to nearly two seconds. When they began to come apart from their single-file, aerodynamic draft with about two laps to go, they had to fight to the finish to hold off Ally Wollaston, Bryony Botha, Emily Shearman and Nicole Shields.

In the final of the men’s pursuit, Sam Welsford, Oliver Bleddyn, Conor Leahy and Kelland O’Brien of Australia beat Britain in a close final at the Vélodrome National de Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines to win gold for the first time in two decades.

U.S. weight off his shoulders

Hampton Morris became the first U.S. men’s weightlifter to earn an Olympic medal in four decades, taking bronze in the 61-kilogram division. It had not happened since Mario Martinez and Guy Carlton at the 1984 Los Angeles Games, notably boycotted by several communist countries.

The 20-year-old Morris, trained by his dad in the garage at their home in Marietta, Georgia, finished third in a competition won again by Li Fabin of China. Li defended his title from the Tokyo Games in 2021 and set an Olympic snatch record.

U.S. figure skaters finally get their medal

A touch of winter came to the Summer Games when the United States figure skating team finally got their gold medals as 2022 Olympic champions.

The special medal ceremony allowed the nine Americans to receive the medals exactly 2½ years after the figure skating team event ended at the Beijing Olympics. A doping saga from the winning Russian team led to the Americans being declared the winner.

All nine American skaters came to Paris: Karen Chen, Evan Bates, Nathan Chen, Madison Chock, Zachary Donohue, Brandon Frazier, Madison Hubbell, Alexa Knierim and Vincent Zhou. Seven of the eight members of the Japan team came to get their silver medals — an upgrade from their third-place result in Beijing.

A Russian appeal trying to win back the Olympic team title was dismissed at the Court of Arbitration for Sport just before the Paris Games opened. The title had been stripped in January when a different CAS panel disqualified Russian teenager Kamila Valieva for doping with a banned heart medication. She also was banned for four years.

China dominates artistic swimming

China took gold in the artistic swimming team event, dominating in the absence of Russia, which had won every gold medal in artistic beginning with the 2000 Sydney Games.

It was a big medal for China, and also a step forward for the sport, which changed its name from synchronized swimming several years ago to update its image. Some swimmers still call it “synchro.”

China finished with 996.1389 points, ahead of the United States and Spain. It was the first U.S. medal in the sport since 2004.

Men had an opportunity for the first time to compete in artistic swimming at the Olympics, but no men were picked by any of the teams. There is consideration to add a mixed duet team event for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, which would create more space for men to compete.

Days after Noah Lyles came from behind to pull inches ahead of Kishane Thompson and win the 100-meter final in stunning fashion, Quincy Hall followed suit with a comeback for the ages in the 400-meter final.

Hall spent the majority of the race in the middle of the pack or even farther behind, but he found a new gear after turning the corner for the final stretch. By the time he crossed the finish line, Hall seemed to be as much in disbelief as he was thrilled about the victory.

Here's a closer look at Hall's remarkable comeback, including the video of the final stretch.

Quincy Hall 400m comeback

Hall appeared to be out of luck when he made the final turn in Wednesday's 400-meter final, battling for fourth and running well behind the clear top three competitors.

At that point, it was pure determination that seemed to propel Hall to the front.

He dug deep and found one last surge of momentum, quickly passing a fading Jereem Richards and Muzala Samukonga. That made it a two-man race between Hall and Great Britain's Matthew Hudson-Smith over the final few meters, and Hall's long strides were enough to gain the slightest separation before crossing the finish line.

NEVER doubt Quincy Hall. 😱



A EPIC comeback to win 400m GOLD! #ParisOlympics



📺 NBC & Peacock pic.twitter.com/qQJqfxrH9n — NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) August 7, 2024

Hall posted a time of 43.40 seconds, narrowly edging out Hudson-Smith's 43.44. The 26-year-old was so dominant over that last stretch that Samukonga and Richards were simply fighting for bronze by the end and finished comfortably behind the two leaders.

All Hall could do after he crossed the finish line was shake his head. He seemed as stunned as everyone else in Stade de France, eyes wide open in disbelief. Hall put his arms up and then laid down right on the track to soak in the moment.

MORE: Medal winners for each track and field event

The win was not only the first of Hall's Olympic career, but it was his first Olympic medal at all. He won bronze in the 400-meter at the World Championships in 2023.

The victory was also a modern-day rarity for the United States. Hall became the first American man to win the 400-meter since LaShawn Merritt won in Beijing in 2008. Merritt was the seventh consecutive American winner of the men's 400-meter, but the U.S. was shut out of the top spot in 2012, 2016 and 2020, failing to even medal in 2012 or 2020.

Lyles reacted with just one emoji to describe his fellow USA gold medalist:

Lyles, Hall and 1500m champion Cole Hocker now have two things in common: all three have a gold medal, and all three had to come from behind to earn it."

Let’s dive into the action.

Track and field

Quincy Hall sprinted for his life during the final stretch of the men’s 400-meter race, and it was good enough to win gold.

Hall, 26, was behind three runners during the final 100-meter stretch. But he turned on the afterburners and overcame all three for the gold. He beat Great Britain’s Matthew Hudson-Smith by 0.04 seconds for the win.

“I’ve got determination,” Hall said. “That’s what got me to that line. A lot of hurt, a lot of pain.”

Hall celebrated his improbable victory in memorable fashion, collapsing to the track to make some snow angels.

“I just wanted to keep doing what my coach told me to do, just keep driving and keep driving and get home,” Hall said.

Cycling

Team USA won its first gold medal in team pursuit Wednesday.

The U.S.’ cycling program has been consistently great, medaling in every Olympics since 2012. But this is its first time taking the top spot.

The team of Jennifer Valente, Chloe Dygert, Lily Williams and Kristen Faulkner finished in the first round earlier Wednesday with a time of 4:04.629. Then, they secured the title against New Zealand with a time of 4:04.306.

“I was confident coming in here tonight, especially after qualifying,” coach Gary Sutton said. “They all played their role. I’ve been around long enough to know that you’re only as good as your athletes. I’m very proud of each one of them.”

Dygert said: “I think USA Cycling has put a lot of work and time into this event specifically. When I came into the program in 2016, this was the medal that USA Cycling had wanted more than any other. This has been the focus from the beginning of my career.”

It’s Faulkner’s second gold of the week after she also won the women’s road race event. Dygert also won bronze in women’s time trial.

Swimming

The U.S. artistic swimming team — formerly known as synchronized swimmers — won its first medal in 20 years.

China won gold, while Spain took bronze. All came in the absence of Russia, which has historically dominated the event.

The U.S. team got quite a bit of attention Tuesday when part of its routine included moonwalking upside down — heads in the pool! — to Michael Jackson’s “Smooth Criminal.”

“It’s so worth it. I can hardly believe it,” American Megumi Field said, her silver medal around her neck. “Now we have a silver medal. What happened? I’m so excited.”

Women’s basketball

Is the sky blue? Well then, the U.S. women’s basketball team won a game at the Olympics.

Team USA won its 59th straight Olympic game, beating Nigeria 88-74 to advance to the semifinals.

A’ja Wilson had 20 points and 11 rebounds, while Breanna Stewart added 13 points and five boards, as the States’ frontcourt continues to wreak havoc on opponents.

Boxing

Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting reached the final of the women’s featherweight division Wednesday, winning a unanimous decision over Turkey’s Esra Yildiz Kahraman.

Similar to Algeria’s Imane Khelif, Lin has been a victim of attacks and false accusations about her gender during the Paris Games.

“In the Olympics, making it to the top four means everyone is very strong,” she said after the win. “Some actions taken to win are understandable. I will reflect humbly and hope to do my best.”

CORRECTION (Aug. 7, 2024, 9:45 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated whose recording of “Smooth Criminal” was played during the U.S. artistic swimming team’s technical routine. It was Michael Jackson’s, not Alien Ant Farm’s. It also misstated which round in which Team USA defeated Great Britain in the women’s team pursuit. It was in the first round, not the final."

It was another eventful day of the Olympics, with Team USA getting some huge and historic wins in track and field, artistic swimming, weightlifting and more. Meanwhile, with the final days of the Olympics approaching, knockout games are ramping up for team sports; for the United States, that means some exciting advancements, and some unfortunate eliminations.

Here are the top five stories of the day:

USA women’s basketball cruises to 59th straight win into semis

It wasn't a 54-point win, but it was more than sufficient.

The U.S. women's basketball team cruised past Nigeria, 88-74 in the Olympic quarterfinal round on Wednesday. With the win, USA advances to face Australia in the semifinal round on Friday.

USA previously beat Nigeria, 100-46, in qualifying. Nigeria kept Wednesday's game considerably closer and trailed USA 31-27 early in the second quarter. But USA closed the half on a 21-6 run and never looked back.

The win is USA's 59th straight in Olympic play, a streak that dates back to the 1992 Games. It's now two wins away from its eighth consecutive gold medal. The winner of Friday's semifinal against Australia will face the winner of France-Belgium in the other semifinal for the gold medal.

A'ja Wilson led the U.S. effort with 20 points and 11 rebounds. Jackie Young moved from the bench to the starting lineup and posted 15 points and three rebounds. Breanna Stewart added 13 points, five rebounds and three assists. USA held a 54-41 edge in field-goal percentage, a 44-28 advantage on the boards and assisted on 31 of its 34 made field goals.

Quincy Hall, Kenneth Rooks and Katie Moon make waves in track and field

It was another busy day at the track, with medals in women’s pole vault, the men’s 400 and men’s 3,000-meter steeplechase.

The women's pole vault final was a nail-biter that came down to joint 2024 world champions Katie Moon of Team USA and Nina Kennedy of Australia. The field decreased with each raise of the bar, and was soon down to just three competitors: Moon (who won the gold in this event in Tokyo), Kennedy and Canada's Alysha Newman.

Newman took bronze when she failed to clear 4.90 meters in three tries. Kennedy cleared 4.90 in one attempt, but Moon didn't clear the bar at that height. Moon still had a way to win gold, but it became an extremely narrow path. The judges passed her at 4.90, meaning she had to clear 4.95 to remain in contention for gold. Moon wasn't able to vault over that bar, but was all smiles on the crash pad and she happily congratulated Kennedy, who was thoroughly ecstatic about winning her first Olympic gold medal.

In the men’s 400, Team USA’s Quincy Hall continued an apparently new trend with a come-from-behind win to take gold. Hall overtook pre-race favorite Matthew Hudson-Smith with 10 meters to go, finishing with a personal-best 43.40 seconds. His time was four-hundredths of a second faster than Smith, and Zambia’s Muzala Samukonga took bronze with a 43.74.

However, Ethiopia’s Lamecha Girma, who can be seen in the video below falling over one of the race’s final barriers, had to be stretchered off the track after receiving medical treatment.

USA artistic swimming earns silver with the help of some moonwalking

The United States' artistic swimming team performed a strong acrobatic routine Wednesday that gave the team a silver medal and the U.S.'s first medal in the event since 2004.

The team went viral earlier this week for their impressive underwater moonwalking to Michael Jackson's ""Smooth Criminal"" during their technical routine on Monday, the first of three rounds in the team competition. Team USA followed up that crowd-pleaser with a strong free routine that moved them into second place going into the final event. The Americans then finished off their run with a stellar acrobatic routine — consisting of jumps and lifts in the water, similar to a partially submerged cheerleading routine — to take silver.

China, who is always stellar at artistic swimming, took gold with an incredibly dominant performance. China finished with 996.1389 points, more than 81 ahead of the U.S. and nearly 300 points above the last-place competitor, Egypt.

American Hampton Morris earns historic bronze medal in weightlifting

Hampton Morris made history on Wednesday, becoming the first American man to win an Olympic weightlifting medal since 1984. Morris won bronze after hoisting a combined weight of 298 kilograms (656.98 pounds), while China's Li Fabin took gold with 310 kg, and Thailand's Theerapong Silachai took silver with 303 kg.

The 20-year-old, 135-pound Morris trains mostly out of his garage at his home, and it's been a quick rise through the ranks for him, setting 10 world records in the youth, junior and senior age divisions.

""It's amazing that I'm able to leave that kind of mark in the sport,"" Morris said. ""I'm just in disbelief.""

Team USA has some key advancements — with a few tough eliminations

Wednesday was another jam-packed day for Team USA, with several teams competing in crucial knockout round matchups. Beyond women's basketball keeping the win streak alive, men's water polo was able to get a comeback against Australia to move on to the semifinals.

But on the other end, there were some tough eliminations. USA men's volleyball fell to Poland in five sets in the semifinals, missing out on the final and a chance to earn gold. However, the team will play Italy for bronze on Friday, with a chance of earning the United States' sixth-ever Olympic medal in men's volleyball.

Beach volleyball was also tough for the U.S., after Miles Partain and Andrew Benesh — the last remaining American pair — were knocked out of the competition. Partain and Benesh fell to Qatar in straight sets in the quarterfinals, leaving the United States without a spot in either set of semifinals in a sport the country is normally dominant in.

One more thing ... U.S. figure skating gets their gold medals

After more than two years of arbitration, the United States figure skating finally received their gold medals for the 2022 Beijing Olympics. The U.S. initially placed silver in the Games, but Russian skater Kamila Valieva testing positive for a banned substance after Russia had already won gold affected the podium. Due to the confusion, the IOC opted not to hand out figure skating team medals until things were sorted out.

On Wednesday, the American team — Vincent Zhou, Nathan Chen, Karen Chen, Evan Bates, Madison Chock, Zachary Donohue, Brandon Frazier, Madison Hubbell and Alexa Knierim — received their gold medals in a ceremony in Paris, on a stage in front of the Eiffel Tower. Japan, which moved into second with the ruling, joined the U.S. to receive their silver medals."
Quincy Hall comes from behind to win gold in the Olympic men's 400-meter race.,https://www.outkick.com/sports/american-quincy-hall-mens-400m,"There have been some incredible performances on the track at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, and we've got another wild come-from-behind win for an American runner.

This time it was Quincy Hall who pulled off an incredible performance to stick the US flag on top of the podium.

Coming into the final 100 meters of the race, Hall — a Kansas City native — found himself in fourth place.

So, how does one manage to pull from fourth to first in the final 100 meters of the gold medal final at the Olympic Games?

Easy: you find another gear that no one else in the race seems to have and you dig deep all the way to the finish line.

What a performance from Hall, which he topped off with a snow angel on the track, which if you think about what tracks feel like, that sounds very painful. It'd be like going snow angels on 60-grit sandpaper. Maybe even lower grit.

Also, another electrifying call from the voice of IndyCar Leigh Diffey. He caught some flack for saying the wrong dude won the 100m in a photo finish. Big whoop. Between this and his call of the men's 1500m, he's been fantastic.

But I digress…

While that was far and away Hall's most exciting run of the Olympics. it wasn't his only impressive one.

While he had to come from behind in the final, Hall breezed to a victory in his semifinal heat and it looked like he barely broke a sweat.

I mean, I don't think he could have made that look any easier.

Impressive stuff from the 26-year-old out of the University of South Carolina who is competing in his first Olympics.

Maybe we'll see him back in Los Angeles four years from now, but if not, he threw down a performance people will be talking about for a long time."

We've been treated to some epic performances on the track so far during the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Obviously, there's Noah Lyles' incredibly close win in the men's 100-meter sprint. There was also Julien Alfred's impressive women's 100-meter win, too. We can't forget about Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone's record semi-final run or Cole Hocker's amazing 1500-meter win.

Now, we can add Quincy Hall's 400-meter run to this list.

Hall miraculously won gold in the 400m after falling behind the pack early on. During the last leg of the race, Hall somehow just seemed to will himself to victory. His steps seemed just as heavy as his competition's were. But, with every single one, he inched closer and closer to the lead. It was thrilling.

The moment will absolutely give you chills. Watch it here.

Hall's victory is kind of coming out of nowhere. Most people probably don't know too much about him. If you're one of those folks, don't worry. We got you.

Here are three facts that you need to know about Quincy Hall.

This was Hall's first Olympic medal

Talk about making a mark in your debut. This was Hall's very first Olympics ever and the race he was making his Olympic debut in.

It ended with a gold medal.

Congrats Quincy Hall!

What a moment.

His 43.40 time was a personal best

Hall's time the best he'd ever run in the 400-meter race and he needed every single second of it, too.

This was legitimately the fastest field ever in this race. There were five runners, including Hall, who posted a sub-44 second time. That's unheard of in the 400m.

First 400m race in history with four men under 44 seconds.

He's the first American man to win gold in the 400m since 2008

The last time an American won a gold medal in this race was in 2008 when LaShawn Merrit won it in the 2008 Beijing Games. Before that, the USA claimed every gold medal in the 400-meter race from 1984 to 2008.

With his personal-best time in a record-breaking field, Hall broke a 16 year medal drought.

He went to the University of South Carolina

Hall was a four time All-American sprinter at South Carolina.

He won the 2019 NCAA Outdoor National Championship in the 400-meter hurdles and the 2019 SEC Indoor and Outdoor championship in the 400-meter race with no hurdles. He'd also previously won a bronze medal at the World Championships in 2023.

He's got a sweet golden grill

And, no, I'm not talking about the one for burgers. Look at this smile, man.

QUINCY HALL. OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST.

It seems the US Track and Field team in Paris is building quite a penchant for dramatic finishes. Hall’s incredible comeback from behind also has everyone from Hollywood stars to former NFL icons buzzing with excitement.

Hall’s performance has captivated everyone because things looked bleak for Team USA as the sprinters neared the final bend. However, just like Cole Hocker in the 1500m event, the 26-year-old turned on the after-burners, jumping from fourth to first place when he crossed the finish line. “As long as I can start the race, I know I can finish,” the newly crowned champion said.

“You can’t outrun a dog. A dog will chase you forever,” added Quincy Hall, explaining the mentality that urged him to chase the win. NFL legend-turned-ESPN analyst Shannon Sharpe was absolutely ecstatic with the track athlete’s performance and his will to win. “Let’s GOOOOOOOOOOOO @dogg8bg. That’s what I’m talking…” Sharpe wrote on X.

What’s your reaction? Quincy Hall's Paris Olympics claim backed by Shannon Sharpe and Kevin Hart! React! Reactions

“Running a lifetime best of 43.40 in the biggest moment and ‘TOOK’ gold in the men’s 400 meters. We’re back baby. American men use on the race…. WE BCK!” added the ecstatic analyst. Hollywood star and comedian Kevin Hart made an even more direct reference to the Olympic champion’s dogged will to win.

“Congrats Champ @QuincyHall400 got that Dawg in him!!” Hart posted on X. Last week, Hall told EssentiallySports, “I’m ready to run, and I hope you guys are ready to run too.” Now we know exactly why he was so confident! Quincy Hall also spilled the beans on the secret behind his new PB.

The secret to Quincy Hall’s late surge

Although the 400m falls under the sprint category, it’s the sweet spot between all-out speed and pacing. However, the 26-year-old revealed he has a history of racing in events where pacing is king. “I have a pretty big engine. I used to run cross country. I put a lot of mileage in, a lot of stuff like that,” explained the sprinter. Thanks to his enhanced stamina, the sprinter found the fuel for an incredible push as the rest of the field lost ground.

However, the 4x400m world champion’s strength was another reason behind his success. As Quincy Hall dropped down from middle-distance, running to sprinting, he worked on his strength. The Paris Olympics 400m champion explained that he worked on foot speed and jump to give the explosive power he utilized to perfection during the final stage of the race in Stade de France.

Quincy Hall oozed with confidence after earning Team USA’s first 400m Olympics gold medal since 2008. Last year, the 26-year-old had promised track and field fans that he would get better this year. So, what better way to prove his point than winning an Olympic gold?"
Quincy Hall comes from behind to win gold in the Olympic men's 400-meter race.,https://www.thescore.com/news/3050233/related,"SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) — As the flash of red, white and blue streaked past one sprinter — then the next, then the next — the American man delivering the latest out-of-nowhere comeback on the track said he had one thing going through his mind: “Get home, son! Get home, son!”

Quincy Hall got home in first, then fell to the ground and did snow angels.

Just another routine day in a come-from-behind kind of Olympics for the U.S.A.

Hall reeled in three runners down the stretch of the 400-meter final Wednesday to deliver another heart-stopping win for his country at the Stade de France. He finished in 43.40 seconds, beating Britain's Matthew Hudson-Smith by .04 seconds; they are now the fourth- and fifth-fastest men in history at the distance.

Hall's late push came the evening after American Cole Hocker rocked his sport by coming from way back to beat the favorites in a memorable men’s 1500.

Add in Noah Lyles, whose only lead in his 100-meter thriller Sunday came at the exact point he crossed the finish line, and it's easy to see a pattern.

“I’ve got determination,” Hall said. “That’s what got me to that line. A lot of hurt, a lot of pain.”

The win came about an hour after Lyles advanced to the final of the 200 meters despite finishing second to Letsile Tebogo in his semifinal. Lyles will race for the gold medal Thursday.

Things did not look good for Hall with 100 meters to go

Things looked bad for Hall, a 26-year-old who starred at South Carolina and who breeds dogs, as the eight sprinters approached the final curve.

He was 5 or so meters behind Hudson-Smith and 2012 champion Kirani James, both to his left, and as they rounded the bend, Hall was making up ground on Jareem Richards to his outside. It looked to be shaping up as a good battle for bronze.

With his arms pumping low and wide and his head bobbing, Hall passed them all, then thrust his chest out to beat the Brit. Hall fell to the ground and scissored his arms and legs back and forth — snow angels in 80-degree weather on the bright purple track.

“I just wanted to keep doing what my coach told me to do, just keep driving and keep driving and get home,” Hall said.

Lost in that chaos was Samukonga, the Zambian, who also came from nowhere to take third.

Hall is the first American since LaShawn Merritt in 2008 to capture gold in the one-lap race that the country dominated for decades before that. He joins the likes of Michael Johnson, Jeremy Wariner and Lee Evans among the champions the United States has produced in the most tactical sprint on the track program.

“I knew these guys would get out try to see who they could throw off their race,” he said.

Turns out, not him.

The new champ’s reaction when he crossed the line: “I just won. It’s over. Next four years, I can say I’m Olympic champion.”

US takes silver and almost pulls upset in steeplechase

Morocco’s Soufiane El Bakkali defended his title in men’s steeplechase, finishing in 8 minutes, 6.05 seconds for a .36-second win over America’s Kenneth Rooks.

Rooks had the lead heading into the homestretch and was looking to pull off a massive upset, but El Bakkali overtook him.

Rooks still beat his personal best by almost 9 seconds to capture the second silver over three Olympics in the event for America.

Evan Jager finished second in 2016.

Australia reaches new heights with pole vault win

Nina Kennedy’s title in pole vault gave Australia its 18th gold medal of the Paris Games, an Olympic record for the country.

Kennedy cleared 4.95 meters to beat defending champion Katie Moon of the U.S.

France in the mix in 400 hurdles but must face Warholm

One of France’s up-and-coming track stars, Clement Ducos, outraced Tokyo bronze medalist Alison dos Santos to the line to finish second in the semifinals of the men’s 400 hurdles.

The prize for Ducos: A rematch with world-record holder Karsten Warholm of Norway, who won that heat easily in 47.67.

Warholm and American Rai Benjamin are expected to vie for the title in Saturday's final. Dos Santos, the Brazilian bronze medalist in a super-fast final three years ago in Tokyo, will also be in the lineup.

“Completely crazy what I’ve done here,” Ducos said. “I’m not scared of anything. There are people around me racing really well and posting really good times, but I have to believe I can get a medal.""

Jamaica wins another medal ... in the field

Roje Stona won gold for Jamaica in the men’s discus, setting an Olympic record with a personal-best of 70 meters (229 feet, 8 inches) on his fourth attempt. That gives traditional sprint powerhouse Jamaica four medals in field events so far at the Paris Games — compared to just one on the track.

It marks Hall's first Olympic gold medal, giving him a perfect match to the gold grill that he's worn for the past couple of months. Why is the 26-year-old wearing a gold grill? Is it simply style or does it have a deeper meaning?

The Sporting News explores the topic below.

Why does Quincy Hall have gold teeth at the Olympics?

There isn't a confirmed reason why Hall has been wearing a gold grill for the Olympics and U.S. Olympic trials.

That said, it's likely for style.

Gold teeth have been used for thousands of years, so this is nothing new. It's become a form of self-expression via jewelry, creating fashionable looks from all over the world.

Hall is bringing this look to the largest athletic stage, allowing fans across the globe to see his gold teeth while he wears a gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Grills are notably popular in hip-hop thanks to artists such as Flavor Flav and Nelly. Nelly's 2005 song ""Grillz"" pumped even more steam into the trend after Flavor Flav popularized it in the 1980s.

Hall isn't the only athlete to wear grills either. Alvin Kamara wore a diamond grill in 2021 after receiving a large contract from the Saints. Nika Muhl wore a gold tooth representing Croatia at the 2024 WNBA Draft.

How much does a gold grill cost?

A gold grill can vary in price depending on how specific someone wants it. Muhl's gold tooth was custom-made to pay homage to her home country Croatia.

If someone wanted diamonds on the grill, that would bump the price up more. Of course, the price will increase depending on how many teeth are being included in the grill.

A plain gold grill can cost about $150-250 per tooth, according to icecartel.com. Getting all 32 adult teeth included in the grill would cost $4,800-$8,000 based on this estimation. Prices likely vary depending on location, and it's possible that buying multiple teeth at once will lower the cost per tooth."

On August 7, 2024, at the Stade de France, Hall achieved this milestone not just through speed but with sheer determination, showcasing his remarkable ability to rebound under pressure. His performance during the men's 400-meter final was nothing short of captivating, turning heads and racing hearts as he clawed his way from behind to snag the gold medal.

At 26 years old, Hall entered the competition as relatively unheralded compared to the likes of seasoned competitors like Great Britain's Matthew Hudson-Smith and Zambia’s Muzala Samukonga. The race started with Hall lagging behind; he found himself several meters away from the frontrunners, battling what seemed to be his own limits and the pace of his rivals. Yet, this scenario was not unfamiliar to him. Hall's career has been marked by challenges and comebacks, and this race was poised to be another chapter of perseverance.

The 400-meter sprint is notorious for rewarding strategic pacing and explosive finishing speed. Hall demonstrated the latter of these attributes remarkably well. Rounding the final bend, he was fourth, and all hope for victory seemed dim. But Hall saw his opportunity. With just 50 meters to the finish, he unleashed his trademark kick—a burst of speed many had come to expect from him but never anticipated would come at such a critical moment.

Hall crossed the finish line with a time of 43.40 seconds, marking both his personal best and the fourth-fastest time recorded at the Olympics. His emotional yet gritty performance drew admiration not just from spectators but also from fellow athletes, solidifying his place as part of America’s proud history in the event.

“I don’t give up, man,” Hall said after the race, his voice ringing with the weight of his accomplishment. “I’ve got grit. I grind. I’ve got determination.” This humility rooted in hard work is also what makes Hall’s story so compelling. He reflects the truth of the athletic pursuit: success isn’t solely about natural ability, but also about relentless perseverance.

Hall’s victory came at meaningful moments for Team USA, marking the first Olympic gold medal for the U.S. men’s 400-meter race since LaShawn Merritt’s win back in 2008. It was part of a broader comeback narrative for the American track and field team, which has significantly struggled to maintain its dominant position since the late 2000s.

His triumph is especially poignant considering the broader context of the men’s 400-meter race, where the U.S. had watched its dominance evaporate. Before Hall’s win, American athletes had only secured one medal (a bronze) over the past three Olympic Games. Hall and his teammates have reignited hope for the sport and shown the world the fierce competitiveness of American runners.

The race’s intensity reached its peak within those final seconds as Hall raced not just against his competitors but against the crushing weight of expectation and self-doubt. Runners often battle not just their physical limits but mental obstacles as well. Hall has experienced this duality very personally, with setbacks, injuries, and moments of feeling underappreciated along his path.

Together with Hall's performance was the persistence of fellow American Noah Lyles, who also won gold medals this week, and Cole Hocker, who delivered his own stunning upset victory earlier by capturing gold in the men’s 1500 meters. Their successes form part of a narrative where American athletes are proving they can still shine brightly on this grand international stage.

Little does the public often see the sacrifices behind these victories. Hall recalls his earlier days, particularly the struggle he faced when competing at the community college level, where resources and facilities were scarce. It was during this time he says he learned to fend for himself, sharpening his willpower and ambition. “When you have no food, you've got to get your own food. You find out how to be a dog by yourself,” Hall recalls, noting how those early challenges shaped his character.

Now, as he dons the gold medal, Hall envisions not just his past battles but also what lies on the horizon. He is set to compete again with the men’s 4x400-meter relay team, where he hopes to add another Olympic title to his burgeoning resume. The exhilaration after winning the individual event is palpable; Hall’s victory lap was filled with joy and fulfillment as he soaked up the adulation from fans and realized the dreams he had chased for years were finally coming to fruition.

With his newfound status, Quincy Hall is now inspired to continue advancing his career and legacy, pushing himself and inspiring the upcoming generation of sprinters. His focus on what he needs to continue improving upon isn’t lost on him, as he expressed confidence but also dedication to keep working hard and refining his craft.

Quincy Hall’s narrative exemplifies beauty in persistence—a fighter’s heart ignited by passion for the sport. He represents what all athletes aspire to embody: the relentless quest for greatness, the tenacity to finish strong, pushing past barriers, setbacks, and rivalries.

Reflecting back to the historic foundations of American track and field, Hall’s win points to renewed potential and excitement for the future. Through his grit and triumph, Hall has undoubtedly added to the rich and storied legacy of American athletics, rekindling hopes of continued success on the Olympic stage."
Quincy Hall comes from behind to win gold in the Olympic men's 400-meter race.,https://www.skysports.com/olympics/news/15234/13192847/olympics-2024-matthew-hudson-smith-narrowly-misses-out-on-mens-400m-gold-to-quincy-hall,"Matthew Hudson-Smith narrowly missed out on gold to USA's Quincy Hall in a dramatic men's 400m final at the Paris Olympics.

Hudson-Smith led into the final straight but Hall came roaring back and pipped the Briton by 0.04s as Zambia's Muzala Samukonga took bronze.

Hall had never won a major individual athletics title before and Hudson-Smith was visibly frustrated to be beaten, having come into the event with the fastest time this year.

Hudson-Smith, who won silver at the World Championships last year, ran a national record time of 43.44, just behind the 44.40 of Hall.

He was hoping to become the first British champion in the men's 400m since Eric Liddell 100 years ago at the 1924 Paris Olympics.

""Sometimes the journey is better than the outcome and it's been a hell of a journey,"" Hudson-Smith told the BBC.

""I'm just grateful. I've come away with an Olympic silver. Not many people in the world can say that.

Image: Quincy Hall pipped Matthew Hudson-Smith on the line in the men's 400m

""I've been the bridesmaid twice now. My time is coming, so I'm happy, I'm grateful.

""I saw my family. I didn't even know they were here! That was a shock. I hate them watching me as well. My mum and dad don't really watch me because they hate it, just as much as I hate them watching.

""It's crazy that they came and it's been a hell of a journey.""

It's the second consecutive night a Team GB athlete has been pipped on the line by an American at the Stade de France after Josh Kerr lost out to Cole Hocker in an equally thrilling men's 1500m.

Image: Matthew Hudson-Smith says he's ""grateful"" after he won his first Olympic medal

Hudson-Smith says he didn't know Hall was catching him in the final 50m, despite appearing to glance at the screens in the stadium.

""I set out exactly the way my coach told me to. We knew it would come down to the last 50m,"" he added.

""He had another gear, I hit the gear too late and he had another step on me when he came up.

""But, it's just the start. My time will come, it's just a matter of time.""

USA's Noah Lyles is still on course to complete the sprint double of winning the men's 100m and 200m, but he was second in his semi-final and looked far from his best.

Quincy Hall comes from behind to win gold in the Olympic men's 400-meter race.,https://evrimagaci.org/tpg/quincy-hall-rises-to-glory-with-400-meter-olympic-gold-7957,"Quincy Hall Rises To Glory With 400 Meter Olympic Gold An inspiring comeback story marks Team USA's return to dominance at the Paris Games

At the heart of Paris 2024's electrifying athletic showcase, Quincy Hall has emerged as one of the standout stars, reclaiming glory for Team USA with his astounding performance in the men’s 400-meter final. From being momentarily buried behind the pack to snatching victory at the last moment, Hall’s triumph is echoed not just by the roar of the crowd but by the resurgence of American prowess on the Olympic track.

This past Wednesday night at the Stade de France, Hall pulled off what many call the ultimate comeback. With competitive spirit and raw determination, he crossed the finish line with a time of 43.40 seconds, marking a personal best and the fourth-fastest time ever recorded for this race. His finish was described as nothing short of spectacular, as he managed to outpace opponents who had gained the lead early on.

Hall's personal story adds depth to his athletic achievements. Hailing from Raytown, Missouri, the 26-year-old runner has had his share of struggles, enduring injuries and pulling himself up from community college athletics to the world stage. Each challenge only fueled his determination to reach the pinnacle of his sport. Reflecting on his fierce mindset, he stated, ""I don't give up, man. I just grit. I grind. I've got determination."" It’s clear this mindset paid off as he claimed victory over Great Britain's Matthew Hudson-Smith by just 0.04 seconds, with Zambia’s Muzala Samukonga taking home the bronze.

Despite starting the race well back, Hall's powerful kick down the stretch became his secret weapon. This signature move, honed through countless hours of training, allowed him to sprint past his competitors just before the finish line. His coach had once told him, ""If you don't get far away from me enough, I'm gon' catch you. Every time."" True to his training, Hall finished the last 50 meters with the fastest time among all competitors, clocking it at just 5.94 seconds.

This victory is not only personal for Hall but pivotal for the U.S. Olympic team, as it marks the first gold medal for American men’s 400 meters since LaShawn Merritt's win back at the 2008 Olympics. After years of struggling to regain dominance—one bronze medal since 2008—Hall's success has undeniably marked the rekindling of American excellence in this sprint.

But Hall’s win didn’t come without its share of drama. This Olympics has had its fair share of narrative arcs, with Hall caught up in some friendly fire with fellow American sprinter Noah Lyles. Lyles, the 100-meter gold medallist, had made headlines during the trials, questioning Hall's role on the hypothetical relay team. After throwing shade about Hall not making the ideal team, the two runners had exchanged jabs online. Hall, not one to back down, shot back, reminding Lyles of his own place to earn his gold.

Hall’s victory lap, draped with the American flag and his sneakers off, was captured by numerous cameras and broadcasted across the globe, showcasing not just his success but the joy and pressure of representing his country. That moment was packed, too, with emotions reflecting the long road Hall traveled to get there. Throughout his career, he faced many ups and downs, but he frequently highlights the role of hard work and sheer grit. ""When you have no food. You’ve got to get your own food. No cafeteria. No study hall. None of those luxuries. You find out how to be strong by yourself,"" he once explained.

Before transitioning to focus solely on the flat 400 meters, Hall was also the NCAA champion for the 400-meter hurdles, adopting tactics from both events to refine his strategy. Now, Hall is poised for even more glory, as he will compete again soon for the 4x400-meter relay where he just might add another gold medal to his collection.

The atmosphere around the stadium has echoed with cheers and passionate fans, and as more than 10,000 athletes compete over the next weeks, Hall’s achievement stands tall among the most dramatic plots. His triumph not only revitalizes American track and field but serves as inspiration for aspiring athletes everywhere—to push through the struggles, overcome adversity, and claim the victory waiting at the finish line.

Hall’s comeback story, filled with hard-fought resilience and the relentless pursuit of excellence, illustrates what the Olympic spirit embodies. From overshadowed beginnings to dazzling triumphs, Quincy Hall has proven to the world—and to himself—that with hard work and fierce determination, anything is possible. This is just the beginning, after all."

Afterward, De Grasse revealed he had a hamstring injury that first surfaced a month ago. He only missed a week of training before re-aggravating it this week.

""It was gonna be tough today,"" De Grasse said. ""I warmed up and I kind of didn't really feel it but I knew I just wanted to try and try and do my best and see what I could come up with.""

De Grasse racing without personal coach

De Grasse admitted that the situation with his coach, Rana Reider, having his accreditation revoked on Tuesday, also served as a distraction.

Without getting into specifics, the Canadian Olympic Committee said it found new information on Sunday ""about the appropriateness of Mr. Reider remaining accredited by Team Canada at the Paris 2024 Games. In discussion with Athletics Canada, it was agreed that Mr. Reider's accreditation be revoked.""

U.K. media outlets have reported the decision is tied to concerns over the ""safeguarding"" of athletes and allegations of sexual and emotional abuse, and court documents filed in Broward County, Fla., show three women have filed suit against Reider related to alleged sexual and emotional abuse.

Reider's U.S.-based lawyer, Ryan Stevens, said Reider is ""suddenly, and without due process, being denied the right to continue coaching athletes competing in the Paris 2024 Olympic Games,"" based on what Stevens called ""years-old claims in a lawsuit by former athletes seeking financial gain.""

Stevens said Reider currently has no sanctions against him by the U.S. Center for SafeSport, USA Track & Field or Athletics Canada.

""I tried to keep my head up and stay mentally strong but of course, that's always a tough one,"" De Grasse said. ""Not having your coach out there who leads you through these Games and being with you all year, so definitely is a tough one.""

'I didn't know the issue'

De Grasse said he found out at the same time as everyone else.

""I didn't know the issue,"" he said. ""Of course, I left [him] back in 2023 when everything went down, he served his time, everything was good, I went back. My federation, everybody said it was good to go, he was all cleared.

""They gave him accreditation and all of a sudden I guess there was a new case. I knew nothing about it, kind of just sprung on to me the same time you guys knew. So of course that's a tough one to swallow to try to just know about that right before you're about to run.""

With the 4x100 relay opening round coming on Thursday morning, De Grasse said he'd ""try to support my team any way I can.""

Lyles to race for 2nd gold

Noah Lyles will race for his second Olympic gold medal despite finishing second in the 200-metre semifinal, his first loss at that distance in three years.

Letsile Tebogo of Botswana finished the heat in 19.96 seconds, beating Lyles by .12 and marking the first time the American has lost a 200 of any kind since he finished third at the Tokyo Games.

It opened up a 24-hour period to debate and discuss the meaning of the second-place finish, which still earned Lyles an automatic qualifying spot in Thursday night's final but could have him running the curve from a less-than-ideal lane.

Last weekend, Lyles notably lost both his opening heat and the semifinal round of the 100, before coming back to eke out a .005-second victor y over Jamaica's Kishane Thompson in the final. That win came about 90 minutes after another Jamaican, Oblique Seville, beat him in the semifinal for that sprint.

Quincy Hall grabs out-of-nowhere men's 400m win

Quincy Hall became the latest American to electrify Olympic track and field with an out-of-nowhere comeback Wednesday night, sprinting from far behind in the 400 meters to reel in three runners and capture the gold medal.

Hall, buried in fourth place as the runners rounded the last bend, outran the runner on his outside, then two more to the inside to cross the line in 43.40 seconds, the fourth-fastest time ever, then dropped to the track to do snow angels to celebrate.

""The race was anyone's at that point. I just wanted to keep doing what my coach told me to do, keep driving and keep driving,"" Hall said. ""We focus on coming home at the end of each practice, so that was nothing more than me just trying to go hard like I am used to doing.""

Britain's Matthew Hudson-Smith finished second and Muzala Samukonga of Zambia finished third.

""Last year I came in injured and was like, 'let's see what happens'. This year I came in ready and just ran the fifth-fastest time of all time (43.44 seconds). I just got bested by a better man on the day. I can't complain, I left everything on the table,"" Hudson-Smith said. ""We knew the last 50 was going to determine who got the gold and he got the last step on me, and that is all she wrote.""

Hall is the first American since LaShawn Merritt in 2008 to capture gold in the one-lap race. His victory came an evening after American Cole Hocker came from far behind late to beat the favourites in the men's 1500.

Other Canadian results

Earlier Wednesday, Moh Ahmed failed to advance to the 5,000-metre final after falling in his heat.

The 33-year-old from St. Catharines, Ont., was in the top seven with about 400 metres left in the race when he seemingly tripped over the leg of a runner in front of him and took a fall. A handful of other runners fell not long after in a similar fashion.

The top eight from each of the two qualifying heats on Wednesday advance to Saturday's final.

In the men's 800, Edmonton's Marco Arop qualified for Friday's semifinals finishing second in Heat 1 with a time of 1:45.74. Arop is the reigning world champion in the event.

The 29-year-old improved his European record to 43.44 seconds but was pipped on the line by American Quincy Hall, who triumphed in a personal best 43.40 in a thrilling conclusion.

It was another agonising near-miss on a global stage for Hudson-Smith, who went within 0.09secs of the world title 12 months ago.

Hudson-Smith, who was favourite for gold as the fastest man in the world in 2024, becomes the first Briton to make the men's 400m podium at a Games in 28 years.

Victory would have made him GB's first male Olympic 400m champion since Eric Liddell 100 years ago - a success immortalised in Chariots of Fire - but he fell just short.

However, this was another outstanding performance by Hudson-Smith and he was denied gold only by a sensational finish from Hall, who chased down his rivals in the closing stages.

The Wolverhampton man held the lead coming in to the home straight but was unable to hold out as Hall fought his way from third to first.

Hudson-Smith put three years of ""absolute hell"" behind him to win world bronze in 2022, before going so close to his first global triumph in Budapest last year.

Silver at the Stade de France will have brought a mixture of emotions given his determination to win gold - but he will be undoubtedly proud of his journey.

""It is just the start really. Time to build,"" Hudson-Smith, who is now the fifth fastest 400m runner in history, told BBC Sport.

""I'm healthy. My time is going to come, it is only a matter of time.""

(ThyBlackMan.com) The Stade de France was electric on Wednesday night as Quincy Hall delivered a performance for the ages, winning gold in the men’s 400-meter race. This victory, reminiscent of the golden days of American sprinting, marks a significant comeback for Team USA in an event that had seen a decline in dominance over the past few Olympic cycles.

Who is Quincy Hall?

Quincy Hall’s journey to the pinnacle of Olympic success is nothing short of inspirational. Born in Kansas City, Missouri, Hall’s path to the gold medal was paved with perseverance, grit, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. Unlike some of his predecessors, Hall’s rise to fame wasn’t immediate. He honed his craft at the community college level before transferring to the University of South Carolina, where he began to make a name for himself in collegiate athletics.

Hall’s talent was evident early on, but his journey was marred by injuries that threatened to derail his career. However, his determination and resilience saw him through the tough times. He fought back from each setback, using the challenges as fuel to propel himself forward. His performance at the NCAA Championships and subsequent competitions showcased his potential, but it was his gold medal run in Paris that cemented his place among the greats.

The Significance of Hall’s Victory

Hall’s gold medal win is more than just a personal triumph; it represents a resurgence of American dominance in the men’s 400 meters. The last American to win gold in this event was LaShawn Merritt in 2008, and since then, the American men had only managed to secure one bronze medal in the subsequent Olympic Games. This dry spell was a stark contrast to the golden era of American 400-meter runners like Michael Johnson, who set the standard with his iconic performances.

Quincy Hall’s victory is a return to form for a nation that prides itself on its sprinting prowess. His time of 43.40 seconds was a personal best and a testament to his hard work and dedication. The race itself was a dramatic affair, with Hall executing a come-from-behind strategy that saw him overtake his competitors in the final 100 meters. His determination was palpable as he strained and pushed through the pain, delivering a performance that will be remembered for years to come.

The Race: A Breakdown

The men’s 400-meter race in Paris was one of the most anticipated events of the Olympic Games. With reigning world champion Antonio Watson of Jamaica absent, the field was wide open, and several athletes were tipped as potential winners. Among them were Great Britain’s Matthew Hudson-Smith, who had bested Hall at the 2023 World Championships, and Grenada’s Kirani James, a veteran with three Olympic medals to his name.

As the race began, Hall got off to a steady start, maintaining a strong pace through the first 300 meters. However, as they came out of the final turn, it seemed as though Hall might be in trouble. His unique running style, characterized by a visible struggle against an invisible foe, made it appear as though he was running out of steam. But it was in these final moments that Hall’s true strength shone through.

One by one, he picked off his competitors, who were fading fast. Hall, on the other hand, seemed to find another gear, getting stronger with every stride. His kick in the final 100 meters was nothing short of phenomenal, propelling him past his rivals and into first place. By the time he crossed the finish line, he had left no doubt about who the best 400-meter runner in the world was.

The Impact of Winning Gold

Winning an Olympic gold medal is a life-changing event for any athlete, and for Quincy Hall, it is the culmination of years of hard work, sacrifice, and perseverance. This victory not only places him in the annals of Olympic history but also opens up numerous opportunities for his future, both on and off the track.

Financial and Sponsorship Opportunities

An Olympic gold medal brings with it significant financial rewards. Hall can expect to see a surge in sponsorship deals and endorsements from major brands looking to associate themselves with his success. Companies in the sports apparel, fitness, and health sectors will likely vie for his endorsement, providing him with lucrative deals that can secure his financial future.

Increased Media Exposure

With his gold medal win, Hall will become a household name, especially in the United States. Increased media exposure means more opportunities for public appearances, interviews, and possibly even roles in commercials and advertisements. This visibility can help him build a personal brand that extends beyond athletics, allowing him to leverage his fame for various ventures.

Inspirational Figure

Hall’s story is one of overcoming adversity, and his success will serve as an inspiration to many. Young athletes, particularly those facing their own struggles, will look up to him as a role model. His journey demonstrates the power of resilience and hard work, providing a blueprint for others to follow in his footsteps.

Legacy in the Sport

Winning gold at the Olympics secures Hall’s place in the history of track and field. He joins the ranks of legendary American 400-meter runners and will be remembered as the athlete who brought the gold medal back to the United States after a 16-year drought. This legacy will inspire future generations of athletes to strive for greatness in the sport.

The Future for Quincy Hall

Looking ahead, Quincy Hall’s future in athletics looks incredibly promising. With the confidence gained from his Olympic triumph, he will be a formidable competitor in upcoming World Championships and Olympic Games. His performance in Paris has set a high standard, and he will undoubtedly aim to maintain and exceed this level in future competitions.

Continued Development and Training

Hall’s focus will now shift to building on his success. This means continuing to train at an elite level, working on his technique, and addressing any areas for improvement. His ability to stay injury-free will be crucial, and he will likely work closely with his coaches and medical team to ensure he remains in peak condition.

Mentorship and Giving Back

As Hall’s career progresses, he will have the opportunity to mentor younger athletes, sharing his experiences and knowledge to help them succeed. Giving back to the community and supporting the next generation of athletes will be an important part of his legacy. Whether through coaching, speaking engagements, or community outreach programs, Hall’s impact will extend beyond his own achievements.

Quincy Hall is not just a gold medalist; he is a champion in every sense of the word.

SAINT-DENIS, France — With his arms in the air, his legs spinning and his face twisted into a grimace, Quincy Hall kept coming, even when he seemed hopelessly behind.

Hall finished a distant fourth in the 400-meter final at the Olympics, with no purple lane between him and the finish line.

With 50 metres to go, he sped past the fading former Olympic champion Kirani James. With 40 metres to go, he ran over Jereem Richards as if the Trinidadian’s shoes were made of cement. Only the pre-race favourite, Matthew Hudson-Smith of Great Britain, was ahead of him, and Hall passed him too.

“You can’t outrun a dog,” Hall said. “A dog will follow you forever.”

Hall captured Olympic gold on Wednesday night with a never-give-up resilience that won’t soon be forgotten. He passed a stunned Hudson-Smith with 10 meters to go, leaned toward the finish line, then stared at the video board to make sure what he thought he had just witnessed was real.

Hall’s winning time was a personal best of 43.40 seconds, the fourth-fastest time ever run by a man over 400 meters. That was four-hundredths of a second faster than Hudson-Smith, now the fifth-fastest in history over 400 meters.

Five of the eight men in the final clocked times under 44 seconds. Zambia’s Muzala Samukonga ran 43.74 to take bronze, his country’s second medal ever and first since 1996.

When Hall was asked when he knew he would win, he replied dryly, “As soon as they fired that gun.”

“You can’t get far enough,” he said matter-of-factly. “That’s what I’m known for. If you don’t get far enough away, I’ll get you every time.”

The determination that has become Hall’s trademark is a byproduct of the obstacle-laden path he’s taken to the top of his sport. After high school, he enrolled in the College of Sequoias, a community college in California that Hall said had no student housing or cafeteria. He worked two jobs to pay for tuition, food and a place to sleep at night.

“That’s where I feel like I’ve become the dog I say I am,” Hall said.

As a pro, Hall trains without partners — and sometimes alone. Curtis Allen, the coach he met in high school, shouts instructions down the phone.

Hall, a former NCAA 400-meter hurdles champion at South Carolina, began his pro career with a focus on that event. For two years, his best times in the 400-meter hurdles were fast, but not in the same league as Rai Benjamin, Karsten Warholms and Alison Dos Santos.

Earlier this summer, Hall told Olympics.com that he was “wasting time” running that event as a pro. On Wednesday night, he called shifting his focus to the Open 400 two years ago the “best decision of my life.”

When Hall won a bronze medal at last year’s world championships in Budapest and ran his first sub-44-second times this summer, he developed a reputation for a fearsome kick. He had developed his endurance when he was younger. In high school, he ran everything from the 200, to the 400, to the 800, to the 1,500. Sometimes he did them all in the same race. In junior college, he won the 400, and 20 minutes later he was lining up for the 400 hurdles.

Hudson-Smith said his coaches warned him about Hall’s kick in the last 50 meters of a race. As a result, he “got the f—- out,” as he put it, by pushing the pace early and building a lead on the final straight.

Hall was blind to the rest of the field in lane eight on Wednesday night and came out faster than normal, but it still wasn’t fast enough. The pace was so high that Hall made up a lot of ground going into the final 100 meters.

As Hall ran, he said to himself, “Go home, son.” He thought of all the grueling workouts he’d done alone. He thought of dragging himself through junior college. He thought of his two brothers who had died young, his mother, and his two young daughters.

Hudson-Smith admitted he was surprised by Hall’s heroic last-minute attack.

“I thought I had it,” Hudson-Smith said. “If you’re going to win, you’re going to have to take it from me. That’s exactly what he did.”

Last month, during a podcast appearance, Noah Lyles considered which sprinters to include in his dream U.S. 4×400-meter relay. Notably absent from Lyles’ selections was Hall, the man who won the U.S. 400-meter title at the Olympic Trials last June.

Christopher Bailey was Lyles’ choice to start. Lyles identified himself as the best option for the second stage, even though he is known primarily as a short sprinter. Michael Norman and Benjamin were Lyles’ choices for the penultimate stage and the anchor position.

“The only reason I wouldn’t use the current U.S. champion is I just don’t think he would be a starter,” Lyles explained. “Using him in the first leg would almost be a waste of his talents.”

On July 19, Hall tagged Lyles in a post on X, writing, “My blocks are ready whenever you feel like you can beat me at the 400.”

“You were talking [too] “I’m putting a lot of my name on your little podcast,” Hall added. “I don’t do the little slick comments and remarks. I stand in line.”

It’s probably safe to assume that Lyles wouldn’t leave Quincy Hall out again if he had a do-over. Hall lined up against seven of the world’s best quarter-milers, saw a few of them get a lead, and then roared back to beat them all."

Hall’s performance will be hard to forget. Despite a slow start, he managed to overcome the deficit and beat the competition. He was in fourth place in the early part of the race but after the last bend, he ran past the runner on the outside before zooming past the remaining two athletes to reach the finish line.

Quincy Hall has brought back the gold to the USA in the 400m race after 16 years

LaShawn Merritt won the gold in the 400m in 2008, since then the gold medal has been out of reach. But Hall’s solid effort has now brought back the gold to the USA. It has been an evening of comebacks for the American athletics diaspora. Cole Hocker won the 1500m race after coming back from behind to upset the favorites in the race.

Quincy Hall (via AP)

Hall’s performance put his resilience and sheer determination on display. If the Olympics were to end today, his finish would be the top contender to earn the award for ‘The best finish to a race.’ Quincy Hall entered the Olympics ranked as the number-one in the world. Matthew Hudson-Smith of Britain clocked in the fastest time of the year and had a steady start in the finals of the 400m race.

He had the edge over Hall for most of the race. It appeared that he was destined to race his way to the gold medal but that was before Hall channeled a part of him that fans had not seen. He never gave up. He continued to give his all and within no time, he had zoomed past Hudson-Smith and taken away his gold medal right in front of his eyes. He ended the race and recorded the fastest time ever!

The Detroit Lions’ 2024 season kicks off on Thursday night... well... sort of. After a couple of... let’s call it “spirited” joint practices with the New York Giants, the Lions begin their preseason schedule with a bout in the Meadowlands.

While Lions coach Dan Campbell has more or less said that the Lions will not be playing most (if any) of their starters, there is still plenty to watch on Thursday night. For one, it’s Lions football! There isn’t really any other reason necessary. But, also, if you’re invested in position battles and roster spots, then you’ll be glued to the television for all four quarters.

With a month left until the season, many lingering questions about the Lions remain. Who will be the team’s WR3? How much will they get out of their rookie class? Will their overhauled secondary actually improve? Is Jake Bates good enough to be this team’s kicker? And what’s this kickoff going to look like?

The New York Giants welcome the Carolina Panthers in Week 2 of the NFL preseason on Friday night at MetLife Stadium.

Last week, the Giants jumped out to a 13-3 halftime lead against the Detroit Lions. However, New York couldn't hold the lead late in the fourth quarter as Lions' QB Adrian Martinez sneaked in the end zone from a yard out to give Detroit a 21-16 victory on Aug. 11.

Things were not much better for the Panthers in their preseason debut as they were shut out by the New York Jets 27-0 on Aug. 12.

The Giants and Panthers have played each other eight times prior in the preseason, however this is the first meeting since Aug. 13, 2011. Carolina won that matchup 20-10 at Bank of America Stadium.

The Giants will begin life without Saquon Barkley, forging ahead with stud rookie wide receiver Malik Nabers as well as free-agent acquisition Devin Singletary. Coach Brian Daboll will be hoping Daniel Jones can stay healthy and New York can get back into the playoffs after a tough-luck 2023 season.

Jared Goff and the Lions, meanwhile, are coming off a massive season in which they went 12-5 and nearly punched their ticket to the Super Bowl. Detroit lost 34-31 to the 49ers in the NFC title game, and an A-plus showing in free agency and the draft has them among the class of the NFL once again this season.

The Giants have four Super Bowl titles, two under Bill Parcells and two under Tom Coughlin, but they're just 1-1 in the playoffs since Eli Manning retired. New York will be looking to bounce back after a tough year of injuries in 2023, an unfortunate follow-up to a 9-7-1 season and playoff berth in 2022.

The Lions have never won it all, but they enjoyed their best postseason in franchise history last year and look poised to take the league by storm again in 2024. With Amon-Ra St. Brown, Jahmyr Gibbs, Sam LaPorta and Aidan Hutchinson, four of the best young players in the NFL, the sky is the limit.

This marks the first preseason game for both teams, so expect to see many rookies get playing time. Roster-cut decisions come quickly, so these exhibition games will play a large part in who makes or misses each team's final 53-man roster.

The 49ers’ asking price for Brandon Aiyuk revealed as trade drama continues.,https://nypost.com/2024/08/08/sports/49ers-asking-price-for-brandon-aiyuk-revealed-amid-trade-drama/,"The 49ers are looking for major compensation for receiver Brandon Aiyuk.

The defending NFC champions are seeking two first-round picks in exchange for their star wideout, as reported by Steel City Insider’s Jim Wexell.

Aiyuk, 26, recently requested a trade from San Francisco after they could not agree on a long-term contract.

The Pittsburgh Steelers engaged in negotiations with San Francisco on Tuesday, per ESPN, which followed reports Monday that the Browns and Patriots had emerged as the two finalists.

The Patriots have since bowed out of the running.

ESPN’s Adam Schefter referred to the trade talks as an “ever-fluid situation.”

Despite the back-and-forth conversations, the Steelers and 49ers had not made any verbal agreements as of Wednesday night, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

The outlet added that the possible deal wouldn’t require the Steelers sending a player in return.

3 The Steelers are talking out a deal to land Brandon Aiyuk.

AP AP

Any Aiyuk deal would require him agreeing to a long-term extension, meaning both the team (trade assets) and Aiyuk (contract) have to be in agreement for a trade to work.

The Patriots reportedly were willing to make him one of the five highest-paid receivers in the league before pulling out of talks, instead focusing on their young and emerging talent.

3 Will Mike Tomlin’s team soon have a new No. 1 receiver? Barry Reeger-USA TODAY Sports

The Steelers, with their new quarterback room of Russell Wilson and Justin Fields, could use an explosive playmaker after trading Diontae Johnson to the Carolina Panthers earlier this offseason.

The team’s depth chart currently lists George Pickens, Calvin Austin III and Van Jefferson as the starters in three-receiver sets.

Aiyuk would take over as the team’s No. 1 receiver after posting a career-high 1,342 yards for the 49ers last season and helping them advance to the Super Bowl.

It’s still possible Aiyuk could stay with the 49ers and play on his fifth-year option or potentially receive the long-term deal he’s seeking."

The 49ers’ asking price for Brandon Aiyuk revealed as trade drama continues.,https://thescore.com/nfl/news/3049632,"The Pittsburgh Steelers re-engaged in trade talks Tuesday with the San Francisco 49ers about disgruntled wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter.

Talks between the two sides stalled Monday night before picking back up Tuesday, Schefter reports.

NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported earlier Tuesday that the Steelers were ""for sure"" still in the Aiyuk trade sweepstakes. Pittsburgh is one of the teams in talks with the 49ers, joining the New England Patriots and Cleveland Browns, according to Rapoport.

The 49ers reportedly had frameworks of deals completed with the Patriots and Browns on Monday, but the Steelers fell out of the race after failing to meet the 49ers' asking price.

Niners head coach Kyle Shanahan confirmed Tuesday that Aiyuk, who's unhappy with the lack of a long-term extension, can talk to other teams, per 49ers on NBCS.

The 49ers apparently gave the Patriots, Browns, Steelers, and Washington Commanders permission to negotiate a contract with Aiyuk, though the latter pulled out of talks. A lucrative contract extension is expected to follow any potential trade for Aiyuk, who is scheduled to earn $14.1 million in base salary in 2024.

The Patriots have decided not to pursue any further trade possibilities for the 49ers standout receiver, sources told Schefter. The Patriots are excited about their young receivers and will instead focus on developing them.

New England reportedly had an agreement in place with the Niners and a large contract extension offer to Aiyuk on the table, but the disgruntled wideout showed no interest in going there, according to NBC Sports Bay Area's Matt Maiocco.

The Patriots had been targeting Aiyuk for months and were willing to make him one of the top-five highest-paid receivers in the league, a source told ESPN's Mike Reiss.

Patriots head coach Jerod Mayo declined to comment on trade rumors Tuesday, telling reporters that he learned from Bill Belichick not to talk about players on other teams, per NFL.com's Eric Edholm. He also mentioned speaking to wide receiver Kendrick Bourne after rumors suggested the wideout would be involved in a package to acquire Aiyuk.

Aiyuk reportedly requested a trade in July after he and the 49ers couldn't agree on an extension. He reported for training camp but hasn't practiced.

Shanahan told media Tuesday that there's still a possibility of Aiyuk striking an extension with the team, according to Nick Wagoner of ESPN. A scenario where the wideout stays with the 49ers and plays out the final year of his rookie deal is also still on the table, Reiss adds.

San Francisco has been publicly adamant that it wishes to retain Aiyuk, though the team reportedly briefly shopped him and Deebo Samuel at the 2024 NFL Draft before electing to keep them.

""Brandon's a great player, so it's real hard to be better when you lose a great player,"" Shanahan said when asked if the 49ers could be better without the wideout, per NFL Network's Tom Pelissero. ""Hopefully it'll work out best for him and best for us in the long run.""

Aiyuk posted a career-high 1,342 receiving yards on 75 catches last season."
The 49ers’ asking price for Brandon Aiyuk revealed as trade drama continues.,https://www.profootballrumors.com/2024/08/patriots-brandon-aiyuk-offer-eclipsed-28mm-per-year-wr-wants-to-land-with-steelers,"In on Calvin Ridley until the end of his free agency sweepstakes, the Patriots have been connected to both Deebo Samuel and Brandon Aiyuk. New England’s Aiyuk effort became rather serious, though as of midday Wednesday, it does not look like the disgruntled 49er will end up a Patriot.

This is not due to lack of desire on the Pats’ part. The team was prepared to give Aiyuk an extension worth more than $28.5MM per year, according to veteran NFL reporter Josina Anderson. Aiyuk does not hold a no-trade clause, but a team willing to trade assets for the second-team All-Pro will want the pass catcher committed. A report Tuesday night revealed Aiyuk was not sold on the Patriots, and Anderson also indicates the team believes this is the case.

The Steelers do not make a habit of giving outside receiver hires key roles, preferring a draft-and-develop model that has produced sustained success. But the team has been more open to outside additions under third-year GM Omar Khan. Questions outside of George Pickens persist at wideout for the Steelers, who are spending next to nothing at quarterback following the acquisitions of Russell Wilson and Justin Fields. This expands to all positions on offense, essentially, with no eight-figure-per-year payment allocated to a Pittsburgh offensive player.

No deal is in place with Pittsburgh, Bleacher Report’s Jordan Schultz tweets, though the sides continue to hold discussions.

Aiyuk, 26, has held in at 49ers training camp. This comes after months of negotiations did not lead to much (if any) progress. Aiyuk has been tied to wanting a deal in step with Amon-Ra St. Brown‘s $30.01MM-per-year contract and guarantees on the A.J. Brown level. Only Justin Jefferson‘s $110MM guaranteed tops Brown’s number ($84MM). Aiyuk has not shown himself to be in these players’ class just yet, ranking 17th in receiving yards since his 2020 NFL entrance. Though, the 49ers’ target tree has not allowed for WR1-level volume. Aiyuk still managed 1,342 receiving yards on 105 targets last season, and he wants to be paid like a high-end No. 1 weapon.

A Monday report indicated the Patriots and Browns had established Aiyuk trade framework with the 49ers, but multiple suitors being in the mix gives the defending NFC champions leverage. New England also asked about Aiyuk earlier this offseason. Aiyuk’s manageable fifth-year option salary ($14.12MM) would stand to buy the 49ers time, and they would have the option of franchise-tagging him in 2025. That number could hit $25MM, and San Francisco is already projected to be nearly $40MM over the 2025 cap. While that would not make an Aiyuk tag a non-starter, it certainly appears the 49ers are more willing to discuss a deal — as they were during the draft — compared to their stance earlier this summer.

The Titans outbid the Pats for Ridley, who signed a four-year deal worth $92MM in free agency. New England, amid a spree of re-signings and extensions this offseason, kept Kendrick Bourne and used a second-round pick on Washington’s Ja’Lynn Polk. These two join Demario Douglas as the Pats’ top options at receiver, though JuJu Smith-Schuster remains on the team for the time being. De facto GM Eliot Wolf has shown a far greater willingness to pay for talent compared to Bill Belichick, and this Aiyuk offer goes along with this organizational change.

Trading Aiyuk without a known replacement — Ricky Pearsall‘s rookie-year form notwithstanding — would inject considerable risk into San Francisco’s equation. The team has Brock Purdy on what almost definitely will be his final season on a rookie contract, and a host of defensive talent is due for free agency in 2025. Losing Aiyuk now would wound a 49ers team perennially on the championship doorstep. It would also reveal the NFC West team taking a hardline stance on Aiyuk’s value, which it is believed to have pegged in the $26-$27MM-per-year range.

While the 49ers solved Samuel’s trade request/hold-in drama with a $23.85MM-per-year extension, they have encountered tougher sledding in the Aiyuk negotiations — as the WR market has boomed once again. If Aiyuk is dealt, Samuel suddenly would appear more likely to stay. An Aiyuk extension could well lead the older, more versatile player out of town in 2025. We continue to wait on whether the 49ers will pull the trigger here, as Aiyuk’s hold-in will soon pass the two-week point."
The 49ers’ asking price for Brandon Aiyuk revealed as trade drama continues.,https://sports.yahoo.com/brandon-aiyuk-timeline-how-the-relationship-between-the-wr-and-49ers-fell-apart-181316190.html,"In mid-February, it would be hard to say Brandon Aiyuk was happy. His San Francisco 49ers had just lost the Super Bowl. But it seemed, as the 49ers left Las Vegas as a Super Bowl runners-up, that everything was looking positive for the future.

Aiyuk went from being a very good receiver to a star in his fourth season, leading the 49ers in receiving yards. San Francisco was slated to bring practically every key player back for a run at a championship.

About six months later, Aiyuk and the 49ers seemed on the verge of parting for good.

How did we get to a point in which Aiyuk and the 49ers had a falling out, leading to the team reportedly coming to terms with the New England Patriots and Cleveland Browns on the framework of a deal pending a contract extension with Aiyuk? Here's how it went down:

2022 offseason: WR contracts explode

The Tennessee Titans were the last to know the receiver market had changed. They traded A.J. Brown to the Philadelphia Eagles, refusing to pay him big. Reportedly Brown was offered $18 million per season but said he would have stayed for $22 million per season. The Eagles gave him $100 million over four years. Not long afterward that looked like a bargain.

That was also the offseason Tyreek Hill was traded to the Miami Dolphins and got a $120 million extension over four years, and Davante Adams signed a five-year, $140 million extension after being traded to the Las Vegas Raiders. There were big receiver deals before 2022, but that was the offseason the market for the position took off.

All of those moves didn't matter for the 49ers-Aiyuk relationship that much at the moment, but it would in a couple years.

April of 2022: Deebo Samuel's trade request

Also in the 2022 offseason, Samuel requested to be traded by the 49ers. That drama went away on July 31, when Samuel signed a three-year, $71.55 million extension. Aiyuk hadn't had his first 1,000-yard season yet but once he became a top-tier receiver, he had a template to follow.

August of 2023: Nick Bosa holds out

This is a forgotten holdout because Bosa signed a five-year, $170 million deal just before the regular season, played in all 17 games for the 49ers and had a fine season. But Bosa held out for all of August last year. The 49ers eventually agreed with him on a five-year, $170 million extension. Deebo Samuel requested a trade and got his money from the 49ers. Bosa held out and got his money too. Aiyuk watched that happen up close.

Jan. 28: Brandon Aiyuk's biggest moment

Aiyuk had a brilliant season with 1,342 yards, leading the 49ers in receiving by more than 300 yards. But if there's one moment that will be remembered forever, it's Aiyuk's circus catch off a deflected pass in the NFC championship game that gained 51 yards and was the key moment in the 49ers' comeback win. This was the signature moment on a breakout season. That was the high point.

Feb. 13: Hints of a split

The drama started two days after the Super Bowl. Aiyuk's girlfriend posted a message on social media that hinted Aiyuk might not be back with the 49ers. There was an issue with his contract. He was slated to make $14.1 million on the fifth-year option of his rookie deal, but with receivers easily surpassing $20 million and then $25 million per season (or $35 million if you're Justin Jefferson) since the market explosion in 2022, Aiyuk was underpaid. This time, the 49ers wouldn't easily fix the problem.

March 25: John Lynch says 49ers aren't talking trade

Like Nick Bosa and Deebo Samuel, it seemed like the 49ers would figure out a way to make Aiyuk happy. At the NFL scouting combine in late February, 49ers general manager John Lynch said ""Brandon's a guy we want to keep around for a long time."" In March, Lynch reiterated that the plan was to extend Aiyuk. He said the 49ers weren't discussing any trades involving their star receiver.

""[W]e have a good history of working with the guys we want to get done to get something done, and it takes two sides,"" Lynch told reporters, via 49ersWebZone. ""So, can we do that? We'll see. There's a number of different directions that it could go, but we appreciate the heck out of Brandon and who he is as a player. We want him to be a part of the Niners, so we're going to work towards making that a reality.""

Aiyuk replied on social media to Lynch's comments with a series of emojis that seemed to say ""money talks and BS walks.""

April: 49ers stand pat

While there were reports that the 49ers were listening to trade offers on Aiyuk and also Deebo Samuel, nothing happened. Usually if a team trades a player it's before the NFL Draft, so it can get the benefit of that year's draft pick that comes in return. The 49ers selected receiver Ricky Pearsall in the first round, which was an indication that San Francisco was planning for a 2025 season without Aiyuk or Samuel.

June 17: 49ers 'don't want me back'

There were some comments here and there on the situation through the slow time in the NFL, but the one that caught everyone's attention came on a TikTok video. In the video, Aiyuk tells Washington Commanders quarterback and former college teammate Jayden Daniels that ""They said they don't want me back,"" referring to the 49ers. It's hard to believe those were the 49ers' exact words, but likely a reflection that the 49ers weren't budging on long-term contract negotiations. It was clear then Aiyuk's feelings were hurt he hadn't been extended, and the saga wasn't over.

July 16: Trade request

In mid-July, Aiyuk formally requested a trade from the 49ers. That didn't mean Aiyuk was moving. Remember, Deebo Samuel did the same thing two years earlier and got a deal. But once again, it was clear that Aiyuk wasn't going to be happy playing on the final year of his rookie deal.

July 25: 'Hold-in' starts

Aiyuk had used Deebo Samuel's method of requesting a trade. Now it was on to Nick Bosa's strategy of a holdout. Or, rather, a ""hold-in."" Aiyuk would attend meetings but not practice, a fairly new method for players who want to avoid daily fines. Bosa waited more than 40 days and almost to the season opener to get his deal. Aiyuk's situation escalated a lot quicker.

Aug. 5: Trade reports

There were some reports on Monday that perhaps a trade was going to happen, and then NBC Sports Bay Area's Matt Maiocco broke a big story on Monday night. The 49ers had trade framework in place with the Patriots and Browns. They were awaiting Aiyuk to agree to contract terms with one of those teams, because no team would give up valuable assets without an assurance Aiyuk would be with his new team over the long term. The report also revealed that the 49ers allowed Aiyuk to talk to two other teams, the Steelers and Commanders, but the Commanders bowed out and the Steelers didn't meet the 49ers' asking price.

It's safe to say the 49ers didn't prefer to move Aiyuk, one of the NFL's best receivers and a key player to their Super Bowl hopes. But over a contentious summer the two sides couldn't get together for an extension that made Aiyuk happy. But that wasn't the end of the drama.

Aug. 6: Steelers back in, Patriots out?

Without a trade finalized, the Steelers reportedly got back in the running. Reports from NFL Media and ESPN said the Steelers were still in on the Aiyuk talks with the 49ers. The Steelers have been looking for some receiver depth to go alongside George Pickens.

Later that night there was another twist: The Patriots were dropping out of any trade talks with the 49ers, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. That was a surprising change after the report from the night before.

The drama with Aiyuk had been going on for months, so it shouldn't have been a big surprise that there was a little more to go before the situation reached a conclusion."
The Noah Lyles-NBA players beef explained CNN.com.,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/08/sport/noah-lyles-nba-players-beef-explained-spt/index.html,"Paris CNN —

Noah Lyles is a charismatic, boisterous athlete who is not afraid to say what’s on his mind in his effort to push track and field’s profile higher in the sporting world. Last year, however, that put him at odds with some of the most high-profile basketball players in the NBA.

At last year’s world championships, Lyles won the 100-meter and 200-meter races – a double he’s trying to repeat in the Olympics on Thursday night after winning the 100m on Sunday – and wasn’t shy about comparing his accomplishments to those of his professional basketball counterparts back in the US.

When speaking to reporters at the World Championships in Budapest, Lyles was asked about what he wanted to do for track and field and what he’d like to see to improve the sport’s profile.

Lyles said the medals he wins are the first step to raising track’s awareness in the public’s eye and that he wants more former world champions to be present at high-profile meets. And then he took a turn into taking a shot at the NBA.

“You know the thing that hurts me the most is that I have to watch the NBA Finals and they have ‘world champion’ on they head. World champion of what? The United States? Don’t get me wrong, I love the US – at times – but that ain’t the world,” Lyles said.

“We are the world. We have almost every country out here fighting, thriving, putting on their flag to show they are represented. There ain’t no flags in the NBA.”

Lyles’ comment hit on something that sports fans in the rest of the world often mock about US sports culture. In almost every major American sport, the champion of the league is referred to as the world champion, even though those teams only play against other franchises that are based in either the US or Canada.

But the US’ distinct sporting culture means that the four major American sports – football, basketball, baseball and hockey – are head and shoulders above those sports’ domestic leagues in other nations. Most of the best players from around the world in those sports end up playing for American teams, hence the claim to the title of world champion: case and point, the last six NBA MVP awards went to players who were born abroad.

Lyles’ comment was not welcomed by the American NBA players who he had called out.

Two-time NBA champion and 2014 MVP Kevin Durant, who has also been named Finals MVP twice in his illustrious career, led the charge.

“Somebody help this brother,” he wrote on Instagram, responding to an ESPN post.

Four-time NBA champion Draymond Green also got involved, writing on Instagram, “When being smart goes wrong” with the face-palm emoji. Devin Booker, who plays on Team USA in these Olympics and the Phoenix Suns, just simply posted a facepalm emoji.

So if Lyles ends up winning the 100m-200m double, don’t expect very many American NBA players to be celebrating publicly."
Olympic commentator CORRECTED live on air after misgendering USA star.,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/olympics/article-13723689/Olympics-commentator-CORRECTED-misgendering-USA-Raven-Saunders-Paris.html,"The Olympic shot put competition veered towards a gender controversy of its own in Paris on Thursday with non-binary USA athlete Raven Saunders qualifying for the final.

Saunders, back competing after an 18-month ban for missing three doping tests, first caused a stir by adopting the alter-ego of 'The Hulk' - before taking the character to a new level.

Appearing in the games today, they wore a mask, their hair was dyed neon green and purple, gold grills covered their teeth and long fingernails on their left hand were bedazzled in Team USA colors, with the letters H-U-L-K.

But as BBC commentator Steve Backley introduced Saunders, he mistakenly referred to the athlete as female and was corrected by his co-commentator Jazmin Sawyers.

'The colorful character of Raven Saunders back. Good to see her back, sort of. Sort of see her, I mean,' Backley said, referencing Saunders' mask, before Sawyers responded.

'Well we can't actually see them very well. Raven Saunders is actually non-binary and wearing a mask there - we are quite used to seeing them with interesting attire,' Backley said around images of a masked Saunders getting ready to compete.

The moment immediately sparked attention on social media, with one viewer posting on X: 'More gender madness at the Olympics in the women's shot put. The host introduces Raven Saunders, saying 'it's good to see her back'.

'He is promptly corrected by his co-host, saying 'they are actually non-binary'. If they're not a woman, why are they in the women's competition?'

Another Olympics fan wrote: 'Anyone supporting this madness is opening the doors for much more to come. Why do we now bother with women's sports when this continues?'

A different follower said: 'What's with the mask thing? And absolutely, if they don't identify as a woman, they should not be allowed in the women's competitions.'

But equally, Saunders won over some new fans as well. One tweeted: 'I'd never heard of Raven Saunders until about 10 minutes, but now I absolutely adore them. The throwing events need more bad a***s!'

And some viewers were pleased to hear Sawyers correcting Backley. One wrote: 'Love to see field commentator (I assume jaz sawyers) correcting her co-commentator about Raven Saunders' pronouns'.

Another commented: 'Applaud Jasmine Sawyers respecting Raven Saunders' pronouns. Steve Backley not doing so and asking if mask should be allowed.'

But the controversy is the latest chapter of what has been a major talking point across the Paris Games. Women's boxers Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting have faced the brunt of the scrutiny, with claims they both posses male XY chromosomes. Both Lin and Khelif are fighting for gold medals in the coming days.

Saunders, meanwhile, won Olympic silver in Tokyo and at the medal ceremony in Japan, crossed their arms and formed an 'X' with their wrists. Saunders explained the 'X' stood for 'the intersection of where all people who are oppressed meet.'

Speaking Thursday, Saunders said of their outfit: 'I'm in full form. I had to remind the people, I am who I am.

'It is one way to make me stand out and encourage other women. A lot of younger athletes are coming through and they really push their own styles.'

The athlete, who plays piano to relax, has said they use the huge green comic book character of the Hulk to channel their power when competing. ‘That’s when Hulk comes out,’ they added. ‘The Hulk was smashing everything that needed to be smashed.’

After scratching on their first throw, they recorded 17.93 meters on their second and 18.62 on their final to ensure their spot in the final on Friday.

A BBC source said Backley’s comments were ‘unintentional’, adding: ‘Jazmin Sawyers immediately clarifies that Raven Saunders is non-binary for audiences.’"

Saunders, 28, identifies as non-binary and uses they/them pronouns. They won a silver medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics before facing an 18-month ban for failing to show up for three doping tests in a 12-month period. They have since served the suspension and returned to competition.

Backley, who was also a Team Great Britain javelin thrower, was commenting on Saunders’ comeback when he made the mistake.

“The colorful character of Raven Saunders back,” Backley said, referring to their multicolored dyed hair. “Good to see her back, sort of. Sort of see her, I mean.”

Saunders first began wearing a mask during the pandemic and opted to continue doing so as a way to block out distractions. They wore an Incredible Hulk mask during the games in Tokyo and have since described it as a way of channeling their Hulk alter-ego.

“Through my journey, especially dealing with mental health and things like that, I learned how to compartmentalize, the same way that Bruce Banner learned to control the Hulk, learned how to let the Hulk come out during the right moments, and that way it also gave him a sign of mental peace,” Saunders said in a 2021 interview with Yahoo Sports. “But when the Hulk came out, the Hulk was smashing everything that needed to be smashed.”

However, Saunders' 'mantra' is that 'nothing in the world will stop me being great', according to i News.

Saunders, who is non-binary and uses they/them pronouns, told the outlet: ""I am constantly sitting myself down and looking in that mirror and reminding myself, 'You’re Raven, The Hulk. You will achieve it'.""

However, the athlete was misgendered by BBC commentator, Steve Backley, so described Sawyers as 'her' during the women’s shot put qualifying event at the Stade de France.

Saunders' correct pronouns were then pointed out by BBC co-commentator Jazmin Sawyers.

The shot putter, who was rocking purple and green hair during the sporting event, garnered a lot of attention for wearing a face mask during the competition with many viewers wondering the reason.

Now, the reasoning behind them donning a face mask to compete is pretty simple - when trying out for Olympic qualifying events in 2020 and 2021, athletes had no other choice but to wear masks due to Covid rules at the time.

Saunders eventually got used to wearing the mask while shot putting, so it stuck around.

Furthermore, they discovered that wearing the mask stopped them from 'getting caught up in pre-competition chat'.

It helped the athlete focus on their mind rather than anything else.

During the shot put event, Backley, a former world record Team GB javelin thrower, could be heard saying: ""The colourful character of Raven Saunders back.

""Good to see her back, sort of. Sort of see her, I mean.""

Sawyers, a Great Britain long jumper, then responded: ""Well we can’t see them very well.

""Raven Saunders is actually non-binary and wearing the mask there, we’re quite used to seeing them with interesting attire.""

And as for why Sawyers refers to themselves as the Hulk, they told Yahoo: ""Early on, similar to the Hulk, I had a tough time differentiating between the two; I had a tough time controlling when the Hulk came out or when the Hulk didn’t come out.

Advert

""But through my journey, especially dealing with mental health and things like that, I learned how to compartmentalise, the same way that Bruce Banner learned to control the Hulk, learned how to let the Hulk come out during the right moments and that way it also gave him a sign of mental peace.

“But when the Hulk came out, the Hulk was smashing everything that needed to be smashed.”

As for what competing in the Olympics means to them, Sawyers added: ""Everything that I’ve been through mental health-wise, injuries, everything like that, financial, really being able to invest everything that I have mentally and physically ... [to] be able to walk away with a medal and inspire so many people in the LGBTQ community, so many people who have been dealing with mental health issues, so many of the African-American community, so many people who are Black all around the world, I really hope that I can inspire and motivate.”

Sawyers qualified for the women's shot put final after throwing 18.62 metres which will take place on Friday (9 August).

Olympic commentator CORRECTED live on air after misgendering USA star.,https://ca.style.yahoo.com/eva-mendes-expresses-gratitude-nbc-212738999.html,"Eva Mendes has expressed her gratitude to NBC, after the network avoided broadcasting the faces of her and Ryan Gosling’s children when they attended the 2024 Paris Olympics.

The 50-year-old actor took to Instagram on August 7 to share a photo of herself in Paris, as she was looking out the window of her hotel, with the Eiffel Tower spotted in the background. In the caption, she described one of the reasons why she doesn’t like being in the public eye.

“Morning in Paris. Sleep marks and all,” the Hitch star wrote. “The minute I see photographers when I’m out, my guard and my wall goes up. So I wanted to share this.”

However, multiple people in the comments hit back at her remark, noting that the Olympics is a “high profile” event where celebrities are constantly documented in the stands. One fan also shared their hope that Mendes, Gosling, and their two daughters – Esmeralda, nine, and Amada, eight – could find a place where they can have “a regular old family” hang out.

In response, Mendes acknowledged how respectful NBC was to her family, since the network didn’t show Amada and Esmeralda’s faces when broadcasting the celebrity couple’s appearance at the Olympics on August 4.

“They were great about not posing the kids so I’m a grateful mama bear,” she wrote. “Thx for a loving comment. Sending it right back !”

When another person in the comments told Mendes that she has to “expect” to be captured by the paparazzi – given her celebrity status – she hit back, explaining how she protects herself when in the public eye.

“I’m not saying I don’t expect it – I’m saying I put a guard up. Which I’m happy to do. I like that I don’t parade out there,” the actor wrote. “But I feel like I can let my guard down on my page. Hence my post.”

At the 2024 Paris Olympics on August 4, the famous couple and their children made a rare public appearance at the dressage Grand Prix Freestyle. The event saw Germany’s Jessica von Bredow-Werndl win gold, with an overall score of 90.09 percent. During the competition, Gosling opted for a white tank top, red flannel, brown sunglasses, and a white cap with the Paris Olympics logo on it. His partner wore a navy blue dress, beige sunglasses, and a large sun hat.

Gosling and Mendes’ day out in Paris continued after the dressage event as they then made their way to the women’s gymnastics uneven bars final. NBC’s broadcast of the event captured the pair in the stands, as Gosling wrapped his arm around Mendes’ shoulders. The couple also watched the competition – which saw Team USA gymnast Suni Lee win the bronze – while wearing sunglasses, with the Barbie star swapping his white Olympics cap for a green one.

Mendes has previously opened up about taking a step back from Hollywood, as she’s continued to keep her relationship of over a decade out of the spotlight. During an appearance on Today in March, she reflected on her decision to stop acting, so she could focus on raising her and The Notebook star’s children.

“It was like a no-brainer. I’m so lucky, and I was like: ‘If I could have this time with my children,’” she said, before noting that she still works, she just “didn’t act” anymore. “Because acting takes you on location, it keeps you away.”

While Mendes acknowledged that she and her partner both have their own careers, her work-from-home schedule gives Gosling the opportunity to act.

“It was almost just like a non-verbal agreement that it was like: ‘OK, he’s going to work and I’m going to work. I’m just going to work here,’” she explained. “He went and he did his job. He just happens to be really good at his job. And he did it and he came home.”"

BBC commentator Steve Backley was corrected live on air after failing to use the preferred pronouns for Team USA shot putter Raven Saunders. The 28-year-old, a silver medalist in Tokyo three years ago, made it through to the women's final on Thursday. The athlete's effort of 18.62 metres was enough for fourth place in Group B. And during competition, Saunders wore the now trademark mask that covers the American's face. Pick up your ultimate guide to the Olympics! Going for Gold provides the day-by-day rundown of what's on and when. Click here to buy.

Backley, a former Olympic javelin silver medalist, repeatedly described to Saunders as 'her' during the live coverage in the Stade de France. Backley’s co-host Jazmin Sawyers duly pointed out that the star identifies as non-binary, and uses different pronouns. Backley had said: “The colourful character of Raven Saunders back. Good to see her back, sort of."" Awkwardly referencing the mask, he added: ""Sort of see her, I mean."" Sawyers replied: “Well we can’t see them very well. Raven Saunders actually non-binary and wearing the mask there, we’re quite used to seeing them with interesting atire.”

Saunders threw 18.62 metres to make the final.

Saunders, who has previously been vocal about mental health issues and the 'Incredible Hulk' persona the athlete is associated with, has previously explained the reasoning of the mask. In 2021, they said: “I learned how to compartmentalize. ""The same way that Bruce Banner learned to control the Hulk, learned how to let the Hulk come out during the right moments. That way it also gave him a sign of mental peace."" Saunders competing in Paris signifies a rapid comeback after only returning from an 11-month ban in February this year. The former NCAA champion was suspended by USADA for missing three doping tests, due to 'whereabouts failures'.

The women's shotput event got underway at the Stade de France this morning, with athletes split into two qualification groups.

The first-placed athlete was Canada's Sarah Mitton, who threw a distance of 19.77 metres.

Advert

Also among the field was the American athlete Raven Saunders, who turned heads by wearing a full face mask and sunglasses.

The reason for the face mask is that it eliminates all distraction, while the athlete was also wearing long, acrylic nails in the colours of the US flag.

Ahead of Saunders' first throw of the competition, the lead BBC commentator for the event said: ""The colourful character of Raven Saunders back.

Advert

""Good to see her back, sort of... sort of see her, I mean.""

But Team GB long jump star Jazmin Sawyers, who is on co-commentary for the field events due to an injury ruling her out of the Games, corrected her colleague and noted that Saunders is in fact non-binary.

""Well, we can't see them very well,"" she said. ""Raven Saunders is actually non-binary, and wearing the mask there, we're quite used to seeing them wearing interesting attire on their head. Why not?""

After winning a silver medal in Tokyo three years ago, Saunders held her hands above her head in an 'X' formation - used to represent those who are oppressed.

Advert

In response to claims there could be sanctions from the IOC - the body eventually took no action - they replied: ""Let them try and take this medal. I'm running across the border even though I can't swim.""

They also have an alter-ego used during shotput events, which they call 'Hulk'.

Saunders successfully qualified for the shotput final, and had the seventh-furthest throw of the season prior to the Olympics.

They almost missed the Games after accepting an 18-month suspension in March 2023 for missing three doping tests over whereabouts failures.

The ban was backdated, meaning Saunders was able to return to competition in February. They said they took 'full responsibility' over the missed tests."

However, it's clear that some athletes are more unfortunate than others as viewers were left shocked after watching the moment an Olympic diver scored a flat zero.

Team USA diver Alison Gibson was gutted following her disappointing performance and has since opened up about the 'pain' she experienced following yesterday's events (7 August).

It all went south during the preliminary round of the Olympic women's 3m springboard which she subsequently finished last out of the 28 competitors.

In her first dive, the 25-year-old Texas native's feet slammed into the springboard when she was in a tucked position amid a somersault prompting the audience to let out a gasp in shock at the painful blunder.

The collision meant that Alison lost her previous form as she plummeted into the water.

The American then had to watch on in agony as judges awarded her a 0.0 for the dive.

A second penned: ""Omg. Glad she’s okay and was able to walk out.""

And a third added: ""Surprised this doesn’t happen more often, even at their level, in the other events some were skimming platforms on the way down, so dangerous.""

Since then, Alison has discussed the moment and explained how it won't stop her from doing what she loves.

""I hit my heels and my feet on the board. I have cuts along the sides. And then I bruised my right heel pretty good, but I was determined to keep going,"" the diver told Reuters.

""I definitely was in pain,"" Alison continued. ""But one thing that I say is I hope that anyone who is watching just was able to see what it looks like to get up and keep going even when things don't go the way you want them to. It's about the fight.""

The Olympian added: ""Obviously, today didn't go the way I wanted it to. But I think you can learn and grow from every experience, and I truly hope that the next generation of athletes recognise that even in the worst moments you can keep fighting, you can walk courageously.""

While Canada’s Tyler Mislawchuk vomited after swimming in the river, Belgian triathlete Jolien Vermeylen admitted she 'felt and saw things that we shouldn’t think about too much'.

It came after health concerns were raised over the pollution levels in the river, with the country splashing out a cool £1.18 billion on cleaning it up in time for the games.

Freddie Crittenden jogs for entire race on purpose

The Team USA star purposely put on a leisurely performance in his first heat of the Men's 110m hurdles and ended up being the last one to make it across the finish line with a time of 18.27 seconds.

The athlete said it was a calculated move to avoid aggravating a sore muscle in his leg and due to the introduction of repechage rounds, he knew that he'd have another chance at glory.

'Slow pool' accusations

The pool at the Paris La Défense Arena is 2.15 metres deep which is short of the minimum of 2.5 metres that World Aquatics recommends for an Olympic competition, prompting backlash from viewers.

As a result of the difference in depth, an issue called 'slow' swimming is created where the water is more volatile when dispersed than in a deeper pool.

Olympic commentator CORRECTED live on air after misgendering USA star.,https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/olympic-gold-medalists-katie-ledecky-120812621.html,"Four-time Olympic swimmer Katie Ledecky and two-time Olympic rower Nick Mead have been named as Team USA flag bearers at the closing ceremony of the 2024 Olympics on Sunday.

The announcement by the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) comes amid growing excitement around Sunday’s ceremony, which will see the city of Paris hand over the summer games baton to L.A., host city in 2028.

More from Deadline

A raft of Hollywood stars is expected to participate in this segment of the ceremony, led by Tom Cruise, who is believed to have pre-recorded material in Paris this spring and is also rumored to be preparing a skydiving stunt into the Stade de France venue.

The flag bearing honor for Ledecky follows a stellar performance in Paris where she won four medals to become the most decorated U.S. women’s Olympian of all time and the fifth most decorated Olympian in history with 14 medals.

Her win in the 800-meter freestyle in Paris, also made her the seventh Olympian to win four consecutive gold medals in the same event — and only the second swimmer to do so after Michael Phelps.

Speculation is now mounting over whether the swimming champion will return to Team USA for the L.A. 2028 games.

“I am incredibly honored to represent Team USA as a flag bearer as we close our time in Paris together,” said Ledecky in the USOPC release.

Ledecky and Mead were chosen by a vote of all the Team USA athletes through a process led by the Team USA Athletes’ Commission, which serves as the representative group and voice of Team USA Athletes.

Mead was part of the team that secured the gold medal in men’s four rowing, which marked the first for Team USA in the event since the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome.



“My experience at the Paris Games has been the dream of a lifetime and I’m filled with immense pride, gratitude and joy. I also wish to thank the city of Paris, and the entire country of France, for hosting an incredible Games. I’ll cherish these memories forever,” said Mead.

The Closing Ceremony will begin at 9 p.m. in Paris (3 p.m. ET) and will be presented live on NBC and Peacock and in primetime beginning at 7 p.m. ET/PT.

American track star Noah Lyles was taken away in a wheelchair after losing the 200m final at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. Botswana's Letsile Tebogo won the event, winning the country's first Olympic gold, with Lyles having to settle for third.

Tebogo became the first African man to win gold in the 200m final. He finished with a time of 19.46, a record, with American Kenny Bednarek taking silver with a time of 19.62, and Lyles winning bronze with a time of 19.70.

Though Lyles competed and appeared to be in distress after his race, Michael Johnson believed the 27-year-old had been given the go-ahead from medical personnel to proceed with Thursday's event. Speaking after the race's conclusion, Johnson elaborated: ""Medics will have given him the OK to race. He was probably not in danger of anything by racing, other than not being at 100 percent""

After finishing the race, Lyles crumpled and remained on the floor at the Stade de France for several moments. He attempted to walk off on his own power but he fell to one knee, prompting a wheelchair to be brought out to help assist the Olympian in leaving the area.

However, it is being reported by BBC that U.S. Track and Field had informed the broadcaster that Lyles had contracted COVID-19 two days prior and had raced despite the illness. It also must be noted that Lyles has a history of asthma and the combination of the two could have affected his performance in the 200m final.

Once news broke that Lyles had competed with COVID-like symptoms, Johnson, the former Olympic champion, questioned the decision to allow Lyles to compete and wondered how other athletes would be affected by the decision to allow the American to be around his fellow competitors while sick.

""It is difficult to know what the situation is with athletes with Covid now,"" Johnson said on BBC. ""What were the rules for the organizers? Are you supposed to report any of those sorts of things?

""They said he had a medical yesterday. There was a rumor going 'round that he was sick but they didn't say COVID. I would imagine they knew that yesterday. Is he going to be out there practicing tomorrow before the final? It seems a no.""

NBC commentator Lewis Johnson provided an update and clarification regarding Lyles' condition and why he was allowed to enter the race. ""I ran into his mom Keisha Caine Bishop, who was distraught and trying to find him as well,"" Johnson began.

""She did confirm that Noah had been diagnosed with COVID two days ago. That's right, diagnosed with COVID two days ago but he decided he was going to run anyway.

""And obviously what he has there, may have affected how he performed. He is now with medical people and his mom is awfully distraught. But that is the issue: Noah has COVID.""

With Lyles suffering from Covid, his participation in Friday's 4x100m relay is now in question. Before Thursday's race, Lyle was seen wearing a mask, potentially as a way to keep others from contracting the virus as well."

Fortunately, no other athletes stepped on Girma, who was running in second before the fall, and he received rapid treatment from on-site medical staff at the Stade de France.

The 23-year-old was placed in a neck brace and taken out of the arena on a stretcher to applause from concerned fans in the stands.

Now, an update on his condition has been provided by French outlet L'Equipe.

They say that Girma was knocked unconscious by the impact, but was able to regain his senses a few minutes later and speak to the medical staff.

He was then taken to the Pitie Salpetriere hospital in Paris for 'further examinations'.

An Ethiopian coach took to social media hours later, confirming that Girma was in a 'good condition' in hospital.

In a statement, Paris 2024 organisers said: ""Following his fall in the 3,000m steeplechase, Lamecha Girma received immediate care from the on-site medical teams.

Raven Saunders has never been shy about standing out and that’s exactly what they did in Thursday’s shot put semifinals.

The US star qualified for Friday’s final with a throw of 18.62m, fourth in their qualification group and seventh overall.

But it was their fashion choice that caused a stir.

Saunders donned a black face mask and a pair of colorful visor sunglasses while competing, and later said the outfit was all about inspiring people to be themselves.

“I feel special trying to get the world more in tune and trying to give us and bring us more in our event,” Saunders said after making the final.

“It is one way to make me stand out and I want to encourage other women – a lot of younger athletes are coming through and they really push their own styles.

“It limits the showcase that we are shot putters, but we have our own style, we can do things as big and bright as any sprinter, any jumper, whoever. So we deserve that spotlight as well.”

It’s not the first time that Saunders has worn a mask during competition. They have become well-known for their outlandish wardrobe decisions in recent years.

Indeed, their Instagram shows posts from a multitude of competitions wearing a variety of masks, ranging from one mimicking the smile of the DC Comics character, The Joker, and another with the Hulk’s grimace – Saunders’ nickname is ‘Hulk.’

The American athlete will be hoping to better their silver medal won at the Tokyo Games three years ago.

In the medal ceremony after winning silver in Tokyo, Saunders raised their hands and crossed them in an X as they and their fellow medal winners posed for photos, telling NBC at the time that it represented “the intersection of where all people who are oppressed meet.”

After they successfully advanced from the semifinals in Paris, Saunders said they were in a “great headspace” heading into Friday’s final.

“With everything that I have been through, there is no point for me to not to be in a great headspace,” the American said.

“When I made this team, it was for those people who reminded me who I was when I was down, when I was out, after I lost my mom, after a hip surgery – this was for them. Because they were the ones, when I felt like I wanted to quit, those were the people that encouraged me to keep going, keep pushing and even make it to this moment.”

Carlos Yulo addressed the controversy surrounding his mother, Angelica, and the comments she made regarding his girlfriend, Chloe San Jose.

Just days after becoming the Philippines' first male Olympic gold medalist, Carlos, with San Jose present, recorded a lengthy TikTok video clarifying the situation regarding his relationship with his mother, her comments about his winnings and her comments on how dating San Jose could ruin his life. In the video, Yulo made sure to touch on his mother's comments and called for an end to the vitriol she harbors.

""First of all, the $70K incentive that she is talking about from the 2021 World Championships. First of all, it’s 2022 and it’s not only $70K that I received,"" Carlos began in Tagalog (translated to English). ""I know it’s six digits because I received two medals.

""The principle is very important and the fact that she touched and moved the incentives without my consent is what I’m pointing out to her.""

Angelica claims she moved her son's finances to her to ""safeguard"" it for his future, per the Inquirer. After explaining the monetary situation, Carlos spoke on Angelica calling San Jose a ""red flag,"" which the gymnast said happened because his mother judged how Chloe dressed and acted. Carlos said any difference that his mother found was because San Jose is from Australia and had a different childhood than those who grew up in the Philippines.

The 24-year-old also addressed the comments his mother made, claiming San Jose will monetarily ""drain him,"" which led to Carlos stating his girlfriend has her own income. ""All of the Nike, items and her travel to wherever she likes, that came from her hard work,"" he added. ""And why would I get drained? That’s why I said Chloe has her own income and all of my bank accounts are with my mother and there have been instances where Chloe has helped me out.""

San Jose is a popular social media influencer, with almost 800,000 followers on TikTok. She also models, posts video content and advertises for Fashion Nova.

Carlos also noted that once he regained control of his finances, that is how he found out that his mother had been siphoning money out of his account. He added that regardless of how San Jose was, his mother already had a preconceived notion of her character and the division between Carlos and Angelica began when he set boundaries regarding their relationship.

At one point in the video, San Jose chimed in to explain her family even created a group chat with all parties involved to address whatever issues Angelica had with her because Carlos' mother often posted on social media about San Jose and her son.

Still, Carlos made it a point to speak on how his mother has acted in recent days after the 24-year-old won two gold medals in Paris. ""There have been interviews where you’re congratulating me,"" he said.

""If that is genuine, thank you very very much and I am acknowledging your congratulations toward me, but I still have flashbacks of the hurtful things you said to me and the fact you didn’t wish me well. That is still impacting me."" Angelica's lawyer posted that any statements attributed to her are ""untrue, fake, and mere products of imagination and fantasy,"" according to his Facebook post.

Carlos left his mother with one last plea before ending his lengthy TikTok post, stating: ""My message to you, mother, is that you heal, move on, I’ve forgiven you a long time ago.

""I’ve been praying for your safety always and everything is well with all of you. Let’s stop this, celebrate what we accomplished through hard work and sacrifice of all Filipino athletes here at the Olympics.""

Along with Yulo, the Philippines almost had another medalist in Paris. EJ Obiena finished fourth in the pole vault event, despite having a spinal procedure done just 10 days before the start of the 2024 Olympic Games."

Mauricio Pochettino is drawing heavy interest from USMTN as he faces a tough decision over his next job.

According to The Athletic, Pochettino has emerged as a favorite for the vacant position with U.S. Soccer, with several sources familiar with the situation describing him as a ""top target."" But the former Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea boss has also become a leading candidate to succeed Gareth Southgate as England manager.

Though Pochettino has never managed a national team, he's routinely achieved immense success and excelled in high-pressure situations at the club level. Over his career, he led Southampton to a top 10 finish in the Premier League in 2013, guided the Spurs to a Champions League final appearance in 2019 and helped Paris Saint-Germain secure a Ligue 1 title in 2022.

During his sole tumultuous season in charge at Chelsea, Pochettino propelled the Blues to the League Cup and FA Cup final, all while finding himself in the middle of conflict between the club's fans and ownership.

It is claimed that Pochettino's camp and U.S. chiefs have already engaged in talks. The Argentine and U.S. Soccer sporting director Matt Crocker previously crossed paths at Southampton, when the latter was in charge of the Saints' academy. He later joined the FA in 2013.

The Stars and Stripes are also under immense pressure from American fans to sign a big-name boss after firing Gregg Berhalter on the heels of an uninspiring group-stage exit from the Copa America. Pochettino would certainly fit the bill, with nearly a decade of experience coaching in the Premier League

U.S. Soccer chief Crocker was willing to spend big on his next boss with Pochettino reportedly among the highest-paid coaches in world football.

""It's a really competitive market out there, salary-wise, and we have to be competitive to get the level of coach that I believe can take the program forward in terms of achieving the results that we want on the field,"" he said. ""It's a priority. It's something we're prepared to invest in and something that we will be investing in."""

MyKayla Skinner's husband, Jonas Harmer, has praised the former Olympic gymnast as the ""strongest person"" amid her public debacle with Team USA icon Simone Biles.

After making remarks about Biles and facing backlash for criticizing the American gymnastics squad, who clinched gold at the 2024 Olympics, Skinner became the target of death threats. Harmer showed his support on social media following Skinner's admission and removal of her comments regarding the gymnastics team. Skinner captioned her plea video: ""I love our country and don't want to take anything away from our athletes. Let's use this time to build each other up, not tear others down.""

The ex-Olympic athlete reached out to Biles in hopes of resolving their conflict and urged her former teammate to help put a stop to the death threats she's been receiving. ""Proud of you for apologizing when you did, staying quiet when you did, and now standing up for yourself. You're the strongest person I know! "" Harmer commented beneath her post.

Skinner, attempting to hold back the tears, addressed the issue on Instagram: ""I sincerely hoped that this topic wouldn't have to be revisited, but unfortunately things have really gotten out of hand lately,"" she said. ""Why I'm here is because four weeks ago, I made a comment about work ethic and what seems to be taking place with the rising generation.

""To be totally clear, I take 100 percent for poorly articulating the point I was trying to make. The last thing I wanted was to cause harm or offend our US Olympic Team. I know these women are incredible - the very best of the best. And almost all of them are my former teammates, who I have enjoyed very much cheering on the last few years.""

She went on to say: ""I posted a video apology on Instagram and I followed up with a written apology and I sent individual messages to each of the women on the team. Only Simone had responded, and she told me that she was proud of me.""

In the original YouTube video, Skinner questioned the ability of Biles' teammates Jordan Chiles, Jade Carey, Suni Lee and Healy Rivera to compete at the highest level. ""Besides Simone, I feel like the talent and the depth just isn't like what it used to be,"" Skinner had remarked.

After Team USA's all-around gymnastics victory, Biles posted a photo of the team with a caption that seemed to respond to Skinner's comments. ""lack of talent, lazy, olympic champions,"" Biles wrote.

The record-breaking gymnast also defended her younger teammates, with her comments appearing to counter Skinner's earlier concerns. ""It's important because you have to teach them to use their voices,"" Biles said, referring to her younger teammates. ""And if not, you're a voice for the voiceless, which is okay. I just felt like it was right in that moment to stand up for them, because they're so young and they haven't fully stood in their power yet."""

Quarterback Nick Foles will officially retire with the Philadelphia Eagles during their home opener Sept. 16 against the Atlanta Falcons.

""I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to retire as a Philadelphia Eagle,"" the 35-year-old Foles said in a statement released by the Eagles. ""The City of Brotherly Love has always felt like home to me as an NFL player. Philadelphia is a city I truly love, and it has been an honor to wear the Eagles jersey.""

Foles played for six teams over 11 seasons in the NFL after being drafted by Philadelphia in the third round of the 2012 NFL draft. He stepped into a starting position with the Eagles in the 2017 season, leading them to Super Bowl LII against the New England Patriots.

Foles threw for three touchdowns against New England, earning Super Bowl MVP honors, also catching one on his own in the ""Philly Special"" play. He became the first of two players in Super Bowl history with a passing and a receiving touchdown, according to ESPN Stats & Information research.

""Nick Foles always carried himself with the utmost class and integrity, demonstrating through his actions, both on and off the field, what it meant to be a Philadelphia Eagle,"" said Jeffrey Lurie, Philadelphia's chairman and CEO. ""He was the ultimate competitor, an inspiring teammate, a true representative of our city, and of course, a Super Bowl champion.""

After the Super Bowl win, Foles played with the Jacksonville Jaguars for one season before two years with the Chicago Bears. His last appearance in the NFL came with the Indianapolis Colts on Jan. 1, 2023.

Foles, 35, made the announcement in a video released on social media.

""The City of Brotherly Love has always felt like home to me as an NFL player. Philadelphia is a city I truly love. And it has been an honor to wear the Eagles jersey.""

Foles was a was an Eagles third-round pick in the 2012 draft and played three seasons for the club before being traded to the Rams in 2015. Following a one-year stint as a Chiefs backup, Foles headed back to Philadelphia in 2017 where he was the backup to Carson Wentz.

But after Wentz tore his ACL late in the year, Foles took over as the starter and led the club to an improbable Super Bowl victory over the Patriots — cementing his status as a Philly legend.

Foles never started more than 11 games in a season, amassing a 29-29 record in his 58 starts.

Super Bowl LII MVP Nick Foles announced his retirement from the NFL on Thursday.

The Philadelphia Eagles, who secured their only Super Bowl win in team history with Foles leading the way, announced that Foles will retire as an Eagle and be present for the team's 2024 home opener on Sept. 16.

The 35-year-old spent the 2022 season with the Indianapolis Colts. He was the third starting quarterback to be utilized by the team when he got the nod for a Week 16 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers. He remained in the role the following week, which resulted in a loss to the New York Giants.

Altogether, Foles threw for 224 yards and four interceptions in three appearances with Indianapolis.

The Colts announced in May 2023 that they were releasing the 2013 Pro Bowler, who told the Philadelphia Inquirer's Kerith Gabriel his future in the NFL remained murky.

""Shoot, almost every year of my career I've almost retired,"" he said. ""Every offseason, I think, 'Do I still want to play? Do I still want to keep going?'""

After going unsigned during the 2023 season and the ensuing offseason, Foles decided to call it quits. He's walking away with 14,227 yards, 82 touchdowns and 47 interceptions in 71 career appearances across 11 seasons.

His best single year came in 2013 with the Philadelphia Eagles, when he thrived in Chip Kelly's offensive scheme. He led the NFL in passer rating (119.2) and finished with 27 touchdowns to two interceptions en route to earning a Pro Bowl nod.

Foles' role in Philly's Super Bowl title will be what fans remember the most, though. During the 2017 postseason, he threw for 971 yards, six touchdowns and one interception, and he had the fifth-most passing yards (373) in Super Bowl history, as the Eagles upset the New England Patriots 41-33 in Super Bowl LII:"

Nick Foles, the MVP of the Eagles’ lone Super Bowl victory in franchise history, announced his retirement from the NFL on Thursday. He will retire as an Eagle.

Foles, 35, was selected out of Arizona by the Eagles in the third round of the 2012 NFL draft and played five of his 11 years in the league with the Eagles over two stints. In his second stretch with the team, he produced one of the most iconic performances in Eagles history, delivering a 41-33 win over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LII and becoming the first quarterback in Super Bowl history to catch a touchdown pass on the now-famous “Philly Special” trick play to end the first half.

The Eagles announced Foles will officially retire as a member of the team before the home opener at Lincoln Financial Field against the Atlanta Falcons on Sept. 16. No player has worn Foles’ No. 9 since his departure. Last week, Eagles edge rusher Josh Sweat suggested he couldn’t switch to the number when assessing a number swap this offseason because it’s off-limits.

“I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to retire as a Philadelphia Eagle,” Foles said in a statement. “The City of Brotherly Love has always felt like home to me as an NFL player. Philadelphia is a city I truly love, and it has been an honor to wear the Eagles jersey. Thank you, Philadelphia, for embracing me and making me a part of your family forever. Your love and support have meant the world.”

Foles was called into action during the 2017 season after former Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz tore his ACL midway through the year, and he led the team to an improbable postseason run. The Austin, Texas, native finished the Super Bowl with a postseason career-high 373 passing yards with a 65% completion percentage, three touchdown passes, and one interception. A video released by NFL Films following the shootout win against Tom Brady’s Patriots revealed that Foles was the one who suggested calling the trick play he’d nicknamed “Philly Philly” to then-Eagles coach Doug Pederson.

With the offense facing fourth-and-goal from the 4-yard line and 38 seconds left in the first half, Foles feigned a pre-snap check, walking up to the line of scrimmage and stopping just in time for Jason Kelce to snap the ball to directly to Corey Clement, who broke left and pitched it to Trey Burton, the tight end who rolled out the opposite way to find Foles uncovered running into the end zone. The score put the Eagles up, 22-12, going into halftime.

Foles spent the 2018 season with the Eagles as well and ushered in another playoff win in relief of Wentz, beating the Chicago Bears in the wild-card round after starting three games to finish out the regular season.

After the team’s 2018 playoff run ended in the divisional round against the New Orleans Saints, Foles signed a four-year contract worth $88 million to be the Jacksonville Jaguars’ starter but suffered a season-ending collarbone injury in his first game with his new team, was replaced by Jaguars draftee Gardner Minshew, and released the following year.

Foles spent two seasons with the Bears and was on the Indianapolis Colts in 2022, but he spent last year as a free agent.

His playing style could best be described as “streaky,” with his highest moments putting him among the league’s most effective passers and his low moments resulting in him bouncing between teams over the course of his career.

“Nick Foles always carried himself with the utmost class and integrity, demonstrating through his actions, both on and off the field, what it meant to be a Philadelphia Eagle,” owner Jeffrey Lurie said in a statement. “He was the ultimate competitor, an inspiring teammate, a true representative of our city, and, of course, a Super Bowl champion. As important as he was under center, it was his positive demeanor, approachability, and kindness toward others that resonated with everyone and continues to speak to his great character. We congratulate the Foles family on Nick’s celebrated career and retirement.”

Some of Foles’ highest moments came during his first few years with the Eagles. He started six games in his rookie season, at first coming in for an injured Michael Vick and eventually earning the job as the team struggled to a 4-12 record that cost former Eagles coach Andy Reid his job. With Chip Kelly replacing Reid, Foles started the season as the backup to Vick, whose dual-threat ability seemingly was a better fit for Kelly’s college-influenced offense.

Still, Foles came in for an injured Vick again a few games into the year and put up career numbers, throwing 27 touchdowns to just two interceptions while completing 64% of his passes. In a Week 9 road game against the Oakland Raiders that year, Foles tied an NFL record with seven touchdown passes in one game. He also had a perfect passer rating, completing nearly 79% of his passes and throwing for 406 yards, a performance that resulted in his jersey, cleats, and a game ball going into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

The Eagles traded Foles in 2015 to the St. Louis Rams, who relocated to Los Angeles the following year. He started 11 games for them but finished the season as a backup to Case Keenum. He spent the next season as a backup with the Kansas City Chiefs before rejoining the Eagles as the No. 2 behind Wentz in 2017.

Foles retires with 58 career starts, 14,227 passing yards, and 82 touchdown passes with 47 interceptions."

We congratulate the Foles family on Nick’s celebrated career and retirement.”

Foles, 35, last played in the NFL with the Colts in 2022. He spent 11 seasons in the NFL and just five of those were in Philadelphia. But he’ll always be remembered as an Eagle.

And in Philly, he’ll be remembered as the guy who delivered the first Super Bowl championship to a city that was starving for it.

While Foles had other great moments with the Eagles, who drafted him in the third round back in 2012, he’ll always be remembered for Super Bowl LII. Late in the 2017 season, the Eagles lost MVP candidate Carson Wentz to a torn ACL and Foles stepped in. Despite some shaky moments early, Foles led the Eagles through the playoffs and saved the best game of his life for the biggest stage.

In Super Bowl LII, Foles completed 65% of his passes for 373 yards with 3 touchdowns and 1 interception and also caught a touchdown pass on the Philly Special — a trick play that he suggested to head coach Doug Pederson at a crucial moment. Foles was the MVP of the only Super Bowl victory in Eagles history.

During that playoff run, the Eagles beat the Falcons in the divisional round and the Vikings in the NFC Championship Game to earn the trip to Minneapolis to face off against Tom Brady and the Patriots in the Super Bowl. As great as Brady was in that game at U.S. Bank Stadium, Foles was able to beat him in a shootout. In that three-game playoff run, Foles completed 72.6% of his passes with 6 touchdowns and just 1 interception.

The Super Bowl season came in Foles’ second stint with the Eagles. Back in 2012, the Eagles took Foles with the No. 88 overall pick out of Arizona and he was a Pro Bowler in 2013 with an incredible 27-2 touchdown-to-interception ratio under head coach Chip Kelly. He’s still the only quarterback in NFL history to have 20+ touchdown passes with 2 or fewer interceptions in a season. And on Nov. 3, 2013 against the Raiders, Foles became just the seventh quarterback in NFL history to throw seven touchdown passes and the third to throw seven touchdowns without an interception in a game.

Foles was traded to the Rams in March of 2015 in a move that brought Sam Bradford to Philadelphia. Foles spent just one season in St. Louis before joining Andy Reid’s Chiefs in 2016. After a rough season with the Rams, Foles contemplated retirement before signing with the Chiefs but decided to stick with football.

The next year, the Eagles needed a backup quarterback behind Wentz and signed Foles to a two-year deal. It ended up being one of the best free agent signings in franchise history.

Foles is the Eagles franchise leader in passer rating (93.2) and is third all-time in completion percentage (62.9). He’s 10th all-time in passing yards (8,703) and ninth in touchdowns (58). Foles started just 32 regular season games and six playoffs games for the Eagles — despite that, he’s an absolute legend in Philadelphia.

Since Foles left the Eagles as a free agent in 2018, no other player has worn No. 9 in Philly. While Foles’ number hasn’t been officially retired, it’s clearly off limits.

Foles, 35, had been an unsigned free agent as training camps progressed. He announced his decision in a statement Thursday.

""After much thought and prayer, I've decided to retire from the NFL,"" Foles said on X, formerly Twitter. ""It's been an incredible 11-year journey filled with unforgettable moments and amazing people. From being drafted by the Eagles to winning the Super Bowl, every step has been a blessing.""

Foles cemented his place in Eagles and NFL history with his performance in Philadelphia's Super Bowl 52 win over Tom Brady and the New England Patriots. Most notably, he caught a touchdown from tight end Trey Burton on the ""Philly Special"" play that would become the signature moment of the game. He also passed for 373 yards and three touchdowns en route to Super Bowl MVP honors.

Foles began the season as Carson Wentz's backup but took over when Wentz tore his ACL in December.

The Eagles plan to honor Foles with a ceremony in the team's home opener in Week 2 against the Atlanta Falcons.

Nick Foles' career took plenty of twists

A third-round pick out of Arizona in 2012, Foles was in his second stint with the Eagles when he helped carry the team to its Super Bowl title.

After taking over for Michael Vick as the starter in 2013, Foles earned Pro Bowl honors after compiling an 8-2 record with 27 touchdowns and two interceptions – a mark that stood as the league's all-time best touchdown-to-interception ratio until Brady broke it three years later. Foles also tied the NFL record for touchdown passes in a single game with seven against the Oakland Raiders.

The following season, however, he struggled to replicate his efficiency and ended the season on injured reserve after suffering a broken collarbone in Week 9. Foles was traded to the St. Louis Rams in the ensuing offseason but would last just one season with the team before being released.

After reviving his career with the Eagles, Foles in 2019 signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars on a four-year, $88 million contract that included a franchise-record $50.125 million guaranteed. In his first game with the team, he suffered a broken collarbone in the first quarter, knocking him out of action for two months.

The Jaguars then traded Foles to the Chicago Bears in March 2020 as the franchise opted to move on from its marquee investment after just one season.

"Quarterback Nick Foles, 35, to retire at Eagles' home opener.",https://nypost.com/2024/08/08/sports/nick-foles-retires-with-eagles-after-11-nfl-seasons/,"One of the more unlikely heroes in NFL history is calling it a career.

Quarterback Nick Foles, the 35-year-old who was named Super Bowl 52 MVP, announced on social media on Thursday that he’ll be hanging up the cleats.

“After much thought and prayer, I’ve decided to retire from the NFL. It’s been an incredible 11-year journey filled with unforgettable moments and amazing people,” Foles wrote to accompany his video announcement. “From being drafted by the Eagles to winning the Super Bowl, every step has been a blessing. I’m excited to spend more time with my family and embrace the next chapter of my life. Thank you to all my teammates, coaches, team staff, and fans for your unwavering support. I am forever grateful.”

Foles and the Philadelphia Eagles — for whom he played for five seasons — revealed that the quarterback will officially retire during Philadelphia’s home opener against the Falcons on “Monday Night Football” in Week 2.

A third-round pick in 2012, Foles will best be remembered for his work with the Eagles in 2017, catapulting the team to a Super Bowl 52 win over the New England Patriots, outdueling Tom Brady in the process.

Foles won MVP honors after completing 28 of 43 passes for 373 yards, throwing three touchdowns and even catching one on the unforgettable “Philly Special,” which is commemorated with a statue outside of Lincoln Financial Field.

Foles took over for starter Carson Wentz, who tore his ACL in Week 14 of that season, and was tremendous down the stretch.

Over the final seven games of that year, Foles collected 1,452 passing yards, 11 passing touchdowns and only three interceptions, guiding Philly to a 6-1 record and its only Lombardi Trophy in franchise history.

Foles’ success wasn’t only limited to one magical stint in Philadelphia, however.

In his second season in 2013, Foles threw for 27 touchdowns and only two interceptions in just 10 starts, including tying an NFL record with seven touchdown passes in a single game.

Following the 2018 season — in which he started five regular-season and two postseason games for the Eagles — Foles signed a four-year, $88 million contract with the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Foles’ career did not flourish outside of Philadelphia, though.

He lasted just one year in Duval County after playing in only four games due to a broken collarbone before ultimately being benched.

The following March, Jacksonville traded him to the Bears in exchange for a fourth-round pick.

Foles rounded out his 11-year career by playing two years in Chicago and one in Indianapolis, completing 64.5 percent of his passes for 2,326 yards, 11 touchdowns and 12 interceptions in 10 starts across three seasons.

The Arizona alum was unsigned for all of last season.

Despite a disappointing final few years, Foles will live in the annals of football history forever for his Super Bowl efforts, staking a claim to the best run of backup quarterback play the NFL has ever seen."

Foles officially retired as a Philadelphia Eagle — the team he played with for five seasons across two stints (2012-14 and 2017-18) and led to a 2018 Super Bowl win.

The only Super Bowl MVP of Philadelphia’s only Super Bowl championship team, Foles cemented his legacy in city lore with a trick play that transcends NFL history. A 2012 third-round pick by the Eagles turned journeyman, Foles returned to the team in 2017 as a backup to Carson Wentz. When Wentz was lost for the season with a torn ACL, Foles helped navigate the Eagles to their first-ever Super Bowl title — an unlikely feat given the sport’s advanced need for superstar quarterbacks.

Foles’ 1-yard touchdown reception from Trey Burton on the famous “Philly Special” gave the Eagles a two-score lead at halftime over the New England Patriots, a lead they never surrendered. In center Jason Kelce’s words, “I won’t forget Nick Foles having the game of his life on the biggest stage possible and having the biggest d— on the team going up to Doug Peterson and asking for the Philly Special and Doug Peterson having the biggest b—- in the stadium to say, ‘Yeah, let’s do it.'”

Foles played one more year in Philadelphia, then spent four seasons with the Jacksonville Jaguars, Chicago Bears and Indianapolis Colts. He also spent one season with the then-St. Louis Rams and one season with the Kansas City Chiefs between his stints with the Eagles.

The 35-year-old Foles last played in 2022. His legacy exists because of 2017.

“Nick Foles always carried himself with the utmost class and integrity, demonstrating through his actions, both on and off the field, what it meant to be a Philadelphia Eagle,” Eagles chairman and CEO Jeffrey Lurie said in a statement Thursday. “He was the ultimate competitor, an inspiring teammate, a true representative of our city, and of course, a Super Bowl champion.

“As important as he was under center, it was his positive demeanor, approachability, and kindness toward others that resonated with everyone and continues to speak to his great character.”

Foles played in 71 career games with 58 starts and ended his career with 14,227 passing yards, 82 touchdowns and 47 interceptions.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Nick Foles (@nickfoles)

Foles finishes his career as arguably one of the best backup quarterbacks of all time with stretches of his career where he went white-hot, including leading the Eagles to a Super Bowl win in 2017 and earning Super Bowl MVP.

He will formally retire with the Eagles in Week 2 of this year in their home opener.

Foles, 35, is a former third-round pick of the Eagles back in 2012. Philadelphia traded Foles to the Rams back in 2015 in a deal for QB Sam Bradford and he later signed an extension with the team.

Foles lasted just over a year with the Rams before he was released and later signed on with the Chiefs. After a year in Kansas City, Foles agreed to a two-year, $11 million contract with the Eagles as a backup, but was pressed into the starting lineup in 2017 and led the team to the Super Bowl.

From there, Foles signed a four-year, $88 million contract with the Jaguars that included $50.125 million guaranteed. He was traded to the Bears in 2020. Chicago released him in 2022 and he later signed on with the Colts. Indianapolis cut him after one season.

For his career, Foles appeared in 71 games over 11 seasons with the Eagles, Rams, Chiefs, Jaguars, Bears and Colts. He completed 62.4 percent of his pass attempts for 14,277 yards, 82 touchdowns and 47 interceptions, also rushing for 407 yards and six scores over his career.

Foles was named to the Pro Bowl following the 2013 season and won the 2017 Super Bowl MVP."

Nick Foles announced Thursday that he's retiring after an 11-year career as an NFL quarterback. And there's only one team he could retire with: the Philadelphia Eagles.

After much thought and prayer, I've decided to retire from the NFL. It's been an incredible 11-year journey filled with unforgettable moments and amazing people. From being drafted by the Eagles to winning the Super Bowl, every step has been a blessing.

Foles, 35, became an instant legend in Philadelphia after leading the Eagles to their first Super Bowl victory in Super Bowl LII, but that's only part of what makes his career so strange and unlikely to be replicated. The Eagles drafted him in 2012 in the third round out of Arizona, and he spent just one season under head coach Andy Reid before Reid was fired and replaced with Chip Kelly. Kelly didn't find much success in Philly, but picking Foles to replace an injured Michael Vick in 2013 was one of his best decisions.

During that season, Foles played like a man possessed. He threw seven touchdowns against the Oakland Raiders in Week 9, tying an NFL record. He ended the season with 27 touchdowns and just two interceptions. His passer rating was 119.2, which in 2013 was third-best all time (and currently fourth-best). He led the Eagles to a division title and made the Pro Bowl for the first (and only) time in his career.

That was supposed to be Foles' breakout season, but he struggled in 2014. The Eagles traded him to the St. Louis Rams in early 2015, but his struggles continued, and he was granted his release (which he requested) before the 2016 season.

Foles returns to Philly and enters history

Foles was seriously considering retiring from the NFL after his rough stint with the Rams, but decided to sign a contract with the Kansas City Chiefs. When they declined his second-year option at the end of the season, he found a home back with the Eagles in 2017. The decision to sign Foles as QB Carson Wentz's backup may be the most consequential in Eagles history, because it ended up changing everything.

Foles took over for Wentz after Wentz tore his ACL in Week 14, finishing the game with a win and securing the division title, which the Eagles hadn't held since Foles' magical 2013 season. Wentz was in the midst of an MVP-level season, and fans were convinced the Eagles wouldn't succeed without him under center.

How wrong they — and everyone — were. Foles found some of his 2013 form, and alongside a perfectly crafted offense and a brick-wall defense the Eagles didn't lose a single bit of momentum after Foles took over as the starter. He helped lead them all the way to the Super Bowl for the first time since the 2004 season. The Eagles lost that Super Bowl to the New England Patriots, who ended up being their opponent in Super Bowl LII.

Foles' performance in Super Bowl LII ensured that history wouldn't repeat itself. The Eagles showed themselves to be superior to the Patriots that night, but Foles became a legend with one two-word phrase: ""Philly Philly."" He and head coach Doug Pederson took a major gamble in the final minute of the first half when they called up the Philly Special, the now-famous play in which Foles lined up at quarterback only to slide over before the snap, which left him completely undefended and open to run into the end zone and catch the pass. It is considered one of the greatest plays in Super Bowl history.

Foles, who now has a statue outside Lincoln Financial Field that depicts him and Pederson making the ""Philly Philly"" call, was named MVP of Super Bowl LII after the Eagles won 41-33. He spent one more season with the Eagles before spending his final four NFL seasons with three different teams (Jacksonville Jaguars, Chicago Bears and Indianapolis Colts). His decision to retire came after he wasn't able to catch on with a team for the entirety of 2023.

Foles was never able to find sustained success over his career no matter where he was, but he was able to find ways to elevate himself during his two stints in Philly — stints that arguably allowed him to extend his career.

That's what makes his 11 years in the NFL so wonderfully weird and unrepeatable. He's a career backup who has a statue outside of a stadium depicting a truly legendary moment in Super Bowl history. He fulfilled the dreams of millions of Eagles fans by bringing the city of Philadelphia its first Super Bowl championship. He helped change the narrative of the Eagles from hapless bag-fumbling losers to a team that actually knows what it's doing. For that, Foles will forever be celebrated (and never charged for a drink again) in the City of Brotherly Love."

The euphoria lasted nine plays. The last was a 35-yard touchdown pass to D.J. Chark on the opening game of the season at EverBank Stadium against the Kansas City Chiefs but Foles never saw it — he was on the ground, hit by Kansas City defensive end Chris Jones and writhing in pain from a broken collarbone.

Except for a brief return later in the season, that was the highlight and the lowlight of the Foles Era in Jacksonville, combined in one play.

Foles, who played for six NFL teams covering 11 seasons, announced he was retiring from football on Thursday. He will make it official during Philadelphia's home opener on Sept. 16 against Atlanta, retiring as an Eagle.

""I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to retire as a Philadelphia Eagle,"" Foles said in a statement. ""The City of Brotherly Love has always felt like home to me as an NFL player. Philadelphia is a city I truly love, and it has been an honor to wear the Eagles jersey.""

Foles, Doug Pederson and ‘The Philly Special’

Foles was drafted by Philadelphia, played there three years, then went to St. Louis and Kansas City. He returned to the Eagles in 2017 where Jaguars coach Doug Pederson had him ready when starter Carson Wentz went out for the season with three games left.

Foles went 2-1 to close the regular season, then led Philadelphia to a 41-33 victory over New England in the Super Bowl. Foles threw for three touchdowns and in one of the most memorable plays in Super Bowl history, caught a 1-yard TD pass from former Florida Gator Trey Burton with 34 seconds left in the first half to give the Eagles a 22-12 lead.

""The Philly Special,"" as the play was called, is memorialized with a statue of Pederson and Foles agreeing on the play call outside Lincoln Financial Field.

Foles never won a game with Jaguars

Two years later, Foles signed his huge free-agent deal with the Jaguars. But after his injury, he played in only three more games and left Jacksonville with an 0-4 record as a starter. He completed 71 of 117 passes (65.8 percent) for 736 yards, three touchdowns, two interceptions and eight sacks.

In Foles’ absence, rookie quarterback Gardner Minshew went 6-6 and excited Jaguars fans with his long hair, mustache and daring play on the field. Again, the Jaguars thought they had their quarterback of the future and traded Foles to the Bears.

Minshew Mania also disappeared

Foles played three more years, two with Chicago and his final season with Indianapolis. Minshew Mania also faded the following season as the Jaguars went 1-15 in 2020. But it earned them the No. 1 overall draft pick and they used it to take Trevor Lawrence. Minshew was traded to Philadelphia the following preseason and Lawrence is entering his fourth season with the Jags, with the last two producing 9-8 records and one playoff appearance.

The Jaguars rewarded Lawrence with a contract worth an estimated $275 million in June. He has won 22 games as a starter.

Eagles owner praises Foles

""Nick Foles always carried himself with the utmost class and integrity, demonstrating through his actions, both on and off the field, what it meant to be a Philadelphia Eagle,"" said Jeffrey Lurie, Philadelphia's chairman and CEO in a statement. ""He was the ultimate competitor, an inspiring teammate, a true representative of our city, and of course, a Super Bowl champion.""

Foles is one of three quarterbacks in NFL history with at least 25 touchdown passes and only two interceptions in a season, along with Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers, according to ESPN Stats & Info. He has the most passing yards in a single game in Eagles history (471) and shares the NFL record for most consecutive completions in a single game (25)."

""That'll be part of the information that's to come as part of the investigation.""

Đukić then opened up about competing in the games alongside his brother, Luka.

""I know somebody is working all the time next to me,"" Đukić said with a smile.

""He pushes me hard, both mentally and physically and I can't let my brother beat me,"" Đukić laughed.

""It's a great push to have him and I was so happy to see him qualify,"" he said of Luka.

LIVE STREAM HORROR

Before reports of the drowning came in, there had already been speculation that a swimmer vanished during the competition.

Concerns started when footage from the CrossFit Games showed a competitor struggling in the water during the event.

On the live stream, a swimmer, now identified as Đukić, could be seen slowing down and gasping for air before disappearing beneath the surface.

The event was being live-streamed on multiple platforms, but the video feed was abruptly cut and no longer appears online.

This was the first day of the competition, which was set to continue until Sunday.

The CrossFit Games feature 40 men and 40 women competing to win the top prize of $315,000.

The Games have not announced whether events scheduled for Friday and Saturday will continue.

The U.S. Sun has reached out to CrossFit Games for further comment.

The run-swim event was scheduled to kick off the competitions, which included a 3.5-mile run and an 800-meter swim.

Other events called the Hammer Down and the Amanda 0.45 have been canceled.

The Track and Field event and Clean Ladder are scheduled for Friday and Saturday.

FORT WORTH, Texas — A CrossFit Games athlete died after a reported drowning in a Fort Worth lake on Thursday during the first day of competition in the multi-day event, officials said.

CrossFit officials in a news conference confirmed that a CrossFit athlete drowned in the swim portion of the CrossFit Game's first event. The event was held at Marine Creek Lake, near the Tarrant County College Northwest campus.

The victim was identified as Lazar Dukic, 28, of Serbia, according to the Tarrant County Medical Examiner's Office. Dukic was pronounced dead at 10:24 a.m., the medical examiner records said.

A cause of the death was not initially listed Thursday afternoon.

The rest of the CrossFit Games events were canceled for Thursday. Officials have not decided whether they will cancel the remainder of the games, which are scheduled to run through the weekend, CrossFit CEO Don Faul said at the news conference.

“CrossFit is deeply saddened by the death of one of our athletes in the swim portion of our event this morning … We are collaborating, we are working very closely with the authorities with the follow-up investigation,” Faul said.

Cole Learn, a CrossFit athlete from Ontario, Canada witnessed the drowning from the shore of the lake Thursday morning.

""Absolutely devastated, not sure what to think, and almost in denial,"" Learn said.

Learn said he witnessed the moments the athlete went under the water during the swimming event.

""I saw him sort of start to scramble he started doing small turns and he was trying to get his head out of the water,"" Learn said. ""It was at that time we started screaming to the lifeguard he needed help and in a few seconds he was under, he never came back up.”

The CrossFit Games had a safety plan in place and safety personnel on-site at the event, Faul said. All of the details of how the event and drowning unfolded Thursday will be part of a review with law enforcement, Faul said.

“I think the CrossFit community needs to lean on each other right now,"" Learn said. ""I’m not too sure where the CrossFit games are going to go from here, but they are going to have to make some drastic measurements to make sure this never happens again.""

The Fort Worth Fire Department was called to the drowning report around 8 a.m. Video from the scene appeared to show Fort Worth Fire Rescue pulling a body from the water around 10 a.m. and placing it in a bag.

“I know a lot of you have questions about who it was today… that information will not be released until the Tarrant County Medical Examiner has the opportunity to speak with the family and verify the athlete’s name and identity,"" Leah Wagner, a spokesperson for the Fort Worth Police Department, said.

The event where the incident occurred was the site of a run-swim event at the CrossFit Games, according to the event schedule. The run-swim was free for spectators to observe and miles away from the main competition space at Dickies Arena.

“There’s a lot of people in the community that are hurting right now, that are really sad, that knew the athlete well, that loved and respected this person and a lot of people are mourning,” Faul said.

Samantha Brown, who traveled from North Carolina to watch the CrossFit Games said the CrossFit community is close, and a drowning happening at one of their events is shocking.

""It's awful, especially since it's not something that we would ever expect to happen and would imagine happening,"" Brown said. ""We are all athletes here and something like this is heartbreaking.""

A GoFundMe has been started to support Đukić's family.

Are the CrossFit Games Canceled?

While it's unclear when the CrossFit Games will resume, all events were canceled Thursday.

The events are scheduled for streaming on ESPN+ and several other platforms including Facebook, Twitch and YouTube. All the livestreams abruptly ended Thursday morning. While scheduled livestreams remained on the ESPN+ platform, the 11 a.m. broadcast of events was not airing.

The Sevan Podcast, which covers the CrossFit Games, was livestreaming their reactions and commentary about the competition when they noted that the swimming event had been canceled.

""Which makes me think something bad happened, if they want everyone to leave"" one of the podcasters said.

The group then began playing audio from a woman who was explaining the situation.

""It looks like we have a serious issue on our hands,"" the woman could be heard saying.

The group then received a call from someone who was apparently at the scene and asked them to cut off their livestream.

""Guys we're going to have to end the stream,"" one of the podcasters said. ""It looks like something serious has happened.""

The top 40 men and women from seven qualifying competitions worldwide compete in the CrossFit games.

The first CrossFit Games event was held in 2007. This is the first year CrossFit has held its annual games in Texas as opposed to its typical location in Madison, Wisconsin. CrossFit's CEO announced the move in 2023 and touted the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport as a key driver of the move.

The competition will include team and individual events and the competition exercises will test athlete's fitness in ten areas: Cardiovascular/respiratory endurance, stamina, flexibility, power, coordination, agility, balance, and accuracy. Often the challenges are unknown until the athletes step into the competition, officials say.

A Fort Worth Fire Department official said during a news conference that the department was asked to assist police at around 8 a.m. because there was “a participant in the water that was down and hadn’t been seen in some point in time.” The official said it took the department’s dive team about an hour to find the body.

CrossFit CEO Don Faul and Fort Worth Police Department Sgt. Leah Wagner also spoke at the news conference. Wagner stated the name of the victim was being withheld at that time out of respect for the family.

“CrossFit is, as you know, in some ways like a family,” said Faul, whose organization first held the CrossFit Games in 2007. “People care a lot about each other. There’s a lot of people in the community that are hurting right now, that are really sad, that knew the athlete well, that loved, respected this person.”

Dukic’s Instagram bio states that he was a “4x CrossFit Games Athlete.”

According to his bio on the 2024 CrossFit Games website, he ranked as Serbia’s No. 1 CrossFit athlete every year from 2017-2021 and ranked at No. 3 in the country this year — one notch below his brother, Luka Dukic, 25, who is also listed as a 2024 CrossFit Games competitor.

CrossFit athlete dies during swimming competition in Texas. CrossFit Games Suspended After a year of intense competition.,https://swimswam.com/lazar-dukic-drowns-at-crossfit-games-raising-questions-about-events-safety-measures/,"Serbian CrossFit competitor Lazar Dukic drowned at the end of his 800-meter swim at the 2024 CrossFit Games on Thursday, raising questions about the safety measures in place at the annual event in Fort Worth, Texas.

Dukic could be clearly seen struggling in the water around the 37-minute mark of a video stream — that has since been taken down — before going under with less than 50 meters remaining in the race. The 800-meter swim came after a 3.5-mile run, deviating from triathlon’s tradition of starting with swimming because it’s the riskiest event.

Some spectators said they yelled for lifeguards who were too far away to hear them. Others said they tried to jump in the water to help, but were prevented from assisting by a lifeguard. Two lifeguards on paddle boards were observing the general area around Dukic, but they did not appear to act.

“We watched Lazar go under, and we screamed for some lifeguards,” CrossFit athlete Cole Learn said. “They were pretty far away, so it was tough to do anything else. We were yelling for lifeguards, but unfortunately they couldn’t hear us and he never came back up. I’m absolutely devastated — that was not something I wanted to watch.”

CrossFit CEO Don Faul said there were safety personnel on site at the event.

Local law enforcement said seven firefighter units responded to a call for assistance around 8 a.m. and their dive team went in for a search. Just over an hour after their first diver entered the water, they recovered Dukic’s body.

The weather forecast for Fort Worth this morning was 91 degrees. The remainder of Thursday’s CrossFit Games action was suspended, and it is not yet known if the competition will continue this weekend.

“CrossFit is deeply saddened by the death of a CrossFit Games competitor during the swimming portion of Individual Event 1 at the 2024 CrossFit Games,” CrossFit said in a statement. “We are fully cooperating with authorities and doing everything we can to support the family at this time.”

West Virginia University assistant swim coach told SwimSwam that he offered to help them with the swimming event and “was basically told they didn’t need any help and they had it covered.”

“Then an athlete disappeared within 50m of the finish line and they couldn’t find him for two hours,” Dent said. “This wasn’t just an accident. It could have been avoided.”

Dukic was ranked 3rd in Serbia and 88th globally among male CrossFit athletes.

An athlete drowned during a swimming event at the 2024 CrossFit Games in Texas.

The county's medical examiner's office identified the athlete as 28-year-old Lazar Đukić, WFAA reported.

CrossFit CEO Don Faul announced the events were canceled for the rest of the day.

An athlete drowned while competing in a swimming event in Texas that was part of the 2024 CrossFit Games on Thursday.

The Tarrant County Medical Examiner's Office identified the victim as Lazar Đukić, a 28-year-old athlete from Serbia, WFAA reported.

The incident happened during the first event of the games, called ""Lake Day,"" which included a 3.5-mile run followed by an 800-meter, or half-mile, swim.

Đukić went missing around 8 a.m. during the event's swimming portion. He appeared to be struggling, according to witness reports.

Cole Learn, a competitor from Ontario, Canada, told WFAA that he saw the athlete doing small turns in the water, trying to stay afloat before going under.

""It was at that time we started screaming to the lifeguard he needed help and in a few seconds he was under, he never came back up,"" he said.

The Fort Worth Fire Department and Fort Worth Police Department were called to the Marine Creek Reservoir around 8 a.m. local time, CBS News reported.

A dive team and drones helped officials locate the body about an hour later, according to the fire department's spokesperson, Craig Trojacek.

The remaining events of the day have been canceled. ""We'll continue to be focused on our community and the family through this tragic set of circumstances,"" CrossFit CEO Don Faul said during a press briefing.

A GoFundMe for Đukić's family, organized by some of the athlete's sponsors, has raised over $187,000, so far.

An investigation is underway

Lazar Đukić competed in the CrossFit Games in the past. LIFEAID Beverage Co.

Fire department personnel weren't at the lake initially, but Faul said other safety personnel were present during the event, according to ABC News.

Law enforcement is investigating the event's plans and the circumstances surrounding the drowning, Faul told WFAA News.

""I'm not too sure where the CrossFit Games is going to go from here, but they're going to have to make some drastic measurements to make sure that this never happens again,"" Learn said.

The competition's rules state that athletes must sign a waiver. These race waivers are common and help protect race directors and sponsors, not competitors. Basically, if a competitor is injured, dies, or has something stolen, the waiver protects the directors and sponsors from being sued.

Other athletes have struggled during similar CrossFit competitions.

CrossFit athlete Mat Fraser had a close call in 2017, endurance coach Chris Hinshaw said in 2021 on the podcast Mark Bell's Power Project.

""Fraser almost drowned one year in the Games,"" he said. Another athlete, Brent Fikowski, helped save him, according to Men's Health.

That same year, Will Powell had difficulty during a 500-meter swim in Wisconsin. Two other athletes, Robert Caslin and Gus VanDerVoort, kept him from slipping under the water, WFAA reported.

The Tarrant Regional Water District website describes Marine Creek Lake as calm, ""ideal for swimming, kayaking,"" and other water sports.

CrossFit athlete dies during swimming competition in Texas. CrossFit Games Suspended After a year of intense competition.,https://fox40jackson.com/sports/crossfit-games-athlete-drowns-in-texas-lake-during-swimming-portion-of-competition/,"A CrossFit Games athlete drowned in Marine Creek Lake in Fort Worth, Texas, Thursday morning during a swimming event.

According to Fox 4, the Fort Worth Police Department is not releasing the identity of the athlete until the Tarrant County Medical Examiner’s report is complete and the victim’s family is notified.

Serbian athlete Lazar Đukić, 28, has been identified by several reports as the athlete who vanished during the swimming portion of the competition.

Đukić was last seen toward the end of the 800-meter swim, which was being livestreamed for the 2024 CrossFit Games.

The CrossFit Games later announced the rest of the day’s events were suspended after the drowning.

“CrossFit is deeply saddened by the death of a CrossFit Games competitor during the swimming portion of Individual Event 1 at the 2024 CrossFit Games,” the statement said.

The event began Thursday at 7 a.m., according to the CrossFit website. It involved a 3½-mile run after the 800-meter swim.

However, police and fire departments were called in around 8 a.m., and those in helicopters saw a boat searching around a buoy in the middle of the lake.

The body was later recovered by the Fort Worth Fire Department around 10 a.m.

The Fort Worth Police and fire department did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.

Events are still unfolding, but witnesses report that as the event – a 3.5-mile run followed by an 800m swim – came to a close, not all athletes were accounted for. Although no official statement has yet been made, the event was live streamed and various online sources have named the missing athlete as Serbian-born Lazar Đukić.

CrossFit Games athlete Cole Learn who was present during the incident took to social media to share his experience of the event, stating that he and other athletes were ""yelling for lifeguards"" after witnessing Đukić going under. Learn, visibly shaken, shared in the Instagram post that he didn't see Đukić resurface.

American news outlet CBS, who were monitoring events from a helicopter above the reservoir, have since reported that a body has been pulled from the water.

Spectators have allegedly been asked to leave the competition grounds and further events have been cancelled.

Crossfit have since released a statement via the official Crossfit Games Instagram, and in collaboration with director of the Games, Dave Castro, stating:

What happened to Lazar Dukic?

During the swimming portion of the competition, Lazar went missing near the end of the event, at around 8 a.m., per the New York Post. ""Pray for Lazar,"" wrote The Barbell Spin on Instagram at the time. ""It is our understanding that Lazar never crossed the finish line and search parties are in Marine Creek Lake looking for him. No further details are known at this time.""

Sadly, two hours after Lazar went missing, his body was recovered from the lake. ""CrossFit is deeply saddened by the death of a CrossFit Games competitor during the swimming portion of Individual Event 1 at the 2024 CrossFit Games,"" the organization wrote in a statement on social media.

Though it's unclear how far exactly Lazar was from the finish line (some reports say he went missing about 100 meters away from the end), some fans have expressed outrage that more wasn't done to help the athlete.

""How you let someone drown in a lake, 50m from the finish line? What kind of water security is this? You guys are amateurs! This is no tragedy, this is pure lack of professionalism!"" wrote one person on Instagram under CrossFit's official statement.

A GoFundMe campaign has been started to support Lazar's loved ones.

If you want to help support Lazar's family, the drink company Fitaid (a brand which Lazar had worked with) started a GoFundMe. ""We ask that you please keep his family in your thoughts and consider donating to the GoFundMe account that will be directly shared with his loved ones to support them during this extremely difficult time,"" Fitaid wrote on Instagram.

CrossFit athlete dies during swimming competition in Texas. CrossFit Games Suspended After a year of intense competition.,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/competitor-crossfit-games-died-during-181359817.html,"FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) — A Serbian competitor in the CrossFit Games has died while competing in a swimming event Thursday morning at a Texas lake.

CrossFit CEO Don Faul said during a news conference that they were “deeply saddened” and were working with authorities on the investigation into the death of one of their athletes at Marine Creek Lake in Fort Worth.

The Tarrant County medical examiner’s office identified the athlete as 28-year-old Lazar Dukic of Serbia. The medical examiner’s office had not yet listed his cause of death.

An official with the Fort Worth Fire Department said they were called out around 8 a.m. to assist police because there was “a participant in the water that was down and hadn’t been seen in some point in time.” Police said that officers who were working the event were told that a participant was unaccounted for after last being seen in the water and then not resurfacing.

The Fort Worth fire official said they responded for search and rescue and were not on the scene when the initial call was made.

Faul said CrossFit had a safety plan and did have safety personnel on site at the event. CrossFit did not respond Thursday to an inquiry from The Associated Press to provide more details on that safety plan.

The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that the event on Thursday included a 3.5-mile (5.6-kilometer) run followed by an 800-meter (0.5-mile) swim. The newspaper said an estimated 10,000 people were in the area for the games, which began Thursday and were set to run through Sunday.

Kaitlin Pritchard told the newspaper that she was standing by the finish line when she saw Dukic approach. She said he was among swimmers she’d noticed had changed up their swimming patterns, which she thought could have been because they were tired from the run.

Pritchard said she saw people she assumed were lifeguards on paddleboards on the lake, but she didn’t notice that any of them jumped in to try to rescue anyone.

“Gauging where the people on the paddleboards were and everything, it’s just that he should have been reachable,” Pritchard told the newspaper.

The mission of the CrossFit Games, first held in 2007, is to “find the fittest athletes in the world,” the CrossFit website said. It says the games change every year and often the details are not announced until just before the event.

Faul said the CrossFit community is like a family. “We’re doing everything in our power during this tragic time to support the family, to support our community,” Faul said.

Dukic's biography on the CrossFit website says he was the third-ranked CrossFit athlete in Serbia and the 88th-ranked worldwide. Dukic finished ninth in his debut in the games in 2021, then eighth the next season and ninth in 2023."

After launching a search with a dive team and drones, the athlete's body was found around an hour after the first divers went into the water.

The rest of the events on day one of the games were cancelled after the death.

CrossFit chief executive Don Faul said in a news conference the organisers were ""deeply saddened"" by the death and were working with authorities on the subsequent investigation.

He added: ""We're doing everything in our power during this tragic time to support the family, to support our community.""

Mr Faul also confirmed CrossFit did have safety personnel on site during the swim.

US women’s volleyball prevailed in a 5-set ‘dogfight’.,https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/08/08/us-volleyball-beats-brazil-olympics/74721162007/,"PARIS — No one had to tell Avery Skinner this match was going to go to five sets. She might be an Olympic rookie, but she knew what was coming: A raucous, 95% pro-Brazil crowd, a roster full of women who can crush the ball over the net at any time and a team that hadn’t lost a set all Olympics.

What's not to love?

“We’ve always gotta expect that it’s going to go to five, we knew the Brazil crowd was going to be crazy, they always bring it,” said Skinner. “We knew it was going to be a dogfight.”

In a retread of the Tokyo gold medal match, the U.S. women’s volleyball team topped Brazil 3-2, staving off a South American power looking for revenge. The U.S. will seek to defend its gold medal Sunday against Italy.

It was a wild, thriller full of long rallies, clutch points and newbies showing no fear.

2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.

After the Americans’ first Olympic match in pool play, a 3-2 loss to China, coach Karch Kiraly changed his starting lineup, moving veteran outside hitters Jordan Larson and Kelsey Robinson Cook to reserve roles in favor of Skinner and Kathryn Plummer, who are both playing in their first Olympics.

It’s more than paid off. Skinner and Plummer hit the ball so hard Kiraly likes to refer to them as his “slugger lineup.” Thursday against Brazil, Plummer led Team USA with 26 points (23 kills, two blocks, one ace) while Skinner chipped in 19 (15 kills, three blocks, one ace). Annie Drews added 18 points (17 kills, one ace).

“It’s so fun to see a couple of not-so-experienced outsides in Kathryn and Avery, who have not played in many high-level matches like this. It’s so fun to see them just take this game by the throat,” Kiraly said. “The other team can have everything right and all the sudden the ball’s going 40 feet that way because they hit so hard and it goes off the block. They’re giving us some fantastic firepower.”

Brazil hadn’t dropped a set coming into Thursday. But they looked all out of sorts in the first set against the U.S., as the Americans built a quick 6-1 lead. Brazil battled back but all those early points helped the U.S. as it hung on for a 25-23 set win.

Brazil made quick work of the second set, winning 25-18. Then it was the Americans turn again, as the U.S. jumped out to a 10-4 lead before putting Brazil away 25-15.

In the fourth set, the teams again traded points before a critical service error by American Chiaka Ogbogu gave Brazil an 11-10 edge. Brazil won 25-23 when the U.S. was hit with a net violation, a call Team USA unsuccessfully challenged. That set up a winner-take-all fifth set.

To Skinner, that’s when the U.S. felt most confident. The Americans knew Brazil had rolled through pool play and its quarterfinal; the U.S., on the other hand, had gone five sets twice already this tournament.

“We knew we’d been battled-tested,” Skinner said. “We had a lot of confidence at that point.”

In the fifth set, the teams again traded points until the U.S. started to pull away on a kill from Drews that gave the Americans a 12-8 lead. At 14-10, match point, a long rally looked to go the U.S.’s way until Brazil saved the point last second, pulling within three and forcing the Americans to keep playing. They won on — what else? — an attack from Plummer.

“I’m not stressed, but I don’t know that I’m enjoying it like if I were sitting at home,” Kiraly said of the long rallies that delighted the crowd. “I did say before the fifth set, could we just sit here and bask in the glow — tens of millions of volleyball players dream of playing in a fifth set for the chance to play for a gold medal. It just brings a smile to my face, gives me goosebumps.”

He held his arm up as proof.

To say the Americans are peaking at the right time would be an understatement. In June, things looked dire: They weren’t playing well in the Volleyball Nations League (VNL), finishing seventh in the annual international competition. The starting lineup was under constant fluctuation, and two players got sent home with injuries.

But players kept reminding each other that Paris was the end of the road.

“Everything we’ve been through this summer has not been easy,” Skinner said. “I’m just proud of how we’ve continued to rise to the occasion. Of course we wanted to have a great finish at VNL, there was a little bit of defeat (mentally) after that. But we had a turning point. We had four days off and then we came back into the gym and said we’re going to work hard for what’s coming up.

“You’re seeing that now.”

Vinesh Phogat, the Indian Olympic wrestler who was disqualified from the women's 50kg gold medal match after failing the weigh-in, announced that she is retiring from the sport.

In a message posted on X on Wednesday, Phogat said her ""dreams are shattered"" and that she was ""sorry.""

""Wrestling won and I lost. My dreams are shattered,"" Phogat wrote. ""Goodbye wrestling 2001-2024. I will always be indebted to you all. I am sorry.""

Phogat, 29, who defeated Cuba's Yusneylys Guzmán 5-0 in the semifinal Tuesday, was eliminated from the 50kg tournament when she failed her second weigh-in. Phogat had been set to face Team USA's Sarah Hildebrandt for gold on Wednesday, the first time a female Indian would have ever competed in an Olympic wrestling final.

The extra weight didn't just cost Phogat the first wrestling gold medal in India's history. United World Wrestling's rules explain that when a wrestler doesn't make weight on the second weigh-in, he or she is eliminated from the tournament and is basically ranked last, unless someone is forced to withdraw on the first day of competition.

According to India's Sportstar, Phogat went without food and water the night before the match, with her staff eventually resorting to cutting her hair and drawing blood. Even after that miserable process, they couldn't get the last 100 grams she needed.

Per India Today, Phogat fainted due to dehydration after the unsuccessful weigh-in and had to be hospitalized.

Phogat was competing in her third Olympics. She has three gold medals from the Commonwealth Games, two bronze medals from the World Championships, and a gold from the Asian Games."

With the win, he became the first person to ever win an individual event five times at the Olympics.

Lopez won gold in the 120-kilogram division in 2008, then did so again in 2012. Four years later in Rio, the weight class than bumped up 10 kilos, and he won again.

He won another gold in the class in Tokyo three years ago, and did the same in Paris on Tuesday.

After cementing his legacy, Lopez placed his shoes in the center of the mat, symbolizing his retirement. ""What’s great is the joy,"" Lopez said through a translator.

LE BOURGET, France — Sam Watson climbed a 49-foot overhanging wall in 4.74 seconds here on Thursday and didn’t win Olympic gold.

He scurried up a beyond-vertical surface like a supersized squirrel, and completed this standardized “speed climbing” course quicker than any human ever had.

He descended back to earth as the fastest man in the fastest Olympic sport, and thousands of fans rose to salute him.

And then, minutes later, he forced a smile with a bronze medal draped around his neck.

Sam Watson breaks his own speed climbing world record to secure BRONZE at the #ParisOlympics! 🇺🇸🧗 pic.twitter.com/D6cy2r8U5c — NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) August 8, 2024

Watson, an 18-year-old Texan, didn’t quite know how to process the strange dichotomy. “I haven't really gone through it,” he said here at Le Bourget climbing site. He had mastered this wild, blink-of-an-eye sport but also suffered in its ridiculously fine margins.

“Speed climbing is most likely the lowest margin-of-error sport in the entire Olympic Games,” he said, a couple hours after he and fellow climbers proved it.

Take, for instance, a quarterfinal race between the reigning world champion, Italy’s Matteo Zurloni, and China’s Peng Wu. They heard the starting buzzer. They bolted toward the sky, using each wall’s 20 red hand-holds and 11 smaller foot-holds to propel them upward. They slapped a timing panel at virtually the same time, and looked up to see a clock that had extended to three decimal places.

Zurloni’s 4.997 was red, and “whoa, f***,” he thought. He brought his hands to his head as he floated back down to earth, controlled by a harness.

Peng, five feet away, was “excited.” His clock was green, and read 4.995.

Watson, meanwhile, cruised through his quarterfinal. He’d set a world record, with a time of 4.75 seconds, in qualification heats earlier in the week. But here, minutes later, in a semifinal against Peng, near the top of a gravity-defying obstacle course he’d scaled thousands of times, he was “a few little millimeters off a certain hold,” he said. It cost him a bit of power and, he estimates, 0.2 seconds. He lost to Peng by 0.08.

“I just lost the most important match of my life,” Watson thought.

But he had no time to dwell on the thought. “Now I have the next most important race of my life, back-to-back, in five minutes,” he said.

And in that race, his last of this rapid-fire Olympic competition, in the “small final,” he lowered his own world record by 0.01 seconds, touching in 4.74.

A minute after that, Indonesia’s Veddriq Leonardo went 4.75 in the big final. Peng went 4.77. All were faster than anybody had ever been before this week.

In speed climbing, the path of the course is always the same, never varying. That allows for muscle memory to build and perfection to be pursued.

Watson’s goal, he said, is to someday scale the wall in less than 4.6 seconds. (Zurloni said he thinks that eventually, speed climbers will hit 4.4.) That’s what he’s been training to do for years, perhaps ever since he picked up the sport at age 5. He has put hour after hour into it. He has embraced a sport that often doles out gnarly injuries — lost fingernails, sprained toe, bloody cuts, banged-up knees — and doesn’t let its practitioners stop for anything.

Along the way, he has come to terms with the margins. “It is 30 movements at max speed, so there can be mistakes,” he said.

Nothing, though, could have prepared him for the storm of “complicated” emotions he felt Thursday.

“You do come here with a goal of winning gold,” he acknowledged hours after winning bronze. He felt something — he couldn’t quite express what — when gold slipped away.

“But,” after breaking the world record five minutes later, “I really did soak it in,” Watson said. He hugged coaches and family. He sought out a board displaying his time, and asked organizers to arrange “a photo Usain Bolt-style.” He wanted to give a “very big shoutout to them for letting my crazy ideas happen.”

And “to be an Olympic medalist, and to hold it in my hand, with a piece of the original Eiffel Tower, nobody will ever take that away from me,” he said, as the processing began. “No one will ever take away any of the four world records I've broken. It will be with me for life.”"

Medal table | Olympic schedule | How to watch | Olympic news

When an athlete makes a gold medal match at the Olympics, a silver medal is typically seen as a happy worst-case scenario. It wound up being much worse for India's Vinesh Phogat.

Phogat, who defeated Cuba's Yusneylys Guzmán 5-0 in the semifinal on Tuesday, was eliminated from the women's 50kg wrestling tournament on Thursday morning when she failed her second weigh-in, the Olympics announced. Phogat had been set to face Team USA's Sarah Hildebrandt for gold on Wednesday, the first time a female Indian would have ever competed in an Olympic wrestling final.

The extra weight won't just cost Phogat the first wrestling gold medal in India's history. United World Wrestling's rules explain that when a wrestler doesn't make weight on the second weigh-in, they are eliminated from the tournament and are basically ranked last, unless someone is forced to withdraw on the first day of competition.

So Phogat will leave Paris without a medal. You can see the official Olympic bracket with Phogat's name crossed out here.

Vinesh Phogat hospitalized after brutal weight cut

Missing out on an Olympic medal is bad enough, but the Indian delegation's efforts to get Phogat under weight were reportedly brutal.

According to India's Sportstar, Phogat went without food and water the night before the match, with her staff eventually resorting to cutting her hair and drawing blood. Even after that miserable process, they couldn't get the last 100 grams she needed:

“Her normal weight is 57 kgs, and she did everything to get down to 50. She was 49.9 kg yesterday morning, but the moment she had even a small meal, her weight bounced back to at least 53 kg. She had to reach this weight to have the strength to fight in three bouts,” a member of her camp told Sportstar.

“After the semifinals last night, her weight was 52.7 kg. She didn’t sleep even a minute, didn’t drink a sip of water, and didn’t have a morsel of food. She spent the entire night running and using the sauna. She made it to 50.1 kg but didn’t have time to cut the last 100 grams. There was no leeway and no extra time to make weight,” the member added.

Per India Today, Phogat fainted due to dehydration after the unsuccessful weigh-in and had to be hospitalized.

Team USA's Sarah Hildebrandt won't win gold by default

Meanwhile, Hildebrandt won't win gold by default. She will instead face the woman Phogat defeated in the semifinal, Cuba's Yusneylys Guzmán.

Guzmán was previously set to compete in a bronze medal match against the winner of a repechage, but that repechage between Japan's Susaki Yui and Ukraine's Oksana Livach, both of whom Phogat also defeated, will instead become one of the two bronze medal matches.

Olympic wrestling tournaments usually hold two repechages with the winners facing the semifinal losers for a bronze medal. Combat sports are unique in that they offer multiple bronze medals rather than a true bronze medal match.

Hildebrandt, seeded sixth in the tournament, won bronze in the event in Tokyo and is a four-time medalist in the world championships, but without a gold."
"Vinesh Phogat, Indian wrestler who was DQ'd from women's wrestling.",https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/sports-games/3044814-vinesh-phogat-dqd-a-shocking-olympic-setback,"In an unfortunate twist, Indian wrestler Vinesh Phogat has been disqualified from the Paris Olympics for being overweight ahead of the women's 50kg final. Her disqualification marks a shocking end to what had been a seminal performance, as she became the first Indian woman wrestler to reach the gold medal bout in her category.

Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi voiced his disappointment on Wednesday, urging the Indian Olympic Association to challenge the decision. He expressed confidence that Phogat would come back stronger, noting her historic achievement on Tuesday, where she had defeated defending champion Yui Susaki of Japan.

Gandhi's support reflects a nation's pride in Phogat's journey. While technical rules led to her downfall, the entire country stands with her, hopeful for her return to the wrestling arena. She was set to face American Sarah Ann Hildebrandt in the final before the disqualification.
