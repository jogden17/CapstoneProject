PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Donald Trump recommitted to debating Vice President Kamala Harris after recently backing out, holding a lengthy news conference Thursday in which he taunted his new rival, boasted of his crowd on Jan. 6, 2021, and lashed out at questions about the enthusiasm her campaign has been generating.

As the Republican presidential nominee addressed reporters at his Palm Beach, Florida, estate, ABC announced that Trump and Harris, the Democratic nominee, have agreed to a Sept. 10 debate, setting up a widely anticipated faceoff in an already unparalleled election. Trump said he had proposed three debates with three television networks in September.

Trump again insisted there had been a “peaceful transfer” of power in 2021 and renewed attacks on Republican rivals like Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, whom Trump has harshly criticized since Kemp refused to go along with his false theories of election fraud.

In taking questions from reporters for more than an hour, Trump tried to draw a contrast with Harris, who has not held a news conference since she became the likely Democratic nominee following President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the race.

Another key moment in the election is set

Trump’s decision to go on ABC, days after posting on his social media account that he would not appear on the network, sets up a highly anticipated moment in an election where Biden’s catastrophic performance in the last debate set in motion his withdrawal.

“I think it’s very important to have debates,” Trump said Thursday. “I look forward to the debates because I think we have to set the record straight.”

A few hours after the news conference, Harris wrote on X that she heard Trump “has finally committed” to debate her on ABC on Sept. 10, the date her campaign has long stuck to.

“I look forward to it,” she wrote.

Thursday’s event was Trump’s first public appearance since Harris selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate. Trump called Walz a “radical left man.”

“Between her and him, there’s never been anything like this,” Trump said. “There’s certainly never been anybody so liberal like these two.”

He repeatedly suggested Harris was not intelligent enough to debate him. Harris, for her part, has tried to goad Trump into debating and told an audience in Atlanta recently that if he had anything to say about her, he should "" say it to my face.”

Trump grew visibly perturbed when pressed on Harris’ crowds and newfound Democratic enthusiasm, dismissing a question about his lighter campaign schedule as stupid.

Trump says he has not “recalibrated” his campaign despite facing a new opponent, a dynamic some Republican strategists have quietly complained about.

When asked what assets Harris possessed, Trump said: “She’s a woman. She represents certain groups of people.”

Trump has repeatedly — and falsely — accused Harris, the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, of previously downplaying that she is Black.

Trump acknowledges weakness with Black women

Trump recognized some changing patterns with his new opponent, acknowledging he may not be as popular with Black women, one of Democrats’ key voting blocs. He expressed a lot of confidence in his support from Black men.

“It could be I’ll be affected somewhat with Black females but we’re really doing well,” he said. “And I think ultimately they’ll like me better because I’m going to give them security, safety and jobs. I’m going to give them a good economy.”

Trump campaign officials told reporters ahead of the news conference they believe Harris is currently enjoying a honeymoon period they likened to an “out-of-body experience.”

They argued the fundamentals of the race have not changed and the mood of the country remains sour, with Americans frustrated by the state of the economy, the administration and the country’s directions.

They argued that while Harris has energized the Democratic base — which Biden had not done — she will not be able to win over Republicans or convert independents or the persuadable voters they are focused on targeting.

Trump’s campaign plans to spend the next three months hammering Harris as “failed, weak and dangerously liberal,” blaming her for every one of the the Biden administration’s unpopular policies and mocking her mannerisms and speaking style.

Trump takes questions about abortion

Trump suggested abortion will not be a major issue in the campaign and the outcome in November.

He insisted that the matter “has become much less of an issue” since the Supreme Court ended the federal constitutional right to abortion services and returned control of the matter to state governments. But the issue is widely seen as a general election liability, and Trump named states such as Ohio and Kansas that have since voted to protect abortion rights.

Trump also said he expected Florida “will go in a little more liberal way than people thought” when it votes to repeal an abortion ban later this year, but he did not respond to questions asking how he would vote.

Trump argued that Democrats, Republicans and “everybody” are pleased with the results of the 2022 ruling that overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.

Trump’s actions within the GOP, however, suggest he knows that Democrats already have capitalized on Republican opposition to abortion rights and could do so again this fall. Trump single-handedly ensured that the Republican Party platform adopted at the 2024 convention in Milwaukee does not call for a national ban on abortion, and he has said repeatedly that hardliners in the party could cost the GOP in November.

The court’s decision, issued months ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, is widely cited as a reason that Democrats fared much better than expected in House and Senate contests. And Democrats have hammered Trump in paid advertisements blaming him and the justices he appointed for ending Roe.

Trump again makes false claims on Jan. 6

Donald Trump falsely claimed during the press conference that “nobody was killed on Jan. 6,” the date in 2021 when pro-Trump rioters breached the U.S. Capitol amid Congress’ effort to certify Biden’s 2020 election victory after Trump refused to concede.

Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran from San Diego was shot and killed by a police officer as she climbed through a broken part of a Capitol door during the violent riot that breached the building.

To be sure, Trump has often cited Babbitt’s death while lamenting the treatment of those who first attended a rally outside the White House that day, then marched to the Capitol, many of whom fought with police and entered the the building.

“I think those people were treated very badly. When you compare it to other things that took place in this country where a lot of people were killed,” Trump said Thursday, adding “nobody was killed on Jan. 6.”

He also falsely claimed more people attended his speech at a “Stop the Steal” rally before the riot than the famous March on Washington in 1963, the iconic event at which Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his “I Have a Dream” speech.

Trump was asked about Biden’s comments in a CBS interview that he was “not confident” there would be a peaceful transfer of power if Trump were to lose.

“He should have brought this up at the debate if he had a problem. Of course there’ll be a peaceful transfer, and there was last time.”

While Biden was inaugurated on schedule, Washington was on lockdown that day, with the streets patrolled by military personnel and domestic police two weeks after Trump’s supporters had attacked the Capitol. ___

“I’ve talked to my team. I want us to get an interview scheduled before the end of the month,” Harris told reporters on the tarmac in Michigan before she headed to Arizona.

During his news conference at Mar-a-Lago today, Trump criticized Harris for not sitting for an interview since she rocketed to the top of the Democratic ticket.

(AP) — ABC says both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris have agreed to a Sept. 10 presidential debate, setting up a face-off between the Republican and Democratic nominees.

The announcement Thursday came shortly after Trump told a news conference that he had proposed three presidential debates with three television networks, saying he agreed on certain dates in September.

WATCH: Trump holds news conference at Mar-a-Lago

Trump is rejoining the ABC debate days after posting on his social media network that he would not appear on the network, citing a lawsuit he has filed. His decision sets up a highly anticipated moment in an election where the first debate led to a massive change in the race — with Democratic President Joe Biden ending his reelection bid and endorsing Harris.

“I think it’s very important to have debates,” Trump said Thursday. “I look forward to the debates because I think we have to set the record straight.”

The Harris campaign had no immediate comment.

Trump had teased an announcement about the presidential debate earlier this week after pulling out of an ABC News debate scheduled for Sept. 10 after President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign. Trump had said he would prefer that Fox News sponsor the debate, but on Wednesday was showing willingness to reconsider ABC.

Trump also echoed criticism from his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, that Harris has not held a news conference or sat down for interviews since Biden’s withdrawal last month and she entered the race.

Harris has a traveling press pool with her on Air Force Two for all trips. Trump does not have a set traveling press pool that regularly accompanies him on his plane when he goes out to campaign.

Vance has journalists flying with him, and he campaigned this week in states where Harris and Walz had their own events scheduled. That included on Wednesday, when Vance’s plane and Air Force Two ended up on the same tarmac in Wisconsin. Vance started walking toward the Democrats’ plane but did not reach it before a motorcade carrying Harris, Walz and the traveling press pulled away.

Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are set to debate on ABC on September 10 after the former president said Thursday he had agreed to the faceoff, along with two others next month.

“ABC News will host qualifying presidential candidates to debate on September 10 on ABC. Vice President Harris and former President Trump have both confirmed they will attend the ABC debate,” the network said in a statement.

Speaking at a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump said that he was “looking forward” to debating the vice president and that he had agreed to upcoming dates with Fox News, ABC and NBC.

“I think it’s very important to have debates, and we’ve agreed with Fox on a date of September 4. We’ve agreed with NBC. Fairly full agreement subject to them on September 10. And we’ve agreed with ABC on September 25,” the former president said.

A senior Trump adviser and an ABC source familiar with the matter both said that the correct dates Trump has agreed to with networks are: September 4 with Fox News, September 10 with ABC and September 25 with NBC.

Trump said “minor details” were still being worked out, including audience and locations.

“The other side has to agree to the terms. They may or may not agree. I don’t know if they’re going to agree. (Harris) hasn’t done an interview. She can’t do an interview. She’s barely competent, and she can’t do an interview, I look forward to the debates because I think we have to set the record straight,” he said.

Harris, who had previously agreed to the ABC debate, confirmed her participation later Thursday and said she would be “happy” to discuss a further debate.

“I’m glad that he’s finally agreed to a debate on September 10th. I’m looking forward to it, and I hope he shows up,” Harris told reporters before boarding Air Force Two in Detroit after an event with the United Auto Workers.

Asked if she would be open to the other debates mentioned by Trump, Harris said: “I’m happy to have that conversation about an additional debate for after September 10th.”

The ABC debate was originally accepted by Trump and former President Joe Biden before the latter dropped out of the race. Earlier this week, Trump had said that he would not debate Harris if she did not agree to attend the proposed Fox News debate on September 4.

An ABC source had earlier expressed confidence that the network’s debate would be the first one between Trump and the vice president, as the Harris campaign has indicated she will not agree to the Fox News debate.

A source familiar with the NBC negotiations said September 25 was “one of the dates” given to the campaigns. While the network has been in discussions with both camps, the Harris campaign has not formally accepted.

Details on location, rules and moderators will be determined closer to the debate date.

The three debates will occur Sept. 4 on Fox News, Sept. 10 on ABC and Sept. 25 on NBC, according to Trump’s team.

“So we have those three dates and those networks, they’re very anxiously awaiting that date and those dates,” Trump told reporters during a press conference in Mar-a-Lago. “We have spoken to the heads of the network and it’s all been confirmed.”

Harris had previously agreed to the ABC News debate and expressed her delight that Trump will square off with her there as well.

“Well, I’m glad that he’s finally agreed to a debate on September 10,” she told pool reporters Thursday.

“I am happy to have that conversation about an additional debate, or after September 10, for sure,” she added, not committing to the other debates Trump mentioned.

Prior to President Biden’s withdrawal from the 2024 race, the two campaigns agreed to a Sept. 10 debate hosted by ABC News and a yet-to-be-scheduled vice presidential debate hosted by CBS News.

“We also have CBS is going to do the vice presidential debate. So CBS will do a vice presidential. And, and I have to tell you, JD Vance has really stepped up. He’s doing a fantastic job,” Trump later added Thursday.

Trump and his running mate JD Vance (R-Ohio) had raised questions about their commitment to the ABC and CBS debates respectively.

The 45th president suggested last Friday that the ABC News debate had “been terminated.”

“I have agreed with Fox News to debate Kamala Harris on Wednesday, September 4th. The Debate was previously scheduled against Sleepy Joe Biden on ABC, but has been terminated in that Biden will no longer be a participant, and I am in litigation against ABC Network,” Trump posted on Truth Social last Friday.

A source familiar with the negotiations said that the ABC debate is expected to take place in Philadelphia and that the deliberations were led by Rick Klein and John Santucci.

Vance recently suggested that he’d be squaring off against Harris in the vice presidential debate instead of her veep, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D).

“So here’s my offer to Kamala Harris: If she’d like to do a debate with me on August 13, I’ll do it. I don’t think she wants to anymore, because one, she probably doesn’t even know that she’s going to be the Democratic nominee,” he said.

Trump also boasted that his debate performance against Biden knocked him out of the race and cried foul at Harris replacing him.

“I’m not a fan of his. As you probably have noticed,” he chided. “He had a rough debate, but that doesn’t mean that you just take it away like that.”

“We aren’t surprised Trump wouldn’t show his face, he’s ashamed of his dangerous Project 2025 agenda, is afraid to debate, and has no positive vision to present to the American people,” Harris-Walz 2024 spokesperson James Singer said in a statement Wednesday — a day before Trump’s announcement.

Underpinning Trump’s press conference Thursday is his campaign’s beef with Harris for answering few on-the-record questions from reporters since her ascension.

“She’s not doing a news conference. You know why? She’s not doing it because she can’t do a news conference,” Trump jabbed.

“She doesn’t know how to do a news conference. She’s not smart enough to do a news conference. And I’m sorry, we need smart people to lead this country.”"

The Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

Trump’s remarks come less than a week after he said he was going to pull out of the previously scheduled September debate on ABC. He claimed that his agreement “has been terminated” because he will no longer face President Joe Biden, who ended his re-election campaign last month in the wake of a disastrous debate performance against Trump. Trump also claimed the ABC debate could be a conflict of interest because he is in litigation against the network and anchor George Stephanopoulos. The Harris campaign pounced on Trump’s cancellation, framing the former President as “afraid to debate” in a series of attack ads.

""We were given Joe Biden and now we're given somebody else,” Trump said Thursday. “And I think, frankly, I'd rather be running against the somebody else.”

Trump also said Thursday that his running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, would participate in a vice presidential debate on CBS. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who was named Harris’ running mate, has previously said that he would be willing to debate Vance: ""And I gotta tell ya: I can't wait to debate this guy,"" Walz said on Aug. 6."

Chloe Longmire, who attended Wednesday’s rally in Eau Claire said that she is encouraged and excited that Harris has the potential to be the first Black female president.

“She’s trying to create a world where people all have their rights to their own decisions, their bodies, their choices. Women’s rights,” are definitely crucial, she told AP. “Definitely something that I look for as a woman, as a woman who has a daughter, I want her to be able to have a right to her own body.

Wisconsin voter Dan Miller said he liked the tone and message of the Harris and Walz ticket.

“I love Tim Walz saying, you know, yeah, we’re the monsters. You know, look at us. You know, we want. We want to feed children. We want to educate everybody. We want women to have a choice versus, you know, having the government make their choices for them,” he said. “It’s the tone that they use. It’s the messaging itself. It’s just so much better.

Speaking during a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump said, ""I think it’s very important to have debates,"" and added that he accepted invitations from NBC News, Fox News and ABC News.

During his announcement, Trump seemingly got some of the dates incorrect. Both ABC News and the Trump campaign later clarified that the ABC News debate would take place on Sept. 10. The Fox News debate was previously proposed for Sept. 4.

A source familiar with the plans said that the NBC News one was set for Sept. 25, which was one of the options the network gave the campaigns as a date.

When President Joe Biden was still running, his campaign and Trump's agreed to two debates: one with CNN on June 27 and a second with ABC News on Sept. 10. But after Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris, Trump began to waver on his commitment to participating. Last week, Trump said he would skip the ABC News debate because the event had ""been terminated in that Biden will no longer be a participant.""

After Trump pulled out, Harris campaign communications director Michael Tyler said in a statement, ""The Vice President will be there one way or the other to take the opportunity to speak to a prime time national audience. ... We’re happy to discuss further debates after the one both campaigns have already agreed to.”

Harris later Thursday confirmed she would attend the ABC debate, telling NBC News, “I am looking forward to debating Donald Trump and we have a date of September 10th. I hear he’s finally committed to it and I’m looking forward to it.” She did not respond to a question about other potential dates.

Trump on Thursday also said that the campaign has agreed to a vice presidential debate on CBS News, adding that his running mate, Ohio GOP Sen. JD Vance, ""has really stepped up. He’s doing a fantastic job.""

On Tuesday, at Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's first rally since being named Harris' running mate, he said of Vance, ""I can't wait to debate the guy.""

During a campaign event Wednesday in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, Vance wouldn't commit to debating Walz, baselessly suggesting that there was still a chance that he wouldn't be the Democratic vice presidential nominee.

""We don't know who the vice presidential nominee is going to be either,"" Vance told reporters, adding that Democrats could ""pull a bait and switch"" and take him off the ticket.

Harris and Walz were formally certified as the Democratic nominees for president and vice president this week.

The Trump campaign is eager to define Tim Walz as a far-left liberal on the wrong side of the culture wars, particularly when it comes to his support for transgender youth.

His backers, however, call him a “prairie populist,” focused on meeting the everyday needs of working Americans, as demonstrated by policies like free school meals for kids and paid family and medical leave. They say that if he’s changed, it’s because his constituents have, too.

Democrats say they think Republicans will struggle to paint Walz as an ultra-liberal, and that many of the criticisms the Trump campaign is launching at Walz – from his handling of the protests in the wake of George Floyd’s murder by a police officer to raising questions about his military service – already fell flat during the governor’s 2022 reelection bid. Walz won by nearly 8 percentage points.

How it started: Walz’s political career began when he flipped Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District – a red, rural seat that had only been held by one other Democrat in 100 years – in 2006, a wave midterm year for his party. Walz went on to serve six terms in the seat, which is now represented by a Republican.

Despite his more conservative voting record in the House, there have been several through-lines in Walz’s policies. Healthcare has been a key part of his platform since 2006, when he campaigned on lowering costs. He later voted for the Affordable Care Act, which made him a target during the Tea Party wave of 2010.

How it’s going: His biggest shift has been on gun control. Though he’d previously received an A rating from the National Rifle Association and is an avid hunter, he donated his NRA contributions after the October 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting. In February 2018, following the Parkland shooting, he wrote a Star Tribune op-ed seeking to clarify his stance in support of “common sense” gun reforms.

Walz faced blowback on the issue during his 2018 gubernatorial campaign, particularly in his Democratic primary.

“I’m a staunch supporter of Second Amendment rights to own firearms,” Walz said in an interview explaining his about-face. “But I also recognize the need to have some common-sense changes in this. I reject the notion that it’s one or the other. Those folks out there who are responsible gun owners ― their hearts are breaking every time you see one of these shootings.”

The extraordinary events of recent weeks, including Mr. Biden’s withdrawal and an assassination attempt on Mr. Trump, have prompted many Americans to refocus on a presidential election that, until June, was shaping up as a rerun of the 2020 race. The ABC debate will most likely be a post-Labor Day kickoff moment of sorts for the campaign’s final two-month stretch.

Mr. Trump said at a news conference on Thursday that he would debate Ms. Harris on two other occasions, at events hosted by NBC News and Fox News. But the Harris campaign has not agreed to those debates, which were not part of the original debate schedule that Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump had agreed upon in May.

NBC News is in active discussions with both campaigns about a potential debate, including one on Sept. 25, but Ms. Harris has not committed, according to a person familiar with the discussions. The Harris campaign has also not agreed to a debate hosted by Fox News.

Ms. Harris, after speaking at a campaign event in Michigan on Thursday, told reporters that she was “looking forward” to the debate on Sept. 10. “Hope he shows up,” she said of Mr. Trump.

She demurred when asked about the additional dates that Mr. Trump had mentioned, signaling that she was unlikely to consider another debate until after the ABC event. “I’m happy to have that conversation about an additional debate after Sept. 10,” she said. “For sure.”

The ABC debate was negotiated with the campaigns by John Santucci, the network’s executive editorial producer, and Rick Klein, its Washington bureau chief. Mr. Trump’s campaign managers, Chris LaCivita and Susan Wiles, negotiated terms with the network.

Brian Fallon, a senior adviser for communications, played a lead negotiating role for the Harris campaign, according to the people with knowledge of the conversations. When Mr. Biden was still a candidate, that role was primarily occupied by the advisers Ron Klain and Anita Dunn."
Trump says he has agreed to offer ABC News to debate Harris.,https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-abc-debate-814786cc3ad7c11498c71f09f0172db3,"ABC News says that both Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his Democratic counterpart, Kamala Harris, have agreed to meet in a debate on Sept. 10.

The network’s announcement on Thursday came shortly after Trump told a news conference that he had agreed to three debates with Harris in September on separate networks.

Trump is rejoining the ABC debate days after posting on his social media network that he would not appear on the network, citing a lawsuit he has filed. His decision sets up a highly anticipated moment in an election where the first debate led to a massive change in the race — with Democratic President Joe Biden ending his reelection bid and endorsing Harris.

“I think it’s very important to have debates,” Trump said Thursday. “I look forward to the debates because I think we have to set the record straight.”

On the social media site X later on Thursday, Harris wrote that “I hear that Donald Trump has fully committed to debating me on September 10. I look forward to it.”

At a private fundraiser in Paris on Thursday, Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, said he “cannot wait” to see his wife debate Trump. He was in Paris as head of the U.S. delegation to the Summer Olympics closing ceremony.

Fox News has also proposed a debate between Harris and Trump to take place on Sept. 4, and NBC News is angling to air one on Sept. 25. During an appearance in Michigan, Harris said she was “happy to have that conversation” about an additional debate.

Trump also said he wants his vice presidential candidate, JD Vance, to debate Harris’ choice for veep, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, on CBS. The network is discussing potential dates to propose for that meeting.

ABC says that David Muir and Linsey Davis will moderate the Sept. 10 contest. That’s the same date that Trump and Biden had agreed to their second and final debate, before Biden’s decision put that event in doubt.

Any debate promises to take on extra importance with polls showing a tight race between the former president and current vice president. While Harris has ridden a wave of excitement among Democrats since inheriting the mantle from Biden, she has yet to appear at a news conference or give an interview to a journalist.

Republicans are already making that an issue. Vance, in a post on X as Trump was in his news conference on Thursday, said Harris was hiding behind a TelePrompter. “It’s been 18 days since she answered real questions from the media,” he wrote.

Trump says he has agreed to offer ABC News to debate Harris.,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/donald-trump-debate-kamala-harris-make-case-112388274,"Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign says former President Donald Trump is scared to debate her

Trump says he 'probably' will debate Harris but can 'make a case for not.' Her team says he's scared

NEW YORK -- Donald Trump seems to be backing away from his earlier commitment to debate Vice President Kamala Harris, questioning the value of a meetup and saying he “probably” will debate but he “can also make a case for not doing it” — prompting her campaign to say he's “scared.”

Trump, in an interview with Fox News Channel that aired Monday night, was pressed several times about committing to debating Harris before giving a squishier answer than he had in recent days.

The Republican former president had been willing to debate President Joe Biden when Biden was the Democratic nominee after months of suggesting that the president was not mentally up for the matchup — or the presidency. But after Biden dropped out of the race and Harris became poised to be the Democratic presidential candidate, Trump has been questioning the terms of the original debate he agreed to with Biden. He has suggested the Sept. 10 debate on ABC News should be moved to a different network, calling ABC “fake news.”

Last week, in a phone call with reporters, Trump was asked if he'd commit to debating Harris at least once. He responded: “Oh, yes, absolutely. I'd want to,"" and he said there was an obligation to debate.

In the interview Monday, host Laura Ingraham repeatedly pressed Trump on whether he would commit to a debate.

""I want to do a debate. But I also can say this. Everybody knows who I am. And now people know who she is,"" Trump said.

Trump eventually said, “The answer is yes, I'll probably end up debating.""

He went on for a minute, saying any debates need to be held before early voting starts in states, and then he added, “The answer is yes, but I can also make a case for not doing it.""

Trump has skipped debates before, including all the 2024 Republican presidential primary debates. He initially didn't participate after suggesting the timing was too early and then questioning the venue of another before eventually making it clear he would not participate in any of those debates.

Harris campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa accused Trump of continuing to dodge a face-off with his likely opponent.

“It’s clear from tonight’s question-dodging: He’s scared he’ll have to defend his running mate’s weird attacks on women or his own calls to end elections in America in a debate against the vice president,” Moussa said.

The Republican candidate also sought in the interview Monday to clarify comments he made last week at a conservative event in which he told an audience of Christians that they “won’t have to vote anymore” after he's elected.

He urged Christians, who he claims don’t vote in high numbers, to vote “just this time,"" and said, “You won’t have to do it anymore.”

In four years, he said: “It’ll be fixed, it’ll be fine. You won’t have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians.""

He added moments later: “In four years, you don’t have to vote again. We’ll have it fixed so good, you’re not gonna have to vote.”

The comments drew alarm from Democrats and others who noted Trump's pattern of using authoritarian language, his earlier comments that he would only be a dictator on “day one” and his behavior after losing the 2020 presidential election, in which he refused to accept the results and sought to overturn them.

Trump's campaign and supporters offered various explanations for his comments, and Ingraham prodded him to explain what he meant.

“They don't vote, and I’m explaining that to 'em. ‘You never vote.’ This time, vote. I’ll straighten out the country. You won’t have to vote anymore. I won't need your vote,"" Trump said.

Ingraham asked if he meant Christians won't need to vote for him because he will only have four years in office.

Trump started his answer by speaking about voting rates of Christians and gun owners, and Ingraham interrupted to ask him again.

“Don’t worry about the future. Vote, on, you have to vote on November 5th. After that, you don’t have to worry about voting anymore. I don’t care because we're going to fix up — the country will be fixed and we won’t even need your vote anymore because, frankly, we will have such love. If you don’t want to vote anymore, that’s OK,” Trump said.

Trump made similar comments last month at another Christian-focused event, in which he lamented the voting rates of Christians and implored them to participate in the election.

“In four years, you don’t have to vote, OK? In four years, don’t vote. I don’t care,"" he said.

U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Thursday he is willing to debate his Democratic rival Kamala Harris three times in September on different networks, as he tried to win back momentum from the Democratic vice president's newly galvanized campaign. ABC News said on X that it would host a presidential debate on Sept. 10 and that both Trump and Harris had agreed to participate.

During a news conference at his Palm Beach, Florida, residence, Trump said he wanted to hold debates on Sept. 4, Sept. 10 and Sept. 25, with Fox, ABC and NBC hosting one each.

His campaign later clarified that he had mixed up which network would host which debate.

Trump did not detail specific terms, such as whether there would be an audience, and it was not immediately clear whether his campaign had made a proposal to Harris' camp about the other two dates. The Harris campaign did not immediately comment on the debates.

The news conference was Trump's first public appearance since Harris selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate on Tuesday.

Harris, the U.S. vice president, and Walz have headlined rallies in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin this week, drawing tens of thousands of attendees in a fresh sign of how her late entry into the race has re-energized Democrats.

Her rapid rise has sent Trump's team scrambling to recalibrate their strategy and messaging. Opinion polls show Harris has erased the lead Trump had built over President Joe Biden, and Democrats have raked in hundreds of millions of dollars from voters and big donors in a matter of weeks.

The former president's campaign also put forth debate dates of Sept. 4 and Sept. 25, with details to be worked out with the Harris campaign.

""I think they'll be very revealing,"" Trump told reporters during a snap news conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla. ""We'd like to do three debates.""

Harris, speaking to reporters in Michigan, responded to the Republican nominee: ""I am looking forward to debating Donald Trump and we have a date of September 10. I hear he's finally committed to it and I'm looking forward to it.""

As for the prospect of other debates, Harris replied, ""I am happy to have that conversation about an additional debate, or after September 10, for sure.""

ABC News, which had previously scheduled a debate between Trump and President Joe Biden, said in a statement that it will ""host qualifying presidential candidates to debate on September 10 on ABC. Vice President Harris and former President Trump have both confirmed they will attend the ABC debate.""

In recent days, Trump had suggested he might withdraw from the ABC agreement because of conflicts with the network, and the fact that Biden has withdrawn from the race and Harris has earned the Democratic nomination.

On Thursday, Trump confused people by saying he is willing to do an ABC debate on Sept. 25, as well Fox on Sept. 4, and NBC on Sept. 10.

""I will expose Kamala during the Debate the same way I exposed Crooked Joe, Hillary, and everyone else during Debates,” Trump said earlier in the day on his Truth Social account. ""Only I think Kamala will be easier.”"

Trump says he has agreed to offer ABC News to debate Harris.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy54l4x7d71o,"Debate showdown between Trump and Harris set for September

Ms Harris confirmed that she will attend the ABC debate while at an event in Michigan on Thursday, but she has not yet weighed in on any additional dates.

“We think we should do three debates,” Trump said, suggesting two additional debates that he said would be hosted by Fox News and NBC, respectively.

The network confirmed the showdown in a post on X, formerly Twitter, after Trump said on Thursday that he would be open to debating his Democratic rival multiple times before the November election.

ABC News has said it will host the first debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris on 10 September.

“I am looking forward to debating Donald Trump and we have a date of September 10. I hear he’s finally committed to it and I’m looking forward to it,"" Ms Harris said at the event in Detroit.

Trump, the Republican candidate, debated President Joe Biden once in June.

The two were slated to do so again on 10 September but Mr Biden withdrew from the US presidential race after a disastrous performance against Trump in the televised matchup.

The confirmation of the debate on ABC marks an end to a back-and-forth that followed Mr Biden's decision to leave the race between the two campaigns over that planned showdown.

Trump had previously said that he wanted a debate hosted by the conservative network Fox News, saying it would take place in Pennsylvania, ""at a site in an area to be determined"".

The Harris campaign had maintained they would still like to debate Trump on 10 September.

At a news conference on Thursday at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump also said he would like to debate Ms Harris two additional times - on 4 September on Fox News and on 25 September on NBC.

Trump said that CBS will host a debate between the two vice-presidential nominees, Republican JD Vance and Democratic Tim Walz.

NBC News is reportedly in discussions with both campaigns about a potential debate this autumn and the Harris campaign has not agreed to a Fox News debate, the New York Times reported.

At his news conference, Trump criticised Ms Harris for not holding a news conference or doing an interview since she became the likely Democratic nominee just over two weeks ago.

He called her “barely competent” and criticised her intelligence.

In a statement, the Harris campaign said that if Trump ""is so concerned about the success of VP Harris, he could, you know, get out there on the campaign trail"".

Trump took questions for about an hour - an event held amid reports that his campaign is feeling the pressure from Democrats, who have new enthusiasm under Ms Harris and have been dominating headlines.

National and battleground state polls suggest her campaign has gained some ground in recent days, though the race for the White House remains a close contest.

The former president denied he had ""recalibrated"" his campaign to challenge Ms Harris instead of Mr Biden, and he appeared to prickle when asked about the audience Ms Harris draws at rallies.

""Oh, give me a break,"" he said, arguing that crowds at his rallies were larger than at hers.

His Thursday news conference is the first he has held in several months, as his campaign has previously focused on holding rallies across the country.

Trump also praised his running mate Mr Vance, who was recently under fire for comments he made in 2021 when he said those without children shouldn't be leading the country and that women who don't have children are ""miserable"" and ""childless cat ladies"".

“I have to tell you, JD Vance has really stepped up,” Trump said. “He's doing a fantastic job.”

He took aim at Ms Harris' track record on immigration and the economy.

And he repeated his belief that US presidents should have a say over interest rates and monetary policy - a departure from the longstanding practice of having the US Federal Reserve, an independent body, oversee these matters.

He emphasised his priorities of lowering inflation, lowering crime rates and strengthening the military.

Ms Harris on Thursday addressed United Auto Workers in Detroit, and thanked the union for endorsing her.

She said there are ""89 days to get this done"" ahead of the election."
Trump says he has agreed to offer ABC News to debate Harris.,https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/trump-agrees-to-sept-10-debate-with-harris-claims-two-more-upcoming/,"WASHINGTON — Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said Thursday he has agreed to debate Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris on Sept. 10, a reversal from his position last week that he would not participate in the ABC News event.

During a press conference at Trump’s Mar-A-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, the former president said he had also agreed to debates on Sept. 4 and Sept. 25.

The first debate would be hosted by Fox News, he said.

He initially misspoke and said the Sept. 10 debate would be on NBC, with ABC hosting the debate on Set. 25. His campaign later clarified the ABC News debate would be Sept. 10, the date Trump and President Joe Biden agreed to with ABC before Biden dropped out of the race, with NBC hosting the final debate.

ABC News confirmed that Trump and the Harris campaign have agreed to the network’s debate.

“I think it’s very important to have debates,” Trump said.

He then quickly moved on to disparaging Harris.

The Harris campaign, Fox News and NBC did not respond to States Newsroom’s requests for comment.

In a press release, the Harris campaign called Trump’s press conference a “public meltdown,” but did not mention if Harris would participate in the Fox News or NBC debate.

Biden was the presumptive Democratic nominee but dropped out of the race following a disastrous performance at the first 2024 general election debate on June 27.

Following Biden’s withdrawal, Harris quickly clinched the nomination and kicked off a campaign tour with her newly tapped running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

Peaceful transfer of power

During Thursday’s press conference, a reporter asked if there would be a peaceful transfer of power if Trump lost the election.

“Of course, there’ll be a peaceful transfer and there was last time and there’ll be a peaceful transfer,” Trump said. “I just hope we’re going to have honest elections.”

The 2021 transfer from the Trump to Biden presidencies was among the most chaotic and violent in the country’s history.

On Jan. 6, 2021, a group of pro-Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in an effort to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 presidential election results. Congress impeached Trump for a second time due to his role in inciting the insurrection.

In September of 2020, Trump didn’t commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he lost that election.

Trump said that the hundreds of people the U.S. Justice Department has charged and convicted in their role in the Jan. 6 attack, were not being treated fairly.

“Nobody was killed on January 6,” Trump said, which is not true. “I think that the people of January 6 were treated very unfairly.”

Two police officers, Howard Liebengood of the U.S. Capitol Police and Jeffrey Smith of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, died by suicide after Jan. 6 that were ruled a line of duty death. A woman, Ashli Babbitt, was shot and killed by a Capitol police officer as she tried to breach the Speaker’s Lobby adjacent to the U.S. House floor.

Only the ABC debate has been confirmed by all parties. Speaking at a press conference at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, Trump said he would debate Harris on Fox, NBC and ABC in September.

“We have spoken to the heads of the networks and it’s all been confirmed, other than some fairly minor details,” he said. “The other side has to agree to the terms. They may or may not agree.”

ABC News confirmed that both candidates are set to appear at its debate on Sept. 10.

A person familiar with the matter says NBC News has been in touch with both campaigns about a range of dates, including September 25. Fox News did not comment.

Harris has agreed to one debate.

“I hear that Donald Trump has finally committed to debating me on September 10,” she said on X on Thursday afternoon. “I look forward to it.”

Trump originally agreed to debate President Biden on ABC on Sept. 10, but withdrew that commitment after Biden dropped out of the race. The Harris campaign charged that Trump was “too scared” to debate, and said that Harris would show up whether he was there or not.

“Since he talks the talk, he should walk the walk and – as Vice President Harris said earlier this week – say it to her face on September 10,” said co-chair Cedric Richmond on Aug. 2. “She’ll be there waiting to see if he’ll show up.”

In a statement on Thursday, ABC said that both candidates are now on board.

“ABC News will host qualifying presidential candidates to debate on September 10 on ABC,” an ABC spokesperson said. “Vice President Harris and former President Trump have both confirmed they will attend the ABC debate.”

When he withdrew from the ABC debate, Trump said he would debate Harris on Fox on Sept. 4. In his remarks Thursday, he said he would still do that date, as well as a debate on NBC on Sept. 10 and ABC on Sept. 25.

Harris has not agreed to debate on Fox, and referred to it as a “safe space” for Trump in a post on X last week.

Trump also floated the possibility of a vice presidential debate on CBS. A person familiar said that the network has reached out to both sides about potential presidential and vice presidential debates, but that nothing is confirmed.

Trump says he has agreed to offer ABC News to debate Harris.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/08/08/trump-harris-news-conference/,"Former president Donald Trump on Thursday agreed to debate Vice President Kamala Harris on Sept. 10 on ABC, reversing himself after ruling out such a meeting previously. Trump made the announcement during a meandering news conference where he also made a series of false claims about the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, including that it was part of a peaceful transition of power and that his speech beforehand drew a bigger crowd than when Martin Luther King Jr. spoke from the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington.

“We actually had more people,” Trump said of his Jan. 6 speech, compared with King’s “I Have a Dream” speech. On at least eight occasions, when asked about pardons for Jan. 6 defendants, he said it was the “biggest crowd I’ve ever spoken to.”

Trump repeatedly assailed Harris at the news conference and pushed for two more debates, Sept. 4 on Fox News and Sept. 25 on NBC. He previously proposed the Sept. 4 meeting.

“We have those three dates and those networks, they’re very anxiously awaiting that date and those dates,” Trump said during the news conference at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida. He added that Harris has to agree to the debates and that the plans have been confirmed with the networks “other than some fairly minor details,” including location.

Trump apparently mixed up NBC and ABC in his news conference remarks. His campaign clarified Sept. 10 is the date of the ABC debate and Sept. 25 is the date of the proposed NBC debate.

After Trump’s comments, ABC News said on X that Trump and Harris “have both confirmed they will attend the ABC debate.”

The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Harris previously pushed Trump to keep the Sept. 10 debate with ABC that he originally agreed to when President Joe Biden was running for reelection.

“I’ll be there on September 10th, like he agreed to,” Harris said on X. “I hope to see him there.”

Harris’s campaign responded to the news conference with a long email fact-checking Trump’s claims that included a reference to his mixing up of the debate dates.

“The ABC debate is September 10th. Not the 25th,” the email said.

Harris and Trump have been wrangling over debates since Biden ended his reelection campaign last month and backed Harris to replace him on the ticket. Biden’s decision came after a widely criticized debate performance in late June.

Trump had agreed to a second debate against Biden on Sept. 10 on ABC. After Biden dropped out, Harris announced she wanted to keep that date, but Trump withdrew and said he would meet her in a Fox News debate on Sept. 4.

“I’ll see her September 4th, or I won’t see her at all,” Trump said at the time.

Her campaign rejected that date and vowed she would show up to the original ABC debate regardless of Trump’s attendance.

At the news conference, Trump also unleashed multiple falsehoods about Jan. 6, when a crowd of his supporters stormed the Capitol to stop the certification of his reelection loss. Biden said in a TV interview released Wednesday that he was “not confident at all” there will be a peaceful transfer of power in January if Trump loses again.

At the news conference, Trump falsely claimed it was part of a peaceful transfer of power “last time” and “nobody was killed on January 6th.” The violent attack left five people dead, including a police officer and a woman shot by police.

Trump boasted, as he has done before, about the crowd that he drew before the attack. He said it was the “biggest crowd I’ve ever spoken to,” falsely claiming it was larger than King’s.

“Nobody’s spoken to crowds bigger than me,” Trump said.

Trump complained extensively about Harris being the nominee instead of Joe Biden, even as he said he was not complaining. He denied he has “recalibrated strategy” against her and predicted the “honeymoon period’s going to end.”

Trump seemed particularly annoyed at comparisons of her crowds to his, falsely stating the size of his crowd at several recent events.

“What a stupid question,” he said, when asked why he was not campaigning more frequently. “Because I’m leading by a lot.”

He attacked the popular Republican governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp again, though he suggested the two might have a detente of sorts. “I’ve never understood it. When you get somebody elected, they’re supposed to like you,” Trump said of Kemp. The relationship failed after Kemp wouldn’t help him overturn the 2020 election results, and Trump has slashed him since.

Trump scheduled the news conference after learning his team was planning to brief reporters a few miles from Mar-a-Lago without him present, according to Trump advisers. He asked them instead to bring the reporters to Mar-a-Lago for a news conference, where he bragged about how large the foyer was. The podium was not adorned with a campaign sign, but a sign for his private club.

The former president spent the morning going after Harris on Truth Social and accused the media of giving overly positive attention to her rally crowd sizes. She held a large rally Wednesday night at a Detroit airport hangar, the kind of backdrop that Trump has often used for his boisterous campaign events.

Harris on Thursday was set to continue campaigning in Michigan with her new running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D). They plan to meet with members of the United Auto Workers union in Detroit before heading to another battleground state, Arizona, for a rally Friday.

Ahead of the Western swing, Harris’s campaign announced an ad campaign targeting Latino voters. It includes a minute-long spot — in both English and Spanish — that is largely biographical and touts Harris’s “determination” throughout her life.

New polling has underscored the changed nature of the race since Biden’s withdrawal. A national survey from Marquette Law School found Harris with a narrow lead over Trump among registered voters.

The Harris campaign has not yet responded to a request for comment.

Audience composition and location have yet to be determined, Trump said, adding that the ""other side,"" meaning the Harris campaign, ""has to agree to the terms.""

""We think we should do three debates,"" Trump said.

Trump also said CBS News would host a vice presidential debate next month, noting that his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, has ""really stepped up, he's doing a fantastic job."" The Harris campaign has previously agreed to the vice presidential debate. CBS News has extended invitations to the Harris and Trump campaigns inviting the candidates to participate in vice presidential and presidential debates.

It was the first Trump-Biden debate in late June that set into motion Mr. Biden's ultimate departure from the race and his replacement by Harris as the Democratic presidential nominee.

Initially, President Biden and former President Trump agreed to a Sept. 10 debate to be hosted by ABC News. But once President Biden left the race and Vice President Harris became the face of the Democratic ticket, Trump's firm commitment became more uncertain.

However, at least for now, it appears Trump is rejoining the ABC debate after previously saying he would not appear on the network, citing a pending lawsuit.

""I hear that Donald Trump has finally committed to debating me on September 10,"" Harris said in a statement after the announcement. ""I look forward to it.""

The new agreement sets up what is sure to be a highly anticipated meeting between Trump and Harris, who have both accused the other in recent weeks of dodging the debate stage.

This also comes after Trump vice presidential nominee JD Vance said earlier this week that he will debate Harris' running mate Tim Walz, but not until he is ""officially the nominee"" — speculating that the top of the Democratic ticket could still be changed.

""Would it shock me if the Democrats pulled another switcheroo? No, it wouldn't,"" Vance said. ""So look, we're going to wait until they actually nominate Kamala Harris and Tim Walz before we do any debates.""

This year's fall presidential debate calendar is more uncertain than previous years because the nonpartisan presidential debate commission is no longer organizing and hosting, following opposition from the campaigns. Instead, individual television networks are pitching debates directly to the campaigns.

Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have agreed to a debate on Sept. 10 hosted by ABC News, both presidential nominees said Thursday. Trump at a news conference said that he has also signed up for two more debates: one to be hosted by Fox News on Sept. 4, the other to be hosted by NBC News on Sept. 25. Harris, the Democratic nominee, later told reporters, ""I am happy to have that conversation about an additional debate, or after Sept. 10 [on ABC News], for sure.""

""I have always been on record, I am looking forward to debating Donald Trump and we have a date of Sept. 10,"" Harris told NBC News earlier at a campaign event with the United Auto Workers union in Wayne, Michigan. Republican nominee Trump, at the news conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, said, ""I think it's very important to have debates."" Trump said CBS News will host a vice presidential debate between his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, and Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Fox previously agreed to host a Trump-Harris debate on Sept. 4.

NBC has pitched both campaigns multiple potential dates for a presidential debate, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC. Trump's campaign agreed to Sept. 25 but the Harris campaign has yet to agree to that date, the person said. Trump's announcement of three potential debates with Harris was a reversal of his vow last week that he would not participate in a debate on ABC. Trump at the time claimed his pending defamation lawsuit against the network created a ""conflict of interest."" Harris since then had taunted Trump for refusing to commit to the ABC debate, whose Sept. 10 date was set originally for Trump to debate President Joe Biden, who dropped out of the election last month. Trump's freewheeling news conference Thursday, which lasted about an hour, came amid a swell of momentum for the Harris-Walz ticket. Trump's campaign in recent days has pressured Harris and Walz to take questions from the media — and pressured media outlets to demand the Democrats do so — as it accused the vice president of dodging reporters. ""She hasn't done an interview, she can't do an interview, she's barely competent,"" Trump said Thursday. Harris has largely sidestepped reporters since Biden dropped his reelection bid and endorsed her as his replacement last month. Harris and Walz on Tuesday embarked on a kickoff campaign swing through battleground states, without holding news conferences."
Trump says he has agreed to offer ABC News to debate Harris.,https://deadline.com/2024/08/trump-says-three-debates-kamala-harris-1236034931/,"(Updated with ABC debate confirmation, Harris comments) “We’d like to do three debates,” Donald Trump said today of meeting Kamala Harris face-to-face before the November election.

“I think it’s very important to have debates, and we’ve agreed with Fox on a date of September 4,” the GOP nominee announced today in a press conference from his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida. “We’ve agreed with NBC, fairly full agreement subject to them on September 10, and we’ve agreed with ABC on September 25 so we have those three dates and those networks,” Trump added.

Of course, Trump being Trump, the debates with the now poll-leading Vice President are not actually a done deal on all three outlets. “The other side has to agree to the terms,” the ex-Celebrity Apprentice host admitted. “They may or may not agree. I don’t know if they’re going to agree.”

Intentionally or not, looks like Trump got his dates mixed up as ABC is saying that their debate is still on September 10 with the two candidates. David Muir and Linsey Davis will moderate.

Harris told reporters this afternoon, “Well, I’m glad that he’s finally agreed to a debate on September 10.” As for more debates, she said she was “happy to have that conversation about an additional debate, or after September 10, for sure.” She also said that she wanted to schedule a sit down interview with a media outlet “scheduled before the end of the month.”

Last month, Trump made a big deal of dropping out of the long scheduled September 10 POTUS debate on ABC. Today’s inclusion of the Disney-owned net is also surprising as Trump has roasted ABC over and over as unfair to him. NBC has not confirmed the September 10 date that Trump tossed out today, nor a potential September 25 date, but they and the campaigns are discussing various dates, I hear.

With the VP challenging Trump to “say it to my face” in her rallies the past week, the Harris campaign has yet to respond to the Republican’s announcement of three debates. However, when it came to Trump’s obsession with crowd size, which he returned back to again and again in Thursday’s press conference, Harris and running mate Gov. Tim Walz were quick to knock down his faulty math.

In an election that has actually seen big big crowds for Harris and tossed the rule book out, especially with Joe Biden’s disastrous June 27 debate performance and dropping out of the race last month, Trump went through much of his usual stump speech and grievances today. Amidst that he repeatedly warned that the geopolitical situation was “close to World War III,” offered up legally incorrect interpretations of the Constitution on a number of subjects, and attacked Harris as “not smart enough” to handle the media or be president.

Thursday’s rambling and false claim-filled press conference is the first Trump has given since he was convicted on 34 felony counts in his hush money trial. While speaking frequently on and off the record to the media traveling with her, the Vice President has not given a formal press conference since becoming the Democrats leading contender and presumptive nominee.

Harris and Walz are on a tour of battleground states that started yesterday in Wisconsin and Michigan. Today, the VP and the Minnesota governor are in Michigan again, before traveling to Arizona. The duo will be on the road until August 10, ending with events in Las Vegas and Harris’ old stomping ground of San Francisco.

Off the trail for most of the past two weeks, Trump’s only scheduled campaign event is a rally in Montana on Saturday. Sure to attract a big crowd and give some juice to down ballot races, Trump’s visit to Montana is seen as otherwise odd being that he is well ahead in the state.

During his announcement, Trump seemingly got some of the dates incorrect. Both ABC News and the Trump campaign later clarified that the ABC News debate would take place on Sept. 10. The Fox News debate was previously proposed for Sept. 4.

A source familiar with the plans said that the NBC News one was set for Sept. 25, which was one of the options the network gave the campaigns as a date.

When President Joe Biden was still running, his campaign and Trump's agreed to two debates: one with CNN on June 27 and a second with ABC News on Sept. 10. But after Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris, Trump began to waver on his commitment to participating. Last week, Trump said he would skip the ABC News debate because the event had ""been terminated in that Biden will no longer be a participant.""

After Trump pulled out, Harris campaign communications director Michael Tyler said in a statement, ""The Vice President will be there one way or the other to take the opportunity to speak to a prime time national audience. ... We’re happy to discuss further debates after the one both campaigns have already agreed to.”

Harris later Thursday confirmed she would attend the ABC debate, telling NBC News, “I am looking forward to debating Donald Trump and we have a date of September 10th. I hear he’s finally committed to it and I’m looking forward to it.” She did not respond to a question about other potential dates.

Trump on Thursday also said that the campaign has agreed to a vice presidential debate on CBS News, adding that his running mate, Ohio GOP Sen. JD Vance, ""has really stepped up. He’s doing a fantastic job.""

On Tuesday, at Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's first rally since being named Harris' running mate, he said of Vance, ""I can't wait to debate the guy.""

During a campaign event Wednesday in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, Vance wouldn't commit to debating Walz, baselessly suggesting that there was still a chance that he wouldn't be the Democratic vice presidential nominee.

""We don't know who the vice presidential nominee is going to be either,"" Vance told reporters, adding that Democrats could ""pull a bait and switch"" and take him off the ticket.

Harris and Walz were formally certified as the Democratic nominees for president and vice president this week.

CBS News and Fox News did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

“She’s not doing a news conference. You know why? She’s not doing it because she can’t do a news conference,” Trump said during his wide-ranging, 65-minute presser at his Mar-a-Lago estate.

Trump, 78, ratcheted up his attacks on Harris, 59, including by saying she was selected to replace President Biden as the Democrats’ nominee for “politically correct” reasons, as she took the lead in national polling.

“She won’t even do interviews with friendly people, because she can’t do better than Biden,” Trump told reporters.

Trump said his own accessibility contrasted notably with Harris’ reclusive approach to press engagement.

“She’s not smart enough to do a news conference, and I’m sorry — we need smart people to lead this country because our country has never been in this danger before, both economically and from an outside perspective.”

Republicans are attempting to end Harris’ more than two-week honeymoon phase of soft press coverage by goading her into unscripted engagements that could draw critical coverage of her policy positions and performance as vice president.

“She hasn’t done an interview. She can’t do an interview,” Trump said. “But I look forward to the debates.”

Trump announced he agreed to do three debates with Harris — one on Fox News on September 4, another with NBC on September 10 and a third on ABC on September 25.

Trump and Biden’s campaign previously committed to an ABC debate, but the former president had indicated he was backing out, citing his litigation against the outlet.

He also said Harris has been “the most unpopular vice president” and was “nasty” to Biden, 81, when they faced off in the 2020 primaries and was “calling him a racist.”

He claimed that Biden, who stepped aside on July 21 and endorsed Harris, is “a very angry man right now.”

“The presidency was taken away from Joe Biden, and I’m no Biden fan, but I tell you what, from a constitutional standpoint, from any standpoint you look at, they took the presidency away, and people were saying he lost after the debate, he couldn’t win,” Trump said.

“Well, I don’t know that that’s true, necessarily, but whether he could win or he couldn’t win, he had the right to run. And they took it away … They said, ‘We’ll do it the nice way or we’ll do it the hard way.’”

Trump slammed Harris for not giving any interviews since she assumed the Democratic mantle — a point his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, dramatically made at the foot of Air Force Two Wednesday.

The ex-president scoffed at a reporter’s question about Harris’ massive rallies this week in Philadelphia, western Wisconsin and Detroit.

Follow The Post’s coverage on Kamala Harris’ running mate Tim Walz:

“In South Carolina, we had 88,000 people. In Alabama, we had 68,000 people,” he claimed. “Nobody says about crowd size with me. But she has 1,000 people or 1,500 people and they say, ‘Oh, the enthusiasm is back.’ No, no, the enthusiasm is with me and the Republican Party.”

Harris on Tuesday night filled up Temple University’s Liacouras Center, which has a roughly 10,000-person capacity, and on Wednesday spoke to similarly large crowds in Eau Claire, Wis., and in the Motor City.

Trump also addressed Biden’s prediction in a CBS interview taped Wednesday that there may not be a peaceful transfer of power following the Nov. 5 election.

“Of course there’ll be a peaceful transfer, and there was last time,” he said — despite thousands of his supporters storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to prevent certification of Biden’s victory in the Electoral College.

Trump addressed a range of foreign and domestic policy matters, saying he’d bolster US security by dealing more effectively with adversaries such as China, North Korea and Russia. The former chief executive said he and Chinese President Xi Jinping “had a very good relationship” but that the COVID-19 pandemic “broke up our relationship.”

“I think I’m going to get along great with China, President Xi of China and I were very good friends. We met right here,” Trump said, despite suggesting seeking up to $60 trillion in “reparations” from Beijing.

“I think we’re going to have a great relationship, and I think it’s going to be mutually beneficial, but we cannot have it where China is taking advantage of the United States,” he continued.

In some of his more animated remarks, Trump claimed that he knows Biden “regrets” that he picked Harris to be his running mate in 2020.

“She was the first loser in the primary system, during the Democrat primary system. She was the first one to quit. And she quit — she had no votes, no support, and she was a bad debater,” Trump said. “She never made it to Iowa. Then, for some reason, and I know he regrets it — you do too — he picked her and she turned on him, too.”

Trump also addressed abortion rights — one of the biggest Republican liabilities, according to polling — arguing that “I think that abortion has become much less of an issue” and that “I think it’s actually going to be a very small issue.”

“Now the states are voting, and frankly, some of the votes are much more, if you could say liberal, than you would think. Ohio turned out to be. They had a big vote, and it turned out to be a much more liberal standing than people would have thought. Kansas, the same thing,” Trump said.

Here is the latest on VP pick Tim Walz’s time in the military

“And then you have Texas and you have other places where it may be different, but the issue has been brought back to the states now, and like Ronald Reagan, I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother.”

Trump predicted that a looming Florida ballot measure to restore abortion rights in the state would “go in a little more liberal way than people thought” — without explicitly saying his own position on the referendum.

The Republican nominee said Harris was faring better than Biden in polling because “she’s a woman, she represents certain groups of people.”

“I see her going way down to the polls now — now that people are finding out that she destroyed San Francisco, she destroyed the state of California, along with Governor Gavin Newscum [sic],” Trump said, even though the RealClearPolitics average of recent polls shows Harris leading by half a percentage point.

“The honeymoon period is going to end,” he insisted — less than three months before Election Day.

Trump also said at the press conference that he had a small “scar” from the bullet that grazed his ear in an assassination attempt last month and expressed sympathy for the plight of first son Hunter Biden, calling controversies around his drug use and foreign cash grabs “tragic.”

Trump indicated he would not instruct the Justice Department to prosecute the Bidens, noting that he hadn’t done so against his 2016 rival Hillary Clinton, despite what he called her “pretty evil” conduct mishandling classified documents with a private email server."

The effort by Trump to reclaim the spotlight comes after recent weeks dramatically reshaped a presidential race that the former president had previously been leading. Democrats have been invigorated by President Joe Biden ’s decision to step aside, and polls show a surge of support for Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz , her running mate unveiled earlier this week."

The announcement Thursday came shortly after Trump told a news conference that he had proposed three presidential debates with three television networks, saying he agreed on certain dates in September.

Trump is rejoining the ABC debate days after posting on his social media network that he would not appear on the network, citing a lawsuit he has filed. This sets up a highly anticipated moment in an election where the first debate led to a massive change in the race when Democratic U.S. President Joe Biden ended his re-election bid and endorsed Harris.

""I think it's very important to have debates,"" Trump said Thursday. ""I look forward to the debates because I think we have to set the record straight.""

The Harris campaign had no immediate comment.

Trump had said he would prefer that Fox News sponsor the debate, but by Wednesday, he was showing willingness to reconsider ABC.

Trump also echoed criticism from his running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, that Harris has not held a news conference or sat down for interviews since she entered the race.

Harris has a travelling media pool with her on Air Force Two for all trips. Trump does not have such a pool accompanying him on his plane when he campaigns.

Vance has journalists flying with him, and he campaigned this week in states where Harris and running mate Tim Walz had their own events scheduled. That included on Wednesday, when Vance's plane and Air Force Two ended up on the same tarmac in Wisconsin.

Vance started walking toward the Democrat's plane but did not reach it before a motorcade carrying Harris, Walz and the travelling media pool pulled away.

Insults, falsehoods

Separate from the news about the ABC debate, Trump held an hour-long news conference Thursday at his Mar-a-Lago compound in Palm Beach, Fla.

Trump taunted his Democratic opponent while also repeating old falsehoods and lashing out at questions about the enthusiasm her campaign is receiving.

He also took aim at Walz, in what was Trump's first public appearance since Harris announced her running mate.

Trump called Walz, the governor of Minnesota, a ""radical left man.""

""Between her and him, there's never been anything like this,"" Trump said. ""There's certainly never been anybody so liberal like these two.""

He repeatedly suggested Harris was not intelligent enough to debate him. Harris, for her part, has tried to goad Trump into debating and told an audience in Atlanta recently that if he had anything to say about her, he should ""say it to my face.""

Trump grew visibly perturbed when pressed on Harris's crowds and newfound Democratic enthusiasm, dismissing a question about his lighter campaign schedule as stupid.

Trump says he has not ""recalibrated"" his campaign despite facing a new opponent, a dynamic some Republican strategists have quietly complained about.

When asked what assets Harris possessed, Trump said: ""She's a woman. She represents certain groups of people.""

Trump has repeatedly — and falsely — accused Harris, the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, of previously downplaying that she is Black.

False claims about Jan. 6

Trump falsely claimed during the news conference that ""nobody was killed on Jan. 6"" — the 2021 riot when Trump supporters breached the U.S. Capitol amid Congress's effort to certify Biden's 2020 election victory after Trump refused to concede.

Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old U.S. air force veteran from San Diego was shot and killed by a police officer as she climbed through a broken part of a Capitol door during the violence.

Trump has often cited Babbitt's death while lamenting the treatment of those who attended a rally outside the White House earlier that day, then marched to the Capitol, many of whom fought with police and entered the building.

He also falsely claimed more people attended his rally before the riot than the famous March on Washington in 1963, the iconic event at which Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his ""I Have a Dream"" speech."

The new agreement sets up what is sure to be a highly anticipated meeting between Trump and Harris, who have both accused the other in recent weeks of dodging the debate stage.

This also comes after Trump vice presidential nominee JD Vance said earlier this week that he will debate Harris' running mate Tim Walz, but not until he is ""officially the nominee"" — speculating that the top of the Democratic ticket could still be changed.

""Would it shock me if the Democrats pulled another switcheroo? No, it wouldn't,"" Vance said. ""So look, we're going to wait until they actually nominate Kamala Harris and Tim Walz before we do any debates.""

This year's fall presidential debate calendar is more uncertain than previous years because the nonpartisan presidential debate commission is no longer organizing and hosting, following opposition from the campaigns. Instead, individual television networks are pitching debates directly to the campaigns.

Presidential debates, of course, aren't required.

Harris agrees to debate Trump

The ABC debate will take place on a day her campaign has long stuck to as the Republican nominee waffled on his commitment.

“I hear that Donald Trump has finally committed to debating me on September 10,” she wrote on the social media site X. “I look forward to it.”

Earlier Thursday, Trump recommitted to the Sept. 10 debate — which had been arranged when Biden was still in the race — and proposed additional debates on other networks. The Harris campaign has not responded to Trump’s proposal of more debates.

The second gentleman rallies donors at a Paris fundraiser

Vice President Kamala Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, has rallied a group of enthusiastic donors in Paris, France, telling them his wife is “ready” and heaping praise on her newly minted running mate, Gov. Tim Walz.

The private fundraiser held in the French capital’s tony 16th arrondissement was hosted by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s mother, Judith Pisar, the widow of Holocaust survivor Samuel Pisar, who died in 2015. Organizers said it had raised $285,000.

Emhoff, who took time out of his Olympic duties as head of the U.S. delegation to the closing ceremony in Paris, was quick to highlight her choice of Walz, saying “she made the right choice” and touted the governor’s resume.

Emhoff also said he “cannot wait” to see his wife debate former President Trump, but urged the friendly crowd not to get “too comfortable” in the 89 days before the presidential election.

Trump suggests presidents should exert more power over the Federal Reserve

The former president’s statement on the Fed during his news conference earlier Thursday was a direct challenge to the U.S. central bank’s political independence. Most economists say the country is well-served by having the Fed make choices to address inflation without the risk of political interference, which could lead them to make policy mistakes by focusing instead on a president’s electoral goals.

Trump said he felt he had better instincts on the economy than Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who hiked a benchmark interest rate to help lower inflation after it spiked in 2022 to a four-decade high.

In response to a July question about whether the Fed should coordinate more with the White House, Powell said, “People have learned that a central bank that’s independent of political consideration does a better job of getting inflation under control, and that is now the accepted wisdom in all advanced economies around the world.”

Harris addresses United Auto Workers

Kamala Harris is tying her Oakland, California, upbringing by a single mother with running mate Walz’s childhood in small-town Nebraska in an address to United Auto Workers.

“The same people raised us, good people, hardworking people, people who had pride in their work,” she says in the Detroit union hall. “People who had pride in knowing we were a community of people who looked out for each other.”

“No one should ever be made to fight alone,” she said. “We are all in this together.”

Walz speaks at Detroit union hall

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz was sounding a little hoarse after his third day on the campaign trail.

“This is a bit of preaching to the choir. But the choir needs to sing. The choir needs to sing, right now,” Walz, Harris’ new running mate, told a room full of United Auto Workers union members in a Detroit union hall.

The rasp in Walz’s voice didn’t stop him from joining in the chants that have become a regular part of Harris’ rallies, “We’re not going back! We’re not going back! We’re not going back!”

Harris and Walz will speak at a Detroit union hall

The vice president and her Democratic running mate are set to play up their support for organized labor during an appearance at a Detroit-area union hall.

The two are on stage, waiting to speak to several dozen United Auto Workers members at Local 900 Hall, which represents Ford’s Michigan Assembly Plant.

Those members were the first Ford workers to strike in 2023 when the union’s contract with the company expired. Workers at the assembly plant went on strike Sept. 15 and remained on the picket lines until Oct. 25, when the union announced a tentative agreement with Ford.

Trump attacked Harris’ intelligence, claims he hasn’t ‘recalibrated’ his campaign

Trump said he has not “recalibrated” his campaign despite facing a new opponent, a dynamic some Republican strategists have quietly complained about.

Trump continued to criticize Biden, against whom he has been running since before the 2020 election, during his press conference at his home in Palm Beach, Florida, all while hurling personal insults at Harris, the new Democratic nominee.

When asked what assets Harris possessed, Trump said, “She’s a woman. She represents certain groups of people.”

Four times he questioned the intelligence of Harris, a former California attorney general and former U.S. senator.

He said the strategy for the campaign would not change because it’s not about Harris, it’s about the policies of the Biden-Harris administration that will decide the election.

Trump said abortion ‘has become much less of an issue’

During his news conference, the former president suggested that abortion “has become much less of an issue” since the Supreme Court ended the federal right to abortion services and returned control of the matter to state governments.

Trump argued that Democrats, Republicans and “everybody” is pleased with the results of the 2022 ruling that overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.

Trump’s actions within the GOP, however, suggest he knows that Democrats have already capitalized on Republican opposition to abortion rights and could do so again this fall. Trump single-handedly ensured that the Republican Party platform adopted at the 2024 convention in Milwaukee does not call for a national abortion ban, and he has said repeatedly that hardliners in the party could cost the GOP in November.

The court’s decision, issued months ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, is widely cited as a reason why Democrats fared much better than expected in House and Senate contests. And Democrats have hammered Trump on paid advertisements blaming him and the justices he appointed for ending Roe.

Trump and Harris campaigns have agreed to a Sept. 10 debate

ABC News says both the Trump and Harris campaigns have agreed to a Sept. 10 debate. That was the date Trump had initially agreed to debate President Biden, before Biden dropped out of the race.

The assassination attempt hasn’t changed Trump’s mind on gun control

Trump says almost being assassinated by a gunman has not changed his position opposing any new federal regulations or restrictions on weapons.

“People need the guns for protection,” he said, pointing to U.S. cities that have attempted local gun restrictions and still see violent crime.

Trump accused Harris of wanting to “take away everyone’s guns.”

Harris’ proposals call for universal background checks and a ban on certain near-military grade weapons like those that were banned from 1994 until a decade later, when then-President George W. Bush and Republicans on Capitol Hill allowed the ban to expire.

Fact Check: Trump claims ‘nobody was killed on Jan. 6’

Trump has falsely claimed that “nobody was killed on Jan. 6,” the date in 2021 when pro-Trump rioters breached the U.S. Capitol amid Congress’ effort to certify Democrat Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory.

Five people died in the riot and its aftermath, including Ashli Babbitt, a Trump supporter shot and killed by police, and Brian Sicknick, a police officer who died the day after battling the mob.

Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran from San Diego was shot and killed by a police officer as she climbed through a broken part of a Capitol door during the violent riot. To be sure, Trump has often cited Babbitt’s death while lamenting the treatment of those who attended a rally outside the White House that day and then marched to the Capitol, many of whom fought with police.

Federal prosecutors had weighed charging the officer involved in the shooting but opted not to file charges.

“I think those people were treated very badly when you compare it to other things that took place in this country where a lot of people were killed,” Trump said Thursday.

Trump repeats falsehoods about his 2020 election loss

Trump misrepresented the realities of the Jan. 6, 2021, attacks on the Capitol and the electorates of several Southern states as he repeated the lie that President Joe Biden’s victory in 2020 was due to fraud.

He insisted there “was a peaceful transfer of power” after the 2020 election. Certainly, Biden was inaugurated on schedule. But Washington was on lockdown that day, with the streets patrolled by military personnel and domestic police two weeks after Trump’s supporters had attacked the Capitol as Congress convened to certify Biden’s win.

Trump, meanwhile, argued, “You don’t win Alabama and South Carolina by records and lose Georgia. It doesn’t happen.”

Except Alabama and South Carolina are overwhelmingly Republican and Georgia has been trending toward a two-party battleground for years.

Alabama and South Carolina have about 5 million residents and heavily Republican electorates. Georgia, driven by decades of growth in metro Atlanta, now has about 11 million residents — and 5 million presidential voters.

As a comparison, Barack Obama lost Georgia by about 5 percentage points in 2008 without spending significant resources in the state. That same year, he lost Alabama by more than 22 points and lost South Carolina by 9 points.

Trump attacks his present (and former) rivals

Trump began his press conference with a three-pronged attack on Harris, her new running mate Gov. Walz of Minnesota and even President Biden, who has been out of the presidential race for weeks.

Trump began the event with a statement before calling into question Harris’ legitimacy as the nominee. “We have somebody who hasn’t received one vote for president,” he said. Harris was nominated by virtual roll call by the Democratic National Committee on Tuesday.

He called Walz “a radical left man,” adding that “he has positions that it’s not even possible to believe they exist.”

And he said “the presidency was taken away” from Biden, whom Trump has spent years focusing on, even as he said he did not plan to recalibrate his campaign, in light of a new opponent.

Trump offers to debate Harris

Trump suggested he would participate in as many as three debates against Harris. He said he’s willing to appear separately on Fox, NBC and ABC, all spread across September.

The former president has been inconsistent in recent weeks about his debate preferences, and Harris has not committed to any of Trump’s more recent ideas. Trump had agreed previously to a debate against President Biden on ABC in late September but then he pulled out of that commitment and called on Harris to join him in a Fox News debate.

ABC has said it would continue its regularly scheduled event and host whichever of the candidates shows up. Trump was noncommittal when asked if he would move forward if Harris only agreed to the ABC debate.

Trump opens press conference with dark portrait of America

Trump has opened a press conference at his home in Palm Beach, Florida, his first since Vice President Harris announced Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate on Tuesday.

He warned of World War III, a depression of “the 1929 variety” and a nation overrun with migrants from south of the U.S.-Mexico border.

“I think that our country is right now in the most dangerous position it’s ever been in, from an economic standpoint, from a safety standpoint,” he said, adding that President Joe Biden is the “worst president in the history of our country” and that Vice President Kamala Harris also ranks at the bottom of the people to hold the No. 2 spot.

Trump’s supporters typically hear his “America First” and “Make America Great Again” rallying cries as a fundamentally optimistic vision for fixing deep-seated problems. The question is whether more moderate voters hear the same message or are turned off by such sweeping, often-hyperbolic critiques of the country.

Harris’ husband to lead U.S. presidential delegation to Paris Olympics’ closing ceremony

Vice President Kamala Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, is leading the U.S. presidential delegation to the Paris Olympics’ closing ceremony Sunday, cheering on with American athletes over the next few days and holding events such as a UNESCO roundtable to discuss combating antisemitism.

At the roundtable Thursday, Emhoff said the Biden administration is “working with Congress” to support a $2.2 million grant for UNESCO’s international program on Holocaust and genocide education.

“UNESCO plays a vital role in ensuring that Holocaust education is taught and used to combat antisemitism all around the world,” he said. “And in the wake of the horrific Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack against Israel where hostages were taken, this work has never been more urgent.”

President Joe Biden and his wife to meet with campaign staffers in Delaware

President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, will meet with campaign staffers in Wilmington, Delaware on Thursday, using the time to thank them for their hard work over the past year and their continued work in support of Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee. That’s according to a person familiar with the president’s plans, who insisted on anonymity to discuss plans that are not yet public.

The event at a local venue in Wilmington will feature food and, naturally for Biden, ice cream.

The president exited the presidential race two weeks ago and wanted to say hello to the hundreds of staffers expected to attend.

Pelosi on Trump: ‘My goal in life was that man would never step in the White House again’

Nancy Pelosi’s influence can be seen all across the Democratic Party shakeup that in a few short, agonizing weeks has reengineered the 2024 presidential ticket and the race for the White House.

It was Pelosi who publicly encouraged President Joe Biden to make a decision about his reelection campaign when he had already insisted he had no plans to step aside. Once he exited and endorsed Kamala Harris atop the ticket, it was Pelosi who was a big fan of her future running mate, Tim Walz.

For the House speaker emerita, the upheaval is less about Biden, a friend of 40 years, and more about Republican Donald Trump, the former president she refers to as “Bozo,” “a snake-oil salesman,” “what’s his name” and the “Creature from the Black Lagoon.”

“How can I say this in the nicest possible way: My goal in life was that man would never step in the White House again,” Pelosi said, slapping the table with every word.

Pelosi spoke Wednesday with reporters and columnists about her new book, “The Art of Power, My Story as America’s First Woman Speaker of the House,” which calls for an end to political violence in the U.S.

Michigan county official endorses Harris, saying she ‘embodies the America we deserve’

Deputy Wayne County Executive Assad I. Turfe, the highest ranking Arab American official in Michigan’s largest county, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign for president shortly after she gave remarks just outside Detroit on Wednesday.

Turfe told The Associated Press he spoke with Harris backstage at the event prior to his endorsement.

“Kamala Harris embodies the America we deserve – an America that stands for strength, inclusivity and unwavering commitment to justice,” Turfe said in a statement. “I wholeheartedly endorse Kamala Harris, as she represents the true spirit of our nation and the values we hold dear.”

Metro Detroit, home to one of the largest Arab American populations in the United States, has become a focal point of tension and unrest due to the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict. Harris’ speech outside Detroit was interrupted for several minutes Wednesday by a small group of pro-Palestinian protesters yelling.

Turfe also pressed the need for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war, but said Harris “gives us the best chance of achieving peace in that region moving forward.”

Trump will hold a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida

The Thursday news conference would be his first public appearance since Vice President Kamala Harris became the Democratic presidential nominee and selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate.

The former president announced the 2 p.m. EDT news conference on his Truth Social network and then posted he was eager to debate Harris. He had teased an announcement on the presidential debate earlier this week after pulling down from the scheduled ABC News debate. Trump had said he would rather the debate be on Fox News, but on Wednesday was showing willingness to reconsider ABC News.

“I will expose Kamala during the Debate the same way I exposed Crooked Joe, Hillary, and everyone else during Debates,” he said on Truth Social. “Only I think Kamala will be easier.”

Trump’s running mate JD Vance has criticized Harris for not conducting news conference or sitting down for interviews since President Joe Biden stepped aside and she launched her presidential bid. Harris sometimes answers shouted questions while boarding or leaving her plane for campaign stops.

Secretaries of state urge Elon Musk to fix AI chatbot spreading election misinformation on X

Five secretaries of state are urging Elon Musk to fix an AI chatbot on the social media platform X, saying in a letter sent Monday that it has spread election misinformation.

The top election officials from Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Washington told Musk that X’s AI chatbot, Grok, produced false information about state ballot deadlines shortly after President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race.

While Grok is available only to subscribers to the premium versions of X, the misinformation was shared across multiple social media platforms and reached millions of people, according to the letter. The bogus ballot deadline information from the chatbot also referenced Alabama, Indiana, Ohio and Texas, although their secretaries of state did not sign the letter. Grok continued to repeat the false information for 10 days before it was corrected, the secretaries said.

The letter urged X to immediately fix the chatbot “to ensure voters have accurate information in this critical election year.” That would include directing Grok to send users to CanIVote.org, a voting information website run by the National Association of Secretaries of State, when asked about U.S. elections.

According to a BBC report, the ABC Network announced that both former President Trump and Harris have agreed to a debate on September 10.

In the press brief on Thursday, Trump said, “So we have those three dates and those networks, they're very anxiously awaiting that date and those dates. So we have Sept. 4, Sept. 10 and Sept. 25. We have spoken to the heads of the network, and it's all been confirmed, other than some fairly minor details.”

With both the candidates having announced their respective running mates, the campaigning for the US elections is now in full swing.

While Trump has chosen Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate, Kamala Harris declared Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her vice president pick.

Democrats have been in a tightrope walk situation until President Joe Biden remained the presumptive candidate and since the June 27 debate against Trump, the shadow voices for Biden to drop out of the race had become loud.

And eventually by mid July, Biden announced he wouldn’t be running for presidential poll. But endorsed Kamala Harris for the job. Harris was later on also endorsed by former President Barack Obama and other senior Democrats.

It is going to be one of the most crucial US elections in history, considering the current geopolitical situation of the world and global world order going haywire with multiple regional conflicts and tension raging between countries."

PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Donald Trump recommitted to debating Vice President Kamala Harris after recently backing out, holding a lengthy news conference Thursday in which he taunted his new rival, boasted of his crowd on Jan. 6, 2021, and lashed out at questions about the enthusiasm her campaign has been generating.

As the Republican presidential nominee addressed reporters at his Palm Beach, Florida, estate, ABC announced that Trump and Harris, the Democratic nominee, have agreed to a Sept. 10 debate, setting up a widely anticipated faceoff in an already unparalleled election. Trump said he had proposed three debates with three television networks in September.

Trump again insisted there had been a “peaceful transfer” of power in 2021 and renewed attacks on Republican rivals like Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, whom Trump has harshly criticized since Kemp refused to go along with his false theories of election fraud.

In taking questions from reporters for more than an hour, Trump tried to draw a contrast with Harris, who has not held a news conference since she became the likely Democratic nominee following President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the race.

Another key moment in the election is set

Trump’s decision to go on ABC, days after posting on his social media account that he would not appear on the network, sets up a highly anticipated moment in an election where Biden’s catastrophic performance in the last debate set in motion his withdrawal.

“I think it’s very important to have debates,” Trump said Thursday. “I look forward to the debates because I think we have to set the record straight.”

The Harris campaign had no immediate comment.

Thursday’s event was Trump’s first public appearance since Harris selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate. Trump called Walz a “radical left man.”

“Between her and him, there’s never been anything like this,” Trump said. “There’s certainly never been anybody so liberal like these two.”

He repeatedly suggested Harris was not intelligent enough to debate him. Harris, for her part, has tried to goad Trump into debating and told an audience in Atlanta recently that if he had anything to say about her, he should ” say it to my face.”

Trump grew visibly perturbed when pressed on Harris’ crowds and newfound Democratic enthusiasm, dismissing a question about his lighter campaign schedule as stupid.

Trump says he has not “recalibrated” his campaign despite facing a new opponent, a dynamic some Republican strategists have quietly complained about.

When asked what assets Harris possessed, Trump said: “She’s a woman. She represents certain groups of people.”

Trump has repeatedly — and falsely — accused Harris, the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, of previously downplaying that she is Black.

Trump takes questions about abortion

Trump suggested abortion will not be a major issue in the campaign and the outcome in November.

He insisted that the matter “has become much less of an issue” since the Supreme Court ended the federal constitutional right to abortion services and returned control of the matter to state governments. But the issue is widely seen as a general election liability, and Trump named states such as Ohio and Kansas that have since voted to protect abortion rights.

Trump also said he expected Florida “will go in a little more liberal way than people thought” when it votes to repeal an abortion ban later this year, but he did not respond to questions asking how he would vote.

Trump argued that Democrats, Republicans and “everybody” are pleased with the results of the 2022 ruling that overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.

Trump’s actions within the GOP, however, suggest he knows that Democrats already have capitalized on Republican opposition to abortion rights and could do so again this fall. Trump single-handedly ensured that the Republican Party platform adopted at the 2024 convention in Milwaukee does not call for a national ban on abortion, and he has said repeatedly that hardliners in the party could cost the GOP in November.

The court’s decision, issued months ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, is widely cited as a reason that Democrats fared much better than expected in House and Senate contests. And Democrats have hammered Trump in paid advertisements blaming him and the justices he appointed for ending Roe.

Trump again makes false claims on Jan. 6

Donald Trump falsely claimed during the press conference that “nobody was killed on Jan. 6,” the date in 2021 when pro-Trump rioters breached the U.S. Capitol amid Congress’ effort to certify Biden’s 2020 election victory after Trump refused to concede.

Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran from San Diego was shot and killed by a police officer as she climbed through a broken part of a Capitol door during the violent riot that breached the building.

To be sure, Trump has often cited Babbitt’s death while lamenting the treatment of those who first attended a rally outside the White House that day, then marched to the Capitol, many of whom fought with police and entered the the building.

“I think those people were treated very badly. When you compare it to other things that took place in this country where a lot of people were killed,” Trump said Thursday, adding “nobody was killed on Jan. 6.”

He also falsely claimed more people attended his speech at a “Stop the Steal” rally before the riot than the famous March on Washington in 1963, the iconic event at which Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his “I Have a Dream” speech.

Trump was asked about Biden’s comments in a CBS interview that he was “not confident” there would be a peaceful transfer of power if Trump were to lose.

“He should have brought this up at the debate if he had a problem. Of course there’ll be a peaceful transfer, and there was last time.”

While Biden was inaugurated on schedule, Washington was on lockdown that day, with the streets patrolled by military personnel and domestic police two weeks after Trump’s supporters had attacked the Capitol.

Trump acknowledges weakness with Black women

Trump recognized some changing patterns with his new opponent, acknowledging he may not be as popular with Black women, one of Democrats’ key voting blocs. He expressed a lot of confidence in his support from Black men. “It could be I’ll be affected somewhat with Black females but we’re really doing well,” he said. “And I think ultimately they’ll like me better because I’m going to give them security, safety and jobs. I’m going to give them a good economy.”

Trump campaign officials told reporters ahead of the news conference they believe Harris is currently enjoying a honeymoon period they likened to an “out-of-body experience.”

They argued the fundamentals of the race have not changed and the mood of the country remains sour, with Americans frustrated by the state of the economy, the administration and the country’s directions.

They argued that while Harris has energized the Democratic base — which Biden had not done — she will not be able to win over Republicans or convert independents or the persuadable voters they are focused on targeting.

Trump’s campaign plans to spend the next three months hammering Harris as “failed, weak and dangerously liberal,” blaming her for every one of the the Biden administration’s unpopular policies and mocking her mannerisms and speaking style.

During the impromptu presser, the former president announced that he had agreed to three debates with three news networks: Fox News on Sept. 4, NBC on Sept. 10, and ABC on Sept. 25.

“We have spoken to the heads of the network and it’s all been confirmed, other than some fairly minor details,” Trump claimed. “The other side has to agree to the terms. They may or may not agree. I don’t know if they will agree.”

ABC quickly clarified that both campaigns had agreed to participate in a debate on Sept. 10 — not Sept. 25 — which had been scheduled before Biden dropped out of the race.

Trump had attempted to back out of the encounter last month as Democrats debated who would replace Biden at the top of the presidential ticket. Instead, the former president requested a debate with his preferred propaganda machine, Fox News.

“He needs to stop playing games and show up to the debate he already committed to on Sept. 10,” the Harris campaign said earlier this month, adding that even if Trump skips out the vice president would still “take the opportunity to speak to a prime time national audience.”

The meteoric enthusiasm surrounding Harris has clearly rattled the Trump campaign. As previously reported by Rolling Stone, one Republican close to the former president has expressed that Trump is “unhappy with the narrative” surrounding Harris, particularly about her crowd sizes.

When asked at Mar-a-Lago about Harris’ blockbuster crowds, Trump ranted that “nobody has spoken to crowds bigger than me,” and claimed that his crowd of supporters on Jan. 6 may have been larger than the crowd who gathered to listen to Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have A Dream” speech.

“When [Harris] gets 1,000 people and everyone starts jumping, you know if I had 1,000 people, people would say that’s the end of his campaign,” Trump said. “The enthusiasm is with me in the Republican Party.” Editor’s picks

In one tense exchange, Trump lashed out at a reporter who asked him about his absence from the campaign trail in the last week, and concerns he wasn’t taking the race seriously. “What a stupid question. Because I’m leading by a lot,” Trump retorted. The former president’s lead on Harris is slim, if it exists at all, and seems to be shrinking as the vice president gains momentum.

Trump cited the amount of interviews, taped statements, and televised appearances he makes from Mar-a-Lago as part of his campaign. He also leveled several attacks against Harris, particularly against her intelligence. “[Harris is] not doing a news conference,” he added. “You know why she’s not doing it? Because she can’t do a news conference. She doesn’t know how to do a news conference. She’s not smart enough to do a news conference and I’m sorry, we need smart people to lead this country.”

Trump also spoke at length about how the Democratic Party stole the nomination from Biden, falsely claiming it was “unconstitutional.” Despite fantasizing about Biden getting back in the race, he claimed on Thursday that he’s glad to be running against Harris. “I’m not a big fan of his brain,” Trump said of the current president before noting that he’s still smarter than Harris.

Regardless of whether Harris is currently holding press conferences, she seems to be doing quite well, and the former president clearly can’t stand it."

'We have those three dates and those networks. They're very anxiously awaiting that date and those dates,' Trump said at a press conference at Mar-a-Lago.

The ABC debate was already on the calendar - originally meant to be between Trump and President Joe Biden.

Harris agreed to that debate but did not mention other two.

'I hear that Donald Trump has finally committed to debating me on September 10. I look forward to it,' she wrote on X.

Meanwhile, Trump was visibly angry at points in his press conference. He slammed his Democratic rival repeatedly, calling her the 'politically correct' choice for a nominee, questioning her intellect and questioning if she should be on the ticket.

He also was asked about a previous comment where he claimed Harris just became black but he side stepped in his response.

'You have to ask her because she said it. I didn't say it,' he said. 'I think it's very disrespectful to both whether it's Indian or black. To me it doesn't matter.'

The former president held a rambling back-and-forth with reporters at his Palm Beach home as his aides pushed reminders Harris hasn't set down with journalists since she became the nominee.

During the press conference, which lasted slightly more than an hour, Trump veered back-and-forth between topics at a breakneck pace.

He defended Biden and then insulted him. He dispensed his opinion on a variety of subjects from abortion rights, to the legalization of marijuana, to the state of the economy. He repeated old arguments such as his false claim he had a bigger crowd than Barack Obama at his inauguration. And he came up with new nicknames, such as calling Harris 'first loser.' He blasted journalists for 'stupid questions' and then promised 'you'll get more than you want' on press briefings.

Donald Trump proposed three debates with Kamala Harris

Trump did not say if his team had reached out to Harris' team with their debate proposal. The former president did concede she still has to agree to them.

'I don't know if they're gonna agree,' he said. 'She hasn't done an interview.'

Trump and his team have been slamming Harris for not doing a media interview since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and she became the Democratic nominee.

Her last formal television sit-down interview was on June 24, when she joined MSNBC's Morning Joe to talk about abortion rights.

Trump alleged that Harris is 'not smart enough to do a news conference.'

'And I'm sorry, we need smart people to lead this country.'

Trump had cancelled the Sept. 10 with ABC News because he had originally been set to do with Biden. Harris had agreed to that debate once she replaced Biden.

Trump is also suing ABC and anchor George Stephanopoulos for defamation and called the active litigation a 'conflict of interest.'

But now the former president is now agreeing to meet on the debate stage.

His news conference, and his debate offer, comes as Harris has made up significant ground in the polls. She led Trump in a new national poll out on Thursday and runs neck-and-neck with him in several battleground states.

Trump expressed his frustration with the attention his rival is getting.

'Oh give me a break,' he snapped when he was asked about the massive crowd at Harris' rallies. Her biggest rally - held in Detroit on Wednesday night - had 15,000 people.

He then exaggerated the size of his rallies and misrepresented the size of Harris' crowds.

'Listen, I had 107,000 people in New Jersey. You didn't report it. I'm so glad you asked. What did she have yesterday? 2000 people. If I ever had 2000 people you'd say my campaign is finished. It's so dishonest the press,' he said.

'So based on crowd size, in history, for any country, nobody's had crowds like I have and you know that.'

He claimed he's even had bigger crowds than those who attended Martin Luther King's famous 'I Have A Dream' speech in 1963.

As Trump spoke, ABC News confirmed that the September 10th debate with Harris and the former president is on with both contenders vowing to be there.

A well-placed source familiar with the negotiations say the ABC debate is expected to take place in Philadelphia.

The negotiations were led by Washington bureau chief Rick Klein and the network's top producer John Santucci. The debate will be hosted by David Muir and Linsey Davis.

Trump, meanwhile, kept railing against Harris.

He dubbed her the 'first loser' and said repeatedly she had gotten 'no votes.'

He appears to be referring to the 2020 Democratic primary contest. Harris, who was running for president at the time, dropped out of the race before the first nominating contest, which was Iowa's caucuses. Her campaign had been plagued by infighting and bad management.

She eventually became Biden's running mate.

'She was the first loser,' Trump said. 'She was the first one to quit, and she quit. She had no votes, no support, and she was a bad debater, by the way, very bad debater.'

Donald Trump gave Kamala Harris a new nickname: 'first loser'

Donald Trump speaking to reporters at Mar-a-Lago

He also called her the 'the worst vice president in the history of our country - the most unpopular vice president' and indicated she was picked as the party nominee for 'being politically correct.'

In an interview with black journalists last week, Trump questioned whether Harris - who has a black father and South Asian mother - was black.

'She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black. So I don't know, is she Indian or is she Black?' he said at the event.

Trump had been making gains with black voters when Biden was on the ticket. Harris is taking the votes back and the former president tried to shrug that off.

'I seem to be doing very well with Black males. This is according to polls, as you know. It's possible that I won't do as well with Black women, but I do seem to doing very well with other segments - extremely well with Hispanics,' he said.

He also bragged about his supporters.

'I do seem to do very well with other segments, extremely well with Hispanic, Jewish voters, way up. White males, way up. White males have gone through the roof. White males, way up. I don't know,' he said.

Trump defended Joe Biden in his press conference - above the two men at their debate

He also defended Biden, his former rival, saying he was sure the president wasn't happy about his decision to exit the race.

'I don't know if he's happy about that decision,' he said. 'The presidency was taken away from Joe Biden. And I'm no Biden fan. But I'll tell you what, from a constitutional standpoint, from any standpoint, you're looking at they took the presidency away.'

'He's a very angry man right now. I can tell you that.'

But he also got in some insults.

'I'm not a big fan of his brain,' Trump said of Biden. 'But I think actually she's not as smart as he is.'"
Trump says he has agreed to offer ABC News to debate Harris.,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/abc-says-trump-and-harris-have-agreed-to-participate-in-a-presidential-debate-on-september-10/article68503233.ece,"ABC says both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris have agreed to a September 10 presidential debate, setting up a face-off between the Republican and Democratic nominees.

The announcement on Thursday (August 8, 2024) came shortly after Trump told a news conference that he had proposed three presidential debates with three television networks, saying he agreed on certain dates in September.

Trump is rejoining the ABC debate days after posting on his social media network that he would not appear on the network, citing a lawsuit he has filed. His decision sets up a highly anticipated moment in an election where the first debate led to a massive change in the race — with Democratic President Joe Biden ending his reelection bid and endorsing Harris.

“I think it's very important to have debates,” Trump said Thursday. “I look forward to the debates because I think we have to set the record straight.”

The Harris campaign had no immediate comment.

Trump had teased an announcement about the presidential debate earlier this week after pulling out of an ABC News debate scheduled for September 10 after President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign. Trump had said he would prefer that Fox News sponsor the debate, but on Wednesday was showing willingness to reconsider ABC.

Trump also echoed criticism from his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, that Harris has not held a news conference or sat down for interviews since Mr. Biden's withdrawal last month and she entered the race.

Ms. Harris has a travelling press pool with her on Air Force Two for all trips. Trump does not have a set travelling press pool that regularly accompanies him on his plane when he goes out to campaign.

Mr. Vance has journalists flying with him, and he campaigned this week in states where Ms. Harris and Mr. Walz had their own events scheduled. That included on Wednesday, when Mr. Vance's plane and Air Force Two ended up on the same tarmac in Wisconsin. Mr. Vance started walking toward the Democrats' plane but did not reach it before a motorcade carrying Ms. Harris, Mr. Walz and the travelling press pulled away."

Donald Trump announced on Thursday morning that he would hold an afternoon press conference at Mar-a-Lago. His reasons for doing so were unclear, but many assumed it was partly an effort to highlight Kamala Harris’s lack of media interviews since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, and partly a desperate attempt to regain America’s attention.

Afterward, it still wasn’t entirely clear what Trump was doing, aside from delighting Democrats. He did make some news, proposing three debates with Harris (ABC News said both candidates have agreed to a September 10 debate, but the other two debates have yet to be confirmed). But the rest of the hour-long press conference was the usual stream-of-consciousness mix of factually dubious laments and attacks on his political foes. Trump repeatedly mispronounced Harris’s first name, questioned her intelligence, and claimed that he drew a bigger crowd for his January 6, 2021 “Stop the Steal” rally than Martin Luther King Jr. did for his “I Have a Dream” speech. Below is our reverse chronological account of what happened, as it happened.

Trump says he has agreed to offer ABC News to debate Harris.,https://www.aol.com/abc-says-trump-harris-agreed-194045486.html,"ABC announced Thursday that Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have both agreed to a presidential debate to be held Sept. 10 on the network.

The announcement came shortly after Trump proposed three presidential debates with Harris. Speaking during a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump said he has agreed to participate in debates next month on ABC, NBC, and Fox News, but speculated as to whether Harris would accept the terms to all three.

""The other side has to agree to the terms,"" Trump said. ""They may or may not agree. I don't know if they're going to agree.""

RELATED STORY | Candidates hit the road: Tracking Harris and Trump's travel and money

Initially, President Biden and former President Trump agreed to a Sept. 10 debate to be hosted by ABC News. But once President Biden left the race and Vice President Harris became the face of the Democratic ticket, Trump's firm commitment became more uncertain.

However, at least for now, it appears Trump is rejoining the ABC debate after previously saying he would not appear on the network, citing a pending lawsuit.

""I hear that Donald Trump has finally committed to debating me on September 10,"" Harris said in a statement after the announcement. ""I look forward to it.""

The new agreement sets up what is sure to be a highly anticipated meeting between Trump and Harris, who have both accused the other in recent weeks of dodging the debate stage.

This also comes after Trump vice presidential nominee JD Vance said earlier this week that he will debate Harris' running mate Tim Walz, but not until he is ""officially the nominee"" — speculating that the top of the Democratic ticket could still be changed.

""Would it shock me if the Democrats pulled another switcheroo? No, it wouldn't,"" Vance said. ""So look, we're going to wait until they actually nominate Kamala Harris and Tim Walz before we do any debates.""

This year's fall presidential debate calendar is more uncertain than previous years because the nonpartisan presidential debate commission is no longer organizing and hosting, following opposition from the campaigns. Instead, individual television networks are pitching debates directly to the campaigns.

Presidential debates, of course, aren't required.

After John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon debated in 1960, it was 16 years before another presidential debate occurred."
Trump says he has agreed to offer ABC News to debate Harris.,https://newrepublic.com/post/184702/donald-trump-media-attention-kamala-harris-debate,"Only on Wednesday, the Trump campaign was dodging questions about how the former president and convicted felon ducked out of the previously scheduled debate. This followed a litany of excuses Trump has made since Harris entered the race. He claimed that he couldn’t go on ABC because of ongoing litigation against the network and that he didn’t need to debate because he was already leading in the polls (he wasn’t). His team said that he couldn’t debate someone who wasn’t officially the Democratic nominee and didn’t have former President Barack Obama’s endorsement. Hours later, Obama endorsed Harris.

The real reason Trump has been hesitant to debate Harris is probably because he’s worried. Trump reportedly thinks it’s unfair that he has to run against Harris, complaining to confidants about the media coverage Harris is getting and about being overtaken in polls. He and his running mate, J.D. Vance, have been struggling to come up with any effective attacks against Harris and Tim Walz, trying out accusations of antisemitism and attacks on Walz’s military record that so far haven’t picked up any traction.

But in a debate, Trump will have the opportunity to come up with new soundbites and insults, albeit against an opponent sharper than Biden, and he probably wants to do it on a bigger stage than Fox News, even though they would give him a home-field advantage. As Trump would say, the ratings will probably be sky-high."

“I hear that Donald Trump has finally committed to debating me on September 10,” the Vice President wrote on social media platform X. “I look forward to it.”

Trump’s confirmation of the debate on ABC came after a string of flip-flops on whether he would face his new Democratic opponent for the White House.

The Republican spent approximately an hour answering questions and delivering an unhinged mix of his stump speech, punctuated with attacks on his Democratic opponent (and past ones), and revisiting his favorite grievance — the reporting of crowd sizes.

Amid all of that, he said he has agreed to three presidential debates— on Fox News on September 4, ABC News on September 10, and NBC News on September 25. The Harris campaign has only agreed to the ABC News showdown and refused the Fox date.

Trump also claimed that he was ahead in the polls, whereas in reality, the numbers mostly favor the Democrats. The latest polling from Marquette University shows Harris leading by between four and eight percentage points.

Attacking his Democratic opponents he refers to Kamala Harris as the border czar and Tim Walz as being “heavy into the transgender world”.

He then launched into a version of his usual stump speech.

‘It’s unfair’: Trump is freaking out about Kamala Harris’s surging poll numbers

18:40 , Oliver O'Connell

A week after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, the Atlantic published a headline claiming that “Trump is Planning for a Landslide Win.”

Now, a little over a month and one presidential candidate swap later, the 2024 presidential election’s likely results appear a little less obvious.

With the defiant photo of a post-assassination attempt Trump pumping his fist in the rear-view, the former president has become increasingly frustrated by the surging poll numbers enjoyed by his presumed opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, according to five people close to the situation who spoke to The Washington Post.

Graig Graziosi has the story that has led us to this afternoon’s press conference.

Biden ‘not confident’ in peaceful transfer of power if Trump loses 2024 election

Joe Biden says he is “not confident at all” that there will be a peaceful transfer of power if Donald Trump loses the 2024 presidential election.

The president said that Trump needed to be taken seriously over his March comments that there would be a “bloodbath” for the US car industry and country should he be defeated in November.

The White House claimed at the time that the former president was inciting violence, which he rejected.

Trumpworld dusts off ‘swift boat’ attack on Walz leading to Democrat pushback

17:50 , Oliver O'Connell

Two decades after false allegations of stolen valor against his opponent helped George W Bush win a second term in the White House, Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign isn’t letting the same thing happen to her or her running-mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.

The Harris campaign is defending Walz, an Army veteran who spent nearly a quarter-century in the Minnesota National Guard, from Republicans who are claiming he deserted to avoid deployment to Iraq and falsely accusing him of claiming to be a combat veteran.

Andrew Feinberg takes a look at what each side is saying.

Trump claims not to know people behind Project 2025 plan but took private flight with its leader

Despite claiming to know “nothing” of Project 2025, or the people behind it, former president Donald Trump has long-held connections to authors of the conservative presidential transition plan and at one point reportedly took a private flight with its leader.

In April of 2022, Trump took a 45-minute private flight with Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation – a right-wing think tank group responsible for Project 2025 – to attend a conference in Florida for the group,The Washington Post reported.

What sets apart the dueling Rust Belt running mates?

17:20 , John Bowden

Democrats and Republicans are set for a battle over the industrial midwest and the Rust Belt this year — and their vice presidential picks show it.

Kamala Harris’s selection of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz on Tuesday was a sign that her campaign has no plans to cede any ground in Wisconsin, Michigan or Pennsylvania — three states that have been critical in the past three election cycles. The selection of Walz, an affable football coach, former Army National Guardsman, and high school teacher, was a starting gun in the battle for the white working class that backed Trump in 2016.

JD Vance, meanwhile, has built a national brand around being a son of Appalachia whose background inspired both a strong social conservatism as well as a populist economic bent that mirrors Trump’s own. Vance, like his running mate, rails against multinational trade deals he blames for sending manufacturing centers overseas and was the lone Republican member of Congress to show up on a picket line in 2023.

So what similarities can be drawn between the two midwestern politicians’ platforms, and where does the divide fall?

Tim Walz and JD Vance were both picked to win the Rust Belt. What sets them apart?

Trump’s speaking style shows ‘potential indications of cognitive decline’, experts say

Former President Donald Trump’s speaking style may reveal signs of cognitive decline, according to psychological experts.

An analysis by STAT - a media organization focusing on health - found that Trump’s common pattern of speech called tangentiality – jumping from topic to topic with few if any connections in between – is just one of a number of incoherent speaking habits that appears to have worsened in the last few years.

Awkward moment JD Vance attempts to confront Kamala on tarmac

16:50 , Oliver O'Connell

It was one of the weirder moments of yesterday on the campaign trail...

After his plane landed at Chippewa Valley Regional Airport in Wisconsin, Donald Trump’s running mate JD Vance walked across the tarmac to get a closer look at Kamala Harris’s Air Force Two.

But she wasn’t there. After her plane landed on Wednesday afternoon, Harris met a group of Girl Scouts before she joined her motorcade to drive to a packed rally with her running mate Tim Walz in Eau Claire, where Bon Iver was performing for thousands of supporters.

Vance, after getting close to Air Force Two, turned around and walked over to a group of reporters instead.

Trump called a press conference for this afternoon — what’s that about?

16:29 , Oliver O'Connell

Former president and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump (AP)

Close followers of this blog — or anyone who has seen the news over the past two weeks — may have noticed that Kamala Harris is dominating the news cycle with the spectacularly fast rollout of her campaign for the presidency.

The vice president managed to flip, rebrand, reinvigorate, and refocus the entire Democratic Party effort to retain the White House in November’s election. Excited crowds have flocked to events in key battleground states at rallies in Atlanta, Eau Claire, and Detroit.

As poll numbers have quickly begun turning in Harris’s favor, Donald Trump is believed to be seething. The Washington Post reports that he has “grown increasingly upset” at the media coverage of the vice president.

Counterprogramming by his running mate JD Vance has proved to be very much a sideshow and led to mockery over awkward moments and stilted answers to questions from the press. Trump himself had no scheduled events this week other than a rally tomorrow in deep-red Montana.

So, what to do?

A hastily scheduled “general news conference” at Mar-a-Lago, where the former president has been holed up for much of the past two weeks, has been set for 2pm today.

Whether this will actually take the form of a press conference, or whether it will be a freewheeling stream of consciousness interspersed with parts of his stump speech is anyone’s guess, but what is likely happening is that Trump believes that when things aren’t going his way he is the only one who can step in and change the narrative.

His former White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham was quick to note this on X this morning.

She wrote: “Re: Trump’s self-announced press conference today at 2 pm: He’s panicking. I’ve seen this play many times. He thinks his team is failing him & no one can speak better/‘save’ his campaign/defend him but him. He hates the coverage Harris is getting & thinks only he can fix it.”

He hates the coverage Harris is getting & thinks only he can fix it. — Stephanie Grisham (@OMGrisham) August 8, 2024

What he might talk about is unclear given that his Truth Social posts this morning have largely been an array of campaign talking points mashed together in an angry rant.

One thing that did stand out was that he mentioned presidential debates, the subject of a spat between him and Harris after the former president backed off doing the previously agreed debate on ABC next month and tried to move the showdown over to Fox News, which Harris refused.

He wrote: “I will expose Kamala during the Debate the same way I exposed Crooked Joe, Hillary, and everyone else during Debates - Only I think Kamala will be easier! DJT.”

As in our earlier blog post, the Post has since reported that Trump may propose another debate this afternoon. Citing people close to the former president who spoke on condition of anonymity, the paper reports that Trump is likely to return to the proposed ABC News debate or propose a new debate on NBC News with Univision.

Watch this space.

Is Trump about to back down on backing out of ABC News debate?

16:23 , Oliver O'Connell

After backing away from an agreed debate on ABC News and proposing a new debate on Fox News that Kamala Harris declined, is Donald Trump about to back down and return to the scheduled ABC News debate or propose something new?

Per The Washington Post:

Now, Trump is likely to return to ABC News or propose a debate on NBC News with Univision, according to people close to him who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private deliberations.

These people expect his proposal in the coming days and potentially as early as Thursday afternoon.

Both networks are interested in the debate, along with others, the people familiar with the matter said. Trump has discussed both networks with advisers, they said.

Post-Trump assassination attempt, snipers watch over Harris-Walz outdoor rally

Secret Service snipers were positioned outside a rally for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in Wisconsin, the first major outdoor presidential campaign event since a gunman opened fire on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania last month.

Secret Service agents were positioned outside the Harris-Walz rally in Eau Claire on Wednesday, where the vice president and her running mate, other Democratic officials and musician Bon Iver appeared before 12,000 people at an outdoor event space.

Last week, acting Secret Service director Ronald Rowe said that both the Republican and Democratic candidates will have similar “counter sniper coverage moving forward.”

Buttigieg wrote on X: “Tim Walz served honorably and well.”

He continued: “Again, this is strategic: team Trump needs us tied up in debates over pre-retirement conditional rank promotions because they are desperate NOT to discuss their (unpopular) policies, like tax cuts for the rich and banning access to abortion.”

Donald Trump’s federal election interference case is slowly coming back to life.

The case is now back in the hands of District Judge Tanya Chutkan, after it was frozen for months while the former president was fighting for “immunity” up to the Supreme Court.

The four criminal cases against the former president — spanning 88 charges in four jurisdictions — have been hung up in months of appeals and delays, creating a Russian nesting doll of courtroom battles, with court dates and side hearings on evidence, gag orders and defense arguments all designed to slow down the likelihood of another conviction before Election Day.

Daily Show host mocks Republicans over ‘Tampon Tim’ nickname for Walz

The Daily Show host Michael Kosta has mocked Republicans over their new nickname for Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz after they started calling him “Tampon Tim.”

Last year, Minnesota Governor Walz signed a bill into law mandating that free sanitary products must be available to all menstruating students in restrooms used by students in grades 4 to 12 across Minnesota schools.

Coming into effect on January 1, the bill ensures that young girls, non-binary and trans students all have access to the simple but essential products.

Harris leading Trump by largest margin to date in new national poll

15:19 , Oliver O'Connell

Kamala Harris is leading Donald Trump by the widest margin to date in the latest national poll by Marquette Law School.

In a head-to-head match-up, the vice president is the choice for president of 52% of registered voters, and former president Trump is the choice of 48% — not the first survey showing Harris with a four per cent lead.

However, among likely voters, that margin grows further, with Harris receiving 53% and Trump 47%. These results include voters who initially did not choose Harris or Trump but who were then asked whom they would vote for if they had to choose.

When the ballot question was expanded to include independent candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr, Libertarian Party candidate Chase Oliver, Green Party candidate Jill Stein, and independent candidate Cornel West, Harris still led Trump by six per cent — 47: 41% among registered voters.

Kennedy is supported by 9%, Oliver receives 1%, Stein is the choice of 2%, and West wins 1%, among these voters.

When the same question is put to likely voters, Harris gets her biggest lead so far — 8% — with support from 50% of those asked, compared to 42% for Trump. For the other candidates, the breakdown is Kennedy 6%, Oliver 1%, Stein 1%, and West 0%.

Of note is that the poll was conducted before Harris selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate.

The survey was conducted from July 24 to August 1 and 879 registered voters were interviewed nationwide. The margin of error of +/-4.1 percentage points. For likely voters, the sample size is 683 with a margin of error of +/-4.7 percentage points.

Heritage Foundation president delays release of Project 2025 book

Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation, has delayed the release of his new book until after November’s election, following backlash against the conservative think-tank’s Project 2025 initiative.

Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance has written the foreword to Roberts’s book Dawn’s Early Light.

“There’s a time for writing, reading, and book tours – and a time to put down the books and go fight like hell to take back our country,” the author told RealClearPolitics.

“That’s why I’ve chosen to move my book’s publication and promotion to after the election.”

This morning on Truth Social...

14:30 , Oliver O'Connell

With reports that Donald Trump has grown increasingly upset about Kamala Harris’s surging poll numbers and media coverage since replacing Joe Biden on the ticket, the former president is trying to take matters into his own hands, lashing out on Truth Social and scheduling an impromptu “General News Conference” this after at 2pm.

It has been noted that while Harris’s confirmation as the Democratic Party’s nominee and selection of Tim Walz as a running mate has dominated the news cycle, Trump has been hidden away at Mar-a-Lago, sending his own running mate JD Vance out to stalk the vice president and give press conferences.

As crowds of up to 15,000 have gathered to see Harris in the first two weeks of her campaign, Trump has just one event planned in Boseman, Montana, tomorrow.

Here’s what he’s had to say on his social media platform this morning.

First up, a general scattershot diatribe:

Kamala refuses to do interviews because her team realizes she is unable to answer questions, much like Biden was not able to answer questions, but for different reasons. He is just plain “shot,” and she is just plain “Incompetent.” Her policies of Open Borders, No Fracking or Drilling for Oil in any Way, Shape or Form, Transgender “anything,” Anti Israel but gross incompetence toward getting anything done for the Palestinians, No Clue on Inflation, or the Economy, Unlimited Money to fight Foreign Wars, and so much more, are CATASTROPHIC. If she is Elected, our County, and indeed the World, will suffer a 1929 Style Great Depression. It will be the Worst in history and AMERICA WILL BE DESTROYED!

Then the announcement of his news conference:

I will be doing a General News Conference at 2:00 P.M. at Mar-a-Lago, Palm Beach. Thank you!

Apparently we will be getting a debate — though unclear whether he means ABC or Fox...

I will expose Kamala during the Debate the same way I exposed Crooked Joe, Hillary, and everyone else during Debates - Only I think Kamala will be easier! DJT

Then this?

We are living in a Pro Criminal Atmosphere. It will end on November 5th.

Here he tries to hone his campaign message:

This Election is about the ECONOMY, INFLATION, OPEN BORDERS (ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION), RESPECT FOR OUR NATION, PREVENTING WORLD WAR lll AND A 1929 STYLE DEPRESSION!

Then classic Trump, moaning about crowd size:

If Kamala has 1,000 people at a Rally, the Press goes “crazy,” and talks about how “big” it was - And she pays for her “Crowd.” When I have a Rally, and 100,000 people show up, the Fake News doesn’t talk about it, THEY REFUSE TO MENTION CROWD SIZE. The Fake News is the Enemy of the People!

Stay tuned for more...

We’ll be carrying the “general news conference” live at 2pm ET.

Kamala Harris and the looming war that could define her presidency

As Kamala Harris sat alongside Joe Biden in the Situation Room on Monday evening, she may have felt some trepidation. The president and vice president were about to be briefed — for hours — on the threat of regional war between Israel and Iran. Harris was now advising as vice president on a war she may soon have to take on as president.

Israel’s assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyehin in July, at a crucial moment in a months-long White House effort to reach a ceasefire deal, has brought the Middle East to the brink of war. It has also, importantly, brought US-Israel relations to breaking point.

Eric Garcia writes:

It looked like progressives got what they wanted on Tuesday when Vice President Kamala Harris selected Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota to be her running mate. In the past, Walz has called humanitarian conditions in Gaza amid Israel’s war with Hamas “intolerable”. That endeared him to some younger Democrats even if Walz, like many other Democrats and Harris herself, remains firmly supportive of Israel.

But only a few hours later, progressives got a punch in the gut when Representative Cori Bush, a member of the Squad, lost her primary in Missouri’s 1st district to Wesley Bell. This comes just months after progressives faced a bruising loss when Representative Jamaal Bowman of New York lost his primary, which left the Squad and its allies demoralized.

Democrats and Republicans are set for a battle over the industrial midwest and the Rust Belt this year — and their vice presidential picks show it.

Kamala Harris’s selection of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz on Tuesday was a sign that her campaign has no plans to cede any ground in Wisconsin, Michigan or Pennsylvania — three states that have been critical in the past three election cycles. The selection of Walz, an affable football coach, former Army National Guardsman, and high school teacher, was a starting gun in the battle for the white working class that backed Trump in 2016.

“I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,” Martin told the Los Angeles Times. “I said, ‘Lorne, I’m not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.’ I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.”

Tim Walz is clearly thrilled about the idea of debating JD Vance, a fellow veteran and Midwesterner.

Here’s the deal: we’re asking for a fair shot. We're asking for health care and child care. We're asking for an education. We're asking for safety in our streets.

RFK admits to a freezer full of roadkill

The RFK campaign keeps getting stranger.

Days after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. admitted to taking a bear carcass from the side of the road and placing it in Central Park as a prank a decade ago, he said that has been picking up roadkill his “whole life” and once had a “freezer full of it” at home.

The comment came as the independent presidential candidate was leaving an upstate New York courtroom Wednesday where he had testified in a lawsuit seeking to exclude him from the state’s ballot in November.

Biden is worried Trump won’t concede

02:35 , Josh Marcus

Joe Biden says he is “not confident at all” that there will be a peaceful transfer of power if Donald Trump loses the 2024 presidential election.

The president said that Trump needed to be taken seriously over his March comments that there would be a “bloodbath” for the US car industry and country should he be defeated in November.

The White House claimed at the time that the former president was inciting violence, which he rejected.

Biden made the comments to CBS News during his first sit-down interview since officially halting his reelection campaign and handing over the reins of the Democratic party to Kamala Harris.

What the polls tell us about the 2024 race

02:00 , Josh Marcus

Kamala Harris appears to be pulling ahead of Donald Trump in presidential election polling for the first time, with the Democrat taking a three-point lead over the Republican former president in a new survey.

A poll for NPR, PBS and Marist published on Wednesday places the Vice President on 51 per cent of the vote overall, compared to Trump’s 48 per cent, and comes after her choice of Minnesota governor Tim Walz as her running mate was met with an overwhelmingly positive response.

Harris also leads Trump on abortion by a huge 15 per cent margin, although the latter has a six-point advantage over the former when it comes to illegal immigration, suggesting MAGA attacks on the Democrat’s past role as a “border czar” within the Biden administration are hurting her on that issue.

Tim Walz is opening up about why he’s so committed to fighting for access to reproductive care like IVF, which could be under threat from a future Trump administration.

His own daughter, Hope, arrived via the procedure.

“This is very personal for my family,” Walz said, describing the “agony” of waiting for years for a successful round of treatment.

“The agony of that I can feel to this day.”

‘Joy,’ ‘Happy Warriors,’ and ‘Minding Your Own Damn Business’: Harris-Walz campaign leans into Midwest vibes

Thursday 8 August 2024 00:53 , Josh Marcus

The Harris-Walz campaign is starting to hit on some central themes, and joy is one of them.

“Those other guys.. tried to steal the joy from this country,” Tim Walz said today from the podium in Detroit.

The campaign has also sought to instill a bit of Midwestern, small-town flair to things, mixing positive messaging and touting the importance “minding your own damn business” on issues ranging from women’s health to access to books.

“It’s amazing what minding your own damn business does to make things work better,” Walz told the crowd.

Earlier in the event, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer called the crowd a group of “happy warriors” for Harris-Walz.

The atmosphere has been upbeat so far in Detroit, but today’s rally has been stopped numerous times as multiple speakers including Tim Walz and Mitchigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer called for medics to attend to members of the crowd.

By our count, at least five people have gone down.

It wasn’t immediately clear what the rallygoers were experiencing, but, given the packed rally in an airport hangar, with temperatures at nearly 80 degrees with over 50 percent humidity, it’s more than likely the heat.

Onstage, Walz thanked the crowd for looking after those in distress.

“Thank you for caring for your neighbors,” he said.

In response to comments from Vance criticizing those without biological children, Whitmer praised Harris for living a “normal life” and being a stepmother in a “beautiful” family.

“She lived a normal life,” Whitmer said. “She was raised by a single mom who had a full-time job.”

“She is a proud stepmom with a beautiful blended family who call her ‘Mom-ala,’” she added. “And I know a lot of us identify with some of those characteristics.”

After his plane landed at Chippewa Valley Regional Airport in Wisconsin, Donald Trump’s running mate JD Vance walked across the tarmac to get a closer look at Kamala Harris’s Air Force Two.

But she wasn’t there. After her plane landed, Harris had met a group of Girl Scouts before she joined her motorcade to drive to a packed rally with her running mate Tim Walz in Eau Claire, where Bon Iver was performing for thousands of supporters.

Vance, after getting close to Air Force Two, turned around and walked over to a group of reporters instead.

Trump says he has agreed to offer ABC News to debate Harris.,https://www.mediaite.com/news/trump-says-hes-agreed-to-three-unconfirmed-debates-with-kamala-harris-on-nbc-abc-and-fox-news/,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said that he has agreed to three debates with his Democratic counterpart Kamala Harris this fall at a press conference on Thursday.

“I think it’s very important to have debates, and we’ve agreed with Fox on a date of September 4. We’ve agreed with NBC, fairly full agreement subject to them, on September 10. And we’ve agreed with ABC on September 25,” began Trump.

Rick Klein Moments after Trump made the announcement, ABC News’ confirmed that Trump had agreed to the previously scheduled debate on the network, which is actually set to take place on September 10.

He continued:

So we have those three dates and, but those networks, they’re very anxiously awaiting that date and those dates. So we have September 4, September 10, and September 25. We have spoken to the heads of the network and it’s all been confirmed, other than some fairly minor details: audience, some location, which city would we put it into? But all things that will be settled very easily. I think it will be very easy. The other side has to agree to the terms, they may or may not agree. I don’t know if they’re going to agree. She hasn’t done an interview, she can’t do an interview. She’s barely competent and she can’t do an interview. But I look forward to the debates because I think we have to set the record straight.

Trump and President Joe Biden debated each other in June, but Trump initially pulled out of an ABC debate after Harris took Biden’s spot on top of the ticket.

On Wednesday, Trump seemed to open the door back up to the ABC debate during an appearance on Fox News.

“I’ve never been so loved by CBS and by ABC fake news. So, and by NBC and by NBC. Now they’re all in love with me now,” he said. “So that, you know, I say yes because it’s up to me, obviously. Also. But, on the debate, the most important thing is we get a debate. I think debates are very important. And I think she’ll be exposed.”

Trump says he has agreed to offer ABC News to debate Harris.,https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/abc-says-trump-and-harris-have-agreed-to-participate-in-a-presidential-debate-on-sept-10-1.6993659,"PALM BEACH, Fla. -

ABC says both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris have agreed to a Sept. 10 presidential debate, setting up a face-off between the Republican and Democratic nominees.

The announcement Thursday came shortly after Trump told a news conference that he had proposed three presidential debates with three television networks, saying he agreed on certain dates in September.

Trump is rejoining the ABC debate days after posting on his social media network that he would not appear on the network, citing a lawsuit he has filed. His decision sets up a highly anticipated moment in an election where the first debate led to a massive change in the race -- with Democratic U.S. President Joe Biden ending his reelection bid and endorsing Harris.

""I think it's very important to have debates,"" Trump said Thursday. ""I look forward to the debates because I think we have to set the record straight.""

The Harris campaign had no immediate comment.

Trump had teased an announcement about the presidential debate earlier this week after pulling out of an ABC News debate scheduled for Sept. 10 after President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign. Trump had said he would prefer that Fox News sponsor the debate, but on Wednesday was showing willingness to reconsider ABC.

Trump also echoed criticism from his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, that Harris has not held a news conference or sat down for interviews since Biden's withdrawal last month and she entered the race.

Harris has a travelling press pool with her on Air Force Two for all trips. Trump does not have a set travelling press pool that regularly accompanies him on his plane when he goes out to campaign.

Vance has journalists flying with him, and he campaigned this week in states where Harris and Walz had their own events scheduled. That included on Wednesday, when Vance's plane and Air Force Two ended up on the same tarmac in Wisconsin. Vance started walking toward the Democrats' plane but did not reach it before a motorcade carrying Harris, Walz and the travelling press pulled away.

Trump says he has agreed to offer ABC News to debate Harris.,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-holds-seemingly-pointless-press-194540343.html,"Former President Donald Trump spent nearly an hour at his Palm Beach, Florida, social club on Thursday ranting to a room full of reporters as he tries to grab the spotlight from a resurgent Democratic ticket fronted by Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.

The ex-president’s campaign had called the hand-picked group of journalists to Mar-a-Lago, where he attacked Harris as a “radical left person” during a rambling monologue in which he claimed that America is “in the most dangerous position it's ever been in” and “very close to a world war” without offering evidence to support those assertions. In one bit of news, Trump said that he has “agreed” to debates hosted by Fox News on September 4, ABC on September 10, and NBC on September 25.

“We have spoken to the heads of the network, and it's all been confirmed, other than some fairly minor details,” he said.

But only the September 10 debate on ABC has been agreed on by both the Trump campaign and the Democratic campaign now headed by Harris after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race last month.

Approximately 12,000 people came to watch Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz at their first joint appearance (AP)

Trump had previously backed out of the debate in a fit of pique after Biden’s exit from the race in favor of Harris last month, but in a post on X, ABC Washington Bureau Chief Rick Klein confirmed that both the Trump and Harris campaigns have agreed to participate in a face-off on the Disney-owned network.

The Harris campaign has not agreed to participate in any other debates, but the former president suggested that her failure to do so would be evidence that she’s incapable of debating even though she has run for office and debated opponents on numerous occasions.

“I don't know if they’re going to agree they she hasn’t done an interview, she can’t do an interview, she's barely competent, and she can’t do an interview. But I look forward to the debates, because I think we have to set the record straight,” he said.

The ex-president also took a swipe at the record crowds drawn by Harris and Walz, claiming at one point that one of his events drew more people than the 1963 March on Washington featuring civil rights activist Rev Dr Martin Luther King Jr. That event drew more than 250,000 people — far more than have attended any of Trump’s political rallies.

Harris and Walz have been filling venues to capacity since they were rolled out as a ticket, with more than 12,000 people attending their first joint event in Philadelphia on Tuesday.

Trump went on to attack Biden, who is no longer running for president, calling him “the worst president in the history of our country” and repeating an oft-told lie that other countries are deliberately emptying prisons and mental institutions and sending their former inmates to the United States.

He also complained that Harris is now leading the Democratic ticket, calling her “a vice president who is the least admired, least respected, and the worst vice president in the history of our country, the most unpopular vice president,” who is now running in Biden’s stead “because of political reasons ... even though she never received a vote.”

In reality, Harris and Biden both received more than 81,000,000 votes when they ran against Trump and then-Vice President Mike Pence in 2020, defeating them in both the popular vote and the electoral college.

But Trump continued to fixate on Harris’s previous record in presidential politics, citing her unsuccessful 2020 campaign which ended before the Iowa caucuses, and suggested that Biden, who has said picking Harris to run with him was the best decision he ever made, might not be happy with the move because she has now succeeded him on the Democratic ticket.

Donald Trump holds a rambling press conference at his Mar-a-Lago club on August 8 (AP)

“The presidency was taken away from Joe Biden, and I’m no Biden fan, but I tell you what, from a constitutional standpoint, from any standpoint you look at, they took the presidency away, and people were saying he lost after the debate, he couldn’t win. Well, I don’t know that that's true, necessarily, but whether he could win or he couldn’t win, he had the right to run. And they took it away,” he said.

He added that he is now “running against someone else” — Harris — and claimed that he’s still “leading” even though many recent opinion polls show him trailing or in a statistical tie with her since she became the Democrats’ presumptive nominee.

Asked if he was changing anything about his campaign now that Harris is his opponent, Trump replied: “I haven't recalibrated strategy at all.”

In a press release, the Harris campaign called Trump “the most insecure man in America.”

Campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said Trump was “throwing tantrums online and today at his country club for the media” because he wasn’t getting the attention he craves.

“The self-obsessed, convicted felon is incensed he’s not in the spotlight as Vice President Harris and Governor Walz barnstorm the nation talking about their vision for an America of opportunity and security — where freedom and democracy are protected and everyone has a fair shot not just to get by, but to get ahead,” he said.

“Trump has no vision, he has no solutions, and he is running a campaign of revenge and retribution to enact his Project 2025 agenda and make people’s lives worse. It’s why voters will reject him again at the ballot box this November.”"

Kamala Harris has welcomed Donald Trump’s decision to debate her in September, which the former president announced at a rambling press conference at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday.

“I hear that Donald Trump has finally committed to debating me on September 10,” the Vice President wrote on social media platform X. “I look forward to it.”

Trump’s confirmation of the debate on ABC came after a string of flip-flops on whether he would face his new Democratic opponent for the White House.

The Republican spent approximately an hour answering questions and delivering an unhinged mix of his stump speech, punctuated with attacks on his Democratic opponent (and past ones), and revisiting his favorite grievance — the reporting of crowd sizes.

Amid all of that, he said he has agreed to three presidential debates— on Fox News on September 4, ABC News on September 10, and NBC News on September 25. The Harris campaign has only agreed to the ABC News showdown and refused the Fox date.

Trump also claimed that he was ahead in the polls, whereas in reality, the numbers mostly favor the Democrats. The latest polling from Marquette University shows Harris leading by between four and eight percentage points."

Trump says he has agreed to offer ABC News to debate Harris.,https://newrepublic.com/feeds/168326/breaking-news,"Only on Wednesday, the Trump campaign was dodging questions about how the former president and convicted felon ducked out of the previously scheduled debate. This followed a litany of excuses Trump has made since Harris entered the race. He claimed that he couldn’t go on ABC because of ongoing litigation against the network and that he didn’t need to debate because he was already leading in the polls (he wasn’t). His team said that he couldn’t debate someone who wasn’t officially the Democratic nominee and didn’t have former President Barack Obama’s endorsement. Hours later, Obama endorsed Harris.

The real reason Trump has been hesitant to debate Harris is probably because he’s worried. Trump reportedly thinks it’s unfair that he has to run against Harris, complaining to confidants about the media coverage Harris is getting and about being overtaken in polls. He and his running mate, J.D. Vance, have been struggling to come up with any effective attacks against Harris and Tim Walz, trying out accusations of antisemitism and attacks on Walz’s military record that so far haven’t picked up any traction.

But in a debate, Trump will have the opportunity to come up with new soundbites and insults, albeit against an opponent sharper than Biden, and he probably wants to do it on a bigger stage than Fox News, even though they would give him a home-field advantage. As Trump would say, the ratings will probably be sky-high."
Trump says he has agreed to offer ABC News to debate Harris.,https://www.whec.com/national-world/abc-says-trump-and-harris-have-agreed-to-participate-in-a-presidential-debate-on-sept-10-2/,"PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Donald Trump recommitted to debating Vice President Kamala Harris after recently backing out, holding a lengthy news conference Thursday in which he taunted his new rival, boasted of his crowd on Jan. 6, 2021, and lashed out at questions about the enthusiasm her campaign has been generating.

As the Republican presidential nominee addressed reporters at his Palm Beach, Florida, estate, ABC announced that Trump and Harris, the Democratic nominee, have agreed to a Sept. 10 debate, setting up a widely anticipated faceoff in an already unparalleled election. Trump said he had proposed three debates with three television networks in September.

Trump again insisted there had been a “peaceful transfer” of power in 2021 and renewed attacks on Republican rivals like Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, whom Trump has harshly criticized since Kemp refused to go along with his false theories of election fraud.

In taking questions from reporters for more than an hour, Trump tried to draw a contrast with Harris, who has not held a news conference since she became the likely Democratic nominee following President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the race.

Trump’s decision to go on ABC, days after posting on his social media account that he would not appear on the network, sets up a highly anticipated moment in an election where Biden’s catastrophic performance in the last debate set in motion his withdrawal.

“I think it’s very important to have debates,” Trump said Thursday. “I look forward to the debates because I think we have to set the record straight.”

A few hours after the news conference, Harris wrote on X that she heard Trump “has finally committed” to debate her on ABC on Sept. 10, the date her campaign has long stuck to.

“I look forward to it,” she wrote.

Thursday’s event was Trump’s first public appearance since Harris selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate. Trump called Walz a “radical left man.”

“Between her and him, there’s never been anything like this,” Trump said. “There’s certainly never been anybody so liberal like these two.”

He repeatedly suggested Harris was not intelligent enough to debate him. Harris, for her part, has tried to goad Trump into debating and told an audience in Atlanta recently that if he had anything to say about her, he should ” say it to my face.”

Trump grew visibly perturbed when pressed on Harris’ crowds and newfound Democratic enthusiasm, dismissing a question about his lighter campaign schedule as stupid.

Trump says he has not “recalibrated” his campaign despite facing a new opponent, a dynamic some Republican strategists have quietly complained about.

When asked what assets Harris possessed, Trump said: “She’s a woman. She represents certain groups of people.”

Trump has repeatedly — and falsely — accused Harris, the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, of previously downplaying that she is Black.

Trump acknowledges weakness with Black women

Trump recognized some changing patterns with his new opponent, acknowledging he may not be as popular with Black women, one of Democrats’ key voting blocs. He expressed a lot of confidence in his support from Black men.

“It could be I’ll be affected somewhat with Black females but we’re really doing well,” he said. “And I think ultimately they’ll like me better because I’m going to give them security, safety and jobs. I’m going to give them a good economy.”

Trump campaign officials told reporters ahead of the news conference they believe Harris is currently enjoying a honeymoon period they likened to an “out-of-body experience.”

They argued the fundamentals of the race have not changed and the mood of the country remains sour, with Americans frustrated by the state of the economy, the administration and the country’s directions.

They argued that while Harris has energized the Democratic base — which Biden had not done — she will not be able to win over Republicans or convert independents or the persuadable voters they are focused on targeting.

Trump’s campaign plans to spend the next three months hammering Harris as “failed, weak and dangerously liberal,” blaming her for every one of the the Biden administration’s unpopular policies and mocking her mannerisms and speaking style.

Trump takes questions about abortion

Trump suggested abortion will not be a major issue in the campaign and the outcome in November.

He insisted that the matter “has become much less of an issue” since the Supreme Court ended the federal constitutional right to abortion services and returned control of the matter to state governments. But the issue is widely seen as a general election liability, and Trump named states such as Ohio and Kansas that have since voted to protect abortion rights.

Trump also said he expected Florida “will go in a little more liberal way than people thought” when it votes to repeal an abortion ban later this year, but he did not respond to questions asking how he would vote.

Trump argued that Democrats, Republicans and “everybody” are pleased with the results of the 2022 ruling that overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.

Trump’s actions within the GOP, however, suggest he knows that Democrats already have capitalized on Republican opposition to abortion rights and could do so again this fall. Trump single-handedly ensured that the Republican Party platform adopted at the 2024 convention in Milwaukee does not call for a national ban on abortion, and he has said repeatedly that hardliners in the party could cost the GOP in November.

The court’s decision, issued months ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, is widely cited as a reason that Democrats fared much better than expected in House and Senate contests. And Democrats have hammered Trump in paid advertisements blaming him and the justices he appointed for ending Roe.

Donald Trump falsely claimed during the press conference that “nobody was killed on Jan. 6,” the date in 2021 when pro-Trump rioters breached the U.S. Capitol amid Congress’ effort to certify Biden’s 2020 election victory after Trump refused to concede.

Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran from San Diego was shot and killed by a police officer as she climbed through a broken part of a Capitol door during the violent riot that breached the building.

To be sure, Trump has often cited Babbitt’s death while lamenting the treatment of those who first attended a rally outside the White House that day, then marched to the Capitol, many of whom fought with police and entered the the building.

“I think those people were treated very badly. When you compare it to other things that took place in this country where a lot of people were killed,” Trump said Thursday, adding “nobody was killed on Jan. 6.”

He also falsely claimed more people attended his speech at a “Stop the Steal” rally before the riot than the famous March on Washington in 1963, the iconic event at which Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his “I Have a Dream” speech.

Trump was asked about Biden’s comments in a CBS interview that he was “not confident” there would be a peaceful transfer of power if Trump were to lose.

“He should have brought this up at the debate if he had a problem. Of course there’ll be a peaceful transfer, and there was last time.”

While Biden was inaugurated on schedule, Washington was on lockdown that day, with the streets patrolled by military personnel and domestic police two weeks after Trump’s supporters had attacked the Capitol. ___

Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are to give a TV debate next month (Getty Images/Reuters)

Donald Trump gave an hourlong news conference Wednesday in which he recommitted to debating Vice President Kamala Harris.

As Mr Trump addressed reporters in a rambling conference at his Palm Beach, Florida, estate, ABC announced that he and Ms Harris have agreed to a September 10 presidential debate, setting up a widely anticipated face-off in the US presidential election run-up.

Mr Trump said he also wants to add two more debates that month - on September 4 and 25 - on Fox and NBC.

The Republican presidential nominee did not detail specific terms, such as whether there would be an audience, and it was not immediately clear whether his campaign had made a proposal to Harris' camp.

The Harris campaign did not immediately comment.

Mr Trump had previously suggested he might back out of the ABC debate, which was scheduled before Ms Harris, the US vice president, replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate less than three weeks ago, upending the contest.

The news conference was Mr Trump's first public appearance since Ms Harris selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate on Tuesday.

Ms Harris and Mr Walz have headlined rallies in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin this week, drawing tens of thousands of attendees in a fresh sign of how her late entry into the race has galvanised Democrats.

Her rapid rise has sent Mr Trump's team scrambling to recalibrate their strategy and messaging.

Opinion polls show Ms Harris has erased the lead Mr Trump had built over President Joe Biden, and Democrats have raked in hundreds of millions of dollars from voters and big donors in a matter of weeks.

Asked on Thursday how he has altered his approach to the new challenge from Ms Harris, Mr Trump insisted he has not done so.

In a question-and-answer session with reporters that stretched beyond an hour, Mr Trump moved from topic to topic, claiming Ms Harris and Mr Walz were weak candidates who were already dropping in the polls.

Despite that, he lamented that he isn't able to face Mr Biden in the election, suggesting that the president was a victim of an unconstitutional plot to dislodge him from atop the Democratic ticket.

Mr Biden dropped his faltering re-election bid under pressure from fellow Democrats worried about his chances of victory in the November 5 election after a poor debate performance against Mr Trump.

Mr Trump also mocked the size of Ms Harris' campaign crowds, even though they have matched his of late.

He falsely claimed the size of the crowd he addressed on January 6, 2021 - the day his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol - was as large as those who packed the National Mall in Washington for Dr Martin Luther King's ""I Have a Dream"" speech in 1963.

""We actually had more people,"" Mr Trump said. ""But I'm OK with it, because I liked Dr. Martin Luther King.""

Mr Trump criticised Ms Harris for not doing a press interview since launching her campaign.

""She can't do an interview. She's barely competent,"" Mr Trump said, later again calling her ""nasty,"" a go-to line that he often uses to disparage female critics.

The Harris campaign cancelled events on Thursday in North Carolina and on Friday in Georgia, where Tropical Storm Debby is bringing heavy rain and dangerous flooding.

The Democrats will head to Arizona and Nevada later this week, visiting two more swing states likely to play a key role in the November 5 election.

Mr Trump's running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, also canceled campaign events in North Carolina on Thursday due to the storm. He has spent the last few days trailing Ms Harris and Mr Walz around the country - an unusual move intended to provide a ""contrast,"" he told reporters on Wednesday."
Trump says he has agreed to offer ABC News to debate Harris.,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-says-hes-agreed-three-195110084.html,"Donald Trump said on Thursday he was happy to debate his Democratic rival Kamala Harris three times in September on different television networks. Trump's team is currently scrambling to outline a fresh campaign strategy with polls showing Harris has erased the lead that Trump had built over President Joe Biden.

U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Thursday he is willing to debate his Democratic rival Kamala Harris three times in September on different networks, as he tried to win back momentum from the Democratic vice president's newly galvanized campaign. ABC News said on X that it would host a presidential debate on Sept. 10 and that both Trump and Harris had agreed to participate.

During a news conference at his Palm Beach, Florida, residence, Trump said he wanted to hold debates on Sept. 4, Sept. 10 and Sept. 25, with Fox, ABC and NBC hosting one each.

His campaign later clarified that he had mixed up which network would host which debate.

Trump did not detail specific terms, such as whether there would be an audience, and it was not immediately clear whether his campaign had made a proposal to Harris' camp about the other two dates. The Harris campaign did not immediately comment on the debates.

Biden dropped his faltering reelection bid 2-1/2 weeks ago under pressure from fellow Democrats worried about his chances of victory in the Nov. 5 election after a poor debate performance against Trump.

Trump says he has agreed to offer ABC News to debate Harris.,https://www.dailywire.com/news/trump-says-hes-agreed-to-3-debates-on-3-different-networks-calls-harris-barely-competent,"Former President Donald Trump said during a Thursday press conference that he has agreed to three debates with three different television networks in September and is awaiting Vice President Kamala Harris’s confirmation.

During the press conference at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, the Republican presidential nominee said he has agreed to a debate against Harris on Fox News on September 4, another debate on ABC on September 10, and a third debate on NBC on September 25. Trump described the NBC debate as “a fairly full agreement, subject to them.”

“We have spoken to the heads of the networks and it’s all been confirmed other than some fairly minor details,” Trump said.

“The other side has to agree to the terms,” he added, referring to the Harris campaign. “They may or may not agree. I don’t know. She hasn’t done an interview. She can’t do an interview. She’s barely competent. She can’t do an interview, but I look forward to the debates because we have to set the record straight.”

Harris has criticized Trump in recent weeks after the former president suggested he wanted to wait for Harris to be officially nominated before completely agreeing to debate her. Last week, Trump said he would “probably” debate Harris but added, “I can also make a case for not doing it.”

WATCH THE TRAILER FOR ‘AM I RACIST?’ — A MATT WALSH COMEDY ON DEI

Trump blasted Harris’ time as vice president overseeing the border crisis and her early exit from the 2020 Democratic primary. He also said that “the presidency was taken away” from Joe Biden, arguing, “He had the right to run and they took it away.”

“What they’ve done is pretty incredible,” he continued. “You would’ve thought they would’ve gone out to a vote, they would’ve had a primary system, they would’ve done something, but to just take it away from him like he was a child. … He had 14 million votes. [Harris] had no votes.”

After Biden dropped out on July 21 and passed the mantle to Harris, the vice president has yet to sit down for a major interview or hold a press conference. Instead, Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are on a multi-stop campaign tour to all seven battleground states.

A previous version of this article reported on Trump saying the NBC debate will be on September 10 and the ABC will be on September 25. The Trump campaign later clarified that the ABC debate will be on the 10th and NBC will host on the 25th."

PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — ABC says both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris have agreed to a Sept. 10 presidential debate, setting up a face-off between the Republican and Democratic nominees.

The announcement Thursday came shortly after Trump told a news conference that he had proposed three presidential debates with three television networks, saying he agreed on certain dates in September.

Trump is rejoining the ABC debate days after posting on his social media network that he would not appear on the network, citing a lawsuit he has filed. His decision sets up a highly anticipated moment in an election where the first debate led to a massive change in the race — with Democratic President Joe Biden ending his reelection bid and endorsing Harris.

“I think it’s very important to have debates,” Trump said Thursday. “I look forward to the debates because I think we have to set the record straight.”"

As Trump addressed reporters at his Palm Beach, Florida, estate, ABC announced that Trump and Harris, the Democratic nominee, have agreed to a Sept. 10 presidential debate, setting up a widely anticipated faceoff in an already unparalleled presidential election. Trump said he had proposed three presidential debates with three television networks in September.

Trump again insisted there had been a “peaceful transfer of power” in 2021 and renewed attacks on Republican rivals like Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, whom Trump has harshly criticized since Kemp refused to go along with his false theories of election fraud. In taking more than a dozen questions from reporters, however, Trump tried to draw a contrast with Harris, who has not held a news conference since she became the likely Democratic nominee following President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race.

Another key moment in the election is set

Trump's decision to go on ABC, days after posting on his social media account that he would not appear on the network, sets up a highly anticipated moment in an election where Biden's catastrophic performance in the last debate set in motion his withdrawal.

“I think it's very important to have debates,” Trump said Thursday. “I look forward to the debates because I think we have to set the record straight.”

The Harris campaign had no immediate comment.

Thursday's event was Trump's first public appearance since Harris selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate. Trump called Walz a “radical left man.”

“Between her and him, there’s never been anything like this,” Trump said. “There’s certainly never been anybody so liberal like these two.”

He repeatedly suggested Harris was not intelligent enough to debate him. Harris, for her part, has tried to goad Trump into debating and told an audience in Atlanta recently that if he had anything to say about her, he should "" say it to my face.”

Trump grew visibly perturbed when pressed on Harris’ crowds and newfound Democratic enthusiasm, dismissing a question about his lighter campaign schedule as stupid.

Trump says he has not “recalibrated” his campaign despite facing a new opponent, a dynamic some Republican strategists have quietly complained about.

When asked what assets Harris possessed, Trump said: “She’s a woman. She represents certain groups of people.”

Trump has repeatedly — and falsely — accused Harris, the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, of previously downplaying that she is Black.

Trump takes questions about abortion

Trump suggested abortion will not be a major issue in the campaign and the outcome in November.

He insisted that the matter “has become much less of an issue” since the Supreme Court ended the federal constitutional right to abortion services and returned control of the matter to state governments. But the issue is widely seen as a general election liability, and Trump named states such as Ohio and Kansas that have since voted to protect abortion rights.

Trump also said he expected Florida “will go in a little more liberal way than people thought” when it votes to repeal an abortion ban later this year, but he did not respond to questions asking how he would vote.

Trump argued that Democrats, Republicans and “everybody” are pleased with the results of the 2022 ruling that overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.

Trump’s actions within the GOP, however, suggest he knows that Democrats already have capitalized on Republican opposition to abortion rights and could do so again this fall. Trump single-handedly ensured that the Republican Party platform adopted at the 2024 convention in Milwaukee does not call for a national ban on abortion, and he has said repeatedly that hardliners in the party could cost the GOP in November.

The court’s decision, issued months ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, is widely cited as a reason that Democrats fared much better than expected in House and Senate contests. And Democrats have hammered Trump in paid advertisements blaming him and the justices he appointed for ending Roe.

Trump says he has agreed to offer ABC News to debate Harris.,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/aug/08/harris-walz-uaw-detroit-trump-vance-elections-updates,"From 3h ago 16.01 EDT Harris and Walz campaign in Michigan “Let the collective come together around a common experience, which at its core is about dignity and the dignity of labor, and then let the people come together to negotiate so you make the balance, and then the outcome will be fair,” said Kamala Harris. “And isn’t that what we’re talking about in this year election? We’re saying we just want fairness. We want dignity for all people. We want to recognize the right all people have to freedom and liberty to make choices, especially those that are about heart and home and not have their government telling them what to do,” she added. Share Updated at 16.18 EDT

now 18.53 EDT Republicans have also questioned Walz’s military record by saying he didn’t serve in a combat zone. AP has looked into it: Earlier this week Harris’ campaign circulated on X a 2018 clip of Walz speaking out against gun violence, and saying, “We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at.” That comment suggests that Walz portrayed himself as someone who spent time in a combat zone.



According to the Nebraska Army National Guard, Walz enlisted in April 1981 — just two days after his 17th birthday — and entered service as an infantryman, completing a 12-week Army infantry basic training course before graduating from high school.



While attending the University of Houston in 1985, he was reclassified as a field artillery cannoneer as a member of the Texas Army National Guard, later serving as an instructor with the Arkansas Army National Guard.



In 1987, Walz returned to Nebraska’s Guard detachment, continuing field artillery assignments while he completed a college degree. By 1996, he transferred to the Minnesota Army National Guard. In 2003, he deployed to Italy in a support position of active military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. But he was not in a combat zone himself.



“Do not pretend to be something that you’re not,” Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance said Wednesday as he campaigned in Michigan. “I’d be ashamed if I was saying that I lied about my military service like you did.”



Vance enlisted in the Marine Corps after graduating high school, serving four years as a combat correspondent, a type of military journalist, and deploying to Iraq in that capacity in 2005.



Neither Trump nor Harris has served in the US military. Trump received a series of deferments during Vietnam, including one attained with a physician’s letter stating that he suffered from bone spurs in his feet.



The Harris campaign statement said Walz “would never insult or undermine any American’s service to this country” and “thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It’s the American way.” Share

18m ago 18.35 EDT Republicans are questioning Minnesota Governor Tim Walz’s military record. AP has taken a look:



Walz served a total of 24 years in various units and jobs in the Army National Guard. But it’s his retirement in 2005 that’s prompting criticism from some Republicans who are suggesting he abandoned his team to pursue a campaign for Congress.



As he ramped up for a congressional bid in 2005, Walz’s campaign in March issued a statement saying he still planned to run despite a possible mobilization of Minnesota National Guard soldiers to Iraq. According to the Guard, Walz retired from service in May of that year.

Photograph: Julia Nikhinson/AP In August 2005, the Department of the Army issued a mobilization order for Walz’s unit. The unit mobilized in October of that year before it deployed to Iraq in March 2006.



There is no evidence that Walz timed his departure with the intent of avoiding deployment. But the fact remains that he left ahead of his unit’s departure. In a statement, the Harris campaign pushed back on GOP characterizations of Walz’s service, and also noted that he advocated for veterans once he was elected to the US House. After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform – and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,” the campaign said.

31m ago 18.22 EDT In diplomacy news: California’s governor flew in for the young bears’ debut. Throngs of media gathered inside the zoo, while the city of San Diego warned of traffic jams ahead of the much-anticipated event on Thursday. The San Diego zoo rolled out the red carpet for the first public showing of its newest residents: two giant pandas, the first to enter the US in two decades. For years, the Chinese government has loaned pandas to zoos around the world in a practice called “panda diplomacy”. The fuzzy ambassadors have long been a symbol of the US-China friendship, ever since Beijing gifted a pair of pandas to the National zoo in Washington DC in 1972. As relations soured between the two countries, China stopped renewing panda loans to US zoos. But last year, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, said he was “ready to continue our cooperation with the United States on panda conservation” and pledged to reduce tensions between the two countries. Only four other giant pandas currently reside in the United States, all at the zoo in Atlanta. The Smithsonian’s National zoo will receive a new pair of pandas by the end of the year after its last bears returned to China last November. As part of the loan agreement, US zoos typically pay $1m a year toward China’s wildfire conservation efforts, and all cubs born in the US must return to China by age four.

ABC News has confirmed that Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will debate each other on September 10. Both Harris and Trump have confirmed they will attend the debate.

Donald Trump said he is “very happy” to run the election against Kamala Harris instead of Joe Biden. “We call her the first loser,” Trump said because Harris dropped out of her first presidential campaign early in the cycle, in 2019 before the 2020 primary season began.

Nancy Pelosi has said she will need to come to terms with the role she played in Joe Biden dropping out of his re-election campaign – while also saying it was all in service of keeping Donald Trump out of the White House, her new “life goal.” She said that having a part in the change at the top of the Democratic presidential ticket for 2024 was chiefly about ensuring the best prospects that Trump and the Republicans won’t win this November.

Hillary Clinton was all over X today in support of the Kamala Harris and Tim Walz Democratic ticket for the White House, defending Walz’s military record. She mocked Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance for posing with Air Force Two as if he will one day fly in it as the veep, with Clinton reminding people of his anti-choice stance on reproductive rights.

Donald Trump praised Walz’s handling of the mass protests and some riots that followed the murder of George Floyd by police in his state in 2020, while the-then president was on a phone call with state governors, according to a resurfaced audio clip. This contradicts Trump now slamming Walz for a weak response.

Kamala Harris is leading Donald Trump by six points, 53% to 47%, among likely voters, according to a new poll by Marquette Law School. Among registered voters, 52% said Harris is the choice for president while Trump is the choice of 48%.

Harris and Walz’s campaign has released a new Latino-focused ad in English and Spanish called “Determination.” The one-minute ad, which aims to target Latino voters, centers on Harris’s track record as a prosecutor, state attorney general, senator and vice president. Share

1h ago 17.39 EDT Alice Allan Since launching her campaign, Harris has turned to the ideas of freedom and individual liberties – concepts long associated with the rhetoric of the conservative movement – and turned them back on Trump and the modern Republican party. In Harris’s campaign rallies so far, abortion rights, LGBTQ+ rights and, in this speech, labor rights form the basis of freedom. “Even if you’re not a member of a union, you better thank unions. I’m here to say thank you, thank you, thank you to the sisters and brothers of UAW for all you are and all we will do over these next 89 days,” said Harris at the UAW earlier today. During her speech, the vice-president referred to a political “perversion” of the Republican party, “where there’s a suggestion that somehow strength is about making people feel small, making people feel alone, but isn’t that the very opposite of what we know, unions know, to be strong?

An estimated 50,000 people attended Trump’s speech. About a quarter of a million gathered to hear King speak. 2) He claimed that the US economy was at the brink of a depression. “Not a recession, a depression,” he said. While the stock market took a dip recently, many indicators suggest that the US economy is generally on firm footing. Today, Wall Street saw its best day of trading in two years. 3) He said “the vast majority of the country” supports him, and that his base includes “75 percent of the country”. That’s a bold claim for a former president who never won the popular vote. Polls currently indicate that about 43% of Americans currently hold a favorable view of Trump.

2h ago 16.59 EDT Jason Wilson JD Vance’s investments reveal potential contradictions between the political persona he has sought to project, his history as a venture capitalist and Peter Thiel acolyte, and his status as a hard-edged tribune of the so-called “new right”. Companies he has invested in include a firm that carries out medical testing of therapies that may include stem cells in scientific research to tech firms with records of harvesting data. Vance and some of the people behind the various firms he is involved with also exhibit an obsession with references to the mythology around The Lord of the Rings’ fantasy world. The revelations come in part from an analysis of his financial disclosures to the Senate ethics committee since 2022, first as a Senate candidate and then as a junior senator for Ohio. The Guardian’s reporting also drew on other public records and open source materials. The most recent disclosure, which covers until the end of 2022, also showcases the peculiar preoccupations that Vance as an investor shared with a Thiel-adjacent network of rightwing Silicon Valley venture capitalists who later spent millions supporting Vance’s candidacy to the Senate in 2022.

Harris “shared her sympathies and expressed an openness to a meeting with the Uncommitted leaders to discuss an arms embargo”, the organization said in a statement. But a Harris aide said on Thursday that while the vice-president did say she wanted to engage more with members of the Muslim and Palestinian communities about the Israel-Gaza war, she did not agree to discuss an arms embargo, according to Reuters. Phil Gordon, Harris’s national security adviser, also said on Twitter/X that the vice-president did not support an embargo on Israel but “will continue to work to protect civilians in Gaza and to uphold international humanitarian law”. A spokesperson for Harris’s campaign confirmed she does not support an arms embargo on Israel. The uncommitted movement, a protest vote against Joe Biden that started during the presidential primary season to send a message to the Democratic party about the US’s role in the Israel-Gaza conflict, began in Michigan and spread to several states. In Walz’s Minnesota, it captured 20% of the Democratic votes. Harris’s announcement of Walz as her running mate on Tuesday was met with celebration and even hope by many different parts of the Democratic electorate. But those in the uncommitted movement are still weighing their response, and hoping for a presidential campaign that will comprehensively address the mounting death toll in Gaza. “[Walz] is not someone who has been pro-Palestine in any way. That’s really important here. But he is also someone who’s shown a willingness to change on different issues,” said Asma Mohammed, the campaign manager for Vote Uncommitted Minnesota, and one of 35 delegates nationwide representing the uncommitted movement.

Trump says he has agreed to offer ABC News to debate Harris.,https://www.tampafp.com/trump-agrees-to-september-10-debate-with-harris-hosted-by-abc-news/,"VP Kamala Harris and Former President Donald J. Trump (File)

Former President Donald Trump announced during a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago Club on Thursday that he has accepted an offer from ABC News to debate Vice President Kamala Harris on September 10.

Trump had initially expressed his willingness to debate President Joe Biden and accepted ABC’s invitation in May. However, after Biden withdrew from the race last month and Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee, Trump suggested he might not debate Harris on ABC.

During a Wednesday appearance on Fox & Friends, Trump accused Vice President Kamala Harris of trying to avoid the presidential debates.

Trump committed to debating Harris with Fox News moderators on September 4 rather than on ABC News, leading Harris to accuse him of attempting to back out of a debate. The former president told the “Fox & Friends” co-hosts that he is willing to debate Harris to expose her ahead of the 2024 election.

“I think debates are very important and I think she’ll be exposed, just like [President Joe] Biden was exposed. Nobody knew Biden was that bad and then he was exposed during the debate and they tried to have a series of comebacks after that and they didn’t work out too well and they viciously overthrew him. I mean, he was overthrown using every trick in the book, they overthrew him,” Trump said.

The former president initially was scheduled to debate President Joe Biden on ABC in the second week of September, but has expressed concerns about the debate being moderated by ABC News hosts. Trump refuted the Harris campaign’s accusation that he is “running scared” from the debate by relying on Fox News to “bail him out.”

“She doesn’t want to debate, look, she doesn’t want to debate. She wants to say I don’t want to debate, but I do want to debate,” Trump continued. “You know, when it came to Biden, I accepted everything, I accepted Jake Tapper, I accepted everything because he didn’t want to debate after I accepted everything. The only thing I said, let’s stand up, they wanted to sit down and I said that’s not gonna look so great. But I accepted everything and pretty much that’s the way I do it right now because I want to debate her. I think it’s important for the country that we debate.”

Harris challenged Trump to a debate during a July 30 campaign event in Atlanta, Georgia, where she called on the former president to criticize her “to [her] face.”

“So here’s the thing. Here’s the funny thing about that,” Harris said. “So he won’t debate, but he and his running mate sure seem to have a lot to say about me … And by the way, don’t you find some of their stuff to just be plain weird? Well, Donald, I do hope you’ll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage. Because as the saying goes, ‘If you got something to say, say it to my face!’”

Trump also told the “Fox & Friends” co-hosts that he raised the question on whether it would be a conflict for ABC’s George Stephanopoulos to moderate a debate during his current defamation legal battle against the ABC host. The former president filed lawsuit on March 19 alleging Stephanopoulos intentionally made the false claim during a March 10 interview with Republican South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace that Trump was found “liable for rape.”

Biden’s performance during the June 27 debate caused many prominent Democrats to publicly call on the president to drop out of the race due to their skepticism that he had the ability to defeat Trump. The president announced on July 21 that he dropped out of the 2024 race and endorsed Harris.

PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — ABC says both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris have agreed to a Sept. 10 presidential debate, setting up a face-off between the Republican and Democratic nominees.

The announcement Thursday came shortly after Trump told a news conference that he had proposed three presidential debates with three television networks, saying he agreed on certain dates in September.

Trump is rejoining the ABC debate days after posting on his social media network that he would not appear on the network, citing a lawsuit he has filed. His decision sets up a highly anticipated moment in an election where the first debate led to a massive change in the race — with Democratic President Joe Biden ending his reelection bid and endorsing Harris.

“I think it’s very important to have debates,” Trump said Thursday. “I look forward to the debates because I think we have to set the record straight.”"

His decision sets up a highly anticipated moment in an election where the first debate led to a massive change in the race — with Democratic President Joe Biden ending his re-election bid and endorsing Ms Harris.

“I think it’s very important to have debates,” Mr Trump said on Thursday. “I look forward to the debates because I think we have to set the record straight.”

A few hours after the news conference, Ms Harris wrote on X that she heard Mr Trump “has finally committed” to debate her on ABC on September 10, the date her campaign has long stuck to.

“I look forward to it,” she wrote.

Mr Trump had teased an announcement about the presidential debate earlier this week after pulling out of an ABC News debate scheduled for September 10 after President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign.

Mr Trump had said he would prefer that Fox News sponsor the debate, but on Wednesday was showing willingness to reconsider ABC.

Mr Trump also echoed criticism from his running mate, Ohio senator JD Vance, that Ms Harris has not held a news conference or sat down for interviews since Mr Biden’s withdrawal last month and she entered the race.

Mr Vance has journalists flying with him, and he campaigned this week in states where Ms Harris and Mr Walz had their own events scheduled.

That included on Wednesday, when Mr Vance’s plane and Air Force Two ended up on the same tarmac in Wisconsin. Mr Vance started walking toward the Democrats’ plane but did not reach it before a motorcade carrying Ms Harris, Mr Walz and the travelling press pulled away."

""ABC News will host qualifying presidential candidates to debate on September 10 on ABC. Vice President Harris and former president Trump have both confirmed they will attend the ABC debate,"" the network said in a statement.

It comes as former Trump ally Anthony Scaramucci﻿ declared his one-time boss was ""frightened"" of taking on a newly energised Democratic Party.

Speaking at a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump said that he was ""looking forward"" to debating the vice president and that he had agreed to upcoming dates with Fox News, ABC and NBC.

""I think it's very important to have debates, and we've agreed with Fox on a date of September 4. We've agreed with NBC. Fairly full agreement subject to them on September 10. And we've agreed with ABC on September 25,"" the former president said.

A senior Trump advisor and an ABC source familiar with the matter both said that the correct dates Trump had agreed to with networks were: September 4 with Fox News, September 10 with ABC and September 25 with NBC.

Trump said ""minor details"" were still being worked out, including audience and locations.

In a wide-ranging press conference held at his Mar-A-Lago estate in Palm Beach Florida, Trump attacked his opponent repeatedly. (AP)

""The other side has to agree to the terms. They may or may not agree. I don't know if they're going to agree. (Harris) hasn't done an interview. She can't do an interview. She's barely competent, and she can't do an interview, I look forward to the debates because I think we have to set the record straight,"" he said.

CNN has reached out to the Harris campaign for comment.

Harris previously agreed to the ABC debate on September 10 – which was originally accepted by Trump and President Joe Biden before the latter dropped out of the race. Earlier this week, Trump had said that he would not debate Harris if she did not agree to attend the proposed Fox News debate on September 4.

Trump said his opponents still had to agree to terms on the schedule of debates in September. (AP)

An ABC source was confident that the network's debate would be the first one between Trump and the vice president, as the Harris campaign has indicated she will not agree to the Fox News debate.

A source familiar with the NBC negotiations said September 25 was ""one of the dates"" given to the campaigns. While the network has been in discussions with both camps, the Harris campaign has not formally accepted.

Details on location, rules and moderators will be determined closer to the debate date.

After Trump's press conference, Scaramucci offered an insight into what the former president was thinking after an hour-long attack on Harris.

""He spent the whole time talking about fear mongering. Fear on the border, he's talking about fear in the economy, he's talking about fear of crime, and so it's a very fear based approach,"" Scaramucci told CNN.

""I dont think that any strategist working with him now agrees with what he's doing""."

Gabriel Olds, 52, was arrested and booked on seven felony sexual assault charges on Wednesday, LAPD said. His bail is set at $3.5 million.

Police are asking additional alleged victims of Olds or witnesses to the incidents to come forward.

On Jan. 19, 2023, a 41-year-old woman reported that Olds raped her in her home in LA. Two other adult victims later came forward and made similar reports dating back to 2013, describing consensual dating encounters that allegedly ended in violent sexual assault, police said.

Olds, a Yale University graduate, has worked as an actor and screenwriter dating back to the early 1990s, according to police. He has made many one-off guest appearances in popular shows like “Criminal Minds,” “Heroes,” “Boardwalk Empire” and “NCIS: Los Angeles.”

His victims reported that he used his status as an Ivy League alumnus to meet women and arrange dates, police said. Several women in recent years have also reported meeting him on dating applications.

Police said they have identified three women that Olds allegedly assaulted and two other women who reported lesser violent sexual conduct. Investigators believe there could be more victims nationwide due to Old’s travels.

“We heard the same story again and again,” LAPD detective Brent Hopkins said in a statement. “Mr. Olds started off charming, but then used brutal violence to carry out these rapes. Some of these survivors suffered in silence for years before finding the strength to speak up. Now that he’s off the streets, we want to make sure everyone has a chance to be heard.”

“I think it’s very important to have debates,” Mr Trump said on Thursday. “I look forward to the debates because I think we have to set the record straight.”

A few hours after the news conference, Ms Harris wrote on X that she heard Mr Trump “has finally committed” to debate her on ABC on September 10, the date her campaign has long stuck to.

“I look forward to it,” she wrote.

Mr Trump had teased an announcement about the presidential debate earlier this week after pulling out of an ABC News debate scheduled for September 10 after President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign.

Mr Trump had said he would prefer that Fox News sponsor the debate, but on Wednesday was showing willingness to reconsider ABC.

Mr Trump also echoed criticism from his running mate, Ohio senator JD Vance, that Ms Harris has not held a news conference or sat down for interviews since Mr Biden’s withdrawal last month and she entered the race.

Ms Harris has a travelling press pool with her on Air Force Two for all trips. Mr Trump does not have a set travelling press pool that regularly accompanies him on his plane when he goes out to campaign.

Mr Vance has journalists flying with him, and he campaigned this week in states where Ms Harris and Mr Walz had their own events scheduled.

That included on Wednesday, when Mr Vance’s plane and Air Force Two ended up on the same tarmac in Wisconsin. Mr Vance started walking toward the Democrats’ plane but did not reach it before a motorcade carrying Ms Harris, Mr Walz and the travelling press pulled away."

Trump says he'll skip an ABC debate with Harris in September and wants them to face off on Fox News

CHAPIN, S.C. -- CHAPIN, S.C. (AP) — Donald Trump says he is pulling out of a scheduled September debate with Vice President Kamala Harris on ABC and wants them to face off on Fox News, making it increasingly unlikely that the candidates will confront each other on stage before the November election.

In a series of Truth Social posts late Friday, the Republican nominee and former president said his agreement to a Sept. 10 debate on ABC “has been terminated"" because he will no longer face Democratic President Joe Biden, who ended his campaign last month after a disastrous performance in their first debate.

Trump now says he will appear on Fox News on Sept. 4 in Pennsylvania with rules that he called “similar” to his debate with Biden, but with a full audience instead of a mostly empty studio. Trump said that if Harris, the likely Democratic nominee, does not agree to the new network and date, he will do a “major Town Hall” with Fox News.

Michael Tyler, a Harris spokesperson, said Trump “is running scared and trying to back out of the debate he already agreed to and running straight to Fox News to bail him out.”

It was not immediately clear whether ABC would turn its Sept. 10 event into a Harris town hall in Trump's absence. Tyler said Harris is committed to the time slot and would appear “one way or the other to take the opportunity to speak to a prime time national audience.”

In a subsequent Truth Social post on Saturday afternoon, Trump said of Harris, “I’ll see her on September 4th or, I won’t see her at all.”

Trump has gone back and forth on debating with Harris since she entered the presidential race. He had told reporters he felt an obligation to debate but also said in a recent Fox News interview that he thought Americans “already know everything” about both candidates Harris has pressed Trump to keep the commitment he made when Biden was in the race. Noting Trump's criticisms of her, Harris dared him recently to “say it to my face.”

In his Truth Social posts, Trump also cited his litigation against ABC News as “a conflict of interest” in his participation in the network’s debate. Trump sued the network in March following an assertion by anchor George Stephanopoulos that Trump had been found “liable for rape."" A New York jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing advice columnist E. Jean Carroll but rejected her claim that she was raped.

But Trump agreed, two months after filing his lawsuit, to the Sept. 10 debate on ABC, as well as the June 27 debate on CNN that helped knock Biden out of the race. David Muir and Linsey Davis, not Stephanopoulos, are set to be ABC's debate moderators.

Trump has skipped debates before, including all the 2024 Republican presidential primary debates.

What You Need To Know Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday teased a forthcoming announcement about a debate against Vice President Kamala Harris



His comments come after he pulled out of a scheduled debate on ABC News



Trump said he wants to debate Harris and he would prefer it to be on Fox, which is perceived as being friendlier to him



The Republican nominee also said in the interview that he was ""thrilled"" by Harris picking Tim Walz to join her on the Democratic ticket, attempting to brand him as a progressive in the vein of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, while repeating oft-used attacks on Jewish people who vote for Democrats

“I hear she’s sort of a nasty person but not a good, good debater,"" Trump said on Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends” on Wednesday, echoing comments he's made about women previously, including Hillary Clinton. ""But we’ll see because we’ll be debating her, I guess in the pretty near future. It’s going to be announced fairly soon but we’ll be debating her.""

Trump said he wants to debate Harris and he would prefer it to be on Fox, which is perceived as being friendlier to him, but said “every network loves me very much right now” and even suggested openness to debating on ABC News despite his protestations in recent weeks as he claimed the network was biased against him.

""I’d love to see it on Fox, but, you know, it takes two to tango,"" he said, adding: ""Look, she doesn’t want to debate.""

He claimed there “might be” a conflict with ABC News because he sued the network in March following a statement by anchor George Stephanopoulos that Trump had been found “liable for rape.” A New York jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing advice columnist E. Jean Carroll but rejected her claim that she was raped.

“You could use that as an excuse. I could use that. I’ve said that, is there a conflict. And you know, there might be,” Trump said.

Trump agreed to the ABC debate two months after filing his lawsuit at the time when he initially was expected to face President Joe Biden. He’s recently cited his frustrations with Stephanopoulos as reason why he would not keep the debate commitment, along with the fact that he agreed to it when he thought he would be debating Biden, not Harris, and claimed that agreement was scuttled by Biden ending his reelection bid.

But Trump on Wednesday noted that ABC had said the debate would be moderated by “World News Tonight” anchor David Muir and “ABC News Live Prime” anchor Linsey Davis, which he didn’t voice any objections about.

Trump didn’t offer any further details.

The Republican nominee also said in the interview that he was ""thrilled"" by Harris picking Tim Walz to join her on the Democratic ticket, attempting to brand him as a progressive in the vein of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, while repeating oft-used attacks on Jewish people who vote for Democrats.

Trump called Harris’ selection of Walz “a shocking pick” and called it “very insulting to Jewish people,"" a reference to a claim made by numerous Republicans that picking the Minnesota governor over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro was a decision related to his Jewish faith.

He later added: ""I think that any Jewish person who votes for a Democrat should have their head examined.”

In terms of political ideology, Trump attempted to claim that Walz is ""probably about the same as Bernie Sanders,"" an effort echoed by fellow Republicans to try and paint the Minnesota governor as a far-left figure.

“He’s probably more so than Bernie Sanders,"" Trump continued. ""She is more so than Bernie Sanders. That’s got to be your guy, Bernie Sanders, and that’s not a great guy. But there has never been a ticket like this. This is a ticket that would want this country to go communist immediately, if not sooner. We want no security. We want no anything. He’s heavy into transgender.”

""This is a ticket that would want this country to go communist immediately, if not sooner,"" Trump claimed."
"Tim Walz may be the next US VP. To those he taught, he's a great teacher.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn5rr0rgg3lo,"He's the new VP pick. To his students, he's Mr Walz

Josh Jagdfeld Former students describe Tim Walz as 'a gifted educator' who 'cared deeply'

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz could be America's next vice-president. Nobody is more enthusiastic about it than former students in his small-town, midwest classroom. At Mankato West High School, years before he joined the political scene, a young Mr Walz taught geography and social studies, supervised the lunchroom and coached the football team. The Harris campaign has sought to highlight Mr Walz's career as a teacher, even though he served six terms in Congress before he returned to Minnesota to run for governor, a position he's held since 2018. Those who knew him back then told the BBC that his teaching history is a guide to the politician he has become and the vice-president he could be.

It was 1999 and Jacob Reitan - the first openly gay student at Mankato West - was part of an effort to form the first gay-straight alliance at the school. GSAs, student-run organisations focused on supporting LGBTQ youth, emerged across the country through the nineties. Mr Reitan still remembers the bullying he faced back then, from the homophobic insult spray-painted on his driveway to a smashed-in car window in the school parking lot. But he told the BBC the Walzes promoted inclusion, kindness and ""jointly made the school a place where it was safe to come out"". And because the new GSA required a faculty advisor, Coach Walz stepped up. ""It really needed to be the football coach, who was the soldier and was straight and was married,"" he said in a 2018 interview, explaining why he took the role. Mr Walz remained a firm supporter of same-sex rights and, in 2011, Mr Reitan stood by the then-congressman's side as President Barack Obama signed his bill repealing the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy for gay and lesbian Americans serving in the military into law.

Jacob Reitan Jacob Reitan with Mr and Mrs Walz

""He's so perfect as an addition to the Harris ticket,"" Mr Reitan said. Introducing him on Tuesday at their first joint campaign event, Ms Harris lavished more praise on Coach Walz than on Governor Walz, his current title. ""Tim Walz was the kind of teacher and mentor that every child in America dreams of having, and that every kid deserves,"" she said. ""He's the kind of person who makes them feel like they belong and then inspires them to dream big, and that's the kind of vice-president he will be."" The Trump campaign has assailed Mr Walz as ""a dangerously liberal extremist"" who, along with Ms Harris, forms a ticket that they say is too far left for most Americans to stomach. They have scrutinised his record as Minnesota's governor - from enacting an ambitious left-wing agenda to delaying deployment of the National Guard in response to violent protests following the murder of George Floyd.

The Harris campaign is leaning into a biography they believe can win over the rural and working-class voters she needs to defeat Mr Trump this November. While Ms Harris grew up and built her career in liberal California, Mr Walz spent his childhood fishing, farming and hunting in rural Nebraska and came to politics later in life. He joined the National Guard at age 17. For about 17 years, from 1989 to 2006, he worked in public high schools - first for a year in China, then in Nebraska and later in his wife's native Minnesota. And former students like Mr Reitan are glowing in their praise for the ex-educator.

For brothers Jake and Josh Jagdfeld, attending Mankato West was akin to ""home-schooling with the Walzes"". Josh Jagdfeld took classes with both Tim and Gwen Walz in the 10th grade, and he remembers worrying politics would change his favourite teacher. But when they met on Monday night, Mr Walz greeted him with a shout of ""Mankato West in the building!"" and a big hug. ""He's warm, engaging, cares about everybody he talks to. That's exactly the same Tim Walz I knew,"" Josh Jagdfeld told the BBC. Coach Walz, a defensive coordinator for the school's football team, tapped Jake Jagdfeld as line-backer, putting him ""in a position to succeed"". When Coach Walz joined the team, Mankato West was reeling from a winless 0-27 season. Three years later, it won its first ever state championship. ""Great credit goes to him,"" Jake Jagdfeld said. ""He helped to create an inspirational environment for us young men to feel confident and work hard.""

Josh Jagdfeld

In 2004, Noah Hobbs was in Mr Walz's last geography class before he left teaching. ""He's a very high-energy person, whether school was just starting or it was the end of the day, and that energy was infectious,"" he said. ""The level of care that he gave to all students - not just the kids getting 4.0 [GPAs] - was really impactful for me as a young kid."" Mr Hobbs believes the US is ""looking for someone that is authentic, and Tim embodies that in a way not seen in politics at that level very often"". Mr Walz's evolution from teacher to politician has been described as accidental. In his telling, it stemmed from an incident at then-President George W Bush's 2004 campaign rally in Mankato. He and another teacher chaperoned two students to the event but local organisers refused to let them in.

To those he taught, he's a great teacher.",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/06/tim-walz-former-students-react/74685979007/,"To Minnesotans, Tim Walz is their governor of six years. To Vice President Kamala Harris, he is her newly official 2024 running mate.

But to Nate Hood, he was Coach and Mr. Walz.

""I'm much more excited about the race now that he's involved,"" Hood, 40, said. ""The energy that he's bringing right now to the campaign reminds me of the energy that he would bring to football practice.""

Formerly Hood’s eleventh grade geography teacher, Walz is now #2 on the Democratic presidential ticket. Harris announced the decision Tuesday.

Walz was one of a handful of candidates said to be in the running for the VP spot. Weeks ago, the governor was relatively unknown outside the Midwest. Today, his name recognition and popularity have rocketed among a crowd of freshly energized Democratic voters.

Hood said the Walz he knows has always been adored.

“Tim Walz is a very down to earth human being. When you see him and when you talk to him, he's very relatable,” said Hood, a city planner in St. Paul, Minnesota. “I think that's a huge asset for the Harris team.”

Walz taught social studies and coached a championship team

Walz, born and raised in Nebraska, began his teaching career in South Dakota at a Native American reservation, then spent a year teaching in China, before returning home to the Cornhusker State.

He and his wife – and fellow teacher – Gwen moved again to her home state of Minnesota in 1996.

Walz taught social studies and geography at Mankato West High School in southern Minnesota, where he was also a football coach and helped lead the team to their first state championship.

“When he wanted to amp up players before a game, he did a great job of it,” Hood, a 2002 graduate of Mankato West and defensive line player at the time, said. “Just like the fiery speeches that you see him give today that might go viral, that's what he was doing. Except he was yelling at a bunch of 16- and 17-year-olds.”

In his new role, Walz will be expected to help amp up the entire Democratic base and any Midwestern moderates still deciding between Harris and former President Donald Trump in 2024. And he began that work even before Harris called his name, credited with coining the insult “weird,” now popularly used by Democrats against Trump and MAGA conservatives.

""These are weird people on the other side,"" Walz told MSNBC in July. ""They wanna take books away, they wanna be in your exam room, that's what it comes down to and don't, you know, get sugar-coating this, these are weird ideas. Listen to them speak, listen to how they talk about things.""

A teacher ""universally beloved""

Other students at Mankato West remember Walz bringing that same energy and passion to his classroom.

“I was a ‘C-ish student in high school,” Noah Hobbs wrote on X ahead of the Harris campaign’s official announcement. “Mr. Walz took the time to make sure that I was successful. Not only in his class but others. He made learning exciting.”

The now-governor had a reputation for being the fun and favorite teacher, even by those who didn’t have him for history class.

“Everybody liked Mr. Walz,” said Emily Scott, who did not have Walz for a teacher but remembers him leading their school trip to China when she was 17.

Scott said Walz, who was also a lunchroom supervisor, acted as a bridge between the student cliques.

“There were jocks that did football. There were history nerds like me that wanted to go to China,” Scott said. “Debate and speech nerds, band nerds. And Mr. Walz stood in the middle of all of that and was pretty much universally beloved.”

When a student at Mankato West wanted to start the school’s first gay-straight alliance club in 1999, Walz agreed to be the group’s faculty adviser.

""It really needed to be the football coach, who was the soldier and was straight and was married,"" Walz said of his role in a 2018 Star Tribune article.

Educator to politician, he's still Mr. Walz

Walz made the shift from educator to politician in 2006. He ran for a seat in the U.S. House, flipping what had been a reliably Republican district in southern Minnesota.

Six terms later, Walz set his sights on governor. He is currently in the middle of his second term.

Peter Williams, a 2002 alumnus like Hood and Scott, has watched his former geography teacher go from Mankato to Congress to the governor’s mansion, and now to representing the Democratic presidential ticket out on the campaign trail.

He described Walz as a local celebrity back home in Mankato.

""He was already a pretty big figure in town that was always so nice to everyone,” said Williams, a 41-year-old attorney in Minneapolis. “It doesn't matter whether he's running for (vice) president or whatever, he's still the same guy. So, yeah, I think of him as Mr. Walz.”"
"Tim Walz may be the next US VP. To those he taught, he's a great teacher.",https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/08/tim-walz-not-lawyer-supreme-court-reform.html,"There’s a truly excellent Tim Walz tweet circulating (thanks, Sal Gentile!) about all the things the Minnesota governor will do for you if elected vice president. It includes fixing your carburetor and putting a new chain on your lawn mower (read all the replies, I beseech you), and the upshot is that the former high school civics teacher and football coach is not just a menschy guy who will bring over a hot dish without even being asked but also a regular human who lives in the world. He doesn’t so much have an IVF “policy” as have an IVF daughter. His daughter is in fact the reason he changed his views on guns, in order to work more aggressively to prevent gun violence. Walz is not so much a creature of law and policy as a first responder. And, as People magazine put it when he was tapped Tuesday, Walz thus becomes the first candidate on a Democratic White House ticket since Jimmy Carter ran for reelection in 1980 to not have attended law school. The first nonlawyer in more than 40 years!* In a year in which the Democrats are putting the Supreme Court on the ballot, that makes him perfectly positioned to talk about what the court has done to ordinary Americans and why it matters.

In recent days alone, one sitting justice of the Supreme Court, in an interview with Fox News Sunday, cautioned President Joe Biden—kinda mobbishly—to “be careful” about proposing reforms that include imposing enforceable ethics rules (something all other judges in America must abide by). Justice Neil Gorsuch did this just as the New York Times reported on yet more undisclosed and unreported luxury travel by one of Gorsuch’s colleagues. In a new letter from Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, of Oregon, we learned that Justice Clarence Thomas took a round-trip flight from Hawaii to New Zealand in November 2010 on Harlan Crow’s private jet but never disclosed it. As the Times points out, Thomas’ disclosure form for 2010 does not list any flights on Crow’s jet, and while he has recently amended other filings to account for luxury travel after the press has unearthed it, this form has never been corrected.

To briefly review, then, the same Supreme Court conservative supermajority that last month granted Donald Trump almost boundless immunity from criminal prosecution and in June took away the government’s power to ensure that water is clean and food and drugs are safe has opted to respond to criticism with yet another warning to “be careful” in even contemplating creating rules, an admonishment that comes alongside yet another brutish shrug from Thomas at the very existence of enforceable ethics guidelines. It’s a foolhardy response to a public that has, according to polling, lost all confidence in the court—but it’s not unremarkable from a branch that sees itself as floating above all law and regulation. As Svante Myrick aptly puts it, this lack of public confidence is about not merely what’s on the docket but the horse it rode in on: “It’s not just the rulings, it’s the recreational vehicle.”

So when Gorsuch and Thomas opt to spend their summers giving the middle finger to an American public that supports ethics reform and term limits by overwhelming margins (73 percent and 74 percent, respectively) while labeling such measures to be interference with “judicial independence,” that is certainly a choice. It’s just an objectively dumb one. And in that sense, finally having a nonlawyer on the ticket to speak to what the court has done to ordinary Americans in these few short years is both vital and long overdue.

If we have learned anything at all this year, it’s that far too many lawyers are far too timid and too institutionalized to be comfortable calling out the raft of bad decisions in which precedent is ignored, statutes are misread, and text and history are warped in order to achieve partisan political goals. It’s time to pass the torch.

And if that means that a former civics teacher can take us all to school and, in layman’s terms, about the urgent issues on which Americans can agree the court has screwed us all, well, his timing is perfect: The Supreme Court as currently constituted has eviscerated voting rights. Tim Walz has been a fervent proponent of expanding the franchise. In his first remarks this week as vice presidential candidate, Walz pledged that he and Kamala Harris would strive to create “a place where we settle our political differences not through violence but with our votes.” Americans overwhelmingly believe in democracy over authoritarianism.

The Supreme Court has just gutted abortion rights. Walz has consistently expanded them. The Supreme Court has worked persistently to dismantle public education in favor of sectarian religious schools. Walz has poured a lifetime of energy into bolstering public education. The high court has put lethal guns in the hands of violent Americans. Walz says he “sleeps just fine” with his F rating from the National Rifle Association. The list goes on.

On almost every signature issue Walz brings to the table as governor, the Supreme Court has worked to undermine and devalue public regulation, funding, and expertise. And as our friend Jay Willis keeps reminding us, you need not be an expert on constitutional law and methodological approaches to statutory interpretation to have informed opinions on the Supreme Court. You know who’s going to have informed nonlawyerly opinions on what’s wrong with the Supreme Court? The nominee for the vice presidency. And if the current justices of the Supreme Court believe that the law has no bearing on the ways in which they opt to live their lives, and if the current GOP front-runner for the presidency has lived his entire existence in that very same spirit, well, it may be useful to have someone in the race who not only is palpably and demonstrably affected by the law but can also speak to that in terms the rest of us can relate to and understand.

In a profound way, Walz is an avatar for someone who is attempting to do effective and lawful state governance and is being thwarted by an imperial Supreme Court, which is exactly what will happen to the Harris administration if court reforms are not enacted. Just as the Supreme Court’s conservative supermajority stood in the way of Biden’s emergency COVID management, his air-pollution efforts, his college-loan-forgiveness program, and his emergency-room abortion-care regulations, it will joyfully throw a spanner into the Harris administration’s efforts to expand voting rights, protect LGBTQ+ Americans, and prevent climate crises. One doesn’t need Juris Doctor behind their name to call this out. One need only have had a semester or two of high school civics to understand that this is neither “checking” nor “balancing” as anticipated by the Framers but rather an untouchable juristocracy that travels by charter flight and superyacht.

It’s high time that a prominent nonlawyer take a turn at this critique of the Roberts court, and it’s clear that Walz may succeed where all of us polite eggheads have failed. The Supreme Court supermajority represents a democracy crisis that needs to be discussed at barbecues and high school lunch tables, not just pondered in the stacks at Ivy League law schools. If Walz can initiate and embody that conversation over the next 90 days, in terms that chime with swing voters and undecideds, and in language that is playful and irreverent and goofy, it will be the best thing to happen to a Democratic Party that has avoided the topic of court reform for two decades too long. To baldly paraphrase Oliver Wendell Holmes, three generations of pointy-headed lawyers is enough. Let’s have a conversation on court reform from someone who has lived, and taught and governed, under the hand of a court that seems not to care about the real impacts of its decisions."

BBC

It's been a busy couple of weeks in American politics since Kamala Harris replaced Joe Biden on the Democratic ticket. On Tuesday, she made her selection for vice-president: Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota and a former congressman, teacher and army veteran. Josh Shapiro and Andy Beshear, the governors of Pennsylvania and Kentucky, had been in the running, as had Arizona Senator Mark Kelly. The BBC spoke to Democratic voters on what they thought of the choice.

Latim Simon Peter, 33, Minnesota

First of all, it's great for Minnesota to have someone on the ticket and yesterday everybody was going crazy over here. He's great for the country because he does not bring too much baggage, maybe that is safer. I struggled quite a bit when Biden was on the ticket and I was even leaning towards voting for a third party, so having Harris on the ticket gives me the option to vote for the ticket that I want to vote for. On a typical day, in a normal situation, this should be a very straightforward easy choice for the American people given the history of the former president. But Trump's people vote and they show up, so this should not be taken for granted. I hope Harris and Walz keep the momentum.

Ms Vaughn, who grew up in a Republican household but votes Democrat, wants to see Mr Walz in a debate with Trump's running-mate JD Vance. He's a teacher of 20 years, he's a rural Democrat, I'm a teacher, I'm a rural Democrat. He's an IVF parent, I'm also an infertility parent. He's a great pick, I think this is going to add a lot of energy to the campaign, he offers so much. The Harris-Walz ticket is going to be incredibly competitive with the Trump-Vance ticket. I would love to see the two VP candidates debate. You have someone who is actually from rural America - who still works as a farmer - versus someone who left his rural roots as quickly as he could and then proceeded to profit off of them after his Ivy League education. Rural communities had [it] really rough under Trump. We lost our child tax credits, IVF has been under attack since Roe [the federal right to abortion] was dismantled. This gives hope that maybe we will have a strong advocate for those aspects of life that are so close to mothers and children and teachers.

Mr Mansfield believes the Harris-Walz ticket would fight to protect women's rights and the LGBTQ community. What I have learned about the VP pick is that he has fought for the rights of women to have agency over their own bodies (if we had policies limiting men’s abilities to make decisions about their bodies, there would be riots and revolts), he passed sensible gun policies, legalized recreational marijuana, passed paid family leave, and restored voting rights and invested $1 billion in affordable housing. I’m so much more hopeful than I was a few weeks ago when our candidate was a president who clearly no longer had the mental capacity to compete with the viciousness of [Trump and his supporters]. I believe that Harris/Walz will work hard to find a pathway to more humane laws, to protect working class people, and to honour the rights of women to make their own choices about their bodies, and to stand up for the LBGTQ+ community. I’m stoked and look forward to victory in November.

Ms Tye initially preferred Mark Kelly as the VP choice but her research on Mr Walz has turned her head. I'm excited. Walz brings something to the party that Shapiro doesn't and somehow Kelly doesn't seem to either. He's a fun, engaging guy who gives fun interviews and he has a background that I think a lot of Americans can appreciate. I think she [Ms Harris] did a really smart thing. Somebody who's a gun guy could bring in some of the people who are really hesitant to vote for an anti-gun Liberal, but Walz has a hunting background and at one point had a positive rating with the NRA. I really appreciate that he's worked really hard with kids. I love that he facilitated a gay-straight alliance when he was a teacher and he's really worked to make sure that people have a minimum wage that is adequate. Kamala and Walz will blow the Republicans out of the water.

Mr Chandler thinks Mr Walz is the perfect choice to shore up Democratic support. Looking at all Walz's policies, he's a very progressive pick. I really like that he stood up for unions, I really appreciate that he fought so hard for kids to be able to have free lunches in schools in his state. He has been very adamant about needing peace in Gaza. I'm really happy with the pick because he feels more inspiring, he reminds me of a really nice grandpa, even though he's basically the same age as Kamala Harris. I like that someone who has been a big proponent of helping people who are struggling is the pick. It's what we need right now in this country. The Harris-Walz ticket is more representative of the wider American public than the Trump-Vance ticket: it makes me feel a lot more inspired for this election.

Ms Mendenhall said she would have reluctantly voted for Mr Biden and Ms Harris. Now she's excited by the Harris-Walz ticket. I was pleasantly surprised, it seemed like it was going to go to Josh Shapiro but I think Tim Walz was the better choice. I don't know that much about him but I know he's been a really good governor in Minnesota and seems to support progressive values. I'm cautiously optimistic, I know it's going to be difficult, but Walz compared to Vance - there's really no comparison. I would love to see the two of them debate, I don't know if that will happen, but I do feel pretty good about it. It's amazing how within a matter of a few weeks the outlook for the election really turned around. With Biden and Harris there was essentially no hope of winning, but now there is at least a fighting chance to win."

Walz, 60, is from cattle country in northeast Nebraska. He was born in West Point, grew up in Valentine, graduated from high school in Butte and earned his bachelor’s degree at Chadron State College.

Much of his political bio was built on his time teaching and coaching football, track and basketball. His career has roots in Alliance, Nebraska, where he and his wife, Gwen, taught. Her Minnesota roots led to them moving to Mankato in 1996.

Walz enlisted as an infantryman in the Nebraska National Guard after high school, and he kept serving when he moved to Minnesota. He retired from the National Guard after 24 years in 2005 with the rank of command sergeant major. He was the highest-ranking enlisted soldier to serve in Congress, the Military Times reported.

Coach remembers Walz as teacher

Walz coached linebackers and signaled the defense at Alliance High School under coach Jeff Tomlin, who recently retired and took a job as an assistant at Hastings College.

Tomlin said he remembers Walz as an amazing coach and social studies teacher. He called Walz “an ordinary guy with the extraordinary ability to have a vision for who he is and who he wants to be.”

Walz had an innate skill of connecting with people who were different from him, Tomlin said.

“He was an exceptional teacher, one of the best I’ve been around,” said Tomlin, who like Walz taught social studies. “A lot of that was the positive energy that he brought.”

Tomlin said he and others they coached with are not surprised that Walz was chosen.

“If you’re ever around Tim, you’re not really that shocked,” he said. “He’s got that it factor that very few people have.”

Nelson says Walz is great with people

Former Nebraska U.S. Sen. and Gov. Ben Nelson said he remembers a young Walz as an educator who pressed him during Nelson’s first campaign for governor.

Walz has said he got the bug to teach when he spent a year in China in the early 1990s, teaching English and American history to high school students.

“He’s a very principled person with deep beliefs about education and about families,” Nelson said. “He is … the kind of person who never meets a stranger. He develops friendships quickly.”

He called Walz “a good friend” and “a warm person” who takes no time to make people comfortable. Nelson lauded Harris’ vice presidential pick as a way to connect better with the Midwest.

Nelson compared Harris’ task of picking a running mate with choosing a lieutenant governor. He said you want someone who shares your values and reflects well on your campaign’s vision.

Political observers said they expect Walz to help the Harris campaign in the “Blue Wall” states of Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania, as well as in Nebraska’s 2nd District, the Omaha area.

“He doesn’t have to introduce himself to those states,” Nelson said. “I don’t think he has to go and convince them that he’s interested in the same areas that they’re interested in.”

Walz visits Nebraska often

Walz, during a September 2023 trip to Omaha for the Nebraska Democratic Party’s “Ben Nelson Gala,” explained his political approach as going out and talking to people like neighbors. He spoke at the event in 2010 as well, when it was called the Morrison-Exon dinner.

Walz touted his work to expand school lunch and breakfast programs for all school kids. He has backed abortion rights, paid family leave, expanded health care and recreational marijuana.

But he told the Nebraska group that for people to embrace progressive policies, including climate change, Democrats needed to focus more on people’s bottom line, family budgets.

“You can go out and try to message this, but it’s kind of hard to vote against kids’ meals at the end of the day,” he said. “We should stay focused on the things that improve people’s lives.”

He has laughed when asked about whether he considers himself a Nebraskan or a Minnesotan, saying last fall that his mom still lives in Butte and his brother-in-law still lives in Alliance.

Jane Kleeb, chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party, said Walz “brings real and deep experiences in rural towns, veteran communities and of course with teachers.”

“Rural America is having our moment being represented on the national stage,” she said.

Walz served in Congress from 2007-2019. He was elected Minnesota’s governor in 2018 and was re-elected in 2022.

Kerrey says pick could bridge gap between rural and urban

Bob Kerrey, also a former Nebraska governor and U.S. senator, said it’s vital for Democrats nationally to show interest in issues faced by Americans outside of cities and suburbs.

Walz, he said, would shine in his ability to “bridge the gap between rural and urban America.” Kerrey, who moved to New York after serving in the Senate, said people in both types of places just want to be heard.

“If all he can do is bridge that gap a little bit … you’re gonna get good policies,” Kerrey said.

It’s also important, Kerrey said, for people involved in national politics to learn that someone who didn’t attend Harvard, Stanford or Yale can contribute in key ways to our politics.

“He looks like a guy you could run into in a coffee shop in Valentine,” Kerrey said. “He’s an enlisted man. He went to one of our state colleges. There’s nothing about him not to like.”

Chadron State President Ron Patterson said Walz’s selection shows his students that they “can make a difference in the world, even if you start at a small college in the corner of northwest Nebraska.”

Republicans criticize selection

Local and national Republicans have criticized the Walz pick for a variety of reasons, describing him and Harris as the most progressive ticket to run for president in decades.

In a statement, Nebraska Republican Party Chairman Eric Underwood criticized the selection process that resulted in Harris becoming the Democratic nominee for president without facing primary voters first and then her ability to select Walz as her running mate.

“Instead of millions of Democrat voters having a voice in their presidential nomination, less than a couple thousand delegates chose for them,” Underwood said in the release.

Several Republicans commenting online have criticized Walz for questioning the effectiveness of a border wall.

Delanie Bomar of the National Republican Congressional Committee criticized Walz’s handling of the aftermath of the George Floyd protests in Minneapolis and said he is wrong on crime.

But Nelson said Nebraskans won’t be fooled by sound-bite critiques of one of their own. He said most people understand “how difficult those decisions are” for governors.

Nelson said he respected Walz for helping a city police itself in the wake of what a court later determined was Floyd’s murder at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer.

“Watching the challenges that have arisen … I think you have a better appreciation for how challenging it is for anybody to deal with them. He didn’t walk away,” Nelson said.

“And I don’t think the justice system has walked away from the incidents in Minnesota, either.”

Harris, in a statement Tuesday, said she picked Walz as her running mate because “his convictions on fighting for middle class families run deep.”

“It’s personal,” she said. “As a governor, a coach, a teacher, and a veteran, he’s delivered for working families like his own. We are going to build a great partnership.”"

Gov. Tim Walz, Kamala Harris’ vice presidential running mate, refused to drop out of his congressional race in 2005 despite an Army National Guard announcement of a possible deployment, according to a statement from his campaign at the time.

Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump’s running mate, accused Walz of ducking service in Iraq when he left the guard and ran for Congress in 2005.

Walz served in the Army National Guard for 24 years before retiring in 2005. He launched a campaign for Congress in Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District that year and was elected in November 2006.

Walz filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission as a candidate for Congress on February 10, 2005. The next month, after the guard announced a possible deployment to Iraq within two years, Walz’s campaign issued a statement saying he intended to stay in the race.

“I do not yet know if my artillery unit will be part of this mobilization and I am unable to comment further on specifics of the deployment,” Walz said in the March 2005 campaign release.

“As Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. I am dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington DC or in Iraq,” he said. “I don’t want to speculate on what shape my campaign will take if I am deployed, but I have no plans to drop out of the race. I am fortunate to have a strong group of enthusiastic supporters and a very dedicated and intelligent wife. Both will be a major part of my campaign, whether I am in Minnesota or Iraq.”

Walz retired from the Army National Guard in May 2005, according to the Minnesota National Guard. Service members often submit their paperwork for retirement months before their retirement date. It’s unclear when Walz submitted his papers for retirement.

In a 2009 interview for the Library of Congress, Tim Walz said he left the Army National Guard to focus full time on running for Congress, citing concerns about trying to serve at the same time and the Hatch Act, which limits political activities for federal employees.

“I left in April of 2005 and for me it was just short of 25 years and it was to run for this office. We were really concerned that we were going to try and do both. There’s always the Hatch Act and some of the things that you have to be very careful of,” Walz said in the interview.

The Harris campaign did not immediately respond when asked about when Walz submitted his retirement paperwork.

"Tim Walz may be the next US VP. To those he taught, he's a great teacher.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/06/tim-walz-what-to-know-harris-vp,"In Kamala Harris’s “veepstakes” – the search for a running mate to take on Donald Trump and JD Vance – the Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, came from relative obscurity to seize the glittering prize. So who is he and what should you know about him?

He’s ‘Minnesota nice’

According to the Star Tribune, the well-known phrase refers to “Minnesotans’ tendency to be polite and friendly, yet emotionally reserved; our penchant for self-deprecation and unwillingness to draw attention to ourselves; and, most controversially, our maddening habit of substituting passive-aggressiveness for direct confrontation”. Most of that holds true for Walz, 60, who was born in Nebraska but whose cheerful and friendly demeanour has made him popular in office and even seems to make his political attack lines more effective, as when he went after Donald Trump and JD Vance for being “weird”, the gambit that propelled him into the reckoning to be running mate to Harris.

He’s not that ‘Minnesota nice’

Walz was a high school football coach, a profession known for displaying and encouraging aggression – active rather than passive at that. For more than a decade at Mankato West high school, Walz was defensive coordinator, working out how to best tackle and silence opposing attackers. As he told Pod Save America this year, when he arrived, the school had lost 27 games in a row. “We said, ‘This is nonsense. Let’s turn this thing around.’ Three years later we were state champions, and now they’re a powerhouse.”

He was a sergeant in the national guard

Walz spent 24 years in the national guard, out of Nebraska, and then Minnesota. As reported by Stars and Stripes, he enlisted as an infantryman at 17, encouraged by his father, a Korean war veteran, then put himself through college on the GI bill. Re-enlisting after 9/11, Walz deployed during natural disasters on US soil and to Italy in support of operations in Afghanistan.

In 2005, Walz retired as a command sergeant major in the artillery – and faced criticism for leaving as his battalion prepared to go to Iraq. In comments publicised by the US army as Covid struck, Walz, the highest-ranking enlisted soldier ever voted into Congress, said: “In the guard, you put your community first. Everything you do, you do to ensure the health, safety and security of the people who are depending on you. And as governor, those are principles of servant leadership that I rely on every day.”

He’s good at winning elections

Walz was a high school social studies teacher – and adviser to LGBTQ+ students – until, in 2006, he beat a Republican incumbent in a rural area to win a seat in Congress. After six terms in the US House, he ran for governor of Minnesota in 2018. He won that race, against the Republican Jeff Johnson, by 11 points. First-term challenges included the response to Covid-19, imposing and maintaining lockdowns and school and business closures, and the fallout from the police murder of George Floyd, an epochal event that made Minneapolis both the focus of worldwide protests for racial justice and the site of serious rioting. Running for re-election in 2022, against Scott Jensen, Walz won comfortably again.

He’s popular with progressives

On defeating Jensen, Walz told Minnesotans they had “made a conscious choice … to reject negative, divisive politics and choose the whole path of each and every one of us to be the best we possibly can”. On Tuesday, campaigners saluting Harris’s choice of running mate emphasised Walz’s progressive achievements. NextGen Pac, a youth-led group, said Walz had passed “significant legislation … that protects our rights, fights for climate justice, and builds a stronger economy for everyday people … enshrining abortion rights, establishing paid sick and family leave, enacting a nation-leading child tax credit, and signing 40 climate initiatives into law”.

Walz has also overseen significant gun control reform, a notable achievement from a politician once endorsed by the National Rifle Association who was encouraged by his daughter to come out in favour of an assault weapons ban, after a series of school shootings.

He enrages Republicans

The announcement that Harris had picked Walz was greeted with predictable rightwing attacks. Foreshadowing Vance’s invective in Philadelphia at lunchtime, the Republican National Committee called Walz “a far-left radical … weak on border security” (presumably the southern border, hundreds of miles from Minnesota, rather than its northern one with Canada), and slammed him for supporting universal healthcare, taxation to pay for such measures, and abortion and voting rights. Walz, the RNC said, is also “extremely woke … a climate radical who wants to phase out fossil fuels” and “soft on crime”.

The Republican National Committee also highlighted a remark in which Walz discussed the Minnesota electoral map in terms familiar both to students of national politics and those engaged by his folksy attacks on Trump and Vance: “You see those maps,” Walz said in Minneapolis in 2017. “Red and blue and there’s all that red across there. And Democrats go into depression over it. It’s mostly rocks and cows that are in that red area.”

He’s a family man

Walz’s wife, Gwen Walz, is a public school teacher like her husband and also a prominent campaigner for educational reform, in particular a champion of improving education in prisons as a means of reducing reoffending. Gwen Walz is also the mother of two children, Hope, 23, and Gus, 17, born with the help of in vitro fertilisation, or IVF – treatment under threat from Republicans and rightwing Christians seeking further victories after the removal of federal abortion rights. “If you have never personally gone through the hell of infertility, I guarantee you someone you know has,” Walz said in March, during his state of the state address.

Walz’s children have appeared with him in public. At the Minnesota state fair last year, he told Hope, a vegetarian, she could have a turkey corn dog. “Turkey is meat,” Hope said.

“Not in Minnesota,” her dad said. “Turkey’s special.”

He knows a bit about China

Thanks to a Harvard-run program, Walz taught in China for a year – it happened to be 1989, the year of the Tiananmen Square protests and brutal government crackdown – and as a result he speaks some Mandarin. In 1994, he and Gwen spent their honeymoon in China, on a trip they had arranged for a group of students. According to Gwen Walz’s official state biography, the couple continued to arrange such trips through 2003.

He doesn’t drink

In September 1995, when he was 31, Walz was stopped while driving at 96mph in a 55mph zone. Having failed a sobriety test, he pleaded guilty to a charge of reckless driving and paid a $200 fine. Walz has acknowledged the incident and said he no longer drinks. His preferred tipple is Diet Mountain Dew – coincidentally, also favored by Vance, the Republican pick for vice-president.

His name is a mystery to some

Is it “Waltz”, as in the dance, or “Walls”, as in the things that hold up roofs, or even “Wal-tz” as in Walmart? Turns out it’s “Waalls”, as in “Walls” but with a slightly longer “a”. He says it that way himself."
"Tim Walz may be the next US VP. To those he taught, he's a great teacher.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/tim-walz-teacher-coach-remembered-rcna165413,"As a teacher and coach at Mankato West High School, Tim Walz gave out hallway high-fives, was named “most inspiring teacher,” motivated students to become educators themselves and helped create a turnaround story for the football team.

Now governor of Minnesota and the vice presidential pick on the Democratic presidential ticket, Walz is still remembered fondly by his former students and players.

“He was probably one of the most well-liked teachers in the school while he taught there,” said Katie Heintz, 41, who had Walz as a teacher her junior year of high school and is now the director of a library in the area.

His lectures on topics like history and government have stuck with her to this day, she said. He really taught both sides of everything,” she said. “He wasn’t pushy about, you know, right or left or whatever.”

He was also an influential assistant coach who mentored students beyond the field and helped lead the football team to a state championship.

Both Walz and his wife, Gwen Walz, worked at Mankato West, and Tracy Frederick Corcoran, 41, took classes with both of them.

“Between Tim and Gwen, those were two people in the high school that were always there for students,” she said. “Both Tim and Gwen had this magic of helping you see possibilities and potential in yourself that maybe you didn’t actually know was there.”

Walz, a Nebraska native, moved to Mankato after having served in the military for almost 20 years. It’s a city of around 45,000 people 80 miles south of Minneapolis, and residents describe it as the ideal place to raise a family. Both Corcoran and Heintz, Walz’s former students, moved back to Mankato years after graduation to raise their families. They’ve seen their old teacher a handful of times each since then; he still attended some high school football games as governor, they said.

Despite his political ascent, Heintz said, his disposition is exactly the same.

“He’s standing true to what he believes in,” she said. “We hadn’t spoken in 15 years, but he remembered I was a student. We just picked up right where we had left off, no awkwardness.”

Corcoran now works in educational consulting and is making her own foray into politics by running for the local school board. It’s something she said Walz inspired her to do.

“Tim is definitely one of those teachers that left a lasting impact on me,” she said. “Tim really provided a window for me to see that actually you can have a bigger impact on a larger scale and public office is one of those ways that you can do that.”

Mankato is fairly mixed when it comes to politics, Corcoran said, nearly split down the middle between Democrats and Republicans. But with his deep community ties, Heintz said, Walz is liked across the board. She thinks he has the potential to attract those on the right to vote for Vice President Kamala Harris. “I think people that know him will vote for him because of who he is,” she said. “My dad is a die-hard Republican, served in the military, and he is fond of Walz.”

Watching their high school teacher become their representative and governor and now join the running to be vice president has been strange and thrilling, Corcoran and Heintz said. They’re both voting for him and Harris in November.

“You can just feel the excitement from everyone who has been impacted by him,” Corcoran said. “He hunts and fishes like many Minnesotans do, and I think that really humble, human side of him is what makes people rally around him.”

Patient but ‘full bore’ as a coach who helped lead a lagging team to state championships

It was his junior year, and Dan Clement wanted to drop out of Mankato West. A self-proclaimed “troubled youth,” he hung out with a group of kids who preferred to skip class, drink alcohol and do drugs rather than sit in a classroom. But a conversation in the summer of 1998 with his linebackers coach, Walz, changed his mindset heading into the final year of high school.

“He really pulled me along,” Clement, 43, said. “He really just showed a lot of care for me to the point where I’m like, ‘OK, I’m going to continue going to school, and I’m going to work hard for you.’ I played football for him. I didn’t really play football for much of anything else.”

Clement’s recollection of Walz is far from unusual from former coaches and players, who say he was an integral part in turning a once-lackluster football program into the best team in Minnesota.“They didn’t win a game for two or three years,” Clement said. “Mankato West was awful. A really bad football team for many, many years. And then quite literally from ’96, ’97 and ’98, within those years, it just went from awful to state champs.”

Walz moved to Minnesota from Nebraska with his wife, Gwen, in 1996 to be closer to her family. They both joined the school as teachers, and Walz was brought up as a possible assistant to then-head coach Rick Sutton.

Sutton, 62, said they immediately hit it off.

“Tim is the kind of guy that just makes people feel comfortable. He’s got really good people skills,” Sutton said. “Without a doubt, one of the most important things in coaching and teaching is the ability to build relationships with students and other people, and that’s definitely Tim’s strength. No question, when I first met him for that informal interview, that this was a guy that I wanted on my staff.”

Walz initially coached the linebackers and then transitioned to defensive coordinator. In 1999, they had a team with major potential but started the season 2-4. Sutton and Walz made sure to emphasize to the players that the year was not done quite yet.

They then rallied for eight straight wins and eventually took home the state championship with a dramatic 35-28 victory over Cambridge-Isanti. Walz’s defense limited one of the state’s star running backs to just over 100 yards, a major success considering he was coming off a semifinal game in which he had more than 250 yards on the ground.Seth Greenwald, a linebacker on the championship team, said Walz’s energy on the sidelines helped change its fortunes that season.

“He brought a lot of energy,” Greenwald said. “He wasn’t a big yeller; he wasn’t a big screamer at us. He was always coaching with us. Always very present as a coach. Never took days off, never wasn’t prepared. He just enjoyed the game. His passion stood out. When he rolls up his sleeves and decides that he’s going to go ahead and attack something, he goes full-bore.”

Clement added: “He wasn’t screaming when you failed. He was screaming when you did well. He’s two fists over his head, jumping 3 feet in the air. That’s how I envision Coach Walz.”

‘The Education Governor’

Walz attributes his decision to switch from educator to legislator to an incident that happened in 2004.

President George W. Bush was in Mankato to give a speech, and Walz brought a group of children to listen to him, hoping to give them a unique educational experience. But the students were denied entry because they had previously volunteered for the Democratic Party, according to Walz.

“My students, regardless of political party, deserved to witness the historical moment of a sitting president coming to our city,” Walz tweeted in August 2020, adding: “It was at this moment that I decided to run for office. While I had a passion for politics, I had never been overly involved in political campaigns, and many people thought that a high school teacher and football coach didn’t stand a chance.”

Educators and advocates applauded Walz, a fierce proponent for children’s causes who they felt was a welcome addition to the national stage.

“Gov. Walz is known as the ‘Education Governor’ because he has been an unwavering champion for public school students and educators and an ally for working families and unions,” Becky Pringle, president of the National Education Association, said in a statement Tuesday. Among the actions he has taken: Last year, Walz signed a bill into law that enabled all K-12 students in Minnesota to receive free school breakfast and lunch, regardless of their families’ incomes. His legislation followed a Covid-era federal waiver that had temporarily made universal free school meals available to all students nationwide during the height of the pandemic; only a handful of states other than Minnesota have made the free school meals permanent.

A group of children fist-bumped and hugged Walz when he signed the bill into law at their Minneapolis elementary school.

Republican critics in his state, meanwhile, have panned the free-meals legislation, arguing that the more than $400 million in taxes spent on it could serve a better end.

Walz has been steadfast in his defense of the legislation.

“The haves and the have-nots in the school lunchroom is not a necessary thing,” he said at a news conference last summer. “Just feed our children.”He has taken the same straightforward approach to other aspects of education, singing off on increasing spending by billions of dollars.

The National Education Association, a union representing about 3 million teachers and other school staff members, said educators are “fired up and united” to elect a Harris-Walz ticket.

“We know we can count on a continued and real partnership to expand access to free school meals for students, invest in student mental health, ensure no educator has to carry the weight of crushing student debt and do everything possible to keep our communities and schools safe,” Pringle said."

Tim Walz as her running mate, capping a historically compressed vice presidential search.

Walz rocketed up the list of finalists on the strength of his folksy relatability, gubernatorial experience and congressional record representing a conservative-leaning district.

""I am proud to announce that I've asked @Tim_Walz to be my running mate,"" Harris posted on X Aug. 6. ""As a governor, a coach, a teacher, and a veteran, he's delivered for working families like his. It's great to have him on the team. Now let’s get to work.""

Walz worked as a teacher and football coach and rose to the rank of command sergeant major over 24 years in the U.S. Army National Guard. (Walz retired as a master sergeant, one rank below command sergeant major, for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.)

He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives by ousting a Republican incumbent in a heavily rural district in 2006. Walz was elected governor in 2018 and was reelected in 2022.

""He’s a smart choice if they deploy him in two specific ways,"" said Blois Olson, a political analyst for WCCO radio in Minneapolis-St. Paul. ""Send him to rural areas to counter the polarization and the idea that only Republicans can win there. And have him keep the deep left base satisfied, which could be an issue with a very moody voting bloc.""

Olson said Walz’s rural experience and regular-guy vibes might be able to shave 2 to 4 percentage points off GOP electoral performance in rural Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — three states considered crucial to a Democratic victory in November.

""The most recent Survey USA poll taken last month for KSTP-TV had Walz’ job approval at a healthy 56%,"" said Steve Schier, a political scientist at Carleton College in Minnesota. ""That said, Minnesota is quite a polarized state, and Republicans in the state despise him. He initially campaigned as a moderate in 2018 but has governed as a progressive.""

Walz was one of several potential vice presidential options floated since President Joe Biden announced he’d cede the nomination and endorsed Harris. Other frequently cited names were Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.

Now that he is Harris’ running mate, we are on the lookout for claims by and about Walz to fact-check — just as we are for Harris and former President Donald Trump and his vice presidential pick, Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio. Readers can email us suggestions to [email protected].

Republicans have already begun to question Walz’s handling of the rioting following the murder of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody. Walz clashed with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey over how to handle the unrest, but he sent the Minnesota National Guard to aid local law enforcement.

Who is Tim Walz?

Walz grew up in Nebraska but moved with his wife, Gwen to Minnesota in 1996 to teach high school geography and coach football; his teams won two state championships.

He was 42 when he ran for Congress, a decision sparked by a 2004 incident at an appearance by President George W. Bush. ""Walz took two students to the event, where Bush campaign staffers demanded to know whether he supported the president and barred the students from entering after discovering one had a sticker for Democratic candidate John Kerry,"" according to the Almanac of American Politics. ""Walz suggested it might be bad PR for the Bush campaign to bar an Army veteran, and he and the students were allowed in. Walz said the experience sparked his interest in politics, first as a volunteer for the Kerry campaign and then as a congressional candidate.""

Walz’s ideological profile is nuanced. The other highest-profile finalist for Harris’ running mate, Shapiro, was pegged as somewhat more moderate and bipartisan than Walz. An Emerson College poll released in July found Shapiro with 49% approval overall in his state, including a strong 46% approval from independents and 22% from Republicans.

When he was elected to Congress, Walz represented a district that had sent Republicans to Washington for 102 of the previous 114 years, according to the Almanac of American Politics. Representing that constituency, Walz was able to win the National Rifle Association’s endorsement and he voted for the Keystone XL pipeline — two positions that have become highly unusual in today’s Democratic Party.

During his first gubernatorial term, Walz worked with legislative Republicans, which produced some bipartisan achievements, including $275 million for roads and bridges, additional funds for opioid treatment and prevention, and a middle-income tax cut.

In 2022, Walz won a second term by a 52% to 45% margin. Democrats also flipped the state Senate, providing him with unified Democratic control in the Legislature. This enabled Walz to enact a progressive wish list of policies, including classifying abortion as a ""fundamental right,"" a requirement that utilities produce carbon-free energy by 2040, paid family leave and legalizing recreational marijuana. He also signed an executive order safeguarding access to gender-affirming health care for transgender residents.

After Harris’ announcement, the Trump campaign attacked Walz’s legislative record in a campaign email: ""Kamala Harris just doubled-down on her radical vision for America by tapping another left-wing extremist as her VP nominee.""

Olson noted that Walz ""only has one veto in six years. He doesn’t say ‘no’ to the left, after being a moderate. That’s a reason he’s now beloved by the left.""

Democrats have controlled the Minnesota state Legislature’s lower chamber during Walz’ entire tenure. However, Republicans controlled the state Senate for his first four years in office.

Walz’s meteoric three-week rise on the national scene began after calling Trump, Vance and other Republicans in their circle ""weird.""

In a July 23 interview on MSNBC, Walz predicted that Harris would win older, white voters because she was talking about substance, including schools, jobs and environmental policy.

""These are weird people on the other side,"" Walz said. ""They want to take books away. They want to be in your exam room. That's what it comes down to. And don't, you know, get sugarcoating this. These are weird ideas.""

Days later on MSNBC, Walz reiterated the point: ""You know there's something wrong with people when they talk about freedom. Freedom to be in your bedroom. Freedom to be in your exam room. Freedom to tell your kids what they can read. That stuff is weird. They come across weird. They seem obsessed with this.""

Other Democrats, including the Harris campaign, amplified the ""weird"" message, quickly making Walz a star in online Democratic circles.

Walz also attracted notice for being a self-styled fix-it guy who has helped pull a car out of a ditch and given advice about how to save money on car repairs. He staged a bill signing for free breakfast and lunch for students surrounded by cheering children.

Schier said he expects Walz to be a compatible ticket-mate who won’t upstage the presidential nominee. ""Walz will be a loyal companion to Harris,"" Schier said.

One thing Walz does not bring to the table is a critical state for the Democratic ticket. In 2024, election analysts universally rate Minnesota as leaning or likely Democratic. By contrast, Shapiro’s state of Pennsylvania is not only one of a handful of battleground states but also the one with the biggest haul of electoral votes, at 19. Another finalist, Kelly, represents another battleground state with nine electoral votes, Arizona.

Fact-checking Walz

We have not put Walz on our Truth-O-Meter. However, days after Floyd’s murder, we wrote a story about how a false claim about out-of-state protestors was spread by Minnesota officials, including Walz, and then national politicians, including Trump.

At a May 2020 news conference, Walz said he understood that the catalyst for the protests was ""Minnesotans’ inability to deal with inequalities, inequities and quite honestly the racism that has persisted."" But there was an issue with ""everybody from everywhere else.""

""We're going to start releasing who some of these people are, and they'll be able to start tracing that history of where they're at, and what they're doing on the ‘dark web’ and how they're organizing,"" Walz said. ""I think our best estimate right now that I heard is about 20% that are Minnesotans and about 80% are outside.""

The statistic soon fell apart.

Within hours, local TV station KARE reported that Minneapolis-based police tallies of those arrested for rioting, unlawful assembly, and burglary-related crimes from May 29 to May 30 showed that 86% of those arrested listed Minnesota as their address. Twelve out of 18 people arrested in St. Paul were from Minnesota.

Confronted with these numbers, the officials walked back their comments that evening or did not repeat them. In a news conference, Walz did not repeat his earlier 80% assertion. KARE-TV wrote that Walz said the estimate was based in part on law enforcement intelligence information and that the state would monitor developments.

Fact-checking the VP reveal rally

At the Aug. 6 rally in Philadelphia, Harris and Walz appeared together for the first time as running mates offering an initial glimpse of how he, in particular, might message on the trail.

Often, he repeated claims Harris and Democratic surrogates have made during the campaign season.

For example, Walz said ""violent crime was up under Donald Trump."" It did rise in Trump's final year, 2020. However, the pandemic and the protests after George Floyd's murder, which happened in Walz’s home state, drove the spike, making it hard to assign blame to Trump’s policies. We rated a similar claim Half True.



Walz also said Trump will ""gut Social Security."" Despite some past comments expressing openness to cutting benefits or raising the retirement age, Trump has said consistently in the current election cycle that he won't do that. We previously rated a more measured claim by Harris Mostly False.

Finally, Walz challenged his opposite number, GOP vice presidential candidate Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, to ""get off his couch"" and show up for a debate. Walz’s use of the word ""couch"" harks back to a fake social media claim about Vance that has received wide circulation. We gave Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker a Pants on Fire for repeating the rumor.

UPDATE, Aug. 6, 8:00 p.m.: This article has been updated to include fact-checks of the Harris-Walz launch rally in Philadelphia.

"Tim Walz may be the next US VP. To those he taught, he's a great teacher.",https://time.com/7008637/tim-walz-china-history-visits-relationship-positions-trade-human-rights/,"China clearly holds a special place in Tim Walz’s heart: The Minnesota governor and Democratic vice presidential candidate speaks some Chinese. He’s traveled there some 30 times, including for his honeymoon. And he’s often spoken about the country and worked on legislation related to it.

But since he was announced as Kamala Harris’ running mate on Tuesday, Walz’s China ties have come under scrutiny from critics who have painted him as sympathetic to Beijing as politicians on both sides of the aisle in Washington seemingly compete to appear tougher on the U.S.’s biggest geopolitical rival.

Read More: Where Tim Walz Stands on the Issues

Make America Great Again Inc., a PAC supporting the Republican ticket of former President Donald Trump and his running mate Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, posted on social media a video clip of Walz saying “I don’t fall into the category that China necessarily needs to be an adversarial relationship, I totally disagree.”

“Tim Walz doesn’t see China as a problem,” James Hutton, a former Assistant Secretary at the Department of Veterans Affairs during the Trump administration, posted on X. “Communist China is very happy with @GovTimWalz as Kamala’s VP pick,” posted Richard Grenell, former U.S. ambassador to Germany and acting Director of National Intelligence during the Trump administration. “No one is more pro-China than Marxist Walz.”

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) posted: “Tim Walz owes the American people an explanation about his unusual, 35-year relationship with Communist China.”

Others, however, see Walz’s experience with China less as a liability and more as an asset. “So he knows a lot about it. That’s great,” former CIA and NSA director Michael Hayden, who worked under Democratic and Republican administrations, posted in response to observations about Walz’s history with China.

Taiwan-based political science professor Lev Nachman also characterized Walz’s experience with China as positive, posting that it “means he is likely to approach U.S.-[China] relations with a much more nuanced point of view, one that humanizes Chinese people and does not equate them to their government.”

That aligns with how Walz himself has described his stance on the country for which he has been consistently critical on a number of issues, particularly human rights, while also expressing hope and optimism about its people and their potential. “If someone tells you they’re an expert on China they’re probably not telling you the truth because it’s a complex country, but it’s critically important for us,” Walz said in the same 2016 interview that the Trump-supporting PAC excerpted. “I think we need to stand firm on what they’re doing in the South China Sea,” he said, referencing one of the many fronts of the U.S.-China rivalry, “but there’s many areas of cooperation that we can work on.”

While reports in Chinese state media noted Walz’s frequent visits to China and past advocacy for “fostering cultural exchanges,” there were no mentions of his human rights-related criticisms. And on Chinese social media, reaction has been mixed. “If Tim Walz didn’t have this connection with China, Harris might be tougher on China,” Qiu Zhenhai, political commentator and founder of the Hong Kong-based think tank Center for Globalization Hong Kong, said in a post on Weibo, adding that Walz’s dynamic with Harris would need further observation. Another user cautioned: “Isn’t it too naive to think that, just because he taught in China and had his honeymoon there, he would be dovish towards China?”

Here’s what to know about Walz’s history with—and stances on—China.

Visiting China

Walz’s first international flight was to China. As a fresh college graduate in 1989, “as a part of the first government sanctioned groups of American educators to teach in China through a program at Harvard University,” according to his congressional biography, Walz traveled to Guangdong province, where he taught at a local high school. It was the same year that the Tiananmen Square massacre saw the Chinese government brutally crack down on pro-democracy protesters.

“I remember waking up and seeing the news on June 4 that the unthinkable had happened,” he told reporters in 2014 at a White House event commemorating the Tiananmen Square massacre, adding that the event prompted many of his American teaching colleagues to leave China. “I felt it was more important than ever to go, to make sure that story was told, and to let Chinese people know we were standing there, we were with them.”

“China was coming, and that’s the reason that I went,” Walz explained to the Hill in 2007 of his decision to spend the year in a country that was just starting to open up. He said his Chinese students gave him the nickname “Fields of China” in reference to the vastness of his kindness. (They also called him “big-nosed one” and “foreign devil,” which he said were not meant as insults.)

When Walz returned to the U.S. in 1990, he told a local Nebraskan newspaper that the Chinese he met “are such kind, generous, capable people” and that they simply lacked “proper leadership.”

The Tiananmen Square massacre clearly resonated with Walz, who got married to Minnesotan fellow teacher Gwen Whipple on its fifth anniversary in 1994. “He wanted to have a date he’ll always remember,” Gwen told the Scottsbluff Star-Herald before their wedding. Together, the couple had founded Educational Travel Adventures, a company that organized annual summer excursions to China for American high school students from 1994 until 2003. (Their honeymoon doubled as one such excursion with dozens of students.)

Walz’s frequent trips to China have fueled unfounded speculation that he was a spy or nefariously linked to the Chinese state—a claim that was amplified in a Fox News segment by host Jesse Watters on Tuesday: “I’m sure he paid for all those trips himself on a teacher’s salary,” Watters said facetiously. “Walz spent his honeymoon in China. He’s being groomed by the Chinese,” Watters asserted. “Now, if I was the FBI, I’d do a background check just to be safe.”

Criticizing China’s record on human rights

While Walz has spoken fondly of his time in China, during his political career, which began with a run for Congress in 2006, he has both publicly condemned China’s human rights record and backed House resolutions expressing concern on issues from political persecutions to alleged organ harvesting in China.

From 2007 to 2018, Walz served on the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), which monitors legal and human rights developments in China. Due to his years of work on China issues—and his teaching stint in Guangdong—Walz was once described as a “stalwart” on the commission by then-chairman Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio).

Walz has consistently supported political freedom in China, including cosponsoring a 2009 resolution recognizing the Tiananmen Square massacre’s 20th anniversary as well as another resolution supporting human rights activists Huang Qi and Tan Zuoren, who were jailed by authorities after investigating the collapse of school buildings in the devastating 2008 Sichuan earthquake.

As international concern grew around Chen Guangcheng, a blind lawyer and activist who was detained after he exposed abuses by local officials, Walz testified at a CECC hearing in 2011: “I applaud the accomplishments of the Chinese people and recognize that some in the Chinese government advocate for greater rule of law. But, we cannot believe China is serious about the rule of law while Chen Guangcheng and his family are being forcefully held and abused.”

“We cannot believe China is serious about human rights while it flagrantly violates its own laws and its international human rights commitments,” he emphasized.

Walz also called for the release of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, and, after Liu died a political prisoner in 2017, Walz cosponsored a resolution to honor Liu’s legacy.

In 2015, Walz co-sponsored a resolution expressing concern about reports of Chinese state-sanctioned organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience—an issue that remains of concern to the CECC and Congress.

“I think the idea was, with a free-market economy, we would see a more opening of the Chinese grip on social life and on human rights,” Walz said at a 2016 congressional hearing on human rights in China. “That simply has not occurred.”

More recently, he’s also criticized China for not opposing Russia’s war in Ukraine. “We need to cooperate with China on issues such as climate change and agricultural production,” he told Japanese news outlet Nikkei in an interview last year, “but I’m disappointed with China’s recent performance—on the Ukraine issue, they are on Russia’s side.”

Touching China’s touchy topics: Tibet, Hong Kong, and Taiwan

As a teacher, Walz has made understanding totalitarianism an important part of his studies and lessons. He earned a Master of Science degree in educational leadership from Minnesota State University, Mankato, in 2001, according to Politico. His thesis, according to Jewish Telegraphic Agency, was about genocide. And in a 2008 New York Times article, his former students described how he encouraged them to analyze the factors that can lead countries toward ethnic cleansing, something China faces accusations of today when it comes to minority communities, including Tibetans.

Since he was a lawmaker, Walz has been vocal about his support for Tibetan autonomy—a movement led by the Dalai Lama, the exiled leader whom Chinese authorities have long accused of inciting separatism and unrest in the Himalayan autonomous region of Tibet.

#tbt to 2 years ago, a life-changing lunch with @DalaiLama. We talked about humility, patience, and compassion. I try to embody these values every day in my work. pic.twitter.com/UnaEyy0GOI — Tim Walz (@Tim_Walz) March 15, 2018

Besides meeting with the Dalai Lama, which Walz once described as “life-changing,” Walz has called attention to Tibetan political prisoners held by Chinese authorities, and in 2016, he welcomed Lobsang Sangay, Prime Minister of Tibet’s government-in-exile, to his congressional office for a meeting with Minnesota high school students.

Walz was also part of a 2015 congressional delegation that visited Tibet, where he described being “in the deepest enclaves of Chinese government with some of their highest level officials having a debate about the Dalai Lama.”

Walz has long maintained the importance of “dialogue” and described the one he had then as “healthy” and “one that absolutely has to happen” during a press conference after the visit.

“This relationship [with China] is too critically important; it’s too critically important on trade; it’s too critically important on climate change; it’s too critically important on national security, issues of containment of terrorism and everything else that’s involved.”

Throughout his political career, Walz has also expressed support for the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong and its proponents.

In 2016—in the wake of Hong Kong’s Umbrella Revolution but before the widespread pro-democracy protests that swept the city in 2019—Walz warned fellow lawmakers during a congressional hearing that “Hong Kong and the basic rule of law that was drawn out is under assault.”

In 2017, Walz posted on X a photo with prominent then-student activist Joshua Wong, who has been repeatedly imprisoned in Hong Kong over a slew of cases related to his activism. “Political prosecutions can’t silence the spirit of self-determination,” Walz said, extending his support to Wong. In another post, he called Wong “a true champion for democracy in China.”

Jeffrey Ngo, an activist-historian who is a senior policy and research fellow with the Washington-based Hong Kong Democracy Council, said in a post on X on Tuesday that Walz had been instrumental in keeping the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act afloat before it was passed by Congress in 2019. “We knocked on every door when the [bill] lacked momentum. Only Walz answered his: At its absolute lowest point in 2017–18, he was the sole House Democrat willing to keep co-sponsoring the bill—seemingly a fruitless endeavor—with [New Jersey Republican Rep. Christopher] Smith,” Ngo recounted.

While Walz has not explicitly expressed a position on the politics of Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing asserts sovereignty over and that the Biden administration has vowed to defend in the case of an invasion, Minnesota has maintained good relations with Taipei throughout his governorship.

In 2021, when a train-truck collision in Hualien county left dozens dead, Walz reached out to the Taiwan Economic and Cultural Organization, the island’s de facto embassy, to express his condolences. He also met with members of Taiwan’s agriculture industry in 2022 to boost the trade partnership with Minnesota.

Focusing on trade and the South China Sea

In a 2016 interview with Agri-Pulse, a Washington-based agriculture news site, then-Rep. Walz said that the U.S. should care about and stand firmly against China’s actions in the South China Sea—the hotly-contested waterway that China claims virtually all of and has engaged in increasingly hostile confrontations with U.S. allies over.

“It is our business what happens in the South China Sea because freedom of navigation to move our crops and to move our products is critically important to our economy as well as our national security,” Walz said at the time.

That same year, Walz co-sponsored the POSTURE Act opposing military personnel cuts, arguing that the number of U.S. troops should be maintained to deter security challenges including Russia, Islamist extremism, and China’s island expansion in the South China Sea. “Those adversaries who think that this is the time to do something with this Nation need to be sent a strong message that we are as strong as ever,” he said during a House session, urging support for the bill.

Trade has long been a key area of focus for Walz, who has supported maintaining, with regulations, a healthy U.S.-China commerce relationship. Even before he became a politician, when he was a sixth-grade social studies teacher in Nebraska, Walz explained to his students who he helped exchange letters with children in China, according to a 1991 local news article, why their governments were at odds: an unfair trade balance. “The Chinese government wants us to buy what they sell, but won’t buy what we sell,” he said.

As a member of the CECC, Walz participated in discussions of issues like China’s compliance with international trade rules and how that relates to U.S. interests. Describing the work of the CECC, Walz said in 2016 that the group’s focus was that “we’ll trade with China but they have to play by the rules, both from an environmental, from a fair trade, and also from a human rights perspective.”

And in 2019, as governor of Minnesota, he publicly urged then-President Trump to end the trade war with China, arguing that it was “hindering our economy’s growth and weakening our country’s prosperity.” Minnesota’s agricultural sector had been hit hard by a slump in exports to China of commodities like soy beans and pork.

“There’s just no substitute for 1.6 billion consumers, who are hungry to get our China trade negotiations normalized,” he later told reporters after a trip to Japan, where he said that the slack left by falling Chinese demand was too much for Minnesota’s other trade partners to pick up. “There's not enough market in the rest of the world to absorb our capacity.”

“This is a guy who has proposed shipping more manufacturing jobs to China,” Vance said Tuesday, reacting to Harris’ selection of Walz as her running mate. Vance has argued that Walz’s progressive energy policies and ambitious climate goals will send manufacturing jobs to China.

Walz, for his part, has tried to link his climate efforts to domestic job creation, telling TIME last year that “the surest way to get people to buy in is to create a job that pays well in their community.”

In the same 1991 newspaper detailing Walz’s pen pal program, Walz explained his philosophy on distinguishing between other nations’ policies and people, and the importance of interacting on a person-to-person level—an approach that U.S.-China diplomacy experts largely support. “That’s the reason we study geography and history, to learn about other people. Geography and history are not just about wars, dead people and old buildings,” Walz said. “The best way to study about people is to hear them tell what it is like where they live.”"
"Tim Walz may be the next US VP.

Tim Walz as her running mate, looking to strengthen the Democratic ticket in Midwestern states.

She introduced Walz at a rally Tuesday evening in Philadelphia.

Harris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a deadline last week. She officially claimed the nomination Monday night when the DNC released final results.

Vance goes after Harris

Ohio Sen. JD Vance is arguing again that Vice President Kamala Harris caved to the far left by not picking Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as her running mate.

Vance appeared Tuesday night on Fox News’ “Hannity,” hours after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz took the stage for the first time with Harris as the Democratic ticket.

Vance and other Republicans have suggested that Shapiro, who is Jewish, wasn’t chosen due to antisemitism. Some liberal activists criticized Shapiro for his backing of Israel during its war in Gaza following Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack.

Vance also criticized Harris for not holding a recent press conference or taking questions from reporters.

Rural Americans organize for Harris-Walz

A line-up of federal, state and local elected officials, plus a few celebrities, joined a call to rally rural Americans for the Harris-Walz campaign — but one expected headliner was notably missing.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz was advertised as a featured guest on the call, but Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan kicked things off, saying she was “pinch hitting” for the newly named vice presidential candidate.

Flanagan, who herself would make history as the first Native woman to be Minnesota’s governor if Harris and Walz were to win in November, touted Walz’s progressive accomplishments and good nature.

Walz wraps his remarks

Saying “God bless America,” Walz pivoted amid the applause to wrap his arms around Harris in a bear hug.

The two clasped hands as Harris grinned and, with her other hand, pointed at Walz to the cheering audience.

Their spouses joined them on stage for waves and applause before the new Democratic ticket stepped off the stage and to the edge of the crowd for photographs and handshakes with voters in the Temple University auditorium.

Walz once again labels Vance, his now VP competition, as ‘weird’

Walz is reprising the “weird” phraseology to describe Republicans that has become a hallmark of his stump appearances and garnered the governor plaudits from younger Americans.

Taking swipes at Vance, Walz said his GOP rival and Trump “are creepy and yes, they’re weird as hell.”

“I can’t wait to debate the guy,” Walz added.

Stumping earlier today in Pennsylvania, Vance said, “I absolutely want to debate Tim Walz,” but not until after the Democratic convention.

He rouses the crowd with a smile on his face

Walz, the former Army sergeant and football coach, is speaking in an old-school, rousing, populist style.

In a feisty tone, dropping “damn well” and “come on” into his remarks, with a Midwestern dialect, Walz is delivering a strong indictment of Trump with a bit of laughter.

“Say it with me! We are not going back,” he belted, starting a chant from the audience.

“We’ve got 91 days. My god, that’s easy,” he said. “We’ll sleep when we’re dead.”

Walz shares his family’s personal history with IVF

Walz has made a personal connection with one of the marquee issues in this year’s election: in vitro fertilization.

Walz said talking about IVF “gets personal for me and my family.”

“It wasn’t by chance that, when we welcomed our daughter into the world, we named her Hope,” he told the crowd.

Abortion opponents have been increasingly pushing for broader measures that would give rights and protections to embryos and fetuses, which could have massive implications for fertility treatments and other areas of health care.

Democrats routinely cite IVF concerns as part of a larger problem where women in some states are getting worse medical care since the fall of Roe vs. Wade, linking delayed IVF care to cases in states with abortion restrictions, where women must wait until they are very sick in order to get care.

He may be Minnesota’s governor, but he’s still a Nebraska native

Walz sometimes talks about his native state of Nebraska more than the one he leads. He spoke about West Point, Nebraska, the “small town of 400” where he was born, and where he spent “the summers working on the family farm.”

“My mom and dad taught us to show generosity towards our neighbors and work for a common good,” he added.

Walz takes the stage

Walz began his remarks by thanking Harris for selecting him. The campaigner known as being upbeat said, “Thank you for bringing back the joy!”

Following a shoutout to Gov. Josh Shapiro, Walz praised his wife, a 29-year public school teacher, wryly plugging a key constituency, “Don’t ever underestimate teachers.”

Different backgrounds

Harris noted her and Walz’s different backgrounds: She’s from Oakland and he’s from Nebraska, but they have common ideals. “After all, the promise of America is what makes it possible for two middle-class kids,” Harris said, “to make it all the way to the White House.”

“Coach Walz and I may come from different corners of our country,” she said, “but we believe in picking people up not knocking them down.”

And without naming Vance, Harris argued for the superiority of her running mate’s experience over his GOP rival, using a sports analogy as the former football coach stood by. Saying Walz would be “ready on day one,” Harris characterized the race between her running mate and Vance as “a matchup between the varsity team and the JV squad.”

Harris campaign rakes in over $20 million

Harris’ selection of Walz as her running mate has been another fundraising boon for the Democratic presidential ticket.

Her campaign announced shortly before 6:30 p.m. that it has raised more than $20 million since the vice president unveiled the Minnesota governor as her running mate.

The Harris campaign has seen a surge in fundraising since she took over the top of the ticket, raising more than $310 million in July. Well over $200 million of that total came after Harris took over top billing from President Joe Biden on July 21.

Walz is certified by the DNC

As Walz took the stage with Harris in Philadelphia, his status as Democrat’s No. 2 for the general election was announced as official.

Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison and Minyon Moore, chair of Democrats’ upcoming convention, said in a statement that Harris and Walz had been certified as their party’s nominees.

Late Monday night, Harris officially secured the delegates needed to become her party’s presidential nominee. Hours later, she named Walz as her running mate.

Harris highlights Walz’s political record

Harris ticked through Walz’s record as Minnesota governor, saying he supports her goal of fighting for the middle class.

Walz was the first governor in the country to sign a law enshrining abortion as a right, she said. She noted paid leave for women and voting rights.

But the biggest applause of the list came when Harris noted Walz’s move to provide meals to all public school students.

“He refused to let students go hungry,” she said. “So, he made school breakfast and lunch free for every child.”

Harris also pointed out that her new running mate “is a hunter and a gun owner too,” then immediately noting that as governor Walz “expanded background checks and increased penalties for illegal firearm sales.”

Harris highlights Walz’s teaching credentials

“Under those Friday night lights Coach Walz motivated his players,” Harris said referring to his time as high school football coach, “Going from a winless record to the school’s first-ever state championship.”

She went on to note how as football coach he helped start the school’s gay-straight alliance “because he’s the kind of person who makes them feel like they belong,” she said.

“That’s the kind of vice president he’s going to be and that’s the kind of vice president America deserves.”

Sergeant major, congressman, coach

Harris introduced Walz as “more than a governor” by running through the titles he’s held over the years.

Beyond that of husband and father, Harris said he was “Sergeant Major Walz” to his fellow veterans, “Congressman” to voters of southern Minnesota, “Mr. Walz” to the high school students he used to teach and “Coach” to the football players he coached.

“And in 91 days, the nation will know Coach Walz by another name: vice president of the United States,” Harris said to cheers.

Harris frames Walz as the partner she’s been looking for

Harris took the stage in Philadelphia for the first time as the Democratic presidential nominee Tuesday, amid raucous cheers in an auditorium on the campus of Temple University.

But her intro was serious.

“We need to move to the general election and win that,” she said. “We also need to level set. We are the underdogs in this race, but we have the momentum and I know exactly what we’re up against.”

In preparing to hand off to Walz, Harris is building him up as the partner she had been looking for during her quick search for a running mate.

“I set out to find a partner who can help build this brighter future, a leader that will help unite our nation and move us forward,” she said.

“Pennsylvania, I’m here today because I found such a leader, Gov. Tim Walz of the great state of Minnesota.”

Harris and Walz take the stage

Vice President Kamala Harris has made her first appearance with her newly chosen running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

Harris and Walz have taken the stage together at a packed rally in Philadelphia. The pair ignited sustained cheers as they appeared before thousands at Temple University’s Liacouras Center.

Walz, the 60-year-old governor and former U.S. House member from rural south central Minnesota, put his hands together and bowed to the crowd. He stood alongside Harris as she waved to the audience and put her hand over her heart, wrapping the other around Walz.

According to excerpts provided by the campaign, Walz plans to use his speech to say that Minnesota values are American values.

Biden learned about Walz from Harris, not the news

“He heard it first from the vice president,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at her regular briefing. She said she couldn’t “pinpoint” exactly where the president was when Harris called on Tuesday morning, but that he was somewhere in the executive mansion.

“She called him to let him know of her pick,” Jean-Pierre said.

Harris had sought Biden’s advice during her search for a running mate, but Jean-Pierre left it there and declined to get into any specifics.

Biden also spoke with Walz and congratulated him on his selection.

Philadelphia mayor calls for unity among Democrats

Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker, who advocated fiercely but unsuccessfully for her state’s governor, Josh Shapiro, to be Harris’ running mate now says, “Our Democratic nominee has spoken and that’s it. Period. End of story.”

At a rally in her city on Tuesday, Parker urged Pennsylvania Democrats to rally behind Harris’ choice. Noting that Republicans and detractors would attempt to divide Democrats over the pick Parker says that the party can’t let them.

Parker made headlines last week for posting a video praising Harris and Shapiro, which some thought suggested Harris had already picked Shapiro as her running mate. Instead, Harris chose Walz and the pair will appear together for the first time at the Philadelphia rally.

The last politician to face off against Tim Walz has some advice for JD Vance

Dr. Scott Jensen, a physician and former Republican Minnesota state senator, was the last political candidate to run against Walz in a general election but lost by nearly 8 points. Jensen says Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance should be prepared for Walz’s fast-talking debate style. He also thinks Walz’s appeal in rural areas has been overstated.

“Tim Walz can talk around a topic extremely effectively. He will give people the impression that he is the candidate of the common, everyday person,” Jensen said. “But if you look at the results of the 2022 election, Tim Walz really won the election because of the Twin Cities, Duluth and Rochester.”

He also pointed out that in the 2022 governor’s race, Walz lost many of the counties in the district he previously represented in Congress.

“Tim Walz lost the district in which the people who knew him best were offered the opportunity to make a decision about his candidacy,” Jensen said. “I think that’s telling.”

Trump will sit for an interview with Elon Musk

Trump says that he will do an interview with billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk next week. Musk endorsed the Republican for president after Trump survived an assassination attempt.

“ON MONDAY NIGHT I’LL BE DOING A MAJOR INTERVIEW WITH ELON MUSK — Details to follow!” Trump posted on his social media network.

His campaign did not immediately have more details to share.

Trump, a longtime opponent of electric cars, said over the weekend at his rally in Atlanta that he favors electric cars “for a small slice” of the population, saying, “I have to be, you know, because Elon endorsed me very strongly.” He added: “So I have no choice.”

Expect Walz to extol Harris during his first running mate appearance

Ahead of a rally in Philadelphia, the Harris campaign has released experts of Walz’s prepared remarks where he’ll introduce himself to the nation, highlight his support for Harris and emphasize stopping Trump at the ballot.

Walz will say that the vice president “has fought on the side of the American people” and “brings joy to everything she does.”

“Minnesota’s strength comes from our values — our commitment to working together, to seeing past our differences, to lending a helping hand,” Walz plans to tell the rally. “Donald Trump — he sees the world differently. He doesn’t know the first thing about service — because he’s too busy serving himself.”

The phone call that sealed the deal

Wearing khakis and a camouflage baseball cap, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz accepted a phone call from Vice President Kamala Harris. The Harris campaign has posted a video of the call on social media.

“Hi, this is Tim,” Walz said into his phone.

“It’s Kamala Harris. Good morning, governor,” the Democratic nominee said with a big smile. “Listen, I want you to do this with me. Let’s do this together. Would you be my running mate?”

“I would be honored, madame vice president,” Walz said.

The two exchanged pleasantries over the roughly minute-long video and Harris ended the call with an, “All right, buddy. I’ll see you soon. Take care.”

The campaign said it has raised more than $10 million from “grassroots supporters alone” since Walz became her running mate.

Voter Voices: ‘I was open for whoever she picked’

Marnie Fowler, a 44-year-old Philadelphia who works in concert touring, wore a blue T-shirt she recently purchased online that said: “Childless Cat Lady,” a reference to remarks by GOP vice presidential candidate JD Vance. Farlow said she wanted Walz all along. “He’s America’s dad,” Farlow said. “Everything he’s done in Minnesota aligns with my values.”

Cheryl Pitts, a 77-year-old retired state worker from Sicklerville, New Jersey, said she was “a little bit” disappointed that Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro wasn’t picked, “but it won’t stop us from voting; it didn’t diminish my excitement.” She called Walz “a regular kind of guy that I can believe what he says.”

Bernie Strain, 66, wore a shirt he made himself for the rally that said: “OLD WHITE MEN FOR HARRIS & FREEDOM.” Strain said he’d met Shapiro through politics but was ready to support whoever Harris selected. “I was open for whoever she picked,” he said. “I was going to support them with both feet.”

A Republican strategist actually praising Harris’ VP pick

Mark Campbell is a rare Republican who’s publicly praising Harris’ choice of Walz, calling it “a home run.”

Campbell, a veteran GOP strategist who managed Glenn Youngkin’s winning 2021 Virginia governor’s campaign, ticked through a number of areas he suggests Walz reinforces Harris, first as an authentic surrogate in the northern battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

An enlisted Army veteran, “not officer class,” Walz is “plainspoken, folksy in a way that will play well in the burbs and rural areas,” Cambell said.

He’s “progressive, but not too far from center,” he said, and will align with “Harris on policy 90% of the time.” Campbell called the selection “rock steady.”

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says Walz is a good pick for Harris’ running mate

Beshear said it was “a true honor of a lifetime” to be considered for Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate and that

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz was a good pick.

“He is a great friend,” Beshear told reporters outside his office in the Kentucky Capitol on Tuesday afternoon. “He’d be an amazing vice president. I am 100% onboard with doing everything I can to elect the Harris-Walz ticket this November.”

Beshear declined to comment on the process — when he was interviewed for the job and if he heard from Harris or her team Tuesday morning.

Man who owned rights to HarrisWalz.com says he’s sold the domain; declined to name the buyer

Jeremy Green Eche, the trademark lawyer who purchased HarrisWalz.com for $8.99 in 2020, sold the domain – and a slate of others linked to Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris – on Tuesday for $15,000, he told The Associated Press shortly after the order was made.

Eche declined to say who bought the domains, but said they have “no obvious connection to either campaign or anything political.”

Harris selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate Tuesday.

Eche bought the rights to the site and others in 2020 when the would-be vice president was in the midst of a primary campaign for president. When he learned Walz was the pick, Eche was particularly excited, both because the Harris supporter liked Walz best out of the men the vice president was considering, and because it meant someone paying his $15,000 asking price was more likely.

Now that the site was sold, however, Eche says he feels glad but odd.

“I feel strange,” he said, “like it happened too soon.”

The domains were sold on the website for Eche’s start-up, Communer, a forum that allows people to buy and sell domains and trademarks online. Eche said the website will now draw up a domain transfer contract between himself and the buyer.

Group founded by Republican women opposed to Trump support Walz

A group founded in June by current and former Republican women who oppose Donald Trump for president came out in favor of Walz as Harris’ pick, in part for Walz’s fiscal measures and policy accomplishments aimed at women.

“As Governor, he’s cut taxes for the middle class while balancing the budget, supported paid family leave so new mothers can be home to care for their children, expanded access to pre-kindergarten, and make sure that no Minnesotan child goes hungry at school,” a release from Women4U.S. states.

The group is a federal superPAC whose honorary advisers include former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, former New Hampshire Republican Chair Jennifer Horn and founding editor of The Weekly Standard, Bill Kristol.

Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi welcomes Walz to the race

Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi welcomed the Minnesotan to what she called the Harris-Walz “freedom ticket.”

“In the Congress, I saw firsthand Tim Walz’s leadership, collaborative spirit and effectiveness in bringing people together and getting the job done,” Pelosi said in a statement.

The former Democratic House speaker was pivotal in reshaping the presidential race as President Joe Biden stepped aside and she said the field of potential VP candidates “demonstrated the strength and vitality of the next generation of Democratic leadership.”

Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin: ‘We’re thrilled to see a fellow Midwesterner at the top of the ticket’

It didn’t take Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin long to seize on Harris’ selection of Walz as a fundraising tool for her competitive reelection campaign.

“We’re thrilled to see a fellow Midwesterner at the top of the ticket,” Baldwin said in a fundraising email sent late Tuesday morning.

Baldwin, seeking a third term, is among several incumbent Democratic senators seeking reelection in states viewed as pivotal to the presidential campaign, and where an uptick in enthusiasm since Harris’ takeover of Joe Biden’s campaign has lifted the party’s hope of holding the seat.

Baldwin spoke at Harris’ first campaign stop as a candidate last month, an upbeat rally in suburban Milwaukee.

“Wisconsin has emerged as the tipping point state that will determine who wins the White House and which party controls the Senate,” Baldwin’s email said.

Biden carried Wisconsin in 2020 by fewer than 21,000 votes.

Voto Latino co-founder says Walz as running mate will help energize Latino voters

Voto Latino co-founder and President Maria Teresa Kumar said Walz’s selection to the ticket would help energize Latino voters who want a more inclusive democracy.

Kumar said in a statement that Walz’s “strong record of defending democracy, protecting voting rights, and standing up for working families in Minnesota aligns perfectly with the values our organization and the Latino community hold dear.”

She added that she knows the vice president and governor personally and knows they’ll represent a powerful voice for “progress, equality and opportunity for Latino communities and all Americans.”

Sen. Mark Kelly urges supporters to contribute to the Harris-Walz ticket

Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly said he and his wife, former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, will do everything they can to elect Harris and Walz after Kelly was passed over for the Democratic ticket.

Kelly sent an email to supporters urging them to contribute to the Harris-Walz ticket.

“Tim has years of experience representing Minnesota both in the House of Representatives, where he served with Gabby, and as Minnesota’s governor,” Kelly wrote. “In that time, he has shown up time and time again for working families and I know he’ll continue that work in the White House.”

Meanwhile, the head of GIFFORDS, a gun-control advocacy group founded by Kelly and Giffords, called Walz “a strong gun safety champion.”

“Gun violence is a top concern for Americans this election cycle and we know the Harris-Walz ticket is the only one that will stand up to the gun lobby and save lives,” said GIFFORDS Executive Director Emma Brown, who managed Kelly’s 2022 Senate campaign and was his deputy campaign manager when in his first race two years earlier 2020.

Vance blames Harris’ policies for drug addiction deaths

Vance is aiming to tie what he portrays as Harris’ failures along the U.S.-Mexico border to deaths from drug addiction.

Vance told several hundred supporters gathered in a South Philadelphia event space that, “thanks to the policies of Kamala Harris, you’ve got children who’ve been orphaned” when their parents die from drugs.

Several Pennsylvanians shared personal stories of how addiction issues have impacted their families.

As he has over several speeches and interviews in recent weeks, Vance told his own story related to drug addition, noting that his mother has been drug-free for a decade but, as a child, he was “desperately hoping and praying, Jesus, please let her wake up from this.”

U.S. government data undercuts the claim that people seeking asylum and other border crossers are responsible for drug trafficking. At a hearing last year, James Mandryck, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection deputy assistant commissioner, said 73% of fentanyl seizures at the border since the previous October were smuggling attempts carried out by U.S. citizens, with the rest being done by Mexican citizens.

Barack and Michelle Obama say Harris ‘has chosen an ideal partner’

“Governor Walz doesn’t just have the experience to be vice president, he has the values and the integrity to make us proud,” the former president and first lady said in a statement.

They said Walz enacted progressive priorities as Minnesota governor including paid family leave, abortion rights and gun safety measures.

“But Tim’s signature is his ability to talk like a human being and treat everyone with decency and respect,” the Obamas said.

Vance says he tried to get Walz on the phone

The Republican told reporters aboard his campaign plane Tuesday that he called Walz earlier in the day but “I left him a voicemail, I didn’t get him.”

It’s not clear if there will be a debate between Vance and Walz. Last week, Trump said he wouldn’t take part in an ABC News debate that had been on the books for September because he made that agreement with Biden before the president exited the campaign.

Instead, Trump said he would debate Harris on Sept. 4 on Fox News, but the vice president hasn’t agreed to that time or network yet.

President Joe Biden calls Harris-Walz ticket ‘a powerful voice for working people’ and middle class

Biden called on Democrats and all Americans to rally behind them.

“They will be the strongest defenders of our personal freedoms and our democracy,” Biden said in a social media post. “And they will ensure that America continues to lead the world and play its role as the indispensable nation.”

Biden said choosing a running mate is a party nominee’s first major decision and praised Harris’ choice. He said he’s known Walz for nearly two decades, praising his background as a teacher, football coach and National Guard soldier.

“Every generation of Americans faces a moment where they are asked to defend American democracy,” Biden said. “That moment is now.”

White House Senior Deputy Press Secretary Emilie Simons says Biden and Harris spoke on the phone Tuesday morning ahead of the official announcement that she selected Walz and that Biden spoke with Walz to congratulate him.

Vance says Walz pick as running mate ‘highlights how radical’ Harris is

In his first public comments since his general election foe was set, JD Vance on Tuesday called Walz a choice that “highlights how radical Kamala Harris is.”

In a gaggle with reporters aboard his campaign plane upon landing in Philadelphia, Vance said Walz “is a person who listens to the Hamas wing” of the Democratic Party and “who wants to make the American people more reliant on garbage energy instead of good American energy.”

Vance is speaking more to reporters in Philadelphia on Tuesday ahead of campaign events across Midwestern battleground states on Wednesday, in a path that somewhat mirrors Harris and Walz’s planned trajectory.

Former colleagues on Capitol Hill appear thrilled with Walz as the VP pick

“Great choice,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.

“Having served for years with Tim in the House of Representatives, I can say without reservation: there’s no better person Vice President Harris could have picked to run and then govern alongside her,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md.

Walz “has always put our country first,” Van Hollen said, and he’s excited to campaign for the Harris-Walz ticket for “a brighter future for all Americans.”

Rep. Mark Takano of California recalled how after Walz beat him during an internal House caucus vote to become the top Democrat on the Veterans Affairs Committee, his colleague “immediately brought me into the fold because that’s the type of leader he is: a collaborative bridge builder.”

And Vermont Sen. Peter Welch, who entered Congress with Walz in 2007, said he “has always had this very straightforward, direct, open approach to things.”

Welch described Walz as “one of these guys in the gym who wouldn’t undo his tie” because it would be faster for him to get back to work.

Polling shows the appeal of Tim Walz’s biography

Tim Walz’s biography as a military veteran and former high school teacher – two broadly trusted professions – may also help him appeal to Americans as he campaigns with Vice President Kamala Harris.

About 9 in 10 U.S. adults say they have a favorable opinion of military veterans, generally, according to an Ipsos poll conducted in 2024. About 8 in 10 say that about school teachers. Both measures are much higher than for government employees or elected officials. Republicans are slightly more likely than Democrats to have a positive view of veterans, while Democrats are a bit more likely to have a favorable opinion of those in a teaching career.

Gallup polling from 2022 found that high school teachers are generally held in high regard among Americans for their honesty and ethical standards. About half, 53%, gave them at least a high rating on ethics.

AP VoteCast shows Tim Walz’s electoral strengths and weakness in Minnesota

Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is hoping her VP choice, Tim Walz, will strengthen the Democratic ticket in Midwestern states and among working class voters.

AP VoteCast shows that when Walz was elected Minnesota governor in 2022, he won young voters in the state. He also did well in Minnesota’s union households, winning nearly 6 in 10 voters in that group. About half of Minnesota voters, 52%, had a favorable view of Walz, and about 4 in 10 had a negative one.

And while Walz lost white voters without a college education in the state, he outperformed Democrats nationwide with this group. He also struggled among white men, a demographic Democrats have sought to win back from President Donald Trump, but did a little better among this group than Democrats nationwide.

However, Walz lost among military veteran households in Minnesota in 2022, according to VoteCast.

Tim Walz will need to introduce himself to America

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will need to introduce himself to the vast majority of Americans.

An ABC News/Ipsos survey conducted before Walz was selected as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, but after vetting began, showed that nearly 9 in 10 U.S. adults did not know enough to have an opinion about him. Among Americans with a view, opinions were split between positive and negative: 6% had a favorable view, and 7% had an unfavorable one.

Walz’s lack of a national profile as he joins Harris on the campaign trail extends to his own party. Nearly 9 in 10 Democrats also didn’t know enough to have an opinion of Walz in the ABC News/Ipsos poll. One in 10 had a favorable view of him, and just 4% had a negative opinion. He was an unknown figure among most Democrats across the party: those older and younger were similarly likely to not know Walz, as well as white Democrats and non-white Democrats.

Fellow Minnesotan Sen. Amy Klobuchar says Walz is ‘just unendingly optimistic and joyous’

U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar says Walz is someone who is “just unendingly optimistic and joyous, and that is very, very important right now in our politics.”

The fellow Minnesotan who served with Walz in Congress told The Associated Press “he’s blunt, but he’s also positive” in a way she believes will provide an upbeat message in contrast to the Trump-Vance Republican ticket.

“I always think of him in his plaid shirt because he was always making the point it’s ‘One Minnesota,’” said Klobuchar, a Democrat. “And I think that’s a point you’re going hear him talk about with our nation.”

She said his background as a hunter and someone who fishes “just brings a different perspective to the White House.”

Harris’ running mate pick is good news for man who owns rights to HarrisWalz.com

Jeremy Green Eche was in the middle of getting his toddler dressed the moment news broke that Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris had selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate.

And he was amped.

Eche was uniquely invested in Harris’ pick. He currently owns the rights to HarrisWalz.com, a site he bought in 2020 — along with a slate of other Harris sites — when the would-be vice president was in the midst of a primary campaign for president. Four years and one vice presidential pick later, Eche is willing to sell the slate of Harris websites, including the one featuring Walz, for $15,000.

“I was constantly refreshing four different news sites on my phone,” he told The Associated Press on Tuesday. “I was very excited.” He said he “almost immediately” began getting calls from both journalists and “friends I hadn’t heard from in a while.”

This is not a new scenario for the 36-year-old trademark lawyer in Brooklyn, New York. Eche is a cyber squatter, someone who buys a domain with someone else’s name or brand in it for very little money, hoping to sell it to that person or brand for a large profit in the subsequent months or years. In 2011, when it looked likely that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would be the Democratic nominee in 2016, then Jeremy Peter Green – he took his wife’s last name – purchased ClintonKaine.com.

After the former secretary of state picked Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, the squatter offered it to the campaign for a hefty return. They declined, so he sold it for $15,000 to a digital marketing company that turned out to be the Trump campaign. The website pushed anti-Clinton news with “Paid for by Donald J. Trump for President, Inc” emblazoned at the bottom.

Eche supported Clinton in 2016 and supports Harris today. The prospect of something like that happening again doesn’t give Eche pause, however.

“The Harris campaign has hundreds of millions of dollars, so if they don’t buy their own domain, that is kind of on them,” he said Monday. But he isn’t convinced they will buy the domain.

“I don’t want to be too confident that somebody will reach out,” he said after Walz was selected. “I would say there’s a 75% chance that one of the campaigns, or a PAC, will buy it from me.”

Walz says he’s ‘all in’

In a Tuesday morning post on X, Walz said joining the ticket with Harris is “the honor of a lifetime.”

His profile details on X are now “Running to win this thing with @kamalaharris.”

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro on Walz

Shapiro called Walz “an exceptionally strong addition to the ticket” who’ll help Harris become the 47th president.

Shapiro, who met with Harris on Sunday about the job, said he was grateful to talk about “her vision for the role and the campaign ahead.”

“As I’ve said repeatedly over the past several weeks, the running mate decision was a deeply personal decision for the vice president – and it was also a deeply personal decision for me. Pennsylvanians elected me to a four-year term as their governor, and my work here is far from finished – there is a lot more stuff I want to get done for the good people of this commonwealth,” Shapiro said in a statement.

He said he considers Walz a good friend and pledged to travel the state over the next three months to help Democrats defeat former President Donald Trump “and build a better future for our country.”

“Vice President Kamala Harris has my enthusiastic support – and I know that Governor Tim Walz is an exceptionally strong addition to the ticket who will help Kamala move our country forward,” Shapiro said.

At the Governor’s mansion, a Minnesota resident says why he likes Walz

David Ivory, 46, stood outside the Governor’s mansion with his two children. Ivory found out Walz was selected after his wife texted him “OMG” from work.

He and his kids immediately hopped on their bikes and rode to the Governor’s residence in St. Paul.

Ivory and his family are longtime admirers of Walz for his liberal record and amiable political persona.

“He’s just down to earth. He gets it. He can talk to anybody,” Ivory said. “He doesn’t seem like he’s above anybody. He was a teacher. He understands kids, which is very important.”

Harris says her new running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has ‘delivered for working families’

“It’s great to have him on the team,” Harris said.

Harris posted on X that she was proud to announce she asked Walz to join her on the 2024 ticket.

Voter Coalition Pushes Issue-Based Outreach Strategy to Increase Registration, Shifting from Top of Ticket Politics

State Voices launched a $3 million nationwide campaign Tuesday to encourage voters of color to vote based on the issues that affect their day-to-day lives, like grocery price spikes or growing rent and mortgage payments.

Under the Vote for Something campaign, the coalition aims to register 800,000 voters, make more than 250 million voter contacts, and encourage 100,000 people to make a plan to vote on or ahead of the 2024 election for themselves and others.

They’ve registered more than 400,000 voters so far.

State Voices, like many voting rights advocates, hopes for messaging that transcends the top of the ticket — a looming match between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election.

“Whatever the issue is that matters to you, vote for something. Get out this November and bring a friend and a family member with you,” said Mishara Davis, the group’s director of issue and electoral organizing.

The key has been reaching voters who may be tired of the political space altogether or who are eligible to vote but aren’t registered and therefore may not receive voting information — especially in presidential swing states, Georgia, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, which are primary areas under the campaign.

This comes as Harris, who is in Pennsylvania this week, has chosen Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, sources say. The pair will continue the campaign tour to Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada starting Wednesday.

Environmental group cheers selection of Walz as the Democratic vice presidential candidate

Manish Bapna, president and CEO of the NRDC Action Fund, the political arm of the Natural Resources Defense Council, called Harris and Walz “the winning ticket on climate. The Harris-Walz administration will be ready, on day one, to build on the strongest climate action ever and lead by example in the global fight against the existential challenge of our time.″

Walz has made Minnesota a national climate leader, Bapna said. Under his leadership, the state committed to 100% clean energy by 2040, and Minnesota was the first Midwestern state to adopt California’s strict tailpipe emissions standards. Walz also signed a bill last year directing $240 million to replace lead service water lines statewide.

“The stakes in this election couldn’t be higher nor the choice more clear. Trump would bow to billionaire oil and gas donors, slam climate progress into reverse and leave our kids to pay the price. Harris is a proven climate and justice leader with two decades of public service on the front lines of needed progress and change. She’s shown us what leadership looks like, and she’s earned the chance to lead,” Bapna said.

The National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund praises Walz’s selection

“The National LGBTQ Action Fund expected a strategic and bold choice as a strong addition to the ticket as a Vice-Presidential candidate,” Sayre E. Reece, vice president of the National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund, said Tuesday in a statement. “In Governor Walz we have gotten both.”

Reece continued: “Governor Walz has been a steadfast ally and advocate for the LGBTQ community, including support for trans affirming care, bodily autonomy and reproductive freedom and gun control. As Governor, Walz signed a ban on so-called ‘conversion therapy’ into law, ending the harmful and cruel practice that has cost LGBTQ people their dignity and their lives. Under Walz’s leadership, Minnesota is both a ‘trans sanctuary’ and immigration sanctuary state.”

The National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund describes itself as lobbying for legislation and ballot initiatives that “achieve justice” for LGBTQ people.

At Walz’s residence in Minnesota

A growing crowd of residents and news reporters gathered outside Walz’s residence in St. Paul, Minnesota, on Tuesday morning.

Black and white SUVs periodically pulled into the driveway as onlookers waited to catch a glimpse of Walz leaving the 20-room governor’s mansion near the Mississippi River.

No immediate comment from Vance on Harris picking Walz as her running mate

Boarding his campaign plane Tuesday morning in Cincinnati for a swing through battleground states this week, Ohio Sen. JD Vance did not answer shouted questions about Harris picking Walz as her running mate.

On Tuesday, Vance was heading to Pennsylvania, where Harris planned to debut with her new running mate later in the day.

Trump attacks Walz in a fundraising email

Donald Trump sent a fundraising email calling Walz “Dangerously Liberal” and saying he would “unleash HELL ON EARTH.”

Moments after Harris’ VP pick became public, the former president and Republican nominee said Walz would be the worst vice president in history, claiming the Minnesota governor would “light TRILLIONS of dollars on fire” and open U.S. borders to criminals.

“HE’S THAT BAD,” the email says.

The selection process that led Harris to pick Walz as her running mate

A team of lawyers and political operatives led by former attorney general Eric Holder pored over documents and conducted interviews with potential vice presidential selections.

And Harris herself met with her three finalists on Sunday. She mulled the decision over Monday with top aides at the vice president’s residence in Washington and finalized it Tuesday morning.

Walz emerged as the choice.

A Minnesota Democratic strategist praises Walz’s ability to connect with voters

Minnesota Democratic strategist Abu Amara says Walz will be a good surrogate for Harris across the upper Midwest, because he represented a rural U.S. House district but won statewide in a state with large metropolitan and suburban areas.

“He’s not trying to speak in poetry. He speaks in practicality,” Amara said. “That’s a level of accessibility for so many voters.”

“He has the ability to connect with rural, suburban and urban voters,” he said.

Some Republicans are already reacting to the selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as Harris’ VP pick

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called it the “most left-wing ticket in American history” and accused Walz of not doing enough to protect Minnesota during the 2020 protests over the killing of George Floyd.

He said “Walz sat by and let Minneapolis burn.”

Tropical Storm Debby continues to upend Harris’ travel plans this week

The campaign had already pulled down a planned stop in Savannah, Georgia, because of the weather.

But the Democratic presidential nominee will now no longer travel to Raleigh, North Carolina, either, according to the campaign. She was set to travel to Raleigh on Thursday.

Harris is launching a tour of battleground states on Tuesday evening, starting in Philadelphia.

Harris picks Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as running mate, AP sources say

Vice President Kamala Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday. That’s according to three people who spoke to The Associated Press.

In choosing Walz, she’s turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families. The people were not authorized to speak publicly about the choice and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.

Sources say Harris has decided on a running mate

Vice President Kamala Harris has decided on a running mate and an announcement is expected in the coming hours before the two appear together at a Philadelphia rally, according to three people familiar with her decision.

In recent days, she has zeroed in on a trio of potential finalists: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. It wasn’t clear yet who she picked.

The people were familiar with her plans but spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss a decision that had not been publicly announced.

Harris’ campaign planned to make the announcement via video message before the rally, though the exact timing remained unclear, according to a person involved in the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail discussions occurring behind closed doors.

Harris formally secures the Democratic presidential nomination

Vice President Kamala Harris formally secured the Democratic presidential nomination late Monday — becoming the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket.

Harris’ nomination became official after a five-day round of online balloting by Democratic National Convention delegates ended Monday night, with the party saying in a statement released just before midnight that 99% of delegates casting ballots had done so for Harris. It said it would next formally certify the vote before holding a celebratory roll call at the party’s convention later this month in Chicago.

Harris’ coronation as her party’s standard-bearer caps a tumultuous and frenetic period for Democrats prompted by President Joe Biden’s disastrous June debate performance.

As soon as Biden abruptly ended his candidacy, Harris and her team worked rapidly to secure backing from the 1,976 party delegates needed to clinch the nomination in a formal roll call vote. She reached that marker at warp speed, with an Associated Press survey of delegates nationwide showing she locked down the necessary commitments a mere 32 hours after Biden’s announcement.

"Tim Walz may be the next US VP. To those he taught, he's a great teacher.",https://ca.news.yahoo.com/fellow-teachers-sharing-excitement-over-230037612.html,"Teachers on social media have been sharing their excitement online after Vice President Kamala Harris announced Minnesota Gov. Tim Walzas her running mate on Tuesday morning.

Walz, a veteran of the Army National Guard who represented southern Minnesota in the U.S. House from 2007 to 2019, is a former high school social studies teacher.

Becky Pringle, president of the National Education Association teachers union, said in a statement shortly after the announcement that “educators are fired up and united to get out and elect the Harris-Walz ticket.”

“Gov. Walz is known as the ‘Education Governor’ because he has been an unwavering champion for public school students and educators, and an ally for working families and unions,” she said, adding that the Democratic governor “has a track record of getting things done to make people’s lives better.”

After graduating from Chadron State College in Nebraska in 1989, Walz, a Nebraska native, taught high school in China for a year before returning home.

Walz and his wife, Gwen Walz, both began teaching at Mankato West High School in southern Minnesota in the 1990s. Walz, who’s currently serving his second term as governor, coached the school’s football team and helped the squad win its first state championship in 1999.

While teaching at Mankato West High, Walz served as the first faculty adviser to a newly formed gay-straight alliance group at the school in the mid ’90s.

Walz’s background as an educator has garnered more national attention in recent weeks after it was reported that he was on the short list of vice presidential picks.

Ann Vote, a former student of Walz’s, told The Washington Post in an article published Friday that it was “wild” for her and her classmates to think their former teacher could become the vice president.

“But I don’t get the sense that everyone is completely shocked,” she said. “It’s sort of like, ‘Darn right he’s on that list. Absolutely he should be!’

Supporters have touted his gubernatorial record of increasing funding for public K-12 schools in Minnesota, as well as signing laws providing free school meals to Minnesota students, implementing a paid family and medical leave program and granting free tuition at public colleges for students whose families earn less than $80,000 a year.

Nevada state Assemblywoman Selena Torres, a Democrat and teacher, celebrated Harris’ choice of Walz.

“Teachers are leaders who deliver results everyday,” she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “I couldn’t be any more excited to cheer on [Walz] as our next VP!!!”

“Teachers are going to turn out in record numbers!” another teacher wrote on X. “I am so excited to get back to the environmental science classroom this fall with a sense of optimism for future US policy!”

"Tim Walz may be the next US VP. To those he taught, he's a great teacher.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgewpzyd91o,"Walz has history with China - it's more hawkish than critics claim

Twitter/Tim Walz Walz meeting the Dalai Lama, a bête noire of Beijing, in 2016

Within hours of Tim Walz being declared winner of the Democratic ""veepstakes"", Republican accusations that he is pro-China came thick and fast. ""Communist China is very happy,"" Donald Trump's former ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, said on Twitter/X. ""No one is more pro-China than Marxist Walz."" Tom Cotton, a Republican senator, said Mr Walz owed an explanation ""about his unusual, 35-year relationship with Communist China"". MAGA War Room, an influential X account supporting Donald Trump, unearthed a 2016 video in which Mr Walz told the farming policy outlet Agri-Pulse that the US and China did not need to have an ""adversarial relationship"". But what does the record show? Republicans may want to weaponise Mr Walz's links to China, but it's pretty slim pickings.

Walz's record

Mr Walz's personal relationship with China does indeed extend back decades. It began in 1989 when, fresh out of college, Mr Walz began a Harvard University volunteer programme teaching American history and English at the Foshan No 1 High School in southern China. He later set up a business with his wife Gwen organising annual summer educational trips to China. The venture lasted more than a decade and by his own estimation, Mr Walz returned to the country around 30 times.

Matt Kleber Walz in China

But if anything, Mr Walz has been pretty hawkish towards its government, particularly on human rights. As a congressman, he met the Dalai Lama and – before his jailing – the high-profile Hong Kong democracy activist, Joshua Wong. Both men would place at the top of the Chinese government’s list of public enemies. In terms of his congressional record, there is not much for China to like. He spent over a decade on the Congressional-Executive Commission on China – a body focused on scrutinising the Chinese government’s human rights abuses. In 2016, the same year he met the Dalai Lama, he also invited the then leader of Tibet's government in exile, Lobsang Sangay, into his congressional office to meet a group of Minnesota high-schoolers.

Hong Kong

Mr Walz lent his strong backing to the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which imposed sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials for human rights abuses during the city's democracy protests. Jeffrey Ngo, a democracy activist now based in the US, has praised Mr Walz's commitment to getting the legislation passed in 2019. ""We knocked on every door when the #HKHRDA lacked momentum,"" he wrote on X after Mr Walz was confirmed as the Harris VP choice. ""Only Walz answered his."" Mr Ngo praised Mr Walz as ""the sole House Democrat willing to keep co-sponsoring the bill"". Republican Chris Smith was the bill's other sponsor.

The Chinese reaction

Mr Walz's elevation to the Democratic ticket has prompted interest on Chinese social media. He once described his decision to teach in China as ""one of the best things I've ever done"", and there were signs of hope in some of the comments that, if he wins, it may signal better US-China ties. One Weibo user pointed out that Walz's ""unique background gives him a real perspective on China"", and he could ""promote cultural exchanges when... relations are extremely difficult"". But others wondered whether that may be assuming too much. The fact that his teaching posting took place in 1989 - the year of the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing - was not lost on some. The Chinese cannot say much about the massacre for risk of getting censored. They refer to it obliquely - one comment simply said ""if you know, you know"". Foreigners who were in China at that time ""are the most anti-China"", said another user. Indeed, Mr Walz has often spoken publicly about his horror at the crushing of the Tiananmen protests, and in 2009 he co-sponsored a resolution in Congress marking its 20th anniversary. His wife Gwen has said that the events had such an effect on Walz, that he chose 4 June - the day Beijing sent the troops in - as the date of their wedding five years later. She said that ""he wanted to have a date he'll always remember"".

"Tim Walz may be the next US VP. To those he taught, he's a great teacher.",https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/08/tim-walz-mankato-west-high-school-students-kamala-harris-vice-president.html,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has been on fire lately. Two weeks after his quip that Donald Trump and J.D. Vance are “just weird” went viral, he has been launched onto the national stage as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate. But Walz’s former students at Mankato West High School, where he taught geography for over 10 years, aren’t all that surprised that he has become an overnight sensation.

Hours after Harris officially announced she had selected Walz as her vice president, I called up Noah Hobbs, a former student at Mankato West, who earlier this week wrote a series of posts on X about his old teacher. “I’m just incredibly proud of him and the way … he conducts himself and how he’s maintained being an authentic, genuine, caring human being in positions that seem to not attract that type of person or those qualities in people,” Hobbs told Slate.

Hobbs graduated high school in 2007 but still vividly remembers Mr. Walz (pronounced “Walls,” despite what Vance might say). On the first day of Hobbs’ sophomore year, as he scanned his new class schedule, a friend told him, “Hopefully you got Mr. Walz for global geography. If not, try to change out and get into that class.” Luckily, Hobbs had been placed in Walz’s class, and he credits that for helping him turn his academic career around. He was a “C-ish student” in high school, but Walz cared deeply about making sure Hobbs was successful, not just in global geography but in every one of his classes. “He made learning exciting,” Hobbs said.

Walz brought an infectious energy to his classroom that, as Hobbs put it, stayed with him throughout the rest of the school day, “like a sugar high that you can’t just stop once you leave the classroom doors.” That energy gave him something to look forward to every day and motivated him to continue coming to school: “OK, I’m going to go. I got Walz at 4. That at least will be a fun class. I will learn something. I will feel like I’m contributing to my academic endeavor,” Hobbs said.

That energy wasn’t limited just to academics either: Walz lit up Mankato West by dressing up as Santa Claus. “He would do fun stuff like this all the time—it’s just who he was,” Tara Borowski, who graduated in 1999, told Slate. She remembers Walz as having lots of school spirit and getting involved in every school function, from prom to sports.

Borowski had Walz as her teacher in 1997 and said he was the guy “everybody seemed to trust and wanted to have, no matter where you were, what clique you were in.” Walz would ask his students to bring in newspaper clippings of the latest news stories, an exercise Borowski said opened her eyes to the wider world beyond her hometown. “He was the first person to get me interested in the news that way and to have that dialogue at that age,” she said.

Walz also organized trips to China for his students, leveraging connections he had established while teaching English there in 1989. Kristina Backman, Mankato West class of 1998, went on one of those nearly three-week-long trips, during which they visited the Great Wall, Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City, and Hong Kong. “When we would eat, he would not tell us what we were eating until we tried everything, because he didn’t want us to say, ‘Oh, that sounds gross!’ ” said Backman. “I appreciated that, because if I had known, there was probably no way I ever would have tried it. It was just such a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I would love to be able to take my kids there someday.”

Kent Wawrzynaik, Borowski’s brother, had Walz not only as a teacher but as a football coach and fondly remembered him as his favorite—a “real good leader.” Ten years after graduating from high school, Wawrzynaik ran into Walz at a local Great Clips, where he was getting a haircut. By this point, Walz had stopped teaching and had become a congressman—and to Wawrzynaik’s surprise, Walz still remembered him. “He’s sincere, he’s really easy to talk to and he’s very knowledgeable,” Wawrzynaik said. “He knows what he’s talking about when he talks, and if he doesn’t, he finds out.”

Throughout each of these conversations, it was obvious that Walz’s students had fond memories of their former high school teacher and were excited for the rest of the world to get a taste of the same kindness and charisma they got to experience firsthand. Especially Hobbs, who kept in touch with Walz well beyond his high school years, as he went on to become a councilman for the city of Duluth. Hobbs launched “100 Cups of Coffee,” an initiative to get his city’s constituents to chat with their local officials in an organic way and have their questions answered. Right as Hobbs was closing in on his goal of having 100 conversations, he got a phone call from his old high school geography teacher. “He was my 100th cup. Came up from the city to a local shop in Duluth, and we spent an hour together reminiscing, talking about old Mankato West and the current state of politics,” Hobbs said.

He’s excited for Walz to bring this sensibility to the presidential race. “Everything that he does is a breath of fresh air and is needed,” said Hobbs. “In the political sphere, I think the way that he’s truly an authentic and genuine human being and truly cares about folks that he interacts with is really important.”"

Getty Images At least two people were killed and more than 600 arrested during the protests

Republicans have sharpened their attacks on Minnesota Governor Tim Walz over his response to the mass protests that erupted in his state after the 2020 police murder of George Floyd. Critics of Kamala Harris's running mate have accused him of bungling the response to the violence by being slow to deploy the National Guard. Donald Trump praised his response as president, a recording obtained by ABC shows. At least two people were killed and over 600 arrested during the protests, which caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damages across Minnesota. The governor recently defended his actions, saying that his administration tried to do the best it could in a difficult situation.

Mr Floyd's murder by Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis police officer, sparked days of protests, some of which descended into riots and looting. The unrest quickly overwhelmed local authorities, prompting Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey to request Mr Walz to deploy the National Guard two days after Mr Floyd's death on 25 May in 2020. A separate written request for 600 troops came just hours later from the city's police chief.

An email from the time seen by the BBC - dated the night of 27 May - shows that the police chief said the force had ""expended all available resources"" and gave a detailed breakdown of how the troops would be used, including for area security, transport and help with logistics. But it was not until 28 May - three days into the violence - that Mr Walz signed an executive order activating Minnesota's National Guard, citing ""extensive damage to private property"" and a ""dangerous situation"" for protesters and first responders. While some troops were deployed that night, they were mostly tasked with protecting federal buildings and were unable to prevent riots which saw a local police station set ablaze. ""We were abandoned,"" an unnamed local official told an external review of the state's response prepared for Minnesota's Department of Public Safety in 2022. ""By the time the National Guard even came, mostly everything had quieted down."" A separate report put together by the then-Republican controlled Minnesota Senate in October 2020 said that Mr Walz ""had the ability and duty to use force and law enforcement to stop violence, but he did not"". Criticism of the governor's handling of the protests in the summer of 2020 has re-emerged as an attack line from Republicans following the announcement that Mr Walz would be joining the Harris campaign. At a rally just hours after the news, Republican vice-presidential hopeful JD Vance, questioned whether ""black business owners in Minneapolis are grateful"" that Mr Walz ""allowed rioters to burn down their business"". The BBC has contacted the governor's office for comment. Mr Walz has said the city's mayor did not give him adequate information to provide the soldiers a mission at that time. “Decisions were made in a situation that is what it is,” Mr Walz said at a news conference earlier this month. “And I simply believe that we tried to do the best we can in each of those.”

Watch key moments from first Harris-Walz campaign rally

Tim Walz touted his rural roots and said Donald Trump would take the US ""backwards"" as he appeared for the first time as Kamala Harris’s running mate at a raucous Democratic Party rally. At the event in Philadelphia on Tuesday night, the party’s new nominee for vice-president said their Republican rivals in November's election were ""weird as hell"". The Minnesota governor spoke in front of thousands of supporters just hours after he was announced as Ms Harris’s pick for the role. The Trump campaign, meanwhile, was quick to attack Mr Walz as a ""dangerously liberal extremist"".

The 60-year-old is billed as someone who could win back rural and working-class voters who have gravitated to Donald Trump in crucial midwestern states. At the rally in the key swing state of Pennsylvania, Ms Harris, currently the US vice-president, said she and Mr Walz were the ""underdogs"" in what is expected to be a close election but had the momentum. She introduced her running mate as “a fighter for the middle class, a patriot”. Mr Walz then recounted his small-town roots in Nebraska and his career as a national guardsman and teacher, before attempting to draw a contrast with Trump. ""He doesn’t know the first thing about service - because he's too busy serving himself,"" said the former army sergeant and football coach. He got some of the loudest cheers of the night when he took aim at the former president's criminal record, with chants of “lock him up” from those in the arena.

He also sparked applause when he invoked a viral attack line that caught the eye of the Harris campaign as she considered who would be her running mate. ""These guys are creepy and, yes, just weird as hell,"" Mr Walz said of their Republican challengers. The pair mostly pitched themselves as defenders of individual freedoms, including on abortion rights and safety from gun violence. Mr Walz showed the plain-spoken, folksy style that has won praise from Democrats, as he took a jab at Republicans on the issue of abortion access. “Mind your own damn business!"" he said, drawing an ovation from the crowd of more than 10,000 at Temple University. Ms Harris and Mr Walz have just launched a five-day tour of key battleground states. They will also speak at the Democratic National Convention, which runs from 19 to 22 August in Chicago.

As the current two-term governor of Minnesota, Mr Walz has overseen one of the most productive legislative periods in state history, implementing a sweeping left-wing agenda. Democrats have used control of the state legislature to guarantee abortion rights, pass gun control measures and institute paid family leave. A source close to the Harris VP selection process told CBS News that his list of accomplishments for working families matched what Harris wants to do nationally. But Republicans have criticised Mr Walz for Minnesota's mask mandate and a shutdown of businesses and schools during the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as his delay in deploying the National Guard to deal with rioting after George Floyd's murder in 2020. Trump called into Fox and Friends on Fox News on Wednesday and said he ""never thought"" Ms Harris would choose Mr Walz as her running mate - who he dubbed as ""very, very liberal"". H said he is ""thrilled"" about the decision, suggesting it would be easy to go after his political record. ""You know, nobody knew how radical left she was, but he's a smarter version of her,"" he said, comparing the Minnesota governor to Bernie Sanders, the progressive Vermont senator. Also in Philadelphia earlier on Tuesday was Mr Vance, Trump’s running mate, who assailed the new Democratic White House ticket. The Ohio senator told reporters that Ms Harris’s choice of Mr Walz shows that ""when given the opportunity she will bend the knee to the most radical elements of her party"".

Tim Walz calls Trump 'weird' and defends Democratic policies

President Joe Biden, who suspended his own election campaign last month and endorsed Ms Harris, said in a statement that the Democratic ticket ""will be the strongest defenders of our personal freedoms and our democracy"". Another of the finalists to be Ms Harris’s running mate, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, was also at the rally. He had faced sharp criticism from the left over his support for Israel and his handling of college protests sparked by the war in Gaza. Some Trump advisers have expressed relief that Ms Harris did not pick Mr Shapiro because of concerns he could help deliver the pivotal state of Pennsylvania. On Wednesday on Fox, Trump suggested that not picking Mr Shapiro was ""very insulting to Jewish people"". Before entering the governor's office, Mr Walz represented a Republican-leaning district in the US Congress for 12 years. He won that seat in 2006 - the only Democrat to have done so in the mostly rural district over the past three decades. Mr Walz is a native of Nebraska and the son of a school administrator and a stay-at-home mother. He grew up farming and hunting and served in the Army National Guard for 24 years after joining aged 17. The young Mr Walz also taught secondary school pupils - first for a year in China, a country he says he has visited about 30 times. He speaks some Mandarin. His wife, Gwen Whipple, a fellow teacher, drew him to her native Minnesota, where he taught social studies and geography and coached American football.

Josh Shapiro, a finalist to be Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, hailed her ultimate decision to tap Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday.

“Lori and I consider Tim and Gwen to be good friends of ours and we are excited for them and for the country to get to know the great people we know them to be,” Shapiro said in a statement on X.

Read his full statement below:

“My life in public service has always been motivated by my family and my faith. Since I first ran for State Representative 20 years ago, I’ve been called to serve because I want to leave our community, our Commonwealth, and our country better off for our children – and because my faith teaches me that no one is required to complete the task, but neither are we free to refrain from it.

Nearly two weeks ago, Vice President Harris asked me to work with her team to complete the vetting process to be considered as her running mate – and following those conversations, on Sunday, I was grateful to have the opportunity to speak with the Vice President directly about her vision for the role and the campaign ahead.

As I’ve said repeatedly over the past several weeks, the running mate decision was a deeply personal decision for the Vice President – and it was also a deeply personal decision for me. Pennsylvanians elected me to a four-year term as their Governor, and my work here is far from finished – there is a lot more stuff I want to get done for the good people of this Commonwealth.

Serving as the 48th Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is the highest honor of my life – showing up in your communities, listening to and learning from you, and then working across the aisle to get stuff done and deliver results for you. In just 19 months, we’ve made a meaningful, positive impact in peoples’ lives, and I’m proud of how Americans all across the country have taken notice of what we’re accomplishing here in Pennsylvania. I’m excited to continue working to protect and advance real freedom, deliver good schools, safe communities, and economic opportunity.

Vice President Kamala Harris has my enthusiastic support – and I know that Governor Tim Walz is an exceptionally strong addition to the ticket who will help Kamala move our country forward. Lori and I consider Tim and Gwen to be good friends of ours and we are excited for them and for the country to get to know the great people we know them to be. Over the next 92 days, I look forward to traveling all across the Commonwealth to unite Pennsylvanians behind Kamala Harris’ campaign to defeat Donald Trump, become the 47th President of the United States, and build a better future for our country.”"

Watch key moments from first Harris-Walz campaign rally

As they walked out for the first time as presidential running mates on Tuesday night, Tim Walz turned to Kamala Harris and mouthed one word: “wow”.

It spoke to the enthusiastic response from the Philadelphia crowd, but also reflected the unlikely journey that the Minnesota governor has been on over the past week.

Few people had Mr Walz on their early lists of possible vice-presidential choices. But on Tuesday, the dark horse won the race.

In a year when ""vibes"" have been everything in politics - on the economy, on the campaign trail - that is exactly what Kamala Harris has gone for: good vibes.

The Minnesota governor has a ""midwestern nice"" appeal, even when he is throwing political punches. His background - a teacher, a football coach, an Army National Guard enlisted soldier - broadcasts ""meat-and-potatoes middle America"", as does perhaps his balding, rotund, slightly dishevelled appearance.

All of this was on display here in Philadelphia.

After noting that violent crime rates went up under Donald Trump, he added – with a smile - “and that doesn’t even count the crimes he committed”. He called the Republican ticket “weird as hell” –a label that has become a Democratic mantra in just a matter of days. And on the topic of abortion, he said government should follow a midwestern golden rule: “Mind your own damn business”.

Mixing humour with jabs - and speaking openly of the “joy” he sees in Democratic politics - may prove to be a more effective way to convince undecided voters who were simply not convinced by the dark “threat to democracy” rhetoric the Biden campaign had been using.

Mr Walz’s aw-shucks affability stood in sharp contrast with other possible choices - the polished and ambitious Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, with his arrow-straight military demeanour.

Mr Shapiro served as the warm-up act for the new Democratic ticket, and he received a hero’s welcome from his home-state crowd. It was a reminder of what Ms Harris passed over in picking Mr Walz – a popular politician with a silver tongue from perhaps the most important state on the electoral map.

Mr Walz was a safer pick than the Pennsylvanian, however, whose criticism of pro-Palestinian protesters and support for using public funds for private schools prompted objections from key parts of the Democratic base. These risked reopening intraparty divisions at a time when Democrats were finally pulling together.

And while Minnesota is not a battleground state, the Harris campaign may hope that Mr Walz has midwestern appeal in places like Wisconsin and Michigan, which will ultimately help decide this election."

The 2024 election has surely heated up and was on fire this week. With Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris’ announcement picking Tim Walz as her vice presidential running mate, he’s emerged as a beacon of progressive change, ready to challenge the status quo. But how does Walz stack up against the current MAGA firebrand, JD Vance? Let’s dive into the expansive contrasts between these two candidates and what their selections mean for the future of American domestic politics.

He’s a Teacher, a Football Coach, a Veteran: Walz is the Guy You Know

Minnesota Governor and VP candidate Tim Walz has been referenced as the exciting solution progressives need for a win in November. Walz graduated with a teaching degree in 1989 from Chadron State College. Then for nearly a decade, he taught at Mankato West High School while winning a state championship as the football coach. In 2006, after serving in the Army National Guard for nearly a quarter century, he was motivated to run for public office; he won a congressional seat in a Republican-leaning district. After marrying his wife, they struggled with fertility and had their daughter using IVF, cementing his support for all Americans to have the same access to this care. His background as a teacher, championship-winning coach, and veteran helped Walz to stand up against conservative-constructed culture wars against LGBTQ+ and reproductive rights. He’s proved that most Americans support compassion above authoritarian attacks on our neighbors.

A Resilient Governor

Walz won the governorship in 2018 with a unifying ""One Minnesota"" message that resonated with Rust Belt voters by championing union rights and a $15 minimum wage, which he delivered by signing the Local Jobs and Projects Plan. This funded roughly $1.9 billion in support of infrastructure projects, including affordable housing.

Notably, Walz has taken a strong stance to protect access to abortion, fight poverty by providing free meals for all public education students, set clean energy benchmarks, and support ‘red flag’ laws that give state courts the power to legally confiscate guns from residents who pose a risk to themselves or others.

In his first term as governor, Walz navigated a split legislature, initiating compromises to fund public schools, universal health care for low-income residents, and major infrastructure improvements. After the legislature went to Democratic hands, Walz and lawmakers swiftly eliminated state abortion restrictions. He said at the bill signing, ""Your access to reproductive health and your right to make your own health care decisions are preserved and protected… and because of this law, that won't change with the political winds or makeup of the Supreme Court."" Walz also protected gender-affirming care and legalized recreational marijuana, leveraging a massive budget surplus to drive Minnesota forward. Walz’s impact on the 2024 election could be a game-changer for progressives as well as our body autonomy and freedoms.

Everything You Need to Know About JD Vance

In very stark contrast, James Donald Bowman, or JD Vance, is a red-blooded Trumpian through and through. The current junior senator from Ohio is the author of a memoir that many see as a misrepresentation of rural Appalachians as lazy. Column after column has marked the book as demeaning to marginalized populations in his home state. JD Vance's ever-changing name, appearance, and most importantly changes in political stances paint a portrait of a man willing to transform himself for power — from referring to MAGA candidate Trump as “America’s Hitler” just several years ago to running alongside him this year. It’s clear JD and Donald will do whatever is necessary to exert oppression on the American people.

Vance Believes in Forced Pregnancies, a Danger to Women and the LGBTQ+ Community

Not only does JD Vance support forced births and a national abortion ban without exceptions for rape or incest, he genuinely believes that child-free Americans are “more sociopathic,” make the country “less mentally stable,” and that the “most deranged” and “most psychotic commentators on X – formerly known as Twitter - are typically childless.”

Additionally, Vance introduced a bill that would restrict gender-affirming care for minors. He’s proudly noted that he would slash sexual orientation and gender identity protections. Similar to Trump, Vance is closely linked to the founder of the Heritage Foundation, the notorious conservative think tank most recently under fire for platforming Project 2025. He supports turning the Heritage Foundation “into the de-facto institutional home of Trumpism.” It was also reported that Vance is an advocate for the proposal that the next GOP president should overhaul the federal workforce to replace career civil servants with political appointees, positioning to fill federal agencies with MAGA supporters.

Vance’s Further Far-Right and Outrageous Platform

JD Vance was also quoted suggesting that women should stay in abusive relationships.

He said, “This is one of the great tricks that I think the sexual revolution pulled on the American populace, which is the idea that like, well, OK, these marriages were fundamentally, you know, they were maybe even violent, but certainly they were unhappy. And so getting rid of them and making it easier for people to shift spouses like they change their underwear, that’s going to make people happier in the long term.”

Vance’s selection as Trump’s running mate stamps two extremists on our ballots, adding a sidekick who is ready and willing to push an extreme, un-American agenda. This pick highlights Trump’s confidence and willingness to double down on authoritarian stances, setting the stage for a fiercely polarizing campaign.

The Ultimate Showdown: Project 2025 vs. Progress 2025

As the 2024 election approaches, the stakes couldn't be higher. With Tim Walz and JD Vance embodying two vastly different visions for America's future, the ultimate showdown between Project 2025 and Progress 2025 is set to captivate the nation. Will America embrace the unifying, progressive vision of Harris-Walz, or will it barrel down the extreme, authoritarian path of Trump-Vance? The battle lines are drawn, and the future of the nation hangs in the balance.

"Tim Walz may be the next US VP. To those he taught, he's a great teacher.",https://www.aol.com/news/hes-vp-pick-students-hes-152126662.html,"Former students describe Tim Walz as 'a gifted educator' who 'cared deeply' [Josh Jagdfeld]

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz could be America's next vice-president. Nobody is more enthusiastic about it than former students in his small-town, midwest classroom.

At Mankato West High School, years before he joined the political scene, a young Mr Walz taught geography and social studies, supervised the lunchroom and coached the football team.

The Harris campaign has sought to highlight Mr Walz's career as a teacher, even though he served six terms in Congress before he returned to Minnesota to run for governor, a position he's held since 2018.

Those who knew him back then told the BBC that his teaching history is a guide to the politician he has become and the vice-president he could be.

It was 1999 and Jacob Reitan - the first openly gay student at Mankato West - was part of an effort to form the first gay-straight alliance at the school. GSAs, student-run organisations focused on supporting LGBTQ youth, emerged across the country through the nineties.

Mr Reitan still remembers the bullying he faced back then, from the homophobic insult spray-painted on his driveway to a smashed-in car window in the school parking lot.

But he told the BBC the Walzes promoted inclusion, kindness and ""jointly made the school a place where it was safe to come out"".

And because the new GSA required a faculty advisor, Coach Walz stepped up.

""It really needed to be the football coach, who was the soldier and was straight and was married,"" he said in a 2018 interview, explaining why he took the role.

Mr Walz remained a firm supporter of same-sex rights and, in 2011, Mr Reitan stood by the then-congressman's side as President Barack Obama signed his bill repealing the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy for gay and lesbian Americans serving in the military into law.

Jacob Reitan with Mr and Mrs Walz [Jacob Reitan]

""He's so perfect as an addition to the Harris ticket,"" Mr Reitan said.

Introducing him on Tuesday at their first joint campaign event, Ms Harris lavished more praise on Coach Walz than on Governor Walz, his current title.

""Tim Walz was the kind of teacher and mentor that every child in America dreams of having, and that every kid deserves,"" she said.

""He's the kind of person who makes them feel like they belong and then inspires them to dream big, and that's the kind of vice-president he will be.""

The Trump campaign has assailed Mr Walz as ""a dangerously liberal extremist"" who, along with Ms Harris, forms a ticket that they say is too far left for most Americans to stomach.

They have scrutinised his record as Minnesota's governor - from enacting an ambitious left-wing agenda to delaying deployment of the National Guard in response to violent protests following the murder of George Floyd.

The Harris campaign is leaning into a biography they believe can win over the rural and working-class voters she needs to defeat Mr Trump this November.

While Ms Harris grew up and built her career in liberal California, Mr Walz spent his childhood fishing, farming and hunting in rural Nebraska and came to politics later in life. He joined the National Guard at age 17.

For about 17 years, from 1989 to 2006, he worked in public high schools - first for a year in China, then in Nebraska and later in his wife's native Minnesota.

And former students like Mr Reitan are glowing in their praise for the ex-educator.

[Matt Klaber]

For brothers Jake and Josh Jagdfeld, attending Mankato West was akin to ""home-schooling with the Walzes"".

Josh Jagdfeld took classes with both Tim and Gwen Walz in the 10th grade, and he remembers worrying politics would change his favourite teacher.

But when they met on Monday night, Mr Walz greeted him with a shout of ""Mankato West in the building!"" and a big hug.

""He's warm, engaging, cares about everybody he talks to. That's exactly the same Tim Walz I knew,"" Josh Jagdfeld told the BBC.

Coach Walz, a defensive coordinator for the school's football team, tapped Jake Jagdfeld as line-backer, putting him ""in a position to succeed"".

When Coach Walz joined the team, Mankato West was reeling from a winless 0-27 season. Three years later, it won its first ever state championship.

""Great credit goes to him,"" Jake Jagdfeld said. ""He helped to create an inspirational environment for us young men to feel confident and work hard.""

[Josh Jagdfeld]

In 2004, Noah Hobbs was in Mr Walz's last geography class before he left teaching.

""He's a very high-energy person, whether school was just starting or it was the end of the day, and that energy was infectious,"" he said.

""The level of care that he gave to all students - not just the kids getting 4.0 [GPAs] - was really impactful for me as a young kid.""

Mr Hobbs believes the US is ""looking for someone that is authentic, and Tim embodies that in a way not seen in politics at that level very often"".

Mr Walz's evolution from teacher to politician has been described as accidental.

In his telling, it stemmed from an incident at then-President George W Bush's 2004 campaign rally in Mankato.

He and another teacher chaperoned two students to the event but local organisers refused to let them in.

Noah Hobbs with Mr Walz [Noah Hobbs]

""They knew we were Democrats,"" Matt Klaber, one of the students, told the BBC.

""At this time, the Bush campaign was turning away any possible protesters from their rallies and this was no exception.""

When Mr Klaber pulled out his ID, the staffers observed a faded John Kerry sticker on his wallet. The students were sent home.

Mr Walz has described being ""struck by how deeply divided our country was becoming"". He went on to volunteer for the Kerry campaign, develop his own local contacts and then launched a bid for Congress in 2006.

""The news reports say part of what Kamala was looking for was chemistry and a governing partner,"" said Mr Klaber.

""Then picking Mr Walz was a no-brainer. All the good things people have been saying about him as a person are absolutely true.""

When Mr Walz arrived on Capitol Hill, new members of Congress were learning in orientation sessions about their salary and benefits.

""They were talking about, ‘I know most of you are taking pay cuts,’” he told local Minnesota television station KSTP.

“And I leaned to my aide and said, ‘This is four times what I’ve ever made in my life.’"
"Tim Walz may be the next US VP. To those he taught, he's a great teacher.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/06/us/kamala-harris-vp-trump-election,"Vice President Kamala Harris and her newly announced running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, went on the attack against the Trump-Vance Republican ticket during a raucous rally in Philadelphia.

“To his former high school students, he was Mr. Walz. And to his former high school football players, he was Coach. And in 91 days, the nation will know Coach Walz by another name: Vice President of the United States.” “Thank you, Madam Vice President, for the trust you put in me, but maybe more so, thank you for bringing back the joy. Now, Donald Trump sees the world a little differently than us. First of all, he doesn’t know the first thing about service. He doesn’t have time for it because he’s too busy serving himself. Like all regular people I grew up with in the heartland, JD [Vance] studied at Yale, had his career funded by Silicon Valley billionaires, and then wrote a best seller trashing that community. Come on. That’s not what middle America is. And I got to tell you, I can’t wait to debate the guy.”

America’s introduction to Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota began with a half-hour of cheering for Vice President Kamala Harris and ended with some of the sharpest attacks Democrats have leveled against former President Donald J. Trump and his running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio.

Before a raucous crowd in Philadelphia, Ms. Harris and Mr. Walz presented the Minnesotan as a folksy former schoolteacher and football coach who had inspired his students, served in the military and improved his constituents’ lives.

But it was his ability to deliver searing yet accessible attacks against their Republican opponents that won Mr. Walz a place on the national ticket, and during his first rally, he did not miss his marks.

“Donald Trump sees the world a little differently than us,” he said. “First of all, he doesn’t know the first thing about service. He doesn’t have time for it because he’s too busy serving himself.”

Then came the dagger. “Violent crime was up under Donald Trump,” he said, before pausing for effect. “That’s not even counting the crimes he committed.”

The Harris campaign’s presentation of Mr. Walz brought an end to its two-week sprint to find a running mate, a process that typically takes months and involves a series of public tryouts. Instead, Ms. Harris’s search for a partner took place largely behind closed doors.

Ms. Harris, in her remarks, hailed Mr. Walz as not only the governing partner she had sought but a person of decency who she said would set an example to inspire the nation.

“Tim Walz was the kind of teacher and mentor that every child in America dreams of having and that every kid deserves,” the vice president said. “The kind of coach — because he’s the kind of person — who makes people feel like they belong and then inspires them to dream big. And that’s the kind of vice president he will be. And that’s the kind of vice president America deserves.”

Just 40 days ago, President Biden was preparing to debate Mr. Trump in what his campaign described as the kickoff to the general election. But the president delivered a performance so alarming that his party exploded in revolt, ultimately pushing him out of the race just over two weeks ago.

In short order, Ms. Harris’s emergence as the nominee has transformed what had been a Democratic Party depressed by the prospect of scrounging up votes for an unpopular 81-year-old candidate. Now the party is newly hopeful heading into the highly competitive homestretch of the election.

“The promise of America is what makes it possible for two middle-class kids — one a daughter of Oakland, California, who was raised by a working mother, the other a son of the Nebraska plains who grew up working on a farm — it’s the promise of America,” Ms. Harris said in Philadelphia. “Because only in America — only in America — is it possible for them together to make it all the way to the White House.”

Mr. Walz seemed almost overwhelmed as he took the stage to wild cheers. He spent the 30 minutes while Ms. Harris spoke alternating between bowing toward her and theatrical applause that had the effect of making him appear like a man who had just won the political lottery.

When he finally took the microphone, his exultation was clear. “Wow,” he said, before offering another small bow.

In his speech, he praised Ms. Harris’s career in law enforcement and as vice president, saying she had “fought on the side of the American people” and “never hesitated to reach across the aisle if it meant improving people’s lives.”

He emphasized his blue-collar roots, growing up in small towns in Nebraska and spending summers working on his family farm, and described how joining the military had given him purpose.

But it was his prepared zingers against Mr. Trump and Mr. Vance that led to the biggest responses from the crowd, which the Harris campaign said had totaled about 12,000 people.

Mr. Walz accused Mr. Vance of being an inauthentic tribune of the white working-class Midwesterners he says he represents. Mr. Walz, who graduated from Chadron State College in Nebraska, mocked Mr. Vance’s Ivy League education and Silicon Valley employment before effectively calling him a coward in front of a national television audience.

“I’ve got to tell you, I can’t wait to debate the guy,” Mr. Walz said, pausing again as he savored the attack line to come. “That is, if he’s willing to get off the couch and show up.”

(The line, for the blissfully uninitiated, was a wink-and-nod reference to a widely shared yet false social media claim about Mr. Vance and furniture.)

Come on. That’s not what middle America is. And I got to tell you, I can’t wait to debate the guy. That is, if he’s willing to get off the couch and show up, so.

Mr. Walz catapulted himself from little-known Midwestern governor to a national Democratic star embraced by the party’s progressive wing.

He created a catchphrase for liberals in labeling Mr. Trump and Mr. Vance as “weird” characters, going so far on Tuesday as to call them “creepy and weird as hell.” He delighted key elements of his party with punchy appearances on cable television and down-home videos on social media, along with his record of enacting liberal measures as governor.

In her introduction, Ms. Harris highlighted several of Mr. Walz’s policy positions, many of which aligned with the Biden administration’s, that she said demonstrated his willingness to stand up against attacks on freedom.

Among them was being the first governor in the country to sign a new law protecting reproductive rights after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. He also signed the most significant expansion of voting rights in Minnesota in over 50 years.

Mr. Walz cast his support for abortion rights, as many Democrats have, as a defense of personal freedom.

“In Minnesota, we respect our neighbors and the personal choices that they make,” he said. “Even if we wouldn’t make the same choices for ourselves, there’s a golden rule: Mind your own damn business.”

Mr. Walz also shared his family’s difficult experience with in vitro fertilization treatments, which have been targeted by conservatives in some states that moved to pass restrictive laws after the decision overturning Roe.

“I remember praying every night for a call for good news,” he said, describing the pit in his stomach and the “agony” he had felt hoping that the treatments had worked.

This, he said, was why he and his wife named their daughter “Hope.”

The rally also had to deal with the thorny issue of Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, who was the runner-up to join Ms. Harris on the ticket and gave a fiery speech to help kick off the rally.

Mr. Shapiro warned about the prospect of a Trump-Vance White House and spoke warmly of Mr. Walz.

“Tim Walz is a great man,” Mr. Shapiro said, adding that he was “an outstanding governor,” a “great patriot” and a “dear friend.”

“I’m going to be working my tail off to make sure we make Kamala Harris and Tim Walz the next leaders of the United States of America,” Mr. Shapiro added.

Mr. Walz, in turn, said Mr. Shapiro could “bring the fire” and called him a “visionary leader,” telling the crowd, “What a treasure you have in Josh Shapiro.” He also praised Mr. Shapiro’s ability to complete an interstate highway reconstruction last year. “Everybody in America knows, when you need a bridge fixed, call that guy,” Mr. Walz said.

The Harris campaign said that since Mr. Walz had been announced as the running mate, it had raised more than $20 million from supporters. It was one of its best fund-raising days this election cycle, the campaign said.

During his speech, Mr. Walz tried to rally supporters for the three-month dash to November, telling them, “We’ll sleep when we’re dead.”

“Over those next 91 days, and every day in the White House, I’ll have Vice President Harris’s back,” he said. “And we’ll have yours.”

Why We Wrote This In choosing Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, Kamala Harris gains a folksy former soldier, teacher, and football coach who could help her presidential campaign in key Rust Belt states.

Former Minneapolis Democratic Mayor R.T. Rybak has known Mr. Walz since his first run for Congress – and says he’s the same “incredibly authentic human being” that he was in 2005.

“Vision, joy, and compassion are very much part of what Tim Walz is, and he also translates that through the eyes of the working people of this country,” Mr. Rybak says. “The country is going to have to get used to seeing a vice president in a schlumpy T-shirt and cargo pants. ... And they’re going to have to get used to seeing a vice president who can fix a car or go hunting.”

That demeanor and his governing record made Mr. Walz a favorite of progressives and populists in the truncated search for a Harris running mate. His description of former President Donald Trump and his running mate, J.D. Vance, as “weird” in recent interviews quickly caught on with Ms. Harris and other Democrats.

She cited his biography and personality for why she selected the governor.

“One of the things that stood out to me about Tim is how his convictions on fighting for middle class families run deep. It’s personal. As a governor, a coach, a teacher, and a veteran, he’s delivered for working families like his own,” she said in a statement announcing the pick.

The Walz track record

Mr. Walz was a relatively centrist congressman during his time in the House. He supported the Keystone XL oil pipeline, worked across the aisle to pass a bipartisan veterans suicide-prevention bill into law in 2015, and was a darling of the National Rifle Association in his early career. He’s a gun owner and avid hunter. But he has shifted to support more restrictions, like an assault weapons ban.

He’s won a number of tough House races in a rural district that leans Republican and two hard-fought gubernatorial elections in Minnesota, a liberal-leaning but competitive state.

He worked across the aisle with Republicans who controlled the Legislature in his first term to secure more funding to fight opioid addiction and cut middle-class taxes. And in the wake of George Floyd’s murder in 2020 by a police officer in Minneapolis, he helped negotiate a bipartisan law putting new restrictions on police use of force in the state.

It was striking that Mr. Walz’s selection drew praise from across the Democratic Party – both progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and centrist West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin cheered him. Mr. Manchin called Mr. Walz “the real deal,” and said he “will bring normality back to the most chaotic political environment that most of us have ever seen.”

The protests and riots that broke out in Minneapolis after Mr. Floyd’s death are a vulnerability for him, however: Mr. Walz later admitted that the state’s initial response was an “abject failure.” Mr. Walz also faces criticism for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. A local nonprofit siphoned off a quarter-billion dollars in federal funds meant to feed children during the pandemic, the largest pandemic fraud case in the United States; a jury found five people guilty in June of fraud, bribery, and money laundering, and dozens of others face charges.

A recent legislative audit found that his administration’s Department of Education failed to conduct proper oversight to prevent the fraud.

Republicans are already attacking Mr. Walz on these issues.

“Tim Walz let BLM rioters burn buildings to the ground. At the same time, he set up ‘snitch phone lines’ to report Minnesotans to the police for going to the store or having a barbecue during COVID. Just like Kamala Harris, he’s dangerous radical,” Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas posted on X on Tuesday.

How Walz came from behind to win veepstakes

He began the rapid veepstakes race as a little-known governor, but quickly gained support from progressives, many of whom wanted to find another Rust Belt candidate to block the more centrist Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro from the ticket. Mr. Walz has earned plaudits from the left for his successful push in recent years for legislation to protect abortion access in Minnesota, create paid family leave, provide free school meals to all Minnesota students, offer free college tuition for all students from families that earn less than $80,000 annually, legalize recreational marijuana, and force public utility companies to use green energy. And he has close ties with organized labor.

Mr. Trump’s campaign immediately sought to paint him as a far-left politician.

“From proposing his own carbon-free agenda, to suggesting stricter emission standards for gas-powered cars, and embracing policies to allow convicted felons to vote, Walz is obsessed with spreading California’s dangerously liberal agenda far and wide,” Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.

Some pundits criticized Ms. Harris for not picking Mr. Shapiro, both because of the missed opportunity to shore up her support in Pennsylvania, perhaps the most important swing state in the country, and because Mr. Shapiro, a first-term governor, has a more moderate record that could win over independents.

But while Mr. Walz and Mr. Shapiro share similar views on Israel, Mr. Shapiro has been more outspoken in criticizing some protests against Israel’s war in Gaza, making him more of a target for criticism from the left.

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a progressive who has known Mr. Walz since they were both elected to Congress in 2006, praised his home-state colleague for being able to build bridges with various disaffected groups.

“He’s a listener; he believes in sitting down with people and talking to them. Let me tell you, there’s a lot of communities who have felt historically marginalized in Minnesota who Tim Walz has built bridges with,” he says. “His basic impulse is to sit and listen and try to understand. He’s great at that.”

And Mr. Shapiro, an attorney from the Philadelphia suburbs, didn’t offer the blue-collar appeal that Mr. Walz brings – and Ms. Harris lacks.

“I always think of him [as] giving off the football coach vibes,” says Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party Chair Ken Martin, who has known Mr. Walz for two decades.

Mr. Martin says that Mr. Walz’s bio and skill set will make him an asset in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania – three “blue wall” states crucial to winning the presidential election.

“There’s no one better equipped to speak to those Midwestern values, with Midwestern sensibilities and sort of a folksiness than Tim Walz, who is one of the best communicators I’ve seen,” he says.

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has received a mocking new nickname now that he’s soaking up the political limelight: “Tampon Tim”.

After being announced as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate in the 2024 US presidential election, Mr Walz has rapidly become an invaluable political asset to the Democrats’ campaign.

Harris’ rival for the White House, former president Donald Trump, and his supporters have unsurprisingly sought to discredit him.

So who is Tim Walz and why are his detractors calling him “Tampon Tim”?

Here’s all you need to know.

Who is Tim Walz?

Mr Walz is a politician who has been Minnesota's 41st governor since 2019.

The 60-year-old and his three siblings grew up in Valentine, Nebraska, a rural community in midwestern America.

He spent summers farming and hunting before joining the Army National Guard aged 17. He also spent 24 years in the volunteer force.

Equipped with a teaching degree, Mr Walz taught for one year in China.

Once back in Nebraska, Mr Walz worked as a teacher and American football coach at Alliance High School. His wife Gwen Whipple — another teacher at the school — encouraged him to move to her home state of Minnesota.

Mr Walz then helped Mankato West High School in Minnesota win its first state American football championship in 1999.

He also received praise for becoming the faculty adviser for the school's gay-straight alliance when homosexuality was generally not accepted.His first political contest was in a predominantly rural, Republican-leaning district in southern Minnesota that is primarily agricultural.Mr Walz caused an upset in the election by running as a moderate who cared about veterans' causes and public service.

He was elected Minnesota governor in November 2018, winning by a margin of more than 11 points, and took up his role in January 2019.

Mr Walz was re-elected for a second term in November 2022, with the Democrats controlling the state legislature by a single seat.

Largely unknown, he has recently garnered attention for his caustic portrayals of Republicans.He told MSNBC: “These are weird people on the other side. They want to ban books. They want to be in your [doctor's] exam room.”

Why are Republicans calling Tim Walz 'Tampon Tim'?

The Republicans are using the nickname “Tampon Tim” to highlight a bill that Mr Walz signed into law. Since January 1, 2024, the law has mandated that menstruation supplies be available to school students.

It decrees that supplies such as tampons and pads “must be available to all menstruating students in restrooms regularly used by students in grades four to 12 according to a plan developed by the school district”.

The law has been widely celebrated. Minnesota is one of 28 states with legislation granting children access to menstruation supplies.

Republicans, however, objected to the legislation's wording, which admits that not all women have periods and that not everyone who menstruates is a woman. Attempts by some challengers to restrict the rule to just women's and gender-neutral restrooms were unsuccessful.

Speaking on Fox News, Mr Trump’s campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said: “As a woman, I think there is no greater threat to our health than leaders who support gender-transition surgeries for young minors, who support putting tampons in men’s bathrooms in public schools.“Those are radical policies that Tim Walz supports. He actually signed a bill to do that.”

“Tim Walz is a weird radical liberal,” the MAGA War Room account posted on X, formerly Twitter. “What could be weirder than signing a bill requiring schools to stock tampons in boys' bathrooms?”

“Tampon Tim is hands down the best political nickname ever,” tweeted conservative commentator Liz Wheeler. “It’s so… savagely effective. In one word tells you EVERYTHING you need to know about Tim Walz’s dangerous radicalism.”

But LGBTQ rights organisations have celebrated Mr Walz's appointment and commended his record. This includes a 2023 executive order that positioned Minnesota as one of the pioneering states to protect access to gender-affirming health care amid a growing number of states attempting to restrict it.

Mr Walz has not yet commented on his new nickname.

But former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said it was “nice of the Trump camp to help publicize Gov. Tim Walz’s compassionate and common-sense policy,” adding, “Let’s do this everywhere.”

Former Georgia State Representative Bee Nguyen said Mr Walz, as an ex-teacher, understands poor access to menstrual products affects education.

“This makes me an even bigger fan of Tampon Tim,” she added."
"Tim Walz may be the next US VP. To those he taught, he's a great teacher.",https://ca.news.yahoo.com/reactions-kamala-harris-pick-tim-143240003.html,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday, choosing a liberal policy champion and a plain speaker from the American heartland to help win over rural, white voters.

Here are some reactions to her pick:

DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN:

""Kamala Harris has made a great decision in choosing Governor Tim Walz to be her running mate ... he's been a strong, principled and effective leader. The Harris-Walz ticket will be a powerful voice for working people and America's great middle class. They will be the strongest defenders of our personal freedoms and our democracy. And they will ensure that America continues to lead the world and play its role as the indispensable nation.""

REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE DONALD TRUMP:

""TIM WALZ WOULD BE THE WORST VP IN HISTORY! Even worse than Dangerously Liberal and Crooked Kamala Harris - HE'S THAT BAD. He'll unleash HELL ON EARTH and open our borders to the worst criminals imaginable. He'll rubber stamp Kamala's GREEN NEW SCAM and light TRILLIONS of dollars on fire.""

REPUBLICAN VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE J.D. VANCE:

""The biggest problem with the Tim Walz pick, it's not Tim Walz himself. It's what it says about Kamala Harris, that when given the opportunity she will bend the knee to the most radical elements of her party.""

DEMOCRATIC PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNOR JOSH SHAPIRO, A VP FINALIST:

""Over the next 90 days, I look forward to traveling all across the Commonwealth to unite Pennsylvanians behind my friends Kamala Harris and Tim Walz and defeat Donald Trump.""

HILLARY CLINTON, 2016 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:

""I'm thrilled to see Tim Walz join the Democratic ticket. From providing free meals for schoolkids to implementing paid family leave in Minnesota, he's about doing good in all the ways you can. He'll be an incredible partner to our first woman president. Let's go win this.""

REPUBLICAN U.S. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM:

""If you had any doubt that Kamala Harris is deeply liberal, look no further than the fact that her VP pick was endorsed by Bernie Sanders. Great day for the Left. Bad day for middle America.""

FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA AND FORMER FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA:

""Kamala Harris has chosen an ideal partner – and made it clear exactly what she stands for. Governor Walz doesn’t just have the experience to be vice president, he has the values and the integrity to make us proud.""

DEMOCRATIC U.S. REPRESENTATIVE MARK POCAN OF WISCONSIN:

""I’ve know Tim for years, and he’s as real as it gets.""

DEMOCRATIC U.S. REPRESENTATIVE ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ:

“Vice President Harris made an excellent decision in Gov. Walz as her running mate. .. Together, they will govern effectively, inclusively, and boldly for the American people.""

INDEPENDENT U.S. SENATOR JOE MANCHIN:

""All of the candidates were strong and any one of them would have been a great pick, but I can think of no one better than Governor Walz to help bring our country closer together and bring balance back to the Democratic Party.""

ASIF MAHMOOD, DEMOCRATIC DONOR AND DELEGATE:

""He's somebody that everybody can relate to. People feel good about him.""

REID HOFFMAN, DEMOCRATIC DONOR AND FOUNDER OF LINKEDIN:

""Walz fostered a pro-business climate, attracting substantial investment and positioning the state as a top contender for business development. I'm confident that as VP, he'll continue to protect America’s innovation power and fuel economic growth.""

DMITRI MEHLHORN, DEMOCRATIC DONOR ADVISER:

“He’s charismatic and reassuring and will be particularly appealing to the voters who previously trusted Biden.”

KAROLINE LEAVITT, TRUMP CAMPAIGN PRESS SECRETARY:

""Just like Kamala Harris, Tim Walz is a dangerously liberal extremist.""

REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION:

""While Walz will try to sell himself as a relatable moderate, his record shows that he consistently backs the most liberal policies that national Democrats have to offer and will be in lockstep with the Democrat agenda that has already failed Americans.""

UNITED AUTO WORKERS PRESIDENT SHAWN FAIN:

""Tim Walz has been a great governor and is going to make a great Vice President. He’s stood with the working class every step of the way, and has walked the walk, including on a UAW picket line last fall.""

REPUBLICAN FLORIDA GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS:

""Harris-Walz: most left-wing ticket in American history. Minnesota was ground zero for the BLM riots of 2020. Harris egged it on and Walz sat by and let Minneapolis burn.""

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES REPUBLICAN LEADER STEVE SCALISE:

""Kamala Harris just made the most liberal ticket in history even more liberal. Tim Walz is a radical who let rioters burn Minneapolis to the ground in 2020 — the same rioters Kamala Harris raised money to bail out. They're a dangerous duo that'll let crime destroy our communities.""

AFL-CIO PRESIDENT LIZ SHULER:

""Gov. Walz isn’t only an ally to the labor movement, but also our union brother with a deep commitment to a pro-worker agenda. ... The labor movement stands united behind the Harris–Walz ticket.""

AMY WALTER AND JESSICA TAYLOR, ANALYSTS FOR NONPARTISAN COOK POLITICAL REPORT:

""Harris has fulfilled the wishes of the more progressive wing of the party ... it looks as if the Harris campaign decided that it was not worth risking an intra-party fight with their VP choice.

""Republicans we talked to were more worried about the impact Shapiro would have on the contest and saw him as the stronger opponent.

""Bottom line: Walz’s rural Midwestern background helps give the ticket some 'Blue Wall' credibility and sensibility without upsetting the progressive wing of the party.""

AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS PRESIDENT RANDI WEINGARTEN:

""Gov. Walz is a proud educator who drew on his experience in the classroom to show Minnesotans what a pro-education, pro-labor administration can look like.""

JOINT STATEMENT FROM PRO-PALESTINIAN GROUPS:

""Vice President Kamala Harris has a taken a step in the right direction but there is more work to do ... The Biden administration's unconditional support for Israel's genocide in Gaza has tarnished Democrats’ longstanding support from Palestinian, Arab, Muslim, and progressive communities, and it will take real change in policy to repair that damage.""

MANISH BAPNA, PRESIDENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP NRDC ACTION FUND:

“Tim Walz has made Minnesota a national climate leader. ... He brings sound judgment and a solid commitment to protecting the environment and public health in a way that advances equity.""

UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR LARRY SABATO:

""Yes, Gov. Josh Shapiro could have brought a bigger payoff (19 Electoral Votes) but Gov. Tim Walz fills the age-old bill for VP nominees: First, do no harm.""

Who is Tim Walz? Kamala Harris' VP pick and his stance on key issues in the upcoming US election

Listen here on your chosen podcast platform.

US Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has confirmed her running mate will be Minnesota governor Tim Walz.

If Harris wins the November 2024 election against Donald Trump, Walz would become America’s next vice president by the new year.

The former teacher, 60, was thrilled to accept the appointment and has been largely welcomed by Democratic circles as a solid VP pick.

“It is the honour of a lifetime to join @kamalaharris in this campaign. I’m all in,” Walz wrote on social media. He added: “Vice President Harris is showing us the politics of what’s possible. It reminds me a bit of the first day of school. So, let’s get this done, folks! Join us.”

It is the honor of a lifetime to join @kamalaharris in this campaign.



I’m all in.



Vice President Harris is showing us the politics of what’s possible. It reminds me a bit of the first day of school.



So, let’s get this done, folks! Join us. https://t.co/tqOVsw2OLM — Tim Walz (@Tim_Walz) August 6, 2024

Walz overcame competition for the position from other key political figures, such as Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro. Harris introduced him as her VP pick at a raucous rally on Tuesday (August 6) in Philadelphia.

He has already earned himself a catchphrase, branding his Republican opponents “weird” — and successfully enraging those on the right.

He is notably also the first Democratic VP selection since 1964 who did not go to law school.

So, who is Walz and where does he stand on all the key issues in the upcoming US election?

Who is Tim Walz?

Walz was born in Nebraska on April 6, 1964, and grew up in a rural town called West Point near the South Dakota border.

He taught in China as a young man before returning to the US, where he taught and coached American football at Alliance High School in Nebraska.

Walz then helped Mankato West High School in Minnesota win its first state American football championship in 1999.

As an educator, Walz also supported LGBTQ+ students and was said to be a popular figure in Minnesota’s education system.

Alongside being a teacher, Walz enlisted in the Army National Guard — a voluntary role he continued for almost three decades.

While supporting the military, Walz was deployed to natural disaster zones and reportedly deployed to Italy, where he supported US-Afghan operations.

Walz began his political career in 2006 after being elected to the House of Representatives, defeating the incumbent Republican Gil Gutknecht.

He was re-elected numerous times before becoming the Governor of Minnesota in 2018, a role he’s held ever since.

Walz is a married father of two and initially positioned himself as a moderate Democratic candidate. However, his take on various policies has seemingly shifted left in recent years.

Here’s where he stands on the key policies.

Environment

Walz shares a progressive position on environmental policies and has backed clean electricity laws and efforts to cut his state’s greenhouse gas emissions.

He previously agreed that climate change is an “existential threat,” with many climate groups praising Walz’s VP pick due to his environmental position.

Business Insider said his state passed more than 40 climate initiatives in 2023.

At a time when the realities of climate change are impossible to ignore, Walz appears determined to act for the good of the environment.

“I have to tell you, when I hear people say ‘You’re moving too fast’ — we can’t move too fast when it comes to addressing climate change,” Walz said in 2023. “This idea of waiting is a luxury we do not have, and Minnesotans do not have.”

This is something that has angered Republicans. “He'll rubber stamp Kamala's GREEN NEW SCAM and light TRILLIONS of dollars on fire,” Trump said in a scathing social media post.

Abortion

In 2023, Walz signed a law protecting abortion rights for people in Minnesota. He has also toured a Planned Parenthood clinic and has long shared support for reproductive rights and sexual health.

“By choosing Gov. Walz as her running mate, Vice President Harris has put forward the most pro-reproductive freedom ticket in history,” said Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Action Fund.

Gun control

America's longest-standing civil rights organization the National Rifle Association (NRA) NRA has endorsed Walz before.

He has reportedly called himself “one of the best shots in Congress”.

However, he’s since distanced himself from the controversial gun lobby group and now advocates stricter gun control to keep Americans safe.

Following the Parkland school shooting in February 2018 and conversations with his daughter, Walz affirmed his commitment to ending gun violence in the country.

“I know that there’s no place for weapons of war in our schools, or in our churches, or in our banks, or anywhere else people are just trying to live their lives without fear,” he said in his State of the State address in 2023.

Immigration

Walz isn’t necessarily from a state where immigration is a major political issue. However, many expect him to advocate a fairer system to help undocumented migrants feel safe.

“There’s no reason someone seeking asylum, which we will always be a guiding light for, should have to wait seven years to have that adjudicated,” he said in 2023.

According to Time, he’s also passed bills that secured health insurance coverage regardless of a person’s immigration status.

Economy

Walz has a long history of supporting American workers, signing a series of bills aiming to enhance employee rights and workplace protections.

In 2021, he backed plans to increase taxes for the richest Minnesotans and on capital gains while also cutting taxes for poorer families.

Walz recently celebrated his child tax credit initiative for helping more than 215,000 Minnesota families.

He’s also pushed for universal free school meals, legalised cannabis in his state, and supported investments in construction and renovation projects in Minnesota.

LGBTQ+ rights

Walz is also an LGBTQ+ ally.

According to Pink News, he’s banned conversion therapy in his state and signed a bill protecting trans youth who have come from other states.

He’s also long stood up for same-sex marriage, and maintains a strong record of protecting people in his state regardless of their sexual orientation."

Stephen Maturen/Getty Tim Walz celebrates his Democratic primary victory in Minnesota's 2018 gubernatorial race alongside his son, Gus

Walz, 60, is a former teacher, national guardsman and high school football coach who turned to politics in 2006 when he successfully ran for the U.S. House as a Democrat in a historically Republican district. After 12 years in Congress, during which he became a senior member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, Walz soundly won the 2018 Minnesota gubernatorial race.

He earned a Bachelor of Science in social science education from Chadron State College and a Master of Science in educational leadership from Minnesota State University, Mankato.



Carter earned a Bachelor of Science from the U.S. Naval Academy, and after serving in the military went on to become a peanut farmer, Georgia state senator and, later, the Georgia governor. He was elected president in 1976, serving one term.

Only one Democrat on a presidential ticket between Walz and Carter didn't earn a law degree: Vice President Al Gore. He did still study law though, only dropping out of the program when the opportunity arose to run for Congress mid-way through his studies.

Walz was among a rumored shortlist of vice presidential picks even before President Joe Biden withdrew from the race, but in recent weeks, he shot up the list in part due to his demonstrated ability to articulate Harris' platform on the campaign trail.

Other names that made Harris' running mate shortlist included Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.

In that bunch, Buttigieg and Kelly also did not attend law school. Buttigieg earned two bachelor's degrees after studying at Harvard University and as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, going on to work as a consultant at McKinsey & Company before joining the U.S. military. Kelly, meanwhile, had a distinguished Naval career and received a Master of Science in aeronautical engineering before becoming an astronaut.

In a statement explaining her decision to select Walz as her running mate, Harris alluded to the governor's Midwest roots, saying, ""One of the things that stood out to me about Tim is how his convictions on fighting for middle class families run deep. It's personal. As a governor, a coach, a teacher, and a veteran, he's delivered for working families like his own.""

""We are going to build a great partnership,"" her statement continued. ""We start out as underdogs but I believe together, we can win this election.""

As the new presumptive vice presidential nominee, Walz promptly began a five-day tour of seven battleground states, beginning with a stop in Philadelphia on Tuesday evening.

On Tuesday, Kamala Harris announced that she has selected Walz as her running mate on the 2024 Democratic ticket. While examples of Walz’s quirky Minnesota charm have gone viral on social media in recent weeks, he’s still largely unknown — with early polls showing that over 60 percent of the country doesn’t know enough about him to form an opinion.

The governor is introducing himself to voters as a candidate through an ad showcasing his small-town roots and political philosophy.

“Sometimes life is as much about the lessons you learn as the lessons you teach,” Walz narrates in a nod to his more than two decades working as a high school teacher and football coach.

I codified abortion rights after Roe got overturned because I go to work for the common good. But enough about me, let’s talk about you, because that’s what this election is about,” he said.

Walz and Harris will make their debut to the public at a rally Tuesday afternoon in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Later that night, the new ticket will host a joint virtual fundraiser to add to what is already expected to be a multi-million dollar fundraising haul in the aftermath of the announcement.

The tourism message in Maui that ‘has managed to stick around’.,https://www.cnn.com/travel/first-anniversary-maui-wildfires-tourism/index.html,"CNN —

On August 8, 2023, an out-of-control wildfire fueled by winds from Hurricane Dora ripped through the town of Lahaina on Maui’s west coast.

Ua Aloha Maji, a lifelong Lahaina resident, was at his house in Lahainaluna, about a mile inland of the town center when the fire began.

From his perch on the hillside, he watched in disbelief as the flames set off small explosions and devoured houses and cars, taking with them many of his friends, community members and childhood memories.

“I grew up in Lahaina; I’ve been here my whole life,” Maji said. “I was trying to hold it all together.”

Maji did what he could to help those around him. With the power out, he went house-to-house with a generator, cycling to neighbors’ refrigerators to keep their food fresh as well as to charge phones and power medical devices.

But there was nothing he could do to save Lahaina. The fast-moving fire took the lives of at least 100 people and destroyed more than 2,200 structures, including homes, apartments and historical buildings.

In a relative blink of an eye, Lahaina, one of the most historic towns in Hawai‘i, was gone.

What followed were days, weeks and months of community organization and support. In the past year, hotels in West Maui have housed more than 7,000 displaced residents. Grassroots organizations – official and unofficial – have done countless hours of selfless work.

Maji said there were three community hubs in his neighborhood alone.

“Everyone really stepped up and helped each other on a level we haven’t seen before,” Maji said. “This was an elevated sharing of kōkua,” the Hawaiian concept of “help” or selfless giving.

Yet a year later, long-term stability for Maui remains elusive. Despite challenging times and some complicated feelings, the island is urging visitors to come back and be a part of the recovery as residents and businesses continue to struggle economically.

“The immediate task before us is clear: Let visitors know that it’s a great time to return and rediscover the island of Maui,” said Ilihia Gionson, public affairs officer for the Hawai‘i Tourism Authority.

Challenging times: Can tourism help?

In the immediate aftermath of the fire, tourism to the entire island was suspended for about two weeks so that resources could be dedicated to the recovery effort. West Maui remained closed to visitors until November.

At that time, tourists were asked to return to the island, but it was a soft sell, because thousands of displaced residents were still living in hotel rooms.

In recent months, the Hawaiʻi Tourism Authority (HTA) has begun to restress the importance of welcoming and encouraging visitors as part of the larger recovery effort.

“Our aim is to ensure that residents have the jobs and financial opportunities to heal and thrive,” said Mufi Hannemann, HTA Board Chair. “Job and financial security are directly tied to housing and food security, which are vital to physical and psychological recovery. It’s our sincere hope to restore a sense of security and normalcy to Maui residents after they’ve faced such extreme loss and uncertainty.”

The impacts of the economic downturn were highlighted last month in a study conducted by the Hawaiʻi State Rural Health Association. It found that a significant number of Maui County residents are suffering from mental health issues and financial strain. Many are thinking about leaving the island because of the poor economic conditions after the fire.

Maji said he knows many people who fit this description. Economically, he said he saw his cost-of-living expenses go up by $1,500 a month in the wake of the fire, with his bills now totaling $4,000 a month.

“And that’s on the low end of what people are paying [in housing costs and bills],” Maji said.

In March, the HTA launched a recovery campaign called “Mākaukau Maui,” which means “Maui is Ready.” The idea was to help revitalize Maui’s economy, get people back to work and signal to potential visitors that they are welcome.

But so far, visitors haven’t got the message in the numbers the island needs, and the economy remains behind.

In the first half of 2024, Maui saw a 23.8% decrease in visitor arrivals from the same period last year, and a 24% drop in visitor spending. The average number of daily visitors on Maui was down 22% in June 2024 when compared with June 2023.

Don Prestage, president of Sail Maui, said that two of his boats were moored off Lahaina Harbor the day of the fire but were far enough offshore to avoid damage. Still, the fires and subsequent downturn in tourism has had a significant effect on the company, including a full halt of business in the weeks after the fire and then the logistics of moving their operations from Lahaina to Ma‘alaea, which took several months to arrange permitting.

He said the worst part has been watching some of his employees leave Maui because of the economic downturn.

“That’s been one of the harder things to see,” Prestage said. “People that haven’t been able to stay in the community – people left [Maui] because they couldn’t work.”

Complicated feelings

The recovery of tourism was slow and difficult in the beginning because of the immensity of the devastation. Now, the recovery is still slow and difficult, and there’s no singular explanation for why.

But one reason might be that complicated feelings about the appropriate time to engage in carefree leisure activities as the local population struggles to rebuild are getting passed on to potential visitors.

Prestage said many of his customers at Sail Maui over the past year have expressed that they were hesitant to visit Maui because they weren’t sure whehter it was appropriate to come and have fun, especially in the early days when thousands of residents still lived in hotels.

Protests back in the fall also undoubtedly shaped public opinion, although those protests were more about the housing crisis than being anti-tourist.

“People I talk to say, ‘We were nervous to come and afraid we weren’t welcome or wanted,’ ” Prestage said.

Maui residents have had the tough task of balancing the local recovery effort and ongoing housing crisis with the economic recovery effort for the island as a whole. Prestage said that business owners “are in the awkward position of having to move on more quickly” than most.

“We need to be respectful for so much devastation and loss,” Prestage said. “But on the other hand, people need to work, and there are people supporting other family members on the island.”

He said people should remember that most visitors are respectful and come because they truly love Maui.

Ben Shank, general manager of the Four Seasons Resort in Wailea, said that Maui’s initial message asking tourists not to come immediately after the fire was appropriate but “has managed to stick around,” hurting the economy and continuing the residual impact of the fire.

Making sure visitors know they are welcome back to the island is crucial to improving the economic situation, which is “key to how the island thrives,” he said.

“Obviously, there are people who have been dramatically affected, but there’s also a huge population of folks who help take care of one another,” Shank said. “By supporting the island and having people come and enjoy it, that fuels the entire island.”

As a cultural practitioner for the local nonprofit Kipuka Olowalu and a gigging local musician, he enjoys sharing his homeland with visitors and believes they should be welcomed in the “old Hawaiian way.”

“In Lahaina, our elders were always graceful,” he said. “They had empathy and love for perfect strangers, and they never judged them.”

When visiting, Maji advises against staying at an Airbnb or vacation rental at this time because of the ongoing housing crisis. (Many vacation rentals have been converted to long-term housing for displaced residents, with more changes possibly on the way).

Instead, he recommends staying at one of the many beautiful Maui hotels that employ locals, and to seek out small shops and restaurants.

“Don’t just stay at an Airbnb and shop for groceries at Walmart,” he said. “Come out and see us.”

When visiting establishments and meeting local people, Maji said not to pry about the fire.

“If someone wants to talk, they will,” he said. “A lot of people are really traumatized, so don’t ask, and don’t stick your finger in the wound. Don’t demand to know what a person’s experience was.”

When choosing activities, Ashley Roussel, sales manager at Sail Maui, said visitors should seek out local companies who are promoting Hawaiian values in their programming, prioritizing environmental awareness, using local catering and instilling a “sense of place” in their employees and clientele.

Visitors should not be afraid to vet companies before giving them their money.

“I think there’s an opportunity for visitors to be selective about the way they participate with providers here,” Roussel said. “Choose vendors that show an extra layer of mindfulness of the cultural environment.”

If you want to take things a step further and take direct action in the local communities, the HTA has ongoing volunteer programs that can also earn you discounts on your stay. Many hotels also offer such packages. Be sure to inquire when booking.

For love of Lahaina

Along with residential homes, most of the historic district of Lahaina, including Front Street, was destroyed by the August 8th wildfire.

The rebuild and future of this area is still being discussed. Some have proposed rebuilding as it was; others have suggested a complete change to protect it from rising sea levels and to restore some of its original, native landscape and Hawaiian cultural sites.

Rebuilding the historic district could be done in a variety of ways because of the many lives Lahaina has lived.

Originally called Lele and known for its abundance of breadfruit (ulu) trees, the area didn’t begin going by Lahaina until the 17th or 18th century.

The name Lahaina translates to “cruel sun.” In the Hawaiian language, place names are used to describe the conditions and personality of an area, so one could know what to expect before arriving.

Lahaina served as the royal capital of Hawai‘i from 1802 to 1845 before it was moved to Honolulu on O‘ahu.

During this time, Lahaina was also a busy port, providing a place of refuge for international ships exploring the world’s largest ocean. It was also the epicenter for the Pacific whaling industry.

In 1820, the missionaries arrived and took up a presence in Lahaina. The Baldwin Home, built in 1834 and referred to as the “missionary compound,” was Maui’s oldest home before it burned down in the wildfire.

In the mid-19th century, Lahaina became a plantation town during the sugarcane era. The Pioneer Mill Co. smokestack, established in 1860, was one of the few historic landmarks to survive the fire.

More recently, Lahaina became a hub of activity and tourism, with restaurants, shops and tour operators.

Almost everything in this area has been destroyed. But one thing that still remains is Lahaina’s famous banyan tree, which was planted in 1873. It was badly damaged in the fire but has shown signs of life in the past year.

The spelling of the place name Lahaina was the subject of a recent public discussion. Previously, you may have seen it spelled Lāhainā, but language experts now say that Lahaina is the proper way of spelling it, according to historical records.

Lahaina is beloved by many who have visited Maui, but most of all by its local population. Maji said he sends his gratitude to all who have helped his community in the past year.

“Every single person that helped, I thank them personally and am grateful for them,” he said."
Tropical Storm Debby spawns deadly tornadoes and life-threatening flooding in North Carolina.,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/08/weather/tropical-storm-debby-landfall-forecast-thursday/index.html,"CNN —

After causing at least six deaths in the Southeast, Debby has weakened to a tropical depression and is still dumping rain and threatening tornadoes Thursday afternoon, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Tropical Depression Debby is now centered 45 miles east of Charlotte, North Carolina, according to the center’s 5 p.m. advisory. Debby is moving to the north-northwest at 10 mph and is expected to quickly accelerate over the next 24 hours.

“Heavy rainfall across portions of the Carolinas is expected to persist through today along with areas of considerable flooding,” the hurricane center said. “Heavy rainfall will also result in considerable to locally catastrophic flooding impacts across portions of the Mid-Atlantic states and Northeast through Saturday morning.”

The death toll from the storm rose to six after it spawned a destructive tornado Thursday that killed a man in Lucama, North Carolina. The tornado damaged homes and a school in the area, which is around 35 miles southeast of Raleigh.

Track the storm: Debby’s path

Since crashing into Florida as a Category 1 hurricane on Monday, Debby has dumped more than a foot of rain over parts of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. The deluges have engorged rivers, flooded roadways and trapped people in cars, homes and boats – and potentially dangerous heat is expected across the region in the coming days, threatening to complicate the recovery process.

Even more chaos is on the horizon as the storm, a reflection of the amplifying consequences of human-fueled climate change, heads toward the Northeast. Here’s the latest:

• Debby’s death toll climbs: One person is dead after a tornado spawned by Debby tore through part of North Carolina’s Wilson County in the earliest hours of Thursday morning, leaving behind damage to a middle school, a church and multiple homes. A man was killed after his home in the town of Lucama collapsed, a county spokesperson told CNN. At least four people in Florida and one in Georgia were also killed by Debby.

• At least a dozen tornadoes confirmed: Debby has whipped up at least a dozen tornadoes as of Thursday that have roared through parts of Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia. A tornado in Snow Hill, North Carolina early Thursday was described as “large, extremely dangerous and potentially deadly.” A tornado watch is in effect through 8 p.m. ET for 6.8 million people in parts of eastern North Carolina and southern Virginia, including the cities of Raleigh, Virginia Beach and Richmond.

• Flash flood emergency: Debby’s torrential rainfall cut off one North Carolina town from its surrounding areas after up to 8 inches of rain fell in just a few hours Wednesday night, according to a rare flash flood emergency issued by the National Weather Service. Officials in Bladenboro – located in the southern part of the state – reported 3 foot deep floodwater.

• Debby’s current path: The system will pick up additional speed and lose more strength Thursday as it moves through North Carolina and into northern Virginia by Friday morning. Debby will accelerate through Pennsylvania and New York Friday and move through New England by early Saturday afternoon, bringing heavy rain and flash flooding to a region drenched by storms earlier this week.

• ‘Be prepared for a deluge,’ North Carolina governor says: Gov. Roy Cooper warned residents Wednesday to brace for major rain and flooding. “All North Carolinians across our state need to be prepared for a deluge,” Cooper said, describing the incoming threat as “more rain than most of us see in a month, or even several months.” Rainfall totals across the state surpassed a foot by early Thursday afternoon. Dangerous rip currents and storm surge up to 3 feet will persist along the Carolinas’ coasts Thursday.

• Disaster declarations across the Southeast: President Joe Biden has approved disaster declarations for Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas – all of which have been pummeled by Debby this week. More than 700 Federal Emergency Management Agency personnel have been deployed to the Southeast, and search and rescue teams are on standby to assist as needed, the agency said Wednesday.

• Georgia dam at risk of ‘imminent failure’: A dam in Bulloch County, Georgia – about 50 miles northwest of Savannah – is in danger of “imminent failure” as a result of Debby’s torrential rainfall, the National Weather Service in Charleston, South Carolina, said. Parts of the county have already suffered serious flooding, requiring water rescues in a mobile home park. But if the dam breaks, communities immediately downstream are at the greatest risk for more flooding and may be asked to evacuate.

• Triple-digit heat in store for Southeast: Potentially dangerous heat has been hovering over the Southeast in Debby’s wake and is expected to persist through the weekend as storm recovery continues. While high temperatures in the upper 80s and lower 90s are expected, the heat indices – how the body feels under combined heat and humidity – could exceed 110 degrees, including in Steinhatchee, Florida, near where Debby made its first landfall.

‘It’s like National Geographic in our backyard’

Debby’s deluge has been a clear illustration of the impact of global warming caused by fossil fuel pollution, which is causing storms to get wetter and strengthen more quickly. Debby, for instance, tracked through near-record warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico, which helped it rapidly intensify before making landfall as a hurricane in Florida.

As Debby has churned through the Southeast, the storm has left behind disastrous scenes. Homes have been shredded by winds and swamped by floodwaters, and roads have been washed out or submerged, creating hazardous conditions for impacted communities.

In South Carolina’s Lowcountry, a home in Bluffton has become an alligator’s paradise as floodwaters turned Adrienne LeBlanc’s yard into an inviting swampland.

Though LeBlanc is no stranger to alligators – often seeing them sunbathing in the distance – she was surprised to wake up after heavy rains Wednesday to discover her backyard had been invaded by alligators.

“It’s like National Geographic in our backyard right now,” LeBlanc told CNN. She counted eight alligators swimming around her house and saw a few of them wrestling.

Adrienne LeBlanc snapped a picture of an alligator in her flooded yard in Bluffton, South Carolina, on Wednesday. Adrienne LeBlanc

“Jokingly I told my husband, ‘When I wake up tomorrow that bad boy is going to be in our bedroom,’” LeBlanc said.

After 17 years of living in Bluffton, LeBlanc said she has experienced this level of flooding once – when Hurricane Matthew made landfall in the state in 2016.

South Carolina hasn’t seen a named storm make landfall on its shores since Hurricane Ian’s arrival in 2022 as a Category 1 storm. The last named storm to track across the state in any fashion was Tropical Storm Idalia in August 2023.

Debby made its second U.S. landfall around 2 a.m. near Bulls Bay, South Carolina, just northeast of Charleston, according to the National Hurricane Center. In a matter of hours, over half a foot of rain had fallen in parts of central North Carolina, causing ""life threatening flash flooding"" as waterways crested, turning roads into rivers.

Debby is expected to drop 4 to 8 inches of rain − some areas could get up to 15 inches − across parts of the Carolinas and Virginia on Thursday and Friday, bringing ""considerable to locally catastrophic flash flooding impacts,"" the weather service's Storm Prediction Center said. All told, rain totals in some parts of South Carolina could exceed 2 feet.

In the days ahead, the storm is forecast to weaken as it picks up speed and moves north, dumping up to 6 inches of rain from Maryland to Vermont. Flood watches throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions are set to activate Thursday evening and last through Friday night.

Across Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, Debby has drenched communities in over a foot of rain, breaking several decades-old records. Flash flooding triggered water rescues, overtook roads and breached several dams as winds knocked over trees and tangled power lines. Officials have said at least seven people have died as a result of the storm.

Developments:

∎ Millions of people from southeast Georgia up through the Carolinas and western New York were under flood advisories, according to the National Weather Service. Parts of North Carolina and Virginia, including the cities of Wakefield and Virginia Beach, were under tornado watches.

∎ Virginia's Department of Emergency Management warned residents to stay aware of possible tornadoes Thursday and Friday. ""Tropical Storm Debby has the potential to create tornadoes, with the threat potentially lasting through the overnight hours,"" the post said.

∎ Cleanup crews have cleared over 245 miles of road and eight acres of debris across Florida, according to the state's Division of Emergency Management. Emergency responders in high-water vehicles and on foot rescued at least 120 people trapped by floodwaters.

Over 150,000 in the dark; Duke Energy scrambles to fix outages in NC

From Florida to Virginia, over 150,000 homes and businesses were without power Thursday afternoon, according to USA TODAY's Power Outage Tracker.

The majority of outages – over 133,000 – were reported in North Carolina, which has been pummeled by Debby’s most intense conditions since the tropical storm made landfall around 2 a.m. Thursday. The largest utility provider in the state, Duke Energy, reported 111,534 outages as of noon. On Wednesday, Duke Energy said it had 7,500 linemen and other employees staged across the Carolinas to respond to power outages.

South Carolina reported over 8,800 outages and Virginia had over 6,200, according to PowerOutage.us. In addition, more than 260,000 homes and businesses were out of power in Ohio, the result of Tuesday storms impacted by Debby.

More than 7,000 utility customers across northern Florida’s Big Bend region, where Debby made its first U.S. landfall on Monday, were still in the dark after four days. Since Wednesday, northern Florida and other parts of the South have been baked by a heat wave that raised temperatures into the high 90s and heat index levels into the triple digits.

Death toll rises to at least 7 after tornado kills man in North Carolina

A man in Wilson County, North Carolina, was found dead in his home after a tornado touched down in the area, bringing Debby's death toll to at least seven.

Stephen Mann, director of communication for Wilson County, told USA TODAY on Thursday that a twister tore through the outskirts of Lucama, a town 35 miles southeast of Raleigh, sometime before 3 a.m. A middle school, a church and four homes sustained structural damage. Inside one of the homes, a search and rescue team discovered the body of an adult male, Mann said.

Officials have tied Debby to at least six other deaths, five in Florida and one in Georgia. In the southern Georgia city of Moultrie, a tree fell onto a home, killing a 19-year-old, Gov. Brian Kemp said Tuesday. In Florida, two adults and one teenager were killed in fatal vehicle accidents; also, a 13-year-old boy died after a fallen tree landed on a mobile home; and officials on Tuesday found the body of a boater who had been missing near the city of Gulfport.

Early Thursday morning, officials confirmed a tornado touched down in North Carolina's Sampson County, damaging two homes, according to weather service reports. A suspected tornado was also reported in Pender County. Across South Carolina and Florida, Debby spawned eight tornadoes earlier this week.

At historic North Carolina inn, 'it's literally raining inside'

Thursday quickly became a tough day at work for hotel manager Elise Tyler, when the ceiling of the Colonial Inn in Hillsborough, North Carolina, began to leak rainwater and drain systems couldn’t keep up with the heavy downpour.

“We are on the verge of flooded,” said Tyler, 37. “Several areas of the inn are dripping and it’s literally raining inside.”

The 200-year-old building had not lost power, but the lights were flickering, Tyler said. Nearby roads were closed because of flooding and some staff who lost power at their homes took advantage of empty hotel rooms to shower and charge their phones, she said.

The Colonial is located in a historic block of Hillsborough, close to the site of a Revolutionary War battle, and the building was pillaged by Union troops, according to the hotel's website.

Known for its restaurant’s weekend brunch, the inn got a lot of customers Wednesday, Tyler said, likely because people were anticipating hunkering down Thursday – when only “one brave soul” came in for lunch.

Forecasters eye another system in the Atlantic

Just as Debby continues to pound the East Coast, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center are also keeping an eye on a developing system near the Caribbean islands.

""An area of low pressure could form in the central or western tropical Atlantic Ocean early next week,"" the center said in an online forecast released Thursday morning. ""Some development of this system is possible while it approaches the Lesser Antilles during the early to middle part of next week and moves generally west-northwestward toward the Greater Antilles thereafter.""

The system has a 30% chance of becoming a tropical depression or named storm within the next week. The next name on the 2024 storm list is Ernesto. It's far too soon to determine whether the system will impact any land areas, including the U.S.

Where is Tropical Storm Debby?

Tropical Storm Debby gained speed but lost intensity as it moved farther inland Thursday, hours after making its second U.S. landfall, the National Hurricane Center said.

According to a 2 p.m. update, the storm was moving north-northwest at 10 mph, twice as fast as when it was recorded several hours earlier. Debby was located 55 miles southeast of Charlotte, North Carolina, and 100 miles southwest of Raleigh, with sustained winds of 40 mph, down from 50 mph at 8 a.m., according to the center.

Debby is forecast to continue weakening over the next day, becoming a tropical depression by as early as Thursday afternoon before merging with a front on Friday and being downgraded to an extratropical cyclone.

On Friday, Debby is expected to move across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions before emerging over Canada on Saturday, according to the hurricane center.

North Carolina resident prepared campground for Debby

In Raeford, North Carolina, Michelle Morville said her property got a few inches of rain overnight but hasn’t flooded or lost power. “It poured and is still raining here with more to come,” Morville said Thursday morning.

Her campground, Idlewild Farm Stays, is terraced to allow for erosion control so there’s no standing water, Morville said. Rain flows properly down a main driveway during storms, and after the current downpour passes, Morville said she will use a land plane on the road to clear any remaining moisture.

Many people who come to the farm are visiting family members serving in the military on nearby Fort Liberty, formerly Fort Bragg, Morville said. This week, she is offering discounted rates to anyone needing to move their camper or RV out of a flood zone.

“Most flooding issues I believe come from a lack of regard for Mother Nature and not planning accordingly to work with her,” Morville said.

Reopening begins after flooding cuts off North Carolina town

Authorities in Bladenboro, North Carolina, began reopening several main roads after the town was completely cut off by floodwaters overnight.

""Water has receded in some areas. Crews will begin reopening up roads here shortly,"" said a statement on the county's Facebook page. Much of the downtown was still closed as standing water remained several inches deep in some areas.

Just before midnight, as Debby approached the South Carolina coast, a statement on Bladenboro's Facebook page announced, ""Downtown is underwater. We have several street closures out. Please stay off the roads!"" Within an hour, the local fire department said, ""Due to flooded roadways all roads into Bladenboro are closed.""

As the heavy rains and tornado threat shifted away from the area toward more northern parts of North Carolina and Virginia, the town has begun to assess the damage and reopen main roads. ""Many secondary roads have not been checked, use caution,"" the fire department warned early Thursday."

The death toll from the storm rose to six after it spawned a destructive tornado Thursday that killed a man in Lucama, North Carolina. The tornado damaged homes and a school in the area, which is around 35 miles southeast of Raleigh.

Track the storm: Debby’s path

Since crashing into Florida as a Category 1 hurricane on Monday, Debby has dumped more than a foot of rain over parts of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. The deluges have engorged rivers, flooded roadways and trapped people in cars, homes and boats – and potentially dangerous heat is expected across the region in the coming days, threatening to complicate the recovery process.

Even more chaos is on the horizon as the storm, a reflection of the amplifying consequences of human-fueled climate change, heads toward the Northeast. Here’s the latest:

• Debby’s death toll climbs: One person is dead after a tornado spawned by Debby tore through part of North Carolina’s Wilson County in the earliest hours of Thursday morning, leaving behind damage to a middle school, a church and multiple homes. A man was killed after his home in the town of Lucama collapsed, a county spokesperson told CNN. At least four people in Florida and one in Georgia were also killed by Debby.

Tropical Storm Debby made a second landfall in South Carolina early Thursday morning after spawning tornadoes in North Carolina.

Copied

Tropical Storm Debby came back ashore in South Carolina on the evening of Aug. 7, unleashing new rounds of flooding.

Tropical Storm Debby made its second U.S. landfall early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina, about 20 miles northeast of Charleston. Maximum sustained wind speeds were 50 mph as it moved inland at 5 mph, exacerbating ongoing flooding across the Carolinas that has promoted curfews, road closures and widespread disruptions.

AccuWeather's Tony Laubach was in Georgetown, South Carolina, at the time of Debby's second landfall. Storm chaser Aaron Rigsby reported live from Elizabethtown, North Carolina, late in the evening of Aug. 7, as the northern side of Tropical Storm Debby caused flash flooding.

Three tornadoes were reported Wednesday and Wednesday night in the state. One twister overnight in Wilson County was the site of a fatality, WRAL reported. Tornadoes damaged homes Wednesday in Harrells, a town in Sampson County, and a tornado was recorded on video near Maple Hill in Pender County.

Rainfall amounts from Tropical Storm Debby this week, as of Thursday morning.

After dropping more than 20 inches of rain in Florida and 15 inches in South Carolina, rainfall reports in southeastern North Carolina rose to more than 11 inches Wednesday night.

The storm knocked out power to at least 133,000 customers in North Carolina on Thursday morning, according to PowerOutage.US, though the number of outages was down to just over 80,000 by afternoon.

On Wednesday afternoon, the Canoochee River near Claxton, Georgia, a town that received over a foot of rain this week, broke its 100-year record height of 17.80 feet.

Debby makes landfall in Florida, sparks tornadoes and flooding in Carolinas

Debby is a 3 on the AccuWeather RealImpact™ Scale for Hurricanes in the United States due to dangerous storm surge, life-threatening flooding rain and strong winds. The storm has already been responsible for at least seven fatalities, all of which were reported in Florida near where Debby roared ashore Monday except for a 60-year-old man who, according to WRAL, died when a tornado passed over his North Carolina home Wednesday as Debby closed in for its second landfall.

Debby will continue to bring impacts of strong winds, life-threatening flooding, isolated tornadoes, dangerous surf and storm surge as it meanders over the Carolinas Thursday.

“Our emergency crews and city staff are working around the clock to keep our residents safe,"" Charleston Mayor William Cogswell said in a press release on Tuesday. ""Safety of our residents and staff is our top priority.”

AccuWeather’s Tony Laubach reported live from Georgetown, South Carolina, at the time of Debby’s second landfall, with a surprisingly calm view.

President Joe Biden has approved an emergency declaration for South Carolina as the state deals with the impacts of Tropical Storm Debby. The declaration allows FEMA to coordinate disaster relief efforts and provide resources and equipment to the state as well as assistance and reimbursement for mass care, evacuation and shelter support.

After making two United States landfalls, which AccuWeather hurricane experts correctly predicted, Debby will sweep northward across the eastern U.S. AccuWeather meteorologists are becoming increasingly concerned that life-threatening, flooding rainfall and isolated tornadoes will heighten the risk to lives and property across the mid-Atlantic and Northeast into the weekend.

Residents remember recent major floods

Those living in the eastern Carolinas - an area vulnerable to flooding from tropical storms and hurricanes - have been through this before. Debby's threat of flooding is reminding residents of the area's vulnerability to flooding from tropical storms; between 2015 and 2018, three major floods gripped the eastern parts of North and South Carolina.

Hurricane Florence 2018

Florence brought torrential rain to North and South Carolina, particularly affecting the Pee Dee River basin in northeastern South Carolina. The storm caused rivers to swell and overflow, leading to extensive flooding that damaged homes, roads and infrastructure. Both North Carolina's and South Carolina's records for highest rainfall totals from a single tropical storm were established during Florence: 23.63 inches at Loris, South Carolina, and 35.93 inches at Elizabethtown, North Carolina.

Hurricane Matthew 2016

Two years before Florence, Hurricane Matthew dropped 1-2 feet of rain from the Georgia coast to southeastern Virginia. Heavy rainfall led to significant river flooding, which impacted communities and caused extensive damage.

Hurricane Joaquin 2015

Often referred to as a 1,000-year flood, this event was caused by a combination of a stalled low-pressure system and moisture from Hurricane Joaquin. The unprecedented rainfall led to catastrophic flooding across much of the state, particularly in the Midlands and Lowcountry regions. Many areas received more than 20 inches of rain, resulting in dam failures, road closures and widespread property damage.

Prior floods of note

Although South Carolina was spared the worst of Hurricane Dorian in 2019, the storm still brought heavy rain and caused localized flooding, particularly along the coast, where more than a foot of rain fell.

Hurricane Floyd in 1999 brought record rainfall, causing rivers to overflow in the Carolinas, resulting in catastrophic flooding. The flooding was compounded by Hurricane Dennis's saturation of the ground just weeks earlier.

In 1996, Hurricane Fran's heavy rain caused rivers and streams to overflow their banks, resulting in widespread damage to homes, roads and infrastructure."

Tropical Storm Debby — which has been drenching parts of the Southeast after making landfall as a Category 1 hurricane in Florida’s Big Bend region earlier this week — made a second landfall, in South Carolina, bringing with it more heavy rain, tornadoes and the threat of severe flooding along the East Coast.

The Associated Press reported that one person died in a home damaged by a tornado in Lucama, N.C., on Thursday, raising the storm's overall death toll to seven. The National Weather Service confirmed at least four tornadoes spawned by Debby have touched down.

Where is the storm, exactly?

According to an update from the National Hurricane Center on Thursday, Debby was moving north through the Carolinas after making landfall near Charleston.

Location: 80 miles southeast of Charlotte, N.C.

Maximum sustained winds: 40 mph

Present movement: Northwest at 10 mph

(National Weather Service)

The storm is expected to weaken as it accelerates across South Carolina and North Carolina Thursday before moving through the mid-Atlantic and Northeast as a tropical depression on Friday and Saturday.

What are the biggest risks associated with Debby?

Rain and storm surge, forecasters say.

Debby is expected to produce an additional 3 to 9 inches of rainfall with locally higher amounts, leading to maximum storm total amounts as high as 25 inches in parts of the Carolinas through Friday.

In addition, the “combination of storm surge and tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline,” the hurricane center said.

Where is the greatest risk for flooding right now?

(National Weather Service)

Along the Carolina coast, the water level could reach 1 to 3 feet above ground “if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide,” the hurricane center warned.

What other areas could see impacts from Tropical Storm Debby?

(National Weather Service)

Debby is expected to merge with a frontal boundary over the mid-Atlantic on Friday, bringing heavy rain and the potential for flash flooding from Virginia to Vermont through the weekend."

SO IT’S IT’S COMING THROUGH NOW, ESPECIALLY THE TRIAD SEEN THE FIRST BRUNT OF THIS HEAVY RAIN BAND COMING IN FOR THE MOUNTAINS AND FOOTHILLS. IT’S GOING TO KIND OF WORK. ITS WAY IN OVER THE COURSE OF THE MORNING AND ESPECIALLY THE AFTERNOON. I THINK OUR MAIN RAIN IMPACT WINDOW, THE STEADIEST AND AT TIMES HEAVIEST RAIN, ESPECIALLY THE STEADY PART OF THAT STATEMENT, WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE EARLY PART OF THE AFTERNOON TODAY. AND THEN WE’LL SEE MORE OF THIS SCATTERED STUFF TRACKING THROUGH OUR AREA. STORM IS ON SHORE AGAIN. THAT HAPPENED ABOUT 2 A.M. IN THE THE BULL’S BAY AREA ALONG THE SOUTH CAROLINA COAST, AND YOU CAN SEE THE HEAVIEST RAIN BAND. WE’VE BEEN WATCHING THIS SINCE YESTERDAY. NOW, WHEN IT WAS IN SOUTH CAROLINA, CONTINUES TO MOVE NORTH. CAME ON SHORE WITH 50 MILE AN HOUR WINDS MOVING NOW TO THE NORTHWEST AT ABOUT FIVE MILES PER HOUR SHOULD FLATTEN OUT NORTH AND EVENTUALLY ACCELERATE OUT TO THE NORTHEAST. AT THIS POINT, I’M NOT GOING TO SHOW THE TRACK VERY MUCH THIS MORNING BECAUSE IT’S HERE. I’M SHOWING IT FOR FOLKS WHO MIGHT BE TRAVELING. KEEP THAT IN MIND THAT BY FRIDAY AT 2:00, IT’S HERE. AND LOOK AT THE DISTANCE IT COVERS IN A SPAN OF 12 HOUR JUMPS. SO THIS IS GOING TO MOVE OUT VERY QUICKLY. IT’S GOOD NEWS FOR US. THAT MEANS IT SHOULD START TO PULL OUT OF OUR AREA OVERNIGHT. BUT IT IS A A SLOW MOVER AT THE MOMENT. RAIN IS MOVING IN. YOU CAN SEE THE TRIAD GETTING INUNDATED WITH RAIN. IT HAS REACHED WINSTON-SALEM AND IS MOVING INTO THE KING AREA OF SURRY COUNTY, SEEING SOME INTERMITTENT SHOWERS. IT’S ABOUT TO GET STEADY.

Tropical Storm Debby spawns deadly tornadoes and life-threatening flooding in North Carolina.,https://www.aol.com/tropical-storm-debby-nears-2nd-042638497.html,"After causing at least six deaths in the Southeast, Debby has weakened to a tropical depression and is still dumping rain and threatening tornadoes Thursday afternoon, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Tropical Depression Debby is now centered 45 miles east of Charlotte, North Carolina, according to the center’s 5 p.m. advisory. Debby is moving to the north-northwest at 10 mph and is expected to quickly accelerate over the next 24 hours.

“Heavy rainfall across portions of the Carolinas is expected to persist through today along with areas of considerable flooding,” the hurricane center said. “Heavy rainfall will also result in considerable to locally catastrophic flooding impacts across portions of the Mid-Atlantic states and Northeast through Saturday morning.”

The death toll from the storm rose to six after it spawned a destructive tornado Thursday that killed a man in Lucama, North Carolina. The tornado damaged homes and a school in the area, which is around 35 miles southeast of Raleigh.

Track the storm: Debby’s path

Since crashing into Florida as a Category 1 hurricane on Monday, Debby has dumped more than a foot of rain over parts of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. The deluges have engorged rivers, flooded roadways and trapped people in cars, homes and boats – and potentially dangerous heat is expected across the region in the coming days, threatening to complicate the recovery process.

Even more chaos is on the horizon as the storm, a reflection of the amplifying consequences of human-fueled climate change, heads toward the Northeast. Here’s the latest:

• Debby’s death toll climbs: One person is dead after a tornado spawned by Debby tore through part of North Carolina’s Wilson County in the earliest hours of Thursday morning, leaving behind damage to a middle school, a church and multiple homes. A man was killed after his home in the town of Lucama collapsed, a county spokesperson told CNN. At least four people in Florida and one in Georgia were also killed by Debby.

• At least a dozen tornadoes confirmed: Debby has whipped up at least a dozen tornadoes as of Thursday that have roared through parts of Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia. A tornado in Snow Hill, North Carolina early Thursday was described as “large, extremely dangerous and potentially deadly.” A tornado watch is in effect through 8 p.m. ET for 6.8 million people in parts of eastern North Carolina and southern Virginia, including the cities of Raleigh, Virginia Beach and Richmond.

• Flash flood emergency: Debby’s torrential rainfall cut off one North Carolina town from its surrounding areas after up to 8 inches of rain fell in just a few hours Wednesday night, according to a rare flash flood emergency issued by the National Weather Service. Officials in Bladenboro – located in the southern part of the state – reported 3 foot deep floodwater.

• Debby’s current path: The system will pick up additional speed and lose more strength Thursday as it moves through North Carolina and into northern Virginia by Friday morning. Debby will accelerate through Pennsylvania and New York Friday and move through New England by early Saturday afternoon, bringing heavy rain and flash flooding to a region drenched by storms earlier this week.

• ‘Be prepared for a deluge,’ North Carolina governor says: Gov. Roy Cooper warned residents Wednesday to brace for major rain and flooding. “All North Carolinians across our state need to be prepared for a deluge,” Cooper said, describing the incoming threat as “more rain than most of us see in a month, or even several months.” Rainfall totals across the state surpassed a foot by early Thursday afternoon. Dangerous rip currents and storm surge up to 3 feet will persist along the Carolinas’ coasts Thursday.

• Disaster declarations across the Southeast: President Joe Biden has approved disaster declarations for Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas – all of which have been pummeled by Debby this week. More than 700 Federal Emergency Management Agency personnel have been deployed to the Southeast, and search and rescue teams are on standby to assist as needed, the agency said Wednesday.

• Georgia dam at risk of ‘imminent failure’: A dam in Bulloch County, Georgia – about 50 miles northwest of Savannah – is in danger of “imminent failure” as a result of Debby’s torrential rainfall, the National Weather Service in Charleston, South Carolina, said. Parts of the county have already suffered serious flooding, requiring water rescues in a mobile home park. But if the dam breaks, communities immediately downstream are at the greatest risk for more flooding and may be asked to evacuate.

• Triple-digit heat in store for Southeast: Potentially dangerous heat has been hovering over the Southeast in Debby’s wake and is expected to persist through the weekend as storm recovery continues. While high temperatures in the upper 80s and lower 90s are expected, the heat indices – how the body feels under combined heat and humidity – could exceed 110 degrees, including in Steinhatchee, Florida, near where Debby made its first landfall.

‘It’s like National Geographic in our backyard’

Debby’s deluge has been a clear illustration of the impact of global warming caused by fossil fuel pollution, which is causing storms to get wetter and strengthen more quickly. Debby, for instance, tracked through near-record warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico, which helped it rapidly intensify before making landfall as a hurricane in Florida.

As Debby has churned through the Southeast, the storm has left behind disastrous scenes. Homes have been shredded by winds and swamped by floodwaters, and roads have been washed out or submerged, creating hazardous conditions for impacted communities.

In South Carolina’s Lowcountry, a home in Bluffton has become an alligator’s paradise as floodwaters turned Adrienne LeBlanc’s yard into an inviting swampland.

Though LeBlanc is no stranger to alligators – often seeing them sunbathing in the distance – she was surprised to wake up after heavy rains Wednesday to discover her backyard had been invaded by alligators.

“It’s like National Geographic in our backyard right now,” LeBlanc told CNN. She counted eight alligators swimming around her house and saw a few of them wrestling.

“Jokingly I told my husband, ‘When I wake up tomorrow that bad boy is going to be in our bedroom,’” LeBlanc said.

After 17 years of living in Bluffton, LeBlanc said she has experienced this level of flooding once – when Hurricane Matthew made landfall in the state in 2016.

South Carolina hasn’t seen a named storm make landfall on its shores since Hurricane Ian’s arrival in 2022 as a Category 1 storm. The last named storm to track across the state in any fashion was Tropical Storm Idalia in August 2023.

This is a developing story and will be updated.

At least five people are dead after the storm made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane on Florida’s Gulf Coast on Monday.

Though Debby is now a tropical storm, the worst may be yet to come as Georgia and South Carolina prepare for as much as 25 inches of rain before the storm moves to the northeast later this week.

On Tuesday the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning between Altamaha Sound, Georgia and Surf City, North Carolina.

The storm is expected to bring potentially historic rainfall totals that may trigger catastrophic flooding. The National Hurricane Center says 10 to 20 inches of rain, with cases of up to 25 inches, may fall in the eastern half of South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Friday.

Through Saturday, 3 to 6 inches and local accumulations of up to 8 inches are possible from central South Carolina north to Southwest Virginia, portions of the mid-Atlantic States, western and northern New York State and Northern New England.

As much as 3 inches of scattered rainfall may continue to fall in Georgia through Tuesday.

Tornadoes are possible over coastal South Carolina and North Carolina until Wednesday morning.

The storm has maximum winds of 40 mph and is moving at just 3 mph — a walking pace that will keep rain-bearing clouds in place over areas for a long time.

RELATED STORY | What is the difference between a tropical storm and hurricane?

In Charleston, South Carolina, where eight inches of rain have fallen in the city and as much as six more are forecast, Mayor William Cogswell Jr. extended the city's curfew.

""The curfew is working,"" he said. ""We have written a number of tickets and will continue to do so, so please stay home.""

Local officials reported tornadoes that flipped a car and downed trees and power lines north of the city.

Debby is expected to gather strength after it moves back over the the Atlantic Ocean over the next few days.

In Florida,more than 45,000 were without power as of Tuesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.

Crews in Florida will attempt to restore power and clear roadways on Tuesday now that the storm has moved out of the state.

Debby also disrupted travel. Over 9,000 flights within, into, or out of the U.S. on Monday were delayed, and nearly 2,000 flights were canceled, according to FlightAware. By Tuesday night, there were more than 8,000 flight delays or cancellations within, into, or out of the U.S.

Vice President Kamala Harris and her newly announced running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, on a current tour of battleground states, have postponed previously scheduled stops in North Carolina and Georgia due to the storm."

Dangers from flash urban flooding, severe thunderstorms packing strong wind gusts and fast-moving tornadoes are possible from Interstate 95 to coastal communities into the end of the week.

Copied

Debby is expected to continue moving towards the Northeast, bringing heavy rainfall and the increased risk of flooding to the region this weekend. Tornadoes spawning in the region is another risk.

While torrential rain will lead to small stream and river flooding in the Appalachians of the Northeast, Debby's eastern flank will bring dangers from flash urban flooding to severe thunderstorms, a few tornadoes and storm surge in the zone from Interstate 95 to the coastal communities into the end of the week, AccuWeather meteorologists warn.

A tropical system that tracks well inland undergoes a transition where the steadiest rain tends to fall near and just north and west of the storm track, AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist John Feerick explained.

""Places such as Philadelphia, New York City and Trenton, New Jersey, may have actually received more rain Tuesday night than they will from Debby into Friday night,"" Feerick said, ""So with Debby taking a path generally up the spine of the central Appalachians then toward the St. Lawrence Valley later on, that steady rain corridor will avoid much of the I-95 zone.""

However, although Debby will likely lose its tropical storm designation while over the interior Northeast, it will continue to cause major problems. AccuWeather refers to former tropical systems that continue to cause risk to lives and property as a tropical rainstorm to continue to raise public awareness of a potentially dangerous situation.

The AccuWeather RealImpact Scale™ for Hurricanes in the U.S. is a 3, and for Canada is a 1.

I-95 zone still at risk for flooding problems from Debby

Despite not being in the steady rain zone, bands of showers and thunderstorms farther to the east, originating from the Atlantic Ocean will continue to feed Debby and interact in coastal areas.

These bands will be troublesome for the I-95 metro areas, including Washington, D.C.; Baltimore; Philadelphia; New York City; Boston; Hartford, Connecticut; Providence, Rhode Island; Portland, Maine; Atlantic City, New Jersey; and Richmond and Norfolk, Virginia. Intense downpours lasting minutes to hours will occur within the bands. The nearby northern and western suburbs of the major cities will experience similar problems.

""Where the downpours persist, the risk of flash flooding in urban areas and along small streams will increase substantially,"" Feerick said.

Because torrential downpours earlier this week dumped debris on some areas, rivers may also rise quickly and significantly from southeastern Pennsylvania to New Jersey, southeastern New York and southeastern New England.

Motorists should be prepared to seek an alternate route, as underpasses and other streets and highways that drain poorly can fill with water quickly. Even though the water may appear to be shallow, it may still be rising rapidly or may have washed away the road beneath. This is why experts urge motorists never to attempt to drive through flooded areas.

Debby poses a tornado threat from I-81 corridor to Atlantic coast in Northeast

Along with torrential downpours, severe thunderstorms packing strong wind gusts are likely. Because Debby has shown a history of triggering tornadoes on its eastern flank, AccuWeather meteorologists believe that trend will continue throughout its duration in the United States.

In many cases, the tornadoes will be fast-moving, perhaps exceeding 40 mph, so there will be little time for people to react.

Another concern is that some of the tornadoes will occur during heavy rain or at night, when they may be hard to spot in advance.

People are urged to closely monitor severe weather bulletins and take immediate action if a tornado warning is issued for their location. In some cases with Debby, a tornado may occur without advanced warning, so people should remain aware of their surroundings.

Outside of tornadoes, wind gusts in some of the bands of showers and thunderstorms can be strong enough to knock down trees, cause minor property damage and trigger sporadic power outages. Wind gusts of tropical-storm-force can occur from I-81 to the Atlantic coast.

The increasingly wet soil in the region will have the effect of making trees top-heavy, so even moderate gusty winds could bring some trees down.

Storm surge, coastal flooding are threats from Debby in Northeast

Another serious concern from Debby will be the coastal flood threat.

""A southerly wind initially will cause water to pile through the Chesapeake Bay with no way to escape, meaning water rises of over 3 feet above the routine tides around Baltimore and Annapolis, Maryland,"" Feerick said, ""There will also be coastal flooding during times of high tide along the Delaware Bay and the tidal portion of the Delaware River into the Philadelphia area. New York City Harbor, the East River and the tidal portion of the Hudson River will also to have some of the same problems, as well.""

Some minor coastal flooding can be expected in southeastern Virginia, eastern Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Long Island, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. The worst conditions will occur around high tide.

Some access roads and streets in low-lying coastal communities may be submerged.

Weather to improve this weekend

Conditions will improve as the weekend progresses, as Debby speeds away across Atlantic Canada.

A sweep of dry and cool air is forecast to filter in from the Midwest.

However, some of the water that was pushed into the back bays may flood the western side of the bays for a time. River flooding set into motion by torrential rain will continue. Some rivers may not crest until next week.

Tropical Storm Debby spawns deadly tornadoes and life-threatening flooding in North Carolina.,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/tropical-storm-debby-moves-gulf-151620058.html,"TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Tropical Storm Debby strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane as it approached Florida on Sunday evening, according to the national weather service.

Debby is the fourth named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season after Tropical Storm Alberto, Hurricane Beryl and Tropical Storm Chris, all of which formed in June.

Forecasters warned heavy amounts of rain from Debby could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia.

The storm was expected to make landfall around midday Monday in the Big Bend area of Florida, the hurricane center said. A tornado watch also was in effect for parts of Florida and Georgia until 6 a.m. Monday.

“Right now, we are trying secure everything from floating away,"" said Sheryl Horne, whose family owns the Shell Island Fish Camp along the Wakulla River in St. Marks, Florida, where some customers moved their boats inland. The sparsely populated Big Bend region in the Florida Panhandle was hit last year by Hurricane Idalia, which made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane.

“I am used to storms and I’m used to cleaning up after storms,” Horne said.

Debby was expected to move eastward over northern Florida and then stall over the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina, thrashing the region with potential record-setting rains totaling up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) beginning Tuesday. Officials also warned of life-threatening storm surge along Florida’s Gulf Coast, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation expected Monday between the Ochlockonee and Suwannee rivers.

“There’s some really amazing rainfall totals being forecast and amazing in a bad way,” Michael Brennan, director of the hurricane center, said at a briefing. “That would be record-breaking rainfall associated with a tropical cyclone for both the states of Georgia and South Carolina if we got up to the 30-inch level.”

Flooding impacts could last through Friday and are expected to be especially severe in low-lying areas near the coast, including Savannah, Georgia; Hilton Head, South Carolina; and Charleston, South Carolina. North Carolina officials were monitoring the storm's progress.

Officials in Savannah said the area could see a month’s worth of rain in four days if the system stalls over the region.

“This is going to a significant storm. The word historic cannot be underscored here,” Savannah Mayor Van. R. Johnson said during a press conference.

The hurricane center said at 11 p.m. that Debby was located about 100 miles (161 kilometers) west of Tampa, Florida, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph). The storm was moving north at 12 mph (19 kph).

Debby's outer bands grazed the west coast of Florida, flooding streets and bringing power outages. Sarasota County officials said most roadways on Siesta Key, a barrier island off the coast of Sarasota, were under water. The hurricane center had predicted the system would strengthen as it curved off the southwest Florida coast, where the water has been extremely warm.

At a briefing Sunday afternoon, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned the storm could lead to “really, really significant flooding that will happen in North Central Florida.”

The storm would follow a similar track to Hurricane Idalia but would “be much wetter. We are going to see much more inundation,"" he said.

A hurricane warning was issued for parts of the Big Bend and Florida Panhandle areas, while tropical storm warnings were posted for Florida’s West Coast, the southern Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas. A tropical storm watch extended farther west into the Panhandle.

Tropical storms and hurricanes can trigger river flooding and overwhelm drainage systems and canals. Forecasters warned of 6 to 12 inches (15 centimeters to 30 centimeters) of rain and up to 18 inches (46 centimeters) in isolated areas of Florida.

Storm surge expected to hit Gulf Coast, including Tampa Bay

Flat Florida is prone to flooding even on sunny days and the storm was predicted to bring a surge of 2 to 4 feet (0.6 to 1.2 meters) along most of the Gulf Coast, including Tampa Bay, with a storm tide of up to 7 feet (2.1 meters) north of there in the Big Bend region.

Forecasters warned of “a danger of life-threatening storm surge inundation” in a region that includes Hernando Beach, Crystal River, Steinhatchee and Cedar Key. Officials in Citrus and Levy counties ordered a mandatory evacuation of coastal areas, while those in Hernando, Manatee, Pasco and Taylor counties called for voluntary evacuations. Shelters opened in those and some other counties.

Citrus County Sheriff Mike Prendergast estimated 21,000 people live in his county’s evacuation zone.

Residents, businesses prepare for flooding

Residents in Steinhatchee, Florida, which flooded during Hurricane Idalia, spent Sunday moving items to higher ground.

“I’ve been here 29 years. This isn’t the first time I’ve done it. Do you get used to it? No,” Mark Reblin said as he moved items out of the liquor store he owns.

Employees of Savannah Canoe and Kayak in Georgia said they were busy tying down their watercrafts, laying sandbags, and raising equipment off the ground. Mayme Bouy, the store manager, said she wasn’t too concerned about the forecast calling for a potential historic rain event.

“But we do have some high tides this week so if the rain is happening around then, that could be bad,” Bouy added. “I’d rather play it safe than sorry.”

Governors declare emergencies ahead of landfall

DeSantis declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida’s 67 counties, with the National Guard activating 3,000 guard members. Utility crews from in and out of state were ready to restore power after the storm, he said in a post on X. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster made their own emergency declarations.

In Tampa alone, officials gave out more than 30,000 sandbags to barricade against flooding.

“We’ve got our stormwater drains cleared out. We’ve got our generators all checked and full. We’re doing everything that we need to be prepared to face a tropical storm,” Tampa Mayor Jane Castor said.

Northeast coast also preparing for storm conditions

Emergency managers in New England and New York were already monitoring the path of the storm for the possibility of remnants striking their states. States including New York and Vermont have been hit by heavy rain and thunderstorms in recent weeks and were still coping with flooding and saturated ground.

Tropical Storm Debby spawns deadly tornadoes and life-threatening flooding in North Carolina.,https://www.aol.com/news/huge-berlin-aquarium-bursts-housed-155139592.html,"BERLIN (AP) — A huge aquarium in Berlin burst, spilling debris, water and more than a thousand tropical fish out of the AquaDom tourist attraction in the heart of the German capital early Friday.

Police said parts of the building, which also contains a hotel, cafes and a chocolate store, were damaged as 1 million liters (264,000 gallons) of water poured from the aquarium shortly before 6 a.m. (0500 GMT). Berlin's fire service said two people were slightly injured.

The company that owns the AquaDom, Union Investment Real Estate, said in a statement Friday afternoon that the reasons for the incident were “still unclear.”

Mayor Franziska Giffey said the incident had unleashed a “veritable tsunami” of water but the early morning timing had prevented far more injuries.

“Despite all the destruction, we were still very lucky,” she said. “We would have had terrible human damage” had the aquarium burst even an hour later, once more people were awake and in the hotel and the surrounding area, she said.

The 25 meter tall (82 foot tall) AquaDom was described as the biggest cylindrical tank in the world and held more than a thousand tropical fish before the incident. Among the 80 types of fish it housed were blue tang and clownfish, two colorful species known from the popular animated movie “Finding Nemo.”

“Unfortunately, none of the 1,500 fish could be saved,” Giffey said.

Efforts were underway Friday afternoon to save an additional 400 to 500 smaller fish housed in aquariums underneath the hotel lobby. Without electricity, their tanks were not receiving the necessary oxygen for them to survive, officials said.

""Now it’s about evacuating them quickly,” Almut Neumann, a city official in charge of environmental issues for Berlin's Mitte district, told German news agency dpa.

Various organizations, including the Berlin Zoo, offered to take in the surviving fish.

Aquarium operator Sea Life said it was saddened by the incident and was trying to get more information about the incident from the owners of the AquaDom.

Sea Life's own aquarium is located in the same building and visitors can tour it and the AquaDom on a single ticket.

There was speculation freezing temperatures that got down to minus 10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit) overnight caused a crack in the acrylic glass tank, which then exploded under the weight of the water. Police said there was no evidence the incident resulted from a malicious act.

About 300 guests and employees had to be evacuated from the hotel surrounding the aquarium, police said.

Sandra Weeser, a German lawmaker who was staying in the hotel, said she was awoken up by a large bang and thought there might have been an earthquake.

“There are shards (of glass) everywhere. The furniture, everything has been flooded with water,"" she said. ""It looks a bit like a war zone.”

Police said a Lindt chocolate store and several restaurants in the same building complex, as well as an underground parking garage next to the hotel, sustained damage. A fire service spokesman said building safety experts were assessing the extent to which the hotel had sustained structural damage.

Hours after the incident, trucks began clearing away the debris that had spilled out onto the street in front of the hotel. Brightly colored Lindt chocolate wrappers were scattered in front of the building where the chocolate shop had been damaged. A small crowd of tourists and onlookers snapped photos from behind the police line across the street.

The aquarium, which was last modernized in 2020, is a major tourist magnet in Berlin. The 10-minute elevator ride through the tropical tank was one of the highlights of the attraction.

Animal rights group PETA tweeted Thursday that the aquarium became a “death trap” for the fish housed in it. “This man-made tragedy shows that aquariums are not a safe place for fish and other marine life,"" they wrote.

Iva Yudinski, a tourist from Israel who had been staying at the hotel, said she was shocked by the incident

“Just yesterday we watched it and we were so amazed (by) its beauty,"" she said. ""Suddenly it’s all gone. Everything is a mess, a total mess.”"

Warnings of ‘historic heavy rainfall’ and ‘catastrophic flooding’ have been issued for parts of the USA’s south east Coast as Storm Debby batters the states of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. An alert for a ‘danger of life-threatening storm surge’ has also been issued and at least five people have been killed after the storm made landfall.

Initially classed as a Category 1 hurricane when it hit land along the Gulf Coast of Florida early on Monday, it was weakened to a tropical storm but it’s still bringing torrential rain along the East Coast. On Monday about 500 people were rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said in a social media post. Just north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.

Five people had died due to the storm as of Monday night, including a truck driver on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor-trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff’s office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet (12 metres) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.

A 13-year-old boy died on Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff’s Office. In Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night. In southern Georgia, a 19-year-old man died when a large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

In South Carolina a tornado touched down on Monday night, damaging trees, and homes and taking down power lines, the Colleton County Sheriff’s Office said on social media. No injuries were immediately reported, officials said. President Joe Biden approved a request from South Carolina’s governor for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp said he has asked Mr Biden to issue a pre-emptive federal emergency declaration to speed the flow of federal aid to the state. North Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Governor Roy Cooper declared it in an executive order signed on Monday.

In an advisory published at 5am EDT on Tuesday August 6, the National Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane Center issued warnings of the extreme weather conditions caused by tropical Storm Debby. The storm is travelling northwards but those in areas of Florida where it has passed are warned of ‘deadly hazards’ left in its wake.

The update said: “Potentially historic heavy rainfall across southeast Georgia and eastern South Carolina through Friday will likely result in areas of catastrophic flooding.” It warned of further flooding from North Carolina through portions of Mid-Atlantic States and southern New England through Sunday morning.

It added: “Dangerous storm surge and tropical storm conditions will spread northward along the southeast US coast from northeastern Florida to North Carolina through the middle of the week. Storm surge and tropical storm watches and warnings have been issued for portions of these areas.” Those in storm watch areas are urged to follow advice from local officials.

While the storm moves northwards, the National Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane Center said that people need to stay safe amid the storm damage. It said: “In portions of Florida where Debby has passed, deadly hazards remain, including downed power lines and flood areas.”

The National Storm Surge Unit at the National Hurricane Center issued an alert for a ‘danger of life-threatening storm surge’. Posting on X the statement at 5am EDT said: “There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge from #Debby along portions of the southeast U.S. coast from Altamaha Sound, GA to the South Santee River, SC, where a Storm Surge Warning is in effect. A Storm Surge Watch is also in effect from the South Santee River, SC to Cape Fear, NC. Residents in the Storm Surge Watch and Warning areas should follow any advice given by local officials.”

The effects of Debby spread across the Southeast on Aug. 6, causing major flooding in places like Savannah and North Myrtle Beach.

After making landfall early Monday in Florida, Debby, now a tropical storm, is moving slowly up the coast bringing life-threatening flooding to Georgia and the Carolinas. Six people in Florida have died in accidents related to Debby.

Three of them were in traffic accidents and two from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, who was on his anchored sailboat when the storm struck, WTSP-TV reported.”

Debby makes landfall in Florida, sparks tornadoes and flooding in Carolinas

Heavy rainfall from Debby stretched from western Florida up the coast to eastern North Carolina, ranging from 21.06 inches at Tatum Ridge, Florida, to 17.27 inches in Summerville, South Carolina. Bellville, Georgia, also received 13.56 inches from the storm.

Widespread flooding was reported in western and northern Florida, Charleston; and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, where drone video showed streets and homes underwater Tuesday evening.

Rainfall amounts from Tropical Storm Debby this week, as of Wednesday morning.

Several tornadoes were spun up from the storm in South Carolina, including an EF1 in Edisto Beach late Monday evening and another tornado in Moncks Corner Tuesday afternoon that heavily damaged an Arbys.

Up to 6 feet of storm surge flooding occurred at Cedar Key, Florida, near landfall Monday morning. On Sunday, a significant overwash occurred in St. Petersburg, Florida, as a 4-foot storm surge hit Tampa Bay.

Debby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane just before 7:00 a.m. EDT Monday morning near Steinhatchee along Florida's Big Bend. Maximum sustained winds were 80 mph, but a gust of 99 mph was measured near where it roared ashore.

The landfall was within 20 miles of Hurricane Idalia’s landfall, a Category 3 storm that roared ashore in the Big Bend of Florida in August 2023.

On Wednesday, DeSantis visited several businesses in Sarasota County that flooded during the storm.

""They’ve poured their heart and souls into these endeavors,"" DeSantis said.

The Sherwood Forest Community became more like a swamp after Debby.

The governor says at least hundreds of people in Sarasota County area faced significant flooding.

""Probably going to be a need for some temporary housing,"" DeSantis said. ""Probably going to be a need for some business support.""

Phillippi Creek Oyster Bar has been closed since the storm, after dealing with significant flooding inside the restaurant.

""We didn’t expect to go this high,"" General Manager Ricky Orduna said. ""It went about a foot and a half, and normally it gets about an inch. Maybe two inches at the most.""

Sarasota County says it received a total of more than 300 storm-related calls on Monday and Tuesday.

The Florida Department of Emergency Management says crews around the county have been out doing damage assessments.

""As of yesterday, Sandra reported that the county was already over 50% one day after the disaster, so they’re doing a remarkable job,"" FDEM Exec. Director Kevin Guthrie said.

The state says it’s working to get approval from the federal government for FEMA disaster relief. DeSantis says they’re also looking at relief efforts like bringing in temporary trailers and other support for residents and businesses.

The staff at Phillippi Creek Oyster Bar says they’ve spent the last two days cleaning up and trying to restore power to reopen as soon as possible.

""We’re going to finish cleaning the driveway, the parking lot,"" Orduna said. ""Get all that done. Get it nice and cleaned up as much as we can, and hopefully we don’t have another storm soon.""

Restaurant staff hope to reopen Friday night.

""This is like our house, so we do our best we can with it,"" Orduna said. ""We try to take care of it. But when something like this comes, you just have to work 10 times as hard, but it’s okay. It’s worth it.""

FDOT is still monitoring water levels on the rivers throughout the region, and crews have pumps ready in anticipation of potential flooding over the next few days.

Gov. DeSantis has activated the Florida Small Business Emergency Bridge Loan Program, making $10 million available for businesses impacted by Hurricane Debby.

Small businesses that are in need of assistance can apply here through Sept. 30, or until all funds are used.

State officials say they’re working to get a list of resources for relief and recovery assistance on the state’s website.

Tropical Storm Debby spawns deadly tornadoes and life-threatening flooding in North Carolina.,https://www.accuweather.com/en/hurricane/tropical-storm-debby-flooding-northeast-new-england/1677088,"Tropical Storm Debby to push inland, threaten Appalachian flooding

As Debby presses inland and swings over the northeastern United States, torrential rain will ease drought in some areas but bring flash flooding of urbn areas and small streams as well as major river flooding.

Copied

Debby is expected to continue moving towards the Northeast, bringing heavy rainfall and the increased risk of flooding to the region this weekend. Tornadoes spawning in the region is another risk.

After gathering more moisture from the Atlantic earlier this week, Debby will swing up and across the interior northeastern United States to unload rain heavy enough to trigger flooding in some areas and raise the possibility of a few tornadoes, AccuWeather meteorologists warn.

Debby will continue to track inland over the Carolinas on Thursday before swinging across Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and upstate New York from Thursday night to Friday night. During this time, Debby will transition from a tropical storm to what AccuWeather meteorologists call a tropical rainstorm. This designation intends to continue to raise public awareness of ongoing impacts that may be damaging and life-threatening.

Debby's greatest threat: Flooding rain

Only Debby's increasing speed will be somewhat of a limiting factor for rainfall, which will still range between 4 and 8 inches from much of Virginia and eastern West Virginia through western and central Maryland, a large part of Pennsylvania, central and eastern upstate New York, western New England and part of southern Quebec. Within this zone, there is an AccuWeather Local StormMax™ of 1 foot of rain.

Much of the interior Northeast will be at high risk to lives and property from Debby, largely due to the impacts of heavy rain and the likelihood of flooding.

""In many areas of the Northeast, much of the rain will not be absorbed by the landscape very well and quickly run off into basements, catch basins, small streams and then the larger rivers,"" AccuWeather Senior Director of Forecast Operations Dan DePodwin said.

It is possible that flash flooding will evolve quickly into a life-threatening situation in some communities of the interior Northeast.

Flooding in urban areas and along small streams is a certainty. Motorists should be prepared for flooded roads or portions of roads that may have been washed out or filled with gravel and other debris in hilly areas.

Summer-long drought conditions, for example, in parts of western Virginia and West Virginia may negate some of the rain's effects. However, even in drought locations, enough rain may fall to lead to at least some incidents of urban flooding and rapid rises on small streams.

Some areas that have been repeatedly hit by flooding this summer, such as parts of Vermont and New Hampshire, could be hit hard again by downpours by the end of the week.

Farther to the east, in the Interstate 95 corridor from Washington, D.C., to Philadelphia, New York City and Boston, the main threats from Debby will be associated with flash urban flooding, storm surge flooding, strong wind gusts and even tornadoes.

Strong winds, tornadoes a threat in part of interior Northeast

With Debby to track inland, winds and tropical air will kick up on the storm's eastern flank and cause trouble.

Strong south-southeast winds will expand as Debby moves northward. Gusts during and outside of thunderstorms will range from 40-60 mph from parts of the Appalachians to the Atlantic coast with an AccuWeather Local StormMax™ gust of 70 mph. The StormMax is most likely on the higher peaks in the Presidential Range in northern New England and along the New England coast.

""The combination of tropical-storm-force winds will have trees bobbing and tipping in the saturated soil, and a number may topple over that can lead to property damage and power outages,"" AccuWeather Meteorologist Brandon Buckingham said.

Even though Debby is likely to transition to more of a non-tropical system, it will retain enough tropical characteristics and bands of thunderstorms, especially near and east of the storm center for a time.

Because of this brief tornadoes may be spawned.

Some of the tornadoes could be wrapped in rain, making iy difficult to see them approaching. Where these occur along the coast, waterspouts are also possible.

Debby to draw in cooler, less humid air in its wake

Debby will become intertwined with a non-tropical storm approaching from the Upper Midwest late this week.

The pair of systems will then speed off to the northeast into southern Canada this weekend. West to northwest breezes in the wake of the storm duo will then draw in much cooler and less humid air across the Northeast. It may take until Saturday night or Sunday for that less humid air to reach the Atlantic coast.

River flooding to continue in Debby's wake

The weather will improve from northwest to southeast across the region this weekend. However, some may be nervously watching river levels.

It often takes several days after a heavy rain event for the larger rivers to fully respond to the runoff. Because of the amount of rain that is forecast to fall from Debby and earlier downpours, some rivers in the region may experience moderate to major flooding this weekend into early next week.

Those living along or having commercial or agricultural property along flood-prone rivers without levee protection may need to take preventative action.

CHARLESTON, S.C. – Tropical Storm Debby is threatening coastal Georgia and the Carolinas as it slows down and potentially stalls over the Southeast. The storm could dump more than 2 feet of rain and cause catastrophic flooding.

After making landfall along Florida’s Big Bend on Monday morning as a Category 1 hurricane, Debby is forecast to move slowly northeastward. Debby already dumped more than 20 inches of rain, sent feet of storm surge flooding into Southwest Florida and knocked out power to more than 300,000 customers in Florida at the height of the storm. However, Debby is far from done.

President Joe Biden has declared an emergency exists in Georgia and ordered federal assistance to supplement state and local response efforts due to the emergency conditions caused by Debby.

A look at the forecast track for Debby.

NOAA’s Weather Prediction Center has issued a Level 4 flood risk, the highest threat on its scale, for Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday in parts of southeastern Georgia, eastern South Carolina and southeastern North Carolina. The risk will only slowly shift north each day as Debby slowly meanders near the Southeast coast.

Roads were flooded in Savannah, Georgia on Tuesday afternnon.

A tornado hit the eastern side of Moncks Corner, South Carolina, on Monday evening. According to the emergency manager for Berkeley County, the tornado destroyed several businesses and damaged many others.

Several trees and power poles were blown down, some of which landed on cars. At least one car was flipped over.

""Roads are opened back up, just be careful in the area of Walmart,"" Moncks Corner Mayor Thomas Hamilton said on social media. ""The Walmart has some roof damage, so not sure when it will open back up. Arby's took the most damage. No major injuries reported, some minor cuts.""

Tornado damage could be seen Tuesday morning across Edisto Beach, South Carolina, as Debby moved closer to the area. According to the Colleton County Sheriff's Office, no injuries have been reported, but property damage and several power poles were down.

On Tuesday, Debby continued to dump rain on Parris Island, South Carolina. The U.S. Marine Corps said its recruit depot base in the area is under a shelter-in-place order, which means no one is allowed to move around the base.

And in Isle of Palms, South Carolina, police shared dramatic photos of damage caused by Debby.

The photos show flooded roads and debris after torrential rain and damaging winds moved through the area early Tuesday morning.

The Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency said state officials conducted swift water rescues Tuesday morning after a car drove into a flooded area in Jeff Davis County.

On Tuesday, the National Weather Service issued several Flash Flood Warnings in southeastern Georgia and eastern South Carolina, where heavy rain will continue to drench the region throughout the day.

DEBBY'S HURRICANE-FORCE WINDS SLAM FLORIDA AT LANDFALL AFTER INTENSIFYING OVER GULF OF MEXICO

Flood Watches are posted from Florida through North Carolina, including Raleigh, through Friday.

Flood alerts in the Southeast.

Debby's core is forecast to head out into the Atlantic Ocean on Tuesday, which could allow it to strengthen again, but computer forecast models show it should remain a tropical storm.

Cities including Savannah, Georgia; Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; and Wilmington, North Carolina, are forecast to see more than a foot of rain through Thursday. Higher totals are possible in places like Charleston, South Carolina, where up to 2.5 feet of rain is not out of the question. This could cause possible life-threatening flooding and swell rivers beyond the flood stage.

In addition to the flooding rainfall, tropical-storm-force winds and a few tornadoes are also expected across the Southeast this week.

A look at the rain totals from Debby.

South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp issued states of emergency ahead of Debby and instructed all residents to prepare for ""significant rainfall."" Both governors have mobilized National Guard resources to respond to potentially extreme flooding impacts.

North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper also declared a state of emergency on Monday afternoon.

South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster speaks about Tropical Storm Debby at the South Carolina Emergency Management Division headquarters on Monday, Aug. 5, 2024.

On Monday, officials in Chatham County, which includes Savannah, enforced a curfew beginning at 10 p.m.

According to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), most computer models show Debby moving off the Southeast U.S. coast by late Tuesday before being pushed back inland over South Carolina on Thursday.

""Although the details of the track forecast are unknown, there is high confidence that Debby will move slowly while near or over the southeastern U.S., which will likely result in catastrophic flooding in some locations,"" the NHC said.

The highest rainfall totals are expected through Thursday, with the most rain falling between now and Wednesday.

Debby's impacts on Georgia and the Carolinas.

Savannah could see up to 18 inches of rain, with the most rain falling through Wednesday and peak wind gusts up to 60 mph possible.

Charleston is facing up to 4 feet of storm surge and nearly 2 feet of rain this week, with winds gusting between 40 and 60 mph through Thursday. Myrtle Beach could see gusts up to 60 mph through Tuesday and up to 18 inches of rain by Thursday.

Forecast impacts for Charleston, South Carolina.

""That is unprecedented. That is something that our system, despite having been tested before, that's a level that not enough pumps in the world can address,"" Charleston Mayor Williams Cogswell said. ""It's important for people to take this seriously and to stay home. Be safe. Do not venture out in these floodwaters.""

—



The dying toll from Tropical Storm Debby is rising after its second US landfall early Thursday.

At the least six individuals have now died due to the storm after it spawned a damaging twister Thursday that killed a person in Lucama, North Carolina. The twister broken houses and a college within the space, which is round 35 miles southeast of Raleigh.

Monitor the storm: Debby’s path

Since crashing into Florida as a Class 1 hurricane on Monday, Debby has dumped greater than a foot of rain over elements of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. The deluges have engorged rivers, flooded roadways and trapped individuals in vehicles, houses and boats – and doubtlessly harmful warmth is anticipated throughout the area within the coming days, threatening to complicate the restoration course of.

Much more chaos is on the horizon because the storm, a mirrored image of the amplifying penalties of human-fueled local weather change, heads towards the Northeast. Right here’s the most recent:

• Debby’s dying toll climbs: One individual is useless after a twister spawned by Debby tore by means of a part of North Carolina’s Wilson County within the earliest hours of Thursday morning, abandoning harm to a center college, a church and a number of houses. A person was killed after his house within the city of Lucama collapsed, a county spokesperson informed CNN. At the least 4 individuals in Florida and one in Georgia have been additionally killed by Debby.

• At the least 11 tornadoes confirmed: Debby has whipped up at the least 11 tornadoes confirmed by the Nationwide Climate Service as of early Thursday. That features 4 tornadoes in Florida, 4 in South Carolina and three in North Carolina. Along with the Wilson County twister, the service warned of a twister in Snow Hill, North Carolina, early Thursday, describing it as “massive, extraordinarily harmful and doubtlessly lethal.” One other twister was noticed Thursday morning close to Louisburg within the northern a part of the state. A twister watch stays in impact for than 5 million individuals in elements of japanese North Carolina and southeastern Virginia, together with the cities of Raleigh and Virginia Seaside.

• Flash flood emergency: Debby’s torrential rainfall lower off one North Carolina city from its surrounding areas after as much as 8 inches of rain fell in just some hours Wednesday evening, in line with a uncommon flash flood emergency issued by the Nationwide Climate Service. Officers in Bladenboro – positioned within the southern a part of the state – reported 3 foot deep floodwater.

• Debby’s present path: The storm began to select up pace and misplaced some energy Thursday morning after landfall as a 50 mph storm close to Bulls Bay, South Carolina. It is going to proceed to weaken because it strikes into North Carolina by Thursday night and into northern Virginia by Friday morning. Debby will speed up by means of Pennsylvania and New York by Friday night and thru New England by early Saturday afternoon, bringing heavy rains and flash flooding to a area drenched by storms earlier this week.

• ‘Be ready for a deluge,’ North Carolina governor says: Gov. Roy Cooper warned residents Wednesday to brace for main rain and flooding. “All North Carolinians throughout our state should be ready for a deluge,” Cooper mentioned, describing the incoming menace as “extra rain than most of us see in a month, and even a number of months.” Rainfall totals throughout the state might attain as excessive as 15 inches. Harmful rip currents and storm surge as much as 3 toes will persist alongside the Carolinas’ coasts Thursday.

• Catastrophe declarations throughout the Southeast: President Joe Biden has authorised catastrophe declarations for Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas – all of which have been pummeled by Debby this week. Greater than 700 Federal Emergency Administration Company personnel have been deployed to the Southeast, and search and rescue groups are on standby to help as wanted, the company mentioned Wednesday.

• Georgia dam susceptible to ‘imminent failure’: A dam in Bulloch County, Georgia – about 50 miles northwest of Savannah – is in peril of “imminent failure” on account of Debby’s torrential rainfall, the Nationwide Climate Service in Charleston, South Carolina, mentioned. Components of the county have already suffered severe flooding, requiring water rescues in a cell house park. But when the dam breaks, communities instantly downstream are on the best threat for extra flooding and could also be requested to evacuate.

• Triple-digit warmth in retailer for Southeast: Doubtlessly harmful warmth has been hovering over the Southeast in Debby’s wake and is anticipated to persist Thursday and thru the weekend as storm restoration continues. Whereas excessive temperatures within the higher 80s and decrease 90s are anticipated, the warmth indices – how the physique feels beneath mixed warmth and humidity – might exceed 110 levels, together with in Steinhatchee, Florida, close to the place Debby made its first landfall.

Debby’s deluge has been a transparent illustration of the impression of worldwide warming attributable to fossil gasoline air pollution, which is inflicting storms to get wetter and strengthen extra rapidly.

Harris and Walz are showing their support for organized labor with appearances at Detroit union hall.,https://apnews.com/article/harris-walz-labor-uaw-michigan-trump-fain-c19aa8557fe93a986f673eccf461f5be,"WAYNE, Mich. (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, played up their support for organized labor at a Detroit-area union hall on Thursday, with the Democratic nominee saying “we’re all in this together” as the new ticket lavishes attention on a crucial base of support.

Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, and Walz, who joined the ticket on Tuesday, spoke Thursday to about 100 United Auto Workers members at Local 900 Hall, which represents Ford’s Michigan Assembly Plant. The stop occurred shortly after Republican nominee Donald Trump held a press conference in Palm Beach, Florida.

As she proclaimed that it was “good to be in the house of labor,” Harris described the value of unions, saying they were “about understanding that no one should be made to fight alone” and that “hard work is good work.”

“We have fun doing hard work, because we know what we stand for,” she said. “When you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. We know what we stand for, and we stand for the people and we stand for the dignity of work, and we stand for freedom. We stand for justice. We stand for equality.

Walz, riffing off a favorite line of President Joe Biden, told the labor crowd that “we know that unions built the middle class.

“The rest of America has to,” Walz added.

The members at Local 900 were the first Ford workers to strike in 2023 when the union’s contract with the company expired. Workers at the assembly plant went on strike Sept. 15 and remained on the picket lines until Oct. 25, when the union announced a tentative agreement with Ford.

After President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign last month and endorsed his vice president, organized labor quickly rallied around Harris. The AFL-CIO endorsed her after having first backed Biden. The UAW formally backed her last week.

Harris and Walz have been highlighting their support for working people during their first joint appearances this week in some of the most closely contested states that will help decide whether she becomes the first female U.S. president or whether Trump returns to the White House and brings along Sen. JD Vance of Ohio as his vice president.

Trump, Vance and other Republicans have increasingly criticized Harris for not engaging extensively with journalists and taking questions during the early days of her candidacy. In a brief exchange with reporters before leaving Michigan, Harris said she has talked with her aides and wants to schedule an interview before the end of the month.

She also re-confirmed that she would participate in a Sept. 10 debate on ABC News — which Trump had backed out of before recommitting to it earlier Thursday during his Palm Beach press conference — and said she would be “happy” to discuss subsequent debates after that one occurs.

The Democrats visited Wisconsin and Michigan on Wednesday, hoping to shore up support among the younger, diverse, labor-friendly voters who were instrumental in helping Biden get elected in 2020.

Two new polls of likely voters in Wisconsin and Georgia, another key state, show close races in both. Several Georgiapolls conducted earlier in the summer found Trump slightly ahead in the state, which Biden won narrowly in 2020.

UAW President Shawn Fain told The Associated Press last week that Harris’ leading the Democratic ticket boosts the party’s chances of winning Michigan and keeping the White House in November. Fain said Trump is beholden to billionaires, knows nothing about the auto industry and would send the labor movement into reverse in a second term.

On Thursday, Fain welcomed the ticket to “labor’s house” and rallied the union crowd by exclaiming: “Kamala Harris is one of us. Gov. Tim Walz is one of us” and praising their pro-labor records.

“This isn’t about opinions. This election is not about party politics,” Fain said. “All we have to do is look at these candidates in their own words and actions. That’s all the facts we need.”

Fain also spoke Wednesday at Harris’ campaign rally at a Detroit-area airport hangar. The UAW leader has become a top nemesis of the Republican presidential nominee, who frequently rails against Fain at rallies and in speeches.

Vance made his own stops in Michigan and Wisconsin on Wednesday, intent on showing that Republicans will compete in the “blue wall” of Midwestern states. He called Walz a “crazy radical” and said that Harris’ decision to pick him as a running mate shows that she “bends the knee to the far left of the Democratic Party.”

As Harris spoke to an estimated 15,000-person crowd at the airport, she was interrupted by protesters opposed to Israel’s war in Gaza with Hamas. At first, Harris said to those trying to disrupt her, “I am here because I believe in democracy, and everybody’s voice matters.”

But Harris lost patience as the shouting continued, with protesters accusing her of supporting genocide in Gaza. That led her to deliver a sharper rejoinder.

“If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that,” she said, talking over the protesters. “Otherwise, I’m speaking.”

Metro Detroit, home to one of the largest Arab American populations in the United States, has become a focal point of tension and unrest due to the Israel-Hamas conflict.

Shortly after her remarks Wednesday, Harris won the backing of Assad I. Turfe, the deputy Wayne County executive, who is the highest-ranking Arab American official in Michigan’s largest county. Turfe told The Associated Press he spoke with Harris backstage at the event before his endorsement.

“Kamala Harris embodies the America we deserve –- an America that stands for strength, inclusivity and unwavering commitment to justice,” Turfe said in a statement. “I wholeheartedly endorse Kamala Harris, as she represents the true spirit of our nation and the values we hold dear.”

Turfe also pressed the need for a cease-fire in Gaza, but said that Harris “gives us the best chance of achieving peace in that region moving forward.”

Union members attending the rally said they supported Harris.

Jeanne Ruff of Livonia, Michigan, whose husband is a longtime UAW member, said she hoped Harris would visit a union shop in Michigan to show her support.

“I want her to make sure skill trades are back in schools so that the next generation can understand what unions are about. What solidarity is and how strong we can be together, working as one,” Ruff said.

The Phoenix-area campaign event was announced on June 30, but without a location or time. The concert and sporting event venue about 15 miles northwest of downtown Phoenix was confirmed as the site in a Thursday email to people who previously signed up to attend.

A start time wasn’t listed in the email, but it advised attendees to arrive no later than 3:30 p.m. or they might not be allowed inside. Doors open at 1:30 p.m.

The rally will be limited to people with confirmed RSVPs who have a matching government-issued photo ID.

As of Thursday morning, the listing for the event was at capacity and closed to new signups.

Where is Desert Diamond Arena, site of Democratic rally

Desert Diamond Arena is located near State Farm Stadium in the Westgate Entertainment District near Glendale Avenue and the Loop 101 Agua Fria Freeway.

The venue, which is owned by the city of Glendale, had a capacity of about 17,000 for hockey games when the Arizona Coyotes played there, but it’s unclear how many people are expected for Friday’s rally.

The Arizona event is part of the Democratic campaign tour through battleground states that started in Pennsylvania on Tuesday, a day after Harris named Walz, the governor of Minnesota, as her running mate.

When will Kamala Harris and Tim Walz arrive in Phoenix?

The Democratic ticket is trying to drum up support for the Nov. 5 general election against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and running mate JD Vance, a U.S. senator from Ohio.

It will be Harris’ fourth visit to Arizona this year, but the first since President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid last month and endorsed his vice president.

Harris was last in the Grand Canyon State on June 24 when she made a campaign stop in Phoenix to support Biden for an event promoting reproductive rights on the two-year anniversary of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade. I little over a month later, she is returning to the Valley as the presidential nominee.

Harris and Walz are expected to fly into Phoenix on Thursday evening after a campaign event in Michigan. They will then fly to Las Vegas for a Saturday rally.

Between Pennsylvania and Michigan, they stopped in Wisconsin. Events scheduled this week for North Carolina and Georgia were postponed because of Tropical Storm Debby.

Today, Kamala Harris leads Trump by less than one point, a shift of more than three points in Harris’ direction. Battleground state polls are showing similar results, with Harris cutting into Trump’s lead by anywhere from two to five points.

The FiveThirtyEight state polling averages from July 21, the last day that Biden was the Democratic nominee, found the president trailing in the Sun Belt states of Georgia, Nevada and Arizona by more than five points. Today, Trump’s lead is well within the margin of error in Arizona and Georgia. There weren’t enough polls for a Nevada average, but recent CBS and Bloomberg surveys have Harris with a two point lead. In the “Blue Wall” states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, where Trump was leading by anywhere from two to four points, Harris now has a margin of error lead in those states of anywhere from 0.7 to 1.6%.

"Arizona, Georgia and Nevada Move From Lean Republican to Toss Up.",https://nypost.com/2024/08/08/us-news/cook-political-report-moves-three-states-away-from-trump/,"The Cook Political Report moved Arizona, Georgia and Nevada away from former President Donald Trump, switching them from “Lean Republican” to “toss-ups” as Vice President Kamala Harris enjoys a polling bump.

Last month, the election handicapper shifted those three states toward Trump in the aftermath of President Biden’s brutal debate performance, but now the election dynamic has seemingly reset with Harris at the helm of the Democratic ticket.

“Three weeks ago, Donald Trump was leading President Joe Biden in the Cook Political Report national vote tracker by about 2.5%. Today, Kamala Harris leads Trump by less than one point, a shift of more than three points in Harris’ direction,” Cook Political Report’s editor-in-chief Amy Walter explained.

“For the first time in a long time, Democrats are united and energized, while Republicans are on their heels,” she added. “The presidential contest has moved from one that was Trump’s to lose to a much more competitive contest.”

She ran through various data showing stark changes in polling since Biden’s sudden exit from the race. This includes averages showing Trump’s advantage in Georgia dwindling from a 5.9-point lead to just 1 point, and in Arizona from a 5.5-point lead down to 1.9 points.

Thus far, there have been sparse surveys done in Nevada, but Walter pointed to recent CBS and Bloomberg polling that had Harris in the lead.

Despite that recent change from the Cook Political Report, it still prognosticates that Trump, 78, is ahead in the election — but at 235 Electoral College votes for the former president and 226 toward Harris, 59.

To win the 2024 battle, one must clinch 270 Electoral College votes, and the election handicapper ranks 77 electoral votes as toss-ups.

“We are the underdogs in this race,” Harris declared during an energetic rally in Philadelphia Tuesday where she unveiled Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate.

Her campaign has repeatedly underscored that it views the 2024 contest as a nail-bitter.

Trump’s team has similarly contended that it is taking nothing for granted, either.

Harris has a 0.8 percentage-point edge in the latest RealClearPolitics aggregate of polling in a five-way national matchup. Trump had long held a national lead against Biden in the RCP aggregate.

Meanwhile, the Trump campaign has been skeptical of the polling, accusing some of having been manipulated to show him losing ground.

“The Fake News Media continue to help dangerously liberal Kamala hide her record of economic failure and soft-on-crime policies. Now, as this analysis shows they’ll even put a finger on the scale of polling to inflate results for her,” senior campaign adviser Brian Hughes said in a statement over the weekend.

Boasting about enthusiasm, the Harris campaign claims the vice president has garnered crowds of 14,000 people and a $310 million fundraising haul during the month of July.

Trump has accused her of paying people to attend the rallies, though he shared no proof of the claim.

“If Kamala has 1,000 people at a Rally, the Press goes ‘crazy,’ and talks about how ‘big’ it was – And she pays for her ‘Crowd,'” Trump groused on Truth Social Thursday.

“When I have a Rally, and 100,000 people show up, the Fake News doesn’t talk about it, THEY REFUSE TO MENTION CROWD SIZE. The Fake News is the Enemy of the People!” he added.

Trump and his campaign have also needled Harris for sparingly answering on-the-record questions from reporters since Biden threw in the towel last month.

Highlighting that grievance, Trump scheduled a press conference at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday."
"Arizona, Georgia and Nevada Move From Lean Republican to Toss Up.",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/presidential/3114929/three-battleground-states-shift-harris-cook/,"A nonpartisan election handicapper updated ratings for three states in the 2024 presidential election cycle, shifting three battleground states within striking distance for Democrats after Vice President Kamala Harris became the party’s nominee for president.

The Cook Political Report is moving Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada into the “toss-up” category from “lean Republican.”

Today, we're making three changes to our Electoral College Ratings.



AZ: Lean R to Toss Up

NV Lean R to Toss Up

GA: Lean R to Toss Up@amyewalter on the presidential campaign reset: https://t.co/zWeqQKdyDH — Cook Political Report (@CookPolitical) August 8, 2024

Arizona has 11 electoral votes, Georgia has 16, and Nevada has six. The election projector now shows Republicans with 235 electoral votes from states that are rated as leaning or solid Republican, while Democrats have 226 electoral votes from states that are likely or solid for Democratic. There are 77 votes in play from “toss-up” states.

In rationalizing the change in ratings, the group said battleground-state polls show Harris cutting into former President Donald Trump’s lead by anywhere from 2 to 5 points, which now reflect that she is leading by less than 1 point. In comparison, three weeks ago, similar polls found that “Trump was leading Biden in the Cook Political Report national vote tracker by about 2.5%.”

“For the first time in a long time, Democrats are united and energized, while Republicans are on their heels,” Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report wrote. “Unforced errors from both Trump and his vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance have shifted the media spotlight from Biden’s age to Trump’s liabilities.”

However, Walter acknowledged that Trump is polling stronger than he was at the same point in 2020, when “he was trailing the national polling average by just over six points and behind in key swing states by similar margins.” Biden won all three of these states in 2020, but the margins were narrow.

“Bottom line: Things look a lot better for Democrats today than they did a few weeks ago, but Trump is looking stronger now than he did in 2020. This is a toss-up,” Walter added."
"Arizona, Georgia and Nevada Move From Lean Republican to Toss Up.",https://www.mediaite.com/politics/cook-political-shifts-three-key-states-away-from-trump-as-electoral-map-tightens/,"The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter announced on Thursday that it shifted three key swing states away from former President Donald Trump’s column back to Toss Up now that Kamala Harris is the Democratic Party’s nominee.

In early July, with President Joe Biden atop the ticket, the Cook Political Report moved 5 states away from Biden – including moving Arizona, Nevada, and Georgia from Toss Up to Lean Republican. At the time New Hampshire and Minnesota also move from Likely Democrat to Lean Democrat.

Now, with Harris regaining ground in the polls, Cook Political has shifted Arizona, Nevada, and Georgia away from Trump and placed them squarely back in the toss-up column. Notably, Harris can win the White House without winning Pennsylvania if she sweeps those three states and captures Wisconsin and Michigan as well.

“With those moves, we now rate 235 electoral votes as leaning, likely or solid Republican and 226 electoral votes leaning, likely or solid for Democrat. There are 77 electoral votes rated as Toss Up,” wrote Editor-In-Chief Amy Walter of the impact of the change, adding:

Bottom line: Things look a lot better for Democrats today than they did a few weeks ago, but Trump is looking stronger now than he did in 2020. This is a Toss Up.

Cook Political also looked at Harris’s favorability rating and found a marked improvement. “Back in early June, her favorability ratings were underwater by 16 points (37% favorable to 53% unfavorable). Today, they sit at 43% favorable to 49% unfavorable, or -6%. Trump has enjoyed a bit of a favorability bump as well, going from -12 in June, to -8 (43% to 52%) today.”

Walter also summed up the current state of the race, writing, “Unforced errors from both Trump and his vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance have shifted the media spotlight from Biden’s age to Trump’s liabilities. In other words, the presidential contest has moved from one that was Trump’s to lose to a much more competitive contest.”

First up, the Cook Political Report has shifted it’s classification of several swing states (AZ, GA, NV have shifted from Lean Republican To Toss up. In other words, there has been a shift toward Harris of late). At that infamous Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in SC, a Trump supporter asked Trump a very good question of what he will do about the cost of living and high rent, and Trump responds with a word salad that highlighted, “Drill Baby Drill!” Finally, Trump has announced that he will hold a “press conference” at 2 P.M. today at Mar-A-Lago. I use quotations marks around press conference because I’m betting Trump will scream about Harris and take no questions at all.

Cook Political Report News:

The election handicapper Cook Political Report shifted its ratings for Arizona, Georgia and Nevada toward Vice President Harris as she continues to close the polling gap with former President Trump. All three states had been considered “lean Republican” in early July, while President Biden was still in the race and falling further behind Trump both on the national level and in the key battleground states. But with polls showing Harris getting back within the margin of error of Trump, or in some cases slightly ahead, the three swing states have been moved to be a “toss Up.”

According to Cook, Trump was six points ahead in GA while Biden was still in the race, but now his lead is just one point.

Next, we have The Huffpost with a report out of Sturgis, SD. A Trump supporter asked a question of Trump about what he will do about the high cost of living, and what he received was a word salad non-response from Trump.

“Drill Baby Drill” was what this got. Trump lied about how bad inflation really is, the price of bacon, and that this all started with energy costs. Nothing about rent or housing. Nada. Zip. Trump also went onto some tangent about China.

Finally, the AP is reporting that Trump has scheduled a supposed news conference at 2 P.M.

The only real question is how crazy Trump might be at this latest gish gallop."
"Arizona, Georgia and Nevada Move From Lean Republican to Toss Up.",https://www.wptv.com/politics/harris-tours-battleground-states-trying-to-capitalize-on-momentum,"There has been a noticeable shift in the 2024 presidential race.

The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which analyzes races from coast to coast, moved the battleground states from Arizona, Nevada and Georgia from ""Lean Republican"" to ""Toss Up"" after numerous polls showed Vice President Harris either beating former President Donald Trump or closing the gap.

To build on that momentum, Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, kicked off their tour of battleground states this week. After introducing Walz in Pennsylvania on Tuesday, the pair visited Wisconsin and Michigan on Wednesday.

While campaigning, Harris has talked a lot about personal freedoms, especially when discussing reproductive rights. Thousands of supporters have cheered on that message; however, Harris did run into some hecklers in Michigan on Wednesday.

When pro-Palestinian demonstrators shouted about the Biden-Harris administration's support of Israel, Harris interjected.

""You know what? If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I'm speaking,"" the vice president responded.

Meanwhile, Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, are working to win the same battleground states as the Harris-Walz team. Vance has essentially been trailing Harris, campaigning in the same states.

RELATED STORY | Who is JD Vance, Trump's pick for vice president?

Vance arrived in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, around the same time as Harris and Walz on Wednesday. At the airport, he walked over to the press covering Harris' campaign and criticized the vice president for not taking more questions from journalists.

""It's disgraceful that she runs from you guys. It's also insulting to the American people,"" Vance told reporters.

Harris has not sat down for an interview or held a press conference since she rose to the top of the ticket. In contrast, Trump plans to hold a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida on Thursday."

Trump shared a private flight with Project 2025's head despite denying connection.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/08/07/trump-heritage-project-2025-roberts/,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has repeatedly denied knowing about the Project 2025 policy blueprint or the people behind it. “Have no idea who is in charge of it,” he wrote in a social media post in July. But in April 2022, Trump shared a 45-minute private flight with Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts, according to people familiar with the trip, plane-tracking data and a photograph from on board the plane, which has not been previously reported. They flew together to a Heritage conference where Trump delivered a keynote address that gestured to Heritage’s forthcoming policy proposals.

“They’re going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do,” Trump said in the speech.

Separately, Roberts told The Washington Post in an interview in April of this year that he had previously discussed Project 2025 with Trump as part of offering briefings to all presidential candidates. “I personally have talked to President Trump about Project 2025,” he said in the interview, “because my role in the project has been to make sure that all of the candidates who have responded to our offer for a briefing on Project 2025 get one from me.”

Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Roberts never briefed Trump. A Heritage spokeswoman declined to elaborate on private meetings.

The flight, Trump’s speech and Roberts’s interview cut against the former president’s recent efforts to distance himself from Project 2025 once Democrats turned some of its most controversial proposals into a frequent campaign attack. The proposals came from alumni of Trump’s first term and often overlap with his own official campaign pronouncements, such as eliminating the Education Department, weakening protections for career civil servants, ending affirmative action and reversing restrictions on greenhouse gases. One of the proposals calls for federal restrictions on access to abortion medication, a position at odds with the Trump campaign stance.

“Project 2025 has never and will never be an accurate reflection of President Trump’s policies,” Leavitt said. “As President Trump himself and our campaign leadership have repeatedly stated, President Trump’s 20 promises to the forgotten men and women and the RNC platform are the only policies endorsed by President Trump for a second term.”

Trump and Roberts flew together in April 2022 from the former president’s home in Palm Beach, Fla., to the foundation’s annual conference on Amelia Island. Heritage chartered the plane because Trump’s jet was being refurbished at the time, according to two people familiar with the trip who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private interactions.

At that time, Heritage was in the early stages of organizing Project 2025. Roberts brought it up with Trump on the flight, but Trump seemed uninterested and moved on to another subject, according to a Heritage official. A Trump campaign official said Trump and Roberts didn’t discuss Project 2025 on the plane ride.

Trump briefly described meeting Heritage staff members during his keynote address at the conference. “With Kevin and the staff, and I met so many of them now, I took pictures with among the most handsome, beautiful people I’ve ever seen,” he said.

Roberts took over day-to-day management of Project 2025 last week with the departure of director Paul Dans. The project is winding down its policy work in anticipation of handing off its recommendations to the official presidential transition. The project will continue to operate a database of 20,000 applicants for Republican political appointments.

Participants are still drafting executive orders and conducting training classes for potential future administration officials, a person involved in the project said. In private, the person said, Roberts has told people Trump isn’t really that mad, instead attributing the backlash to top Trump campaign advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles.

“Some chapter writers see this as a disaster, a catastrophe, that it’s really bad for them. Others think it’s going to blow over,” the person involved in the project said. “The wishful-thinking school is that this will all blow over.”

The Heritage Foundation has since 1980 published a book of policy recommendations for the next Republican administration. For this cycle, the foundation set out to convene a coalition of more than 100 right-wing groups, presenting the proposals as a movement consensus under the banner of Project 2025. The coalition involved at least 140 Trump administration alumni, according to a CNN tally, including Dans, former White House speechwriter Stephen Miller, former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Tom Homan and former White House budget director Russ Vought.

Heritage published the 900-page agency-by-agency policy book in 2023, and it was not until recent months that Democratic attention on its proposals exploded. They have particularly focused on the Project 2025 proposal to ban shipments of abortion medication through the mail — which departs from Trump’s stated plans.

After praising the Heritage Foundation for years, former president Donald Trump now says he is unaware of its policy blueprint, Project 2025. (Video: JM Rieger/The Washington Post, Photo: Alex Wroblewski/The Washington Post)

Trump and his advisers chafed at the critical media coverage that Project 2025 generated, especially when leaders including Roberts brushed off repeated warnings to keep their heads down. Roberts himself drew backlash for a July interview on the right-wing “War Room” podcast (which was hosted by former Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon until he reported to prison), in which he said, “we are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be.”

Miller has started forcefully denying any role in the project. His America First Legal group was part of the coalition, and his deputy, Gene Hamilton, wrote the playbook’s chapter on the Justice Department. Others, such as Vought, who wrote the chapter on the executive office of the president and served as policy director for the Republican National Convention’s platform committee, have kept a lower profile since the Trump campaign started admonishing the project.

Others whom Trump specifically said he would consider bringing back into a second administration contributed chapters to the project, including former adviser Peter Navarro on trade; former acting defense secretary Christopher Miller on the Pentagon; and former HUD secretary Ben Carson on housing. Navarro served four months in prison over his refusal to testify before Congress about efforts to overturn the 2020 election.

Roberts also has a relationship with Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), who wrote the foreword to Roberts’s book, “Dawn’s Early Light.” In the foreword, Vance called Heritage “the most influential engine of ideas for Republicans from Ronald Reagan to Donald Trump.” On Tuesday, Roberts announced that he would delay publication until after the election.

Roberts previously raised suspicion among Trump advisers who viewed him as favoring Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis during the presidential Republican primary. Advisers also said Trump resents other groups such as Heritage raising money that he believes should go to his campaign.

At other times, though, Trump has praised Roberts. He singled him out in February during a speech in Nashville to the National Religious Broadcasters. “Heritage Foundation president, somebody else doing an unbelievable job,” Trump said. “He’s bringing it back to levels it’s never seen, Dr. Kevin Roberts. Kevin, thank you.”

On Tuesday, congressional Democrats called on Roberts to release Project 2025’s plans for the first 180 days of a new administration. This “fourth pillar” was not published, unlike the overall policy recommendations.

Trump shared a private flight with Project 2025's head despite denying connection.,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/08/donald-trump-kevin-roberts-project-2025-flight,"Donald Trump shared a private flight with the head of the rightwing thinktank behind Project 2025, the Washington Post reported, publishing evidence including a picture of the two men in airplane seats, grinning.

The flight was on its way to a conference organized by the thinktank, at which Trump told group members they would “lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do”.

Orchestrated by the Heritage Foundation, Project 2025 is a 900-page plan initially presented for a second Trump administration that posits aggressive rightwing reform to every corner of the federal government.

Democratic attacks have particularly focused on its threats to reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights, voting rights and other progressive concerns.

Appearing to fear that Kamala Harris was making Project 2025 an effective campaign issue, Trump and allies have since tried to disavow the effort, with Trump claiming last month he had “no idea who is in charge of” Project 2025.

On Thursday, a spokesperson for Trump told the Post that Project 2025 “has never and will never be an accurate reflection of President Trump’s policies”.

But the Post published plane-tracking data and the picture of Trump with Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation, in April 2022.

The two men were flying from Trump’s home in Palm Beach, Florida, to Amelia Island in the same state for the annual Heritage conference.

At the conference, the Post said, Trump told attendees: “With Kevin and the staff, and I met so many of them now, I took pictures with among the most handsome, beautiful people I’ve ever seen.”

The Post also pointed out that in April of this year Roberts told the paper: “I personally have talked to President Trump about Project 2025 because my role in the project has been to make sure that all of the candidates who have responded to our offer for a briefing on Project 2025 get one from me.”

Democratic attacks on Project 2025 have inflicted appreciable damage. Last month, Project 2025 director Paul Dans stepped down amid “pressure from Trump campaign leadership”, the Daily Beast first reported.

Roberts has attracted attention, too. In July, he told the Trump ally Steve Bannon: “We are in the process of the second American revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be.”

Controversy over such comments drew attention to Roberts’ forthcoming book, Dawn’s Early Light: Taking Back Washington to Save America, which has an introduction by the Ohio senator JD Vance, Trump’s vice-presidential pick. Publication has now been delayed until after election day.

In his introduction, obtained by the New Republic, Vance calls the Heritage Foundation “the most influential engine of ideas for Republicans from Ronald Reagan to Donald Trump”. The group has indeed produced policy plans for Republican administrations since 1980. But none have proved remotely as controversial as Project 2025.

Earlier this week, two House Democrats told Roberts to publish plans for the first 180 days of a second Trump administration, which remain under wraps.

“It is time to stop hiding the ball on what we are concerned could very well be the most radical, extreme, and dangerous parts of Project 2025,” Jared Huffman of California and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts said in an open letter.

On Thursday, the Post quoted an anonymous Project 2025 source as saying that some contributors saw controversy over their work, and Trump’s attempts to disavow it, as “a disaster, a catastrophe … the wishful-thinking school is that this will all blow over”."

And if the goal was to reassure people that (1) he is not at all freaked out by the vice president’s rising poll numbers and (2) he is the best candidate for the White House, he was not exactly successful!

Trump repeatedly insulted Harris’s intelligence, calling her “barely competent,” saying that she “can't do a news conference” because “she’s not smart enough,” and claiming that she’s “not as smart” as Joe Biden. (As a reminder, Trump thinks there were airports during the Revolutionary War and that it’s safe to inject bleach into the body; he’s also been described as an idiot by numerous people who worked for him.)

As has become a recurring feature of his public remarks, the ex-president also spent time insulting Jewish Americans, saying if they vote for Harris, “they should have their head examined.” He baselessly claimed that Harris, who is married to a Jewish man, has been “very bad to Jewish people.” And, after claiming yesterday that Harris’s decision to pick Tim Walz as her running mate over Josh Shapiro was a snub to Jewish people—and that Shapiro would have been a stronger running mate—he said Shapiro is “a terrible guy and he’s not very popular with anybody.”

Also, at one point, he reiterated that he thinks migrants who are seeking asylum are coming to the US via “insane asylums.”

However, it has now been revealed that Trump flew on a private jet with Kevin Roberts in 2022, according to the Washington Post. Roberts is the president of the Heritage Foundation, the organization behind Project 2025.

Trump and Roberts were traveling to a conference where Trump gave a speech that referenced the project as described by the Heritage Foundation.

According to Roberts, he discussed Project 2025 during the flight."
Trump shared a private flight with Project 2025's head despite denying connection.,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/08/trump-january-6-lies-kamala-harris-attacks,"Struggling in the polls and charged with running a lackluster presidential campaign, Donald Trump faced reporters on Thursday for an hour-long press conference that swiftly descended into a familiar mess of freewheeling invective, outlandish claims and outright lies.

“Nobody was killed on January 6,” the former president and Republican presidential nominee said, of the day in 2021 when he incited an attack on Congress now linked to nine deaths, including law enforcement suicides and the shooting by a police officer of Ashley Babbitt, who Trump voters widely claim as a martyr.

Speaking at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida, Trump repeated his praise of rioters convicted and jailed in the hundreds, whom he has said he will pardon. Absurdly, he also said there was a “peaceful transfer” of power after he lost to Joe Biden.

But he seemed more exercised by the size of his audience.

“I’ve spoken to the biggest crowds,” Trump claimed, in just one complaint about the media supposedly exaggerating crowd sizes for his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, at his expense.

“Nobody’s spoken to crowds bigger than me,” Trump said. “If you look at Martin Luther King, when he did his speech, his great speech, and you look at ours, same real estate, same everything, same number of people, if not we had more.”

Trump was comparing his speech on the Ellipse on 6 January 2021, when he told supporters to “fight like hell” in service of his lie about electoral fraud in his 2020 defeat, to King’s imperishable speech at the Lincoln Memorial on 28 August 1963, a landmark of the civil rights era in which King outlined his dream of racial equality.

“They said I had 25,000 and he had a million people. And I’m OK with it, because I liked Dr Martin Luther King,” Trump said. It was an echo of Trump’s famous lies about the crowd size for his inauguration in 2017, compared to crowd sizes for Barack Obama. Analyses have found Trump’s crowd was not remarkable or comparable.

Trump did make news, saying he wanted to “do three debates” and had agreed or was close to agreeing terms with Fox, NBC and ABC. After he finished speaking, ABC said Harris and Trump had agreed to debate on 10 September.

But most of Trump’s answers trod familiar ground.

He accused Harris of running shy of speaking to the press; attacked her record as vice-president on border policy and immigration; ridiculed her performance in the 2020 Democratic primary; said Democrats were soft on crime; soft-pedaled the removal of the federal right to abortion by supreme court justices he installed; rehashed his hugely controversial questioning of Harris’s racial identity; claimed Harris and Biden projected weakness in the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and elsewhere, allowing Russia to invade Ukraine and Hamas to attack Israel and forfeiting the respect of authoritarian leaders; and claimed the US economy was on the brink of a “depression, not a recession” after Wall Street sell-offs but on a day of notable recovery.

That wasn’t the half of it. Trump even claimed to have been “very protective” of Hillary Clinton, the Democrat he beat in 2016, a campaign in which Trump’s supporters regularly chanted – with his encouragement – that Clinton should be locked up.

Clinton was “pretty evil”, Trump said, accusing her of various unsubstantiated misdoings, but “I thought it was a very bad thing take the wife of a president of the United States and put her in jail, and then I see the way they treat me. That’s the way it goes. But I was very protective of her. Nobody would understand that, but I was. I think my people understand it.”

Most Americans understand that Trump is the first former president to be criminally convicted, on 34 charges of falsification of business records, with sentencing due in New York on 16 September.

He faces as many as 54 other criminal charges, in cases concerning attempted election subversion and retention of classified information. On Thursday he praised as “brilliant” the Florida judge, his own appointee, who threw out the classified information case, a decision now on appeal.

Trump has also been ordered to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in civil suits concerning business fraud and defamation arising from a rape claim a judge called “substantially true”.

Trump has never been afraid to go low. At one point on Thursday, he said Willie Brown, a former mayor of San Francisco whom Harris dated, “told me terrible things about her”. Given past form, including his recruitment in 2016 of women who accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct, Trump’s remarks seemed a likely preview of blows to come.

Despite it all, he remains the Republican nominee for president, running with JD Vance, the Ohio senator, against Harris and Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota.

Amid polls showing Harris leading nationally and gaining or leading in battleground states, doubts about Trump’s prospects have spread. Earlier on Thursday, Karl Rove, a Republican operative once known as George W Bush’s “brain”, wrote for the Wall Street Journal under the headline “Trump Teeters, but Will He Fall?”

“This race will be decided by each party’s success in two fundamental tasks,” Rove wrote. “Turning out its base and persuading independent, swing voters.” Convincing independents would be “decisive”.

“The past six weeks have shown that the pendulum can swing rapidly and wildly,” Rove wrote. “The Trump campaign is floundering. Mr Trump seems rattled. He’s making plenty of unforced errors and wasting valuable, irreplaceable time on insults, side issues and trivia.”

Rove’s column was published before Trump’s press conference. Among Republicans, Rove’s message must have rung louder still after Trump was done.

“All this undermines his cause,” Rove wrote. “The Trump-Vance ticket needs to become much more disciplined and settle soon on an effective line of attack against Harris-Walz that wins over swing voters and then stick to it.

“If it can’t achieve both these goals, a race Mr Trump was on the verge of winning three weeks ago could be lost.”"
Trump shared a private flight with Project 2025's head despite denying connection.,https://newrepublic.com/feeds/168326/breaking-news,"Only on Wednesday, the Trump campaign was dodging questions about how the former president and convicted felon ducked out of the previously scheduled debate. This followed a litany of excuses Trump has made since Harris entered the race. He claimed that he couldn’t go on ABC because of ongoing litigation against the network and that he didn’t need to debate because he was already leading in the polls (he wasn’t). His team said that he couldn’t debate someone who wasn’t officially the Democratic nominee and didn’t have former President Barack Obama’s endorsement. Hours later, Obama endorsed Harris.

The real reason Trump has been hesitant to debate Harris is probably because he’s worried. Trump reportedly thinks it’s unfair that he has to run against Harris, complaining to confidants about the media coverage Harris is getting and about being overtaken in polls. He and his running mate, J.D. Vance, have been struggling to come up with any effective attacks against Harris and Tim Walz, trying out accusations of antisemitism and attacks on Walz’s military record that so far haven’t picked up any traction.

But in a debate, Trump will have the opportunity to come up with new soundbites and insults, albeit against an opponent sharper than Biden, and he probably wants to do it on a bigger stage than Fox News, even though they would give him a home-field advantage. As Trump would say, the ratings will probably be sky-high."

Former President Donald Trump recently expressed his views on abortion, stating that he believes the issue has become less significant in the lead-up to the November election. During a news conference in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump mentioned that he anticipates abortion to be a minor concern in the upcoming political landscape.

Trump reiterated his stance on abortion exceptions, emphasizing that he supports allowances for cases involving rape, incest, and situations where the life of the mother is at risk. He emphasized the importance of these exceptions, highlighting his strong belief in their necessity."
Trump shared a private flight with Project 2025's head despite denying connection.,https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-took-private-jet-flight-025801216.html,"Former President Donald Trump flew on a private jet with the president of the Heritage Foundation, the far-right think tank behind Project 2025, on his way to a conference the institute held in 2022, according to a new report.

The Washington Post obtained flight tracking data and a photo of Trump traveling with Kevin Roberts in April 2022. The image seems to further undercut Trump’s claims that he has “no idea” who was responsible for the controversial conservative blueprint — even though more than a hundred people who worked in his administration had a hand in producing it.

Roberts took over as president of the Heritage Foundation in 2021 and was a key architect of Project 2025, a 920-page document with policy aims that include replacing federal employees with political appointees and eliminating the Department of Education.

“They’re going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do,” Trump said in a keynote speech at a Heritage Foundation conference after the 2022 flight.

Roberts told the Post in an interview last April that he had discussed Project 2025 with the former president as part of a briefing the Heritage Foundation offered to anyone hoping to win the White House.

“I personally have talked to President Trump about Project 2025 because my role in the project has been to make sure that all of the candidates who have responded to our offer for a briefing on Project 2025 get one from me,” Roberts told the newspaper.

Trump, for his part, has continued to deny he had any knowledge of the blueprint, and his spokesperson told the Post that Roberts never briefed him. A Heritage spokesperson told the Post that Trump seemed “uninterested” in what Roberts had to say during the flight.

Trump, the Republican nominee for president, has moved to distance himself from Project 2025 amid fierce criticism from Democrats, and the Heritage Foundation replaced the director of the project last month.

“Project 2025 has never and will never be an accurate reflection of President Trump’s policies,” the spokesperson, Karoline Leavitt, told the publication. “As President Trump himself and our campaign leadership have repeatedly stated, President Trump’s 20 promises to the forgotten men and women and the [Republican Party] platform are the only policies endorsed by President Trump for a second term.”

Roberts also postponed the release of a new book this week, which includes a foreword written by Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, until after the November election.

The Democratic Party quickly pounced on the Post’s report, calling Trump a “liar” and saying the photo confirms how the former president and his running mate “are fully connected to this dangerous plan to rip away our freedoms, threaten our democracy, and take our country backward.”

“While Trump and Vance desperately try to distance themselves from their own ultra-MAGA platform, voters are learning more and more about Project 2025’s wildly unpopular proposals every day ― and are ready to reject this extreme, far-right blueprint at the ballot box in November,” Alex Floyd, the Democratic National Committee’s rapid response director, said in a statement.

Trump shared a private flight with Project 2025's head despite denying connection.,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/08/kamala-harris-tim-walz-uaw-union-credentials,"At a union hall in the Detroit area on Thursday, Kamala Harris and her running mate, the Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, addressed members of the United Auto Workers (UAW) at a campaign stop intended to play up the Democratic candidates’ support for unions.

During the town hall-style event, which was held at the headquarters of UAW Local 900, Harris and Walz emphasized their support for organized labor and slammed Donald Trump for his anti-union record.

Members of Local 900 were among the first to go on strike last year, when 3,300 workers from a Wayne county plant producing pickup trucks and SUVs walked out on 15 September. During the strike, which ended with UAW ratifying contracts with Ford, GM and Stellantis that secured 25% wage increases and cost-of-living adjustments, Joe Biden visited the picket line – becoming the first US president in history to do so.

Unions, which already overwhelmingly backed Harris, welcomed Walz – who signed a raft of worker protections and pro-union bills into law in 2023 – on to the Democratic party ticket.

Sean Fain, the president of the union, introduced Harris and Walz, contrasting the candidates with Trump and JD Vance, who have attempted to court workers in recent months but whose policy records are notably anti-union.

“You know, this is a ‘which side are you on’ moment, and the choice cannot be any clearer,” said Fain. Trump and Vance, Fain said, “spent their lives serving themselves, representing the billionaire class and enriching themselves at the expense of the working class”. He shot back at Trump, who called the UAW president a “stupid person” during a Fox News interview that aired this month.

“Donald Trump calls me stupid,” said Fain. “You know why? Because he thinks auto workers are stupid. But we’re not stupid. We don’t fall for Trump’s alternative facts, what we call lies.”

During their remarks, Walz and Harris spoke appreciatively of the UAW, drawing a sharp distinction between their position on labor and Trump’s.

“I couldn’t be prouder to stand with UAW,” said Walz, who spoke about Trump’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and his anti-union posture. Speaking about the rightwing presidential playbook, Project 2025, Walz said one of the goals was to “get rid of labor unions and get rid of the voices they bring, so they can do whatever the hell they want”.

During Harris’s speech, the vice-president referred to a political “perversion” of the Republican party, “where there’s a suggestion that somehow strength is about making people feel small, making people feel alone, but isn’t that the very opposite of what we know, unions know, to be strong? It’s about the collective. It’s about knowing that no one should ever be made to fight alone.”

Since launching her campaign, Harris has turned to the ideas of freedom and individual liberties – concepts long associated with the rhetoric of the conservative movement – and turned them back on Trump and the modern Republican party. In Harris’s campaign rallies so far, abortion rights, LGBTQ+ rights and, in this speech, labor rights form the basis of freedom.

“Even if you’re not a member of a union, you better thank unions. I’m here to say thank you, thank you, thank you to the sisters and brothers of UAW for all you are and all we will do over these next 89 days,” said Harris, exiting to Beyoncé’s Freedom, now a Harris campaign anthem."
Trump shared a private flight with Project 2025's head despite denying connection.,https://www.inkl.com/glance/news/former-uvalde-schools-police-chief-says-he-s-being-scapegoated-over-response-to-mass-shooting,"The former police chief of the Uvalde school district said he thinks he's been “scapegoated” as the one to blame for the botched law enforcement response to the Robb Elementary School shooting, when hundreds of officers waited more than an hour to confront the gunman even as children were lying dead and wounded inside adjoining classrooms.

Pete Arredondo and another former district police officer are the only two people to have been charged over their actions that day, even though nearly 400 local, state and federal officers responded to the scene and waited as children called 911 and parents begged the officers to go in.

“I've been scapegoated from the very beginning,” Arredondo told CNN during an interview that aired Wednesday. The sit-down marked his first public statements in two years about the May 24, 2022, attack that killed 19 students and two teachers, making it one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history.

Within days after shooting, Col. Steve McCraw, the head of the Texas Department of Public Safety, identified Arredondo as the “incident commander” of a law enforcement response that included nearly 100 state troopers and officers from the Border Patrol. Even with the massive law enforcement presence, officers waited more than 70 minutes to breach the classroom door and kill the shooter.

Scathing state and federal investigative reports about the police response catalogued “cascading failures” in training, communication, leadership and technology problems.

A grand jury indicted Arredondo and former Uvalde schools police Officer Adrian Gonzales last month on multiple charges of child endangerment and abandonment. They pleaded not guilty.

The indictment against Arredondo contends that he didn't follow his active shooter training and made critical decisions that slowed the police response while the gunman was ""hunting” victims.

Arredondo told CNN that the narrative that he is responsible for the police response that day and ignored his training is based on “lies and deception.”

“If you look at the bodycam footage, there was no hesitation — there was no hesitation in myself and the first handful of officers that went in there and went straight into the hot zone, as you may call it, and took fire,” Arredondo said, noting that footage also shows he wasn't wearing a protective vest as officers inside the school pondered what to do.

Despite being cast as the incident commander, Arredondo said state police should have set up a command post outside and taken control.

“The guidebook tells you the incident commander does not stand in the hallway and get shot at,” Arredondo. “The incident commander is someone who is not in the hot zone.”

The Texas Department of Public Safety, which oversees the state police and other statewide law enforcement agencies, and Uvalde County District Attorney Christina Mitchell did not respond to requests for comment.

Javier Cazares, whose daughter Jacklyn Cazares was one of the students killed, criticized Arredondo's comments.

“I don’t understand his feeling that there was no wrongdoing. He heard the shots. There’s no excuse for not going in,” Cazares told The Associated Press on Thursday. “There were children. Shots were fired. Kids were calling, and he didn’t do anything.”

Arredondo refused to watch video clips of the police response.

“I've kept myself from that. It’s difficult for me to see that. These are my children, too,” he told CNN. He also said it wasn't until several days after the attack that he heard there were children who were still alive in the classroom and calling 911 for help while officers waited outside.

When asked if he thought he made mistakes that day, Arredondo said, “It’s a hindsight statement. You can think all day and second guess yourself. ... I know we did the best we could with what he had."""

"Crew of Titan sub knew they were going to die before implosion, according to more information.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/08/us/titan-submersible-implosion-lawsuit/index.html,"AP —

The family of a French explorer who died in a submersible implosion has filed a more than $50 million lawsuit, saying the crew experienced “terror and mental anguish” before the disaster and accusing the sub’s operator of gross negligence.

Paul-Henri Nargeolet was among five people who died when the Titan submersible imploded during a voyage to the famed Titanic wreck site in the North Atlantic in June 2023. No one survived the trip aboard the experimental submersible owned by OceanGate, a company in Washington state that has since suspended operations.

Known as “Mr. Titanic,” Nargeolet participated in 37 dives to the Titanic site, the most of any diver in the world, according to the lawsuit. He was regarded as one of the world’s most knowledgeable people about the famous wreck. Attorneys for his estate said in an emailed statement that the “doomed submersible” had a “troubled history,” and that OceanGate failed to disclose key facts about the vessel and its durability.

According to the lawsuit, the Titan “dropped weights” about 90 minutes into its dive, indicating the team had aborted or attempted to abort the dive.

“While the exact cause of failure may never be determined, experts agree that the Titan’s crew would have realized exactly what was happening,” the lawsuit states. “Common sense dictates that the crew were well aware they were going to die, before dying.”

The lawsuit goes on to say: “The crew may well have heard the carbon fiber’s crackling noise grow more intense as the weight of the water pressed on Titan’s hull. The crew lost communications and perhaps power as well. By experts’ reckoning, they would have continued to descend, in full knowledge of the vessel’s irreversible failures, experiencing terror and mental anguish prior to the Titan ultimately imploding.”

A spokesperson for OceanGate declined to comment on the lawsuit, which was filed Tuesday in King County, Washington. The defendants must respond to the complaint in the coming weeks, court papers state. The lawsuit describes Nargeolet as an employee of OceanGate and a crew member on the Titan.

The suit also criticizes Titan’s “hip, contemporary, wireless electronics system, and states that none of the controller, controls or gauges would work without a constant source of power and a wireless signal.”

Though OceanGate designated Nargeolet as a member of the crew, “many of the particulars about the vessel’s flaws and shortcomings were not disclosed and were purposely concealed,” the attorneys, the Buzbee Law Firm of Houston, Texas, said in their statement.

Tony Buzbee, one of the attorneys on the case, said one of the suit’s goals is to “get answers for the family as to exactly how this happened, who all were involved, and how those involved could allow this to happen.”

Concerns were raised in the aftermath of the disaster about whether the Titan was doomed due to its unconventional design and its creator’s refusal to submit to independent checks that are standard in the industry. Its implosion also raised questions about the viability and future of private deep-sea exploration.

The U.S. Coast Guard quickly convened a high-level investigation, which is ongoing. A key public hearing that is part of the investigation is scheduled to take place in September.

The Titan made its last dive on June 18, 2023, a Sunday morning, and lost contact with its support vessel about two hours later. After a search and rescue mission that drew attention around the world, the wreckage of the Titan was found on the ocean floor about 984 feet (300 meters) off the bow of the Titanic, about 435 miles (700 kilometers) south of St. John’s, Newfoundland.

OceanGate CEO and cofounder Stockton Rush was operating the Titan when it imploded. The lawsuit describes Rush as “an eccentric and self-styled ‘innovator’ in the deep-sea diving industry” and names his estate as one of the defendants.

In addition to Rush and Nargeolet, the implosion killed British adventurer Hamish Harding and two members of a prominent Pakistani family, Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman Dawood.

The company that owns the salvage rights to the Titanic is in the midst of its first voyage to the wreckage site in years. Last month, RMS Titanic Inc., a Georgia-based firm, launched its first expedition to the site since 2010 from Providence, Rhode Island.

Nargeolet was director of underwater research for RMS Titanic. He was part of an expedition to visit the Titanic site in 1987, shortly after its location was discovered, and had supervised the salvage of innumerable Titanic artifacts, the lawsuit states. His estate’s attorneys described him as a seasoned veteran of underwater exploration who would not have participated in the Titan expedition if the company had been more transparent.

The lawsuit blames the implosion on the “persistent carelessness, recklessness and negligence” of OceanGate, Rush and others.

“Decedent Nargeolet may have died doing what he loved to do, but his death — and the deaths of the other Titan crew members — was wrongful,” the lawsuit states."

The family of a French explorer who died in the Titan submersible implosion has filed a $50m wrongful death lawsuit against the operator, claiming the crew suffered “terror and mental anguish” before disaster struck.

Paul Henri-Nargeolet’s family is asking for more than $50m in damages, accusing OceanGate, the company that owned and operated the beleaguered Titan submersible, and its founder of wrongful death, gross negligence, pre-death pain and suffering and mental anguish, and other counts. His family filed the suit in Washington state court on August 6.

Nargeolet, known as “Mr Titanic” for having participated in 37 dives to the Titanic wreckage site — “the most of any diver worldwide” — set out with five other crew members to explore the famous wreckage on June 18, 2023.

But the entire mission came to a shocking end when the vessel lost contact less than two hours into its voyage. The world watched as a search-and-rescue mission rushed to find the crew before the submersible’s 96-hour oxygen supply ran out.

The deaths that arose from the “catastrophic implosion” were “directly due” to the defendants’ “persistent carelessness, recklessness and negligence,” the complaint states.

The suit accuses OceanGate and its founder, 61-year-old Stockton Rush, of having “designed, constructed and operated” the submersible in almost every way “in a manner outside the norms of the diving community and industry.” This diversion from the standard was “driven by Rush’s apparent obsession with being remembered for ‘innovation’ alongside such luminaries as Steve Jobs and Elon Musk,” according to the suit.

The lawsuit claims that Rush, specifically, flouted rules of convention, ignored warnings from experts, and used atypical materials, the suit says. Instead, he prioritized promoting his reputation as an industry “disruptor.”

For example, while titanium is usually used for deep-sea exploration submersibles, Rush “believed that titanium was unnecessarily heavy” and opted for Titan’s hull to be made from carbon fiber, which “breaks down over time under pressure.” However, Rush acknowledged the “catastrophic failure where you have imperfections in the [carbon fiber] structure,” so he installed an acoustic safety system to detect problems.

The Titan traversed to the depth of the wreckage site only a few times before the mission — but these trips would have weakened the vessel’s “carbon-fiber hull and/or the connections and seals between disparate types of material,” the suit added.

Oceangate’s head of marine operations, “the employee ultimately most responsible for the safety of anyone sailing” on Titan, asked for a scan of the carbon fiber hull as part of a detailed safety report, causing Rush to become “infuriated.” The founder not only refused to conduct a scan, but after addressing the report, Rush fired the safety chief.

On top of this expert’s opinion, Rush heard warnings from other experts as well as from the Marine Technology Society, which sent a letter to OceanGate in 2018 stating that “the current ‘experimental’ approach adopted by OceanGate … could result in negative outcomes (from minor to catastrophic).” However, the suit states: “None of the warnings were heeded.”

The vessel was also never certified by the leading group DNV. Rush declined to seek DNV certification for Titan because he believed “it would be too difficult to ‘educate’ DNV personnel – who are by any measure world-class experts on the requirements and dangers of deep-sea diving – on the purported advantages of Titan’s ‘innovative’ design,” the complaint says.

Commander Paul-Henri Nargeolet pictured in 1996 ( AP )

The suit also states that crew members were required to sign a waiver — which “failed to disclose many key, relevant risk factors…regarding the design and operation of TITAN or the materials used in its construction.”

Despite his extensive knowledge of the ocean floor near the Titanic ship, the 77-year-old Nargeolet was never fully informed about the safety of the vessel, the suit says. “Neither Rush nor OceanGate ever fully or accurately disclosed all of the material facts regarding Titan’s design and construction…On the contrary, Rush and OceanGate actively fostered Nargeolet’s (and others’) false impressions about the safety and seaworthiness of the vessel”.

Stockton Rush is accused of ignoring safety warnings about the vessel ( OceanGate )

The worst happened. When the acoustic safety system’s alarm sounded, signaling the hull was “cracking under extreme pressure,” it prompted the pilot to release weight and attempt to abort the expedition.

The crew had no communications and likely would have had no power either. “Common sense dictates that the crew were well aware they were going to die, before dying,” the suit states.

“The crew may well have heard the carbon fiber’s crackling noise grow more intense as the weight of the water pressed on TITAN’s hull,” the filing says. “By experts’ reckoning, they would have continued to descend, in full knowledge of the vessel’s irreversible failures, experiencing terror and mental anguish prior to the Titan ultimately imploding.”

Aside from the Titan, no commercial manned submersible has ever suffered an implosion, the suit says.

Both Rush and Nargeolet died in the implosion, along with British explorer Hamish Harding, 58, UK-based Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood, 48, and his 19-year-old son Suleman.

Tony Buzbee, one of the lawyers for the family, said in a statement: “We are hopeful that through this lawsuit we can get answers for the family as to exactly how this happened, who all were involved, and how those involved could allow this to happen.”

In the immediate aftermath of the Titan tragedy, a so-called “log” detailing the crew’s final moments circulated the internet, suggesting that they were aware of the imminent implosion. But in June, Captain Jason Neubauer, chair of the Marine Board of Investigation (MBI), told the New York Times: “I’m confident it’s a false transcript.” Neubauer added that his team “found no evidence” that the crew had any awareness of their impending deaths.

The Independent has emailed a spokesperson for the MBI for further comment.

Crew had 'full knowledge' that Titan was doomed

The lawsuit claims the Titan began dropping weights about 90 minutes into its dive in an apparent, ill-fated effort to return to the surface.

""The crew may well have heard the carbon fiber's crackling noise grow more intense as the weight of the water pressed on Titan's hull,"" the lawsuit says. ""By experts' reckoning, they would have continued to descend, in full knowledge of the vessel's irreversible failures, experiencing terror and mental anguish prior to the Titan ultimately imploding.""

The Transportation Safety Board of Canada and the French Marine Casualty Investigation Authority are working with the Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board and are conducting ""parallel"" investigations.

What happened to the Titan submersible?

The Titan's trip, expected to take two hours, began at 8 a.m. about 435 miles off the coast of Newfoundland. An hour and 45 minutes later, the submersible's support ship lost contact with it. At 3 p.m., the Titan failed to surface. The frantic search and rescue operation that ensued transfixed the world.

On June 22, the U.S. Coast Guard announced the discovery of a debris field. The vessel likely suffered a ""catastrophic implosion"" and OceanGate announced all occupants of the Titan had been lost.

""The case brought by the Nargeolet family alleges a troubled history of the doomed submersible,"" Buzbee said.

Current Titanic expedition would have included Nargeolet

The Titan tragedy has not ended the interest in exploring the Titanic. In July, RMS Titanic Inc. launched Titanic Expedition 2024, a crew including videographers, photographers, scientists and historians, from Providence, Rhode Island. Nargeolet was scheduled to participate in the current Titanic expedition.

No crew members were visiting the wreckage, but two remotely operated vehicles were sent 12,500 feet deep into the Atlantic. The cameras would survey the sunken ship and take high-resolution images to “preserve the existing state of the site digitally,"" the company said. The exploration team said in a social media post this week that it was headed home.

""Battling some rough seas today,"" the team said in a social media post this week, adding: ""The waves are relentless, but the #TITANICExpedition2024 crew is strong.""

The Titanic also brought tragedy

The Titanic captured the nation's imagination in 1912, the largest and most well-appointed cruise ship of its time. But the ship hit an iceberg on April 15 of that year and quickly sank, killing more than 1,500. About 700 passengers were rescued. The wreck was discovered on Sept. 1, 1985, about 400 miles from the coast of Newfoundland.

Hundreds of books have been written about the ship. James Cameron's film ""Titanic"" was released in 1997 and is among the highest-grossing films of all time.

Nargeolet was a French explorer and part of the five-person crew that boarded the vessel, operated by OceanGate, to view the wreckage of the Titanic, which is about 12,500 feet below the water. The crew was killed when the submersible imploded under the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean.

The lawsuit claims that the crew members knew something was wrong about 90 minutes into their trip to the depths of the Atlantic Ocean.

""While the exact cause of failure may never be determined, experts agree that the Titan's crew would have realized exactly what was happening,"" the lawsuit states, according to CNN. ""Common sense dictates that the crew were well aware they were going to die, before dying.""

""The crew may well have heard the carbon fiber's crackling noise grow more intense as the weight of the water pressed on Titan's hull. The crew lost communications and perhaps power as well,"" the lawsuit continues. ""By experts' reckoning, they would have continued to descend, in full knowledge of the vessel's irreversible failures, experiencing terror and mental anguish prior to the Titan ultimately imploding.""

The lawsuit accuses OceanGate, which suspended operations following the tragedy, of hiding potential flaws in the submersible's design and cutting corners on safety.

""Many of the particulars about the vessel's flaws and shortcomings were not disclosed and were purposely concealed,"" the Buzbee Law Firm of Houston, Texas, said in a statement.

The lawyers added that they want to ""get answers for the family as to exactly how this happened, who all were involved, and how those involved could allow this to happen."""
"Crew of Titan sub knew they were going to die before implosion, according to more information.",https://abovethelaw.com/2024/08/oceangate-targeted-with-50m-suit-over-titan-failure/,"Much of the news following the OceanGate Titan failure has been focused on the clear shortcomings of their former CEO or explaining what an implosion is in lay terms. Outside of the poor taste Oxygen Clock countdown, there hasn’t been much discussion about what the experience would have been like for the passengers of the vessel. The lawsuit against OceanGate has centered on what would have been going through the passengers’ minds before the implosion. Yahoo! has coverage:

“While the exact cause of failure may never be determined, experts agree that the Titan’s crew would have realized exactly what was happening,” the lawsuit states. “Common sense dictates that the crew were well aware they were going to die, before dying.”

José Luis Martín, a submarine expert, inferred that the crew would have realized that something went terribly wrong for about a full minute before the implosion. ABC quoted him describing the likely scenario as something out of a horror movie:

The Titan changed position and fell like an arrow vertically because the 400 kilos of passengers that were in the porthole compromised the submarine,” Martin said. “They all rushed and crowded on top of each other. Imagine the horror, the fear and the agony. It must have been like a horror movie.”

OceanGate has several weeks to respond. While they have to respond with something, it may be hard for them to overcome Stockton Rush’s meticulously documented corner cutting and retaliation against employees voicing safety concerns.

The family of a French explorer killed on the Titan sub is suing OceanGate for over $50 million.

Paul-Henri Nargeolet died alongside four other people last year when the submersible imploded.

The suit claims the ""crew were well aware they were going to die, before dying.""

The crew of the ill-fated Titan submersible, a new lawsuit says, knew that the vehicle was about to implode during its descent and suffered ""terror and mental anguish.""

The allegation was made by the family of the French explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet, who was killed on the sub last year. His family is suing OceanGate, the estate of its CEO, Stockton Rush, and others for more than $50 million.

OceanGate's dive to the Titanic shipwreck on June 18, 2023, killed all five people on board . The sub is believed to have imploded within hours of its descent, which raised concerns about OceanGate's approach to innovation and safety.

The lawsuit says the implosion was the result of the ""carelessness, recklessness and negligence"" of OceanGate, Rush, and others.

The Titan sub ""dropped weights"" a little over an hour into its dive, the suit says, adding that indicates the team had attempted to terminate the expedition. ""Common sense dictates that the crew were well aware they were going to die, before dying,"" the lawsuit says.

It adds: ""The crew may well have heard the carbon fiber's crackling noise grow more intense as the weight of the water pressed on Titan's hull.

""The crew lost communications and perhaps power as well. By experts' reckoning, they would have continued to descend, in full knowledge of the vessel's irreversible failures, experiencing terror and mental anguish prior to the Titan ultimately imploding.""

Nargeolet, nicknamed Mr. Titanic, was hired to help OceanGate during the Titan's trip. But the wrongful-death suit claims that he was misled.

""Mr. Rush confessed to a 'mission specialist' on one Titanic voyage that he had 'gotten the carbon fiber used to make the Titan at a big discount from Boeing because it was past its shelf life for use in airplanes,'"" the lawsuit, which was filed Tuesday in King County, Washington, says.

Nargeolet had participated in 37 dives to the wreckage of the Titanic, which the court filing says is the most of any diver in the world. His dives included part of the first expedition to the Titanic in 1987, shortly after its location was discovered.

The court documents describe Rush as an ""eccentric and self-styled 'innovator'"" who had an ""obsession with being remembered for 'innovation' alongside such luminaries as Steve Jobs and Elon Musk.""

They also referred to instances such as OceanGate's firing of David Lockridge, which The New Yorker reported came after he raised concerns about the submersible's safety and the fact that the Titan deviated from the industry standard of using titanium for its hull.

""TITAN was and remains the only submersible ever produced with a carbon-fiber hull,"" the suit says.

OceanGate's chief engineer, Tony Nissen, was specifically called out for allegedly hiring a ""2017 graduate and having six or fewer years' of relevant work experience"" as the lead electrical engineer on the project.

The company has suspended all exploration and commercial operations since the tragedy.

The clerk's office of the King County Superior Court has set the first trial date for August 2025.

Tony Buzbee, one of the attorneys on the case, told Business Insider: ""We are hopeful that through this lawsuit we can get answers for the family as to exactly how this happened, who all were involved, and how those involved could allow this to happen.""

Matt Shaffer, another attorney representing the Nargeolet family, said: ""We have alleged in the lawsuit that had Stockton Rush (OceanGate's CEO and founder) been transparent about all the troubles that had been experienced with the Titan, as well as the previous, similar models, someone as experienced and knowledgeable as Paul Henri-Nargeolet would not have participated.

""The filing asserts that Stockton Rush simply wasn't forthcoming with the crew and passengers about the dangers he and others knew about but the passengers and crew did not.""

OceanGate declined to comment for this story.

"Crew of Titan sub knew they were going to die before implosion, according to more information.",https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/explorer-s-family-could-have-difficulty-winning-their-lawsuit-against-titan-sub-owner-experts-say-1.6993906,"PORTLAND, Maine -

A lawsuit stemming from the Titan submersible disaster felt inevitable, but winning a big judgment against the owner of the vessel could be very difficult, legal experts said on Thursday.

The family of French explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet, one of five people who died aboard the submersible in June 2023, filed a more than US$50 million civil lawsuit against submersible owner OceanGate earlier this week. Nargeolet's estate said in the lawsuit that the crew aboard the sub experienced ""terror and mental anguish"" before the sub imploded and its operator was guilty of gross negligence.

Now comes the hard part -- winning in court.

Legal experts said Nargeolet's estate may get some money from the lawsuit, but it could be a fraction of the amount sought. It's also unclear if there will be any money available, as OceanGate has since shut down operations, they said.

Some say that the passengers onboard the Titan assumed risk when they got aboard an experimental submersible headed for the Titanic wreck site.

""They made choices to go do this, and it seems to me it was a 50/50 shot anyway it was going to work,"" said John Perlstein, a personal injury lawyer in California and Nevada. ""They bear responsibility too, as well as the guy who built and piloted this thing.""

Nargeolet's estate filed its lawsuit on Tuesday in King County, Washington, as OceanGate was a Washington-based company. A spokesperson for OceanGate declined to comment on aspects of the lawsuit.

Attorneys for Nargeolet's estate are hinging their case in part on the emotional and mental pain of the passengers on board the Titan. The attorneys, with the Buzbee Law Firm in Houston, Texas, said that the crew ""were well aware they were going to die, before dying,"" since they dropped weights about 90 minutes into the dive.

But that could be hard to prove, said Richard Daynard, distinguished professor of law at Northeastern University in Boston. Attorneys will have a difficult time demonstrating that the implosion and resulting deaths were not instantaneous, he said.

It could, however, be possible to prove negligence, Daynard said. But even that doesn't guarantee a big-money judgment, he said.

""A settlement is a possibility, but presumably if the case has a very tiny chance of winning, the settlement will be a tiny fraction of the amount sought,"" Daynard said.

The Titan made its final dive on June 18, 2023, and lost contact with its support vessel about two hours later. After a search and rescue mission that drew international attention, the Titan wreckage was found on the ocean floor about 984 feet (300 metres) off the bow of the Titanic, about 435 miles (700 kilometres) south of St. John's, Newfoundland.

OceanGate CEO and cofounder Stockton Rush was operating the Titan when it imploded. In addition to Rush and Nargeolet, the implosion killed British adventurer Hamish Harding and two members of a prominent Pakistani family, Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman Dawood. No one on board survived.

It wasn't surprising to see a lawsuit filed stemming from the Titan case, but Nargeolet's estate could be suing a company that has little assets, said Ted Spaulding, an Atlanta-based personal injury attorney. He characterized the lawsuit as a ""Hail Mary"" attempt at relief.

""I'm not sure there is anyone else to sue but OceanGate in this case. Maybe they could have sued the CEO and co-founder of the company Stockton Rush if he had assets, but he died on the submersible too,"" Spaulding said.

Nargeolet was a veteran explorer known as ""Mr. Titanic"" who participated in 37 dives to the Titanic site, the most of any diver in the world, according to the lawsuit. His death was mourned around the world by members of the undersea exploration community.

There is an ongoing, high-level investigation into the Titan's implosion, which the U.S. Coast Guard quickly convened after the disaster. A key public hearing that is part of the investigation is scheduled to take place in September."

The family of a French explorer who died in a submersible implosion has filed a more than $50 million lawsuit, saying the crew experienced “terror and mental anguish” before the disaster and accusing the sub’s operator of gross negligence.

Paul-Henri Nargeolet was among five people who died when the Titan submersible imploded during a voyage to the famed Titanic wreck site in the North Atlantic in June 2023. No one survived the trip aboard the experimental submersible owned by OceanGate, a company in Washington state that has since suspended operations.

Known as “Mr. Titanic,” Nargeolet participated in 37 dives to the Titanic site, the most of any diver in the world, according to the lawsuit. He was regarded as one of the world’s most knowledgeable people about the famous wreck. Attorneys for his estate said in an emailed statement that the “doomed submersible” had a “troubled history,” and that OceanGate failed to disclose key facts about the vessel and its durability.

According to the lawsuit, the Titan “dropped weights” about 90 minutes into its dive, indicating the team had aborted or attempted to abort the dive.

“While the exact cause of failure may never be determined, experts agree that the Titan’s crew would have realized exactly what was happening,” the lawsuit states. “Common sense dictates that the crew were well aware they were going to die, before dying.”

The lawsuit goes on to say: “The crew may well have heard the carbon fiber’s crackling noise grow more intense as the weight of the water pressed on Titan’s hull. The crew lost communications and perhaps power as well. By experts’ reckoning, they would have continued to descend, in full knowledge of the vessel’s irreversible failures, experiencing terror and mental anguish prior to the Titan ultimately imploding.”

A spokesperson for OceanGate declined to comment on the lawsuit, which was filed Tuesday in King County, Washington. The lawsuit describes Nargeolet as an employee of OceanGate and a crew member on the Titan.

The lawsuit also criticizes Titan’s “hip, contemporary, wireless electronics system, and states that none of the controller, controls or gauges would work without a constant source of power and a wireless signal.

“The lawsuit further alleges that even though Nargeolet had been designated by OceanGate to be a member of the crew of the vessel, many of the particulars about the vessel’s flaws and shortcomings were not disclosed and were purposely concealed,” the attorneys, the Buzbee Law Firm of Houston, Texas, said in their statement.

Tony Buzbee, one of the attorneys on the case, said one goal of the lawsuit is to “get answers for the family as to exactly how this happened, who all were involved, and how those involved could allow this to happen.”

Concerns were raised in the aftermath of the disaster about whether the Titan was doomed due to its unconventional design and its creator’s refusal to submit to independent checks that are standard in the industry. Its implosion also raised questions about the viability and future of private deep-sea exploration.

The U.S. Coast Guard quickly convened a high-level investigation, which is ongoing. A key public hearing that is part of the investigation is scheduled to take place in September.

The Titan made its last dive on June 18, 2023, a Sunday morning, and lost contact with its support vessel about two hours later. After a search and rescue mission that drew attention around the world, the wreckage of the Titan was found on the ocean floor about 984 feet (300 meters) off the bow of the Titanic, about 435 miles (700 kilometers) south of St. John’s, Newfoundland.

OceanGate CEO and cofounder Stockton Rush was operating the Titan when it imploded. In addition to Rush and Nargeolet, the implosion killed British adventurer Hamish Harding and two members of a prominent Pakistani family, Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman Dawood.

The company that owns the salvage rights to the Titanic is in the midst of its first voyage to the wreckage site in years. Last month, RMS Titanic Inc., a Georgia-based firm, launched its first expedition to the site since 2010 from Providence, Rhode Island.

Nargeolet was director of underwater research for RMS Titanic. One of the expeditions Nargeolet took was the first visit to the Titanic in 1987, shortly after its location was discovered, the lawsuit states. His estate’s attorneys described him as a seasoned veteran of underwater exploration who would not have participated in the Titan expedition if the company had been more transparent.

The lawsuit blames the implosion on the “persistent carelessness, recklessness and negligence” of Oceangate, Rush and others.

“Decedent Nargeolet may have died doing what he loved to do, but his death — and the deaths of the other Titan crew members — was wrongful,” the lawsuit states."

Terrified crew members onboard the doomed Titan sub reportedly knew they were going to die before the craft imploded, according to a bombshell new lawsuit.

The family of French explorer Paul Henri-Nargeolet is suing OceanGate for more than $50,000,000 in damages after claiming the Titan crew suffered ‘terror and mental anguish’ before disaster struck.

Other charges brought against OceanGate, who developed and piloted the craft, are claims that Nargeolet suffered from wrongful death, gross negligence, pre-death pain and suffering and mental anguish, and other counts.

Known as ‘Mr Titanic’, Mr Nargeolet had visited the Titanic site many times before and was regarded as one of the world’s most knowledgeable people about the famous wreck.

Paul-Henri Nargeolet was among five people who died when the Titan submersible imploded during a voyage to the famed Titanic wreck site in the North Atlantic in June 2023. No one survived the trip aboard the experimental submersible owned by OceanGate, a company in Washington state that has since suspended operations.

Known as ""Mr. Titanic,"" Nargeolet participated in 37 dives to the Titanic site, the most of any diver in the world, according to the lawsuit. He was regarded as one of the world's most knowledgeable people about the famous wreck. Attorneys for his estate said in an emailed statement that the ""doomed submersible"" had a ""troubled history,"" and that OceanGate failed to disclose key facts about the vessel and its durability.

According to the lawsuit, the Titan ""dropped weights"" about 90 minutes into its dive, indicating the team had aborted or attempted to abort the dive.

""While the exact cause of failure may never be determined, experts agree that the Titan's crew would have realized exactly what was happening,"" the lawsuit states. ""Common sense dictates that the crew were well aware they were going to die, before dying.""

The lawsuit goes on to say: ""The crew may well have heard the carbon fiber's crackling noise grow more intense as the weight of the water pressed on Titan's hull. The crew lost communications and perhaps power as well. By experts' reckoning, they would have continued to descend, in full knowledge of the vessel's irreversible failures, experiencing terror and mental anguish prior to the Titan ultimately imploding.""

A spokesperson for OceanGate declined to comment on the lawsuit, which was filed Tuesday in King County, Washington. The defendants must respond to the complaint in the coming weeks, court papers state. The lawsuit describes Nargeolet as an employee of OceanGate and a crew member on the Titan.

The suit also criticizes Titan's ""hip, contemporary, wireless electronics system,"" and states that none of the controller, controls or gauges would work without a constant source of power and a wireless signal.

Though OceanGate designated Nargeolet as a member of the crew, ""many of the particulars about the vessel's flaws and shortcomings were not disclosed and were purposely concealed,"" the attorneys, the Buzbee Law Firm of Houston, Texas, said in their statement.

Tony Buzbee, one of the attorneys on the case, said one of the suit's goals is to ""get answers for the family as to exactly how this happened, who all were involved, and how those involved could allow this to happen.""

Concerns were raised in the aftermath of the disaster about whether the Titan was doomed due to its unconventional design and its creator's refusal to submit to independent checks that are standard in the industry. Its implosion also raised questions about the viability and future of private deep-sea exploration.

The U.S. Coast Guard quickly convened a high-level investigation, which is ongoing. A key public hearing that is part of the investigation is scheduled to take place in September.

The Titan made its last dive on June 18, 2023, a Sunday morning, and lost contact with its support vessel about two hours later. After a search and rescue mission that drew attention around the world, the wreckage of the Titan was found on the ocean floor about 984 feet (300 metres) off the bow of the Titanic, about 435 miles (700 kilometres) south of St. John's, Newfoundland.

OceanGate CEO and cofounder Stockton Rush was operating the Titan when it imploded. The lawsuit describes Rush as ""an eccentric and self-styled 'innovator' in the deep-sea diving industry"" and names his estate as one of the defendants.

In addition to Rush and Nargeolet, the implosion killed British adventurer Hamish Harding and two members of a prominent Pakistani family, Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman Dawood.

The company that owns the salvage rights to the Titanic is in the midst of its first voyage to the wreckage site in years. Last month, RMS Titanic Inc., a Georgia-based firm, launched its first expedition to the site since 2010 from Providence, Rhode Island.

Nargeolet was director of underwater research for RMS Titanic. He was part of an expedition to visit the Titanic site in 1987, shortly after its location was discovered, and had supervised the salvage of innumerable Titanic artifacts, the lawsuit states. His estate's attorneys described him as a seasoned veteran of underwater exploration who would not have participated in the Titan expedition if the company had been more transparent.

The lawsuit blames the implosion on the ""persistent carelessness, recklessness and negligence"" of Oceangate, Rush and others.

""Decedent Nargeolet may have died doing what he loved to do, but his death -- and the deaths of the other Titan crew members -- was wrongful,"" the lawsuit states."

—



The family of a French explorer who died in a drowning explosion has filed a more than $50 million lawsuit, saying the crew suffered “terror and mental anguish” before the disaster and accusing the deputy director of gross negligence.

Paul-Henri Narjolet was one of the five who died then The submarine Titan exploded During a trip to the famous Titanic wreck site in the North Atlantic in June 2023. None of the passengers aboard the experimental submarine, owned by OceanGate, a company in Washington state, survived.

“Mr. Titanic,” Narjolet participated in 37 dives Titanic site, according to the lawsuit, the most of any diver in the world. He was considered one of the most knowledgeable people in the world about the famous wreck. Attorneys for his estate said in an emailed statement that the “wrecked submarine” has a “complicated history” and that OceanGate failed to disclose key facts about the vessel and its survival.

According to the lawsuit, the Titan lost weight about 90 minutes into its dive.

“Although the exact cause of the failure has never been determined, experts agree that the Titan’s crew must have known exactly what was going on,” the lawsuit states. “Common sense dictates that before dying, the crew knew they were going to die.”

The lawsuit continues: “The crew could have heard the cracking of the carbon fiber grow louder as the weight of water pressed against Titan’s hull. The crew also lost communications and power. According to experts’ calculations, they would have continued to descend, in full knowledge of the ship’s irreversible failures, and to experience terror and anguish before the Titan finally exploded.

A spokeswoman for OceanGate declined to comment on the lawsuit, which was filed Tuesday in King County, Washington. Court documents say the defendants are expected to respond to the complaint in the coming weeks. The lawsuit describes Norjolette as an employee of OceanGate and working for Titan.

The lawsuit also criticizes the Titan’s “hip, contemporary, wireless electronics system, and claims that none of the controllers, controls or gauges will work without constant power and a wireless signal.”

Although OceanGate appointed Nargeolet as a member of the board, “many details of the vessel’s defects and deficiencies were not disclosed and were intentionally concealed,” lawyers for the Buzbee Law Firm of Houston, Texas, said in their statement.

Tony Busbee, one of the attorneys in the case, said one of the goals of the case is to “get answers for the family as to how this happened, who was involved, and how those involved could allow this to happen.”

Concerns were raised after the disaster that Titan was doomed because of its unorthodox design and its refusal to submit to industry-standard independent checks. Its explosion raised questions about the viability and future of private deep-sea exploration.

The US Coast Guard quickly assembled a high-level investigation, which is ongoing. A Major Public Inquiry Part of the trial is due to take place in September.

On June 18, 2023, a Sunday morning, Titan made its final dive and lost contact with its support vessel two hours later. After a search and rescue mission that attracted worldwide attention, the wreckage of the Titanic was found on the sea floor about 984 feet (300 meters) from the Titanic, about 435 miles (700 kilometers) south of St. John’s. , Newfoundland.

OceanGate CEO and co-founder Stockton Rush was operating the Titan when it exploded. The suit describes Rush as “an eccentric and self-styled ‘innovator’ in the field of deep-sea diving” and names his estate as one of the defendants.

Besides Rush and Narjolet, the blast killed British adventurer Hamish Harding and Shahjata Dawood and his son Suleman Dawood, members of a prominent Pakistani family.

Owned company Patent for the Titanic It is in the midst of its first trip to a wreck in years. Last month, RMS Titanic Inc., a Georgia-based company, set sail from Providence, Rhode Island, on its first voyage to the site since 2010.

He was part of an expedition to visit the site of the Titanic in 1987, shortly after its location was discovered, and oversaw the salvage of countless Titanic artifacts, the suit says. His estate’s lawyers described him as a seasoned veteran of underwater exploration who would not have participated in the Titan mission if the company had been more transparent.

The lawsuit alleges that the explosion was caused by the “continuous carelessness, inattention and negligence” of OceanGate, Rush and others.

"CNN analyst triggered by JD Vance approaching Kamala Harris' plane, suggests it was threatening.",https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-analyst-triggered-jd-vance-approaching-kamala-harris-plane-suggests-threatening-women,"A CNN analyst complained about GOP vice presidential candidate JD Vance approaching Air Force 2 to try and confront Vice President Harris about her dodging the media so far during her campaign, claiming he’s trying to ""intimidate"" the Democratic presidential nominee.

The Grio's Natasha Alford ripped Vance on CNN Wednesday for approaching the vice president’s plane on a tarmac in Wisconsin and bashing her to the reporters who were waiting for her appearance.

""How dare you, right? This is the vice president of the United States,"" Alford declared.

In a move that went viral on Wednesday, Vance approached a press gaggle awaiting Harris at the Chippewa Valley Regional airport. As Vance got to the reporters, he quipped, ""I just wanted to check out my future plane,"" and then slammed Harris for dodging formal interviews and press conferences to this point in her campaign.

VP KAMALA HARRIS PICKING GOV. TIM WALZ AS RUNNING MATE MET WITH MEDIA SCORN: ‘SUCH A WEIRD CHOICE’

""But I also wanted to go say hello to the vice president and ask her why Kamala Harris refuses… Why does she refuse to answer questions from the media?"" Vance asked.

Alford appeared offended on behalf of the vice president during the CNN segment, saying, ""I think so many people will be turned off by this."" Off-screen, one of her colleagues interjected, ""Stalker.""

""Literally, the stalking, it’s like Donald Trump walking behind Hillary Clinton in the debate,"" she added, mentioning a memorable debate moment between the two candidates in the 2016 election.

Alford went on to describe Vance’s actions as somewhat threatening to women.

COMIC MICHAEL RAPAPORT SAYS HARRIS LOST HIS VOTE OVER ISRAEL: ‘CAN’T SUPPORT PARTY THAT IS FOR THIS BULLS---""

""Again, for women, this is a huge election for women, women‘s rights, our sense of selves, our sense of not having people control our bodies and not having people control us.""

She continued, ""And so that‘s like stepping into her territory. It‘s this very, the physicality of it is supposed to send a message. And I cannot wait until she takes that debate stage so she can fight back.""

In a social media post sharing a clip of her comments, Alford doubled down on this message and the lack of ""respect"" it shows for Harris.

""JD Vance trying to confront Kamala Harris on the tarmac is about showing as little respect for her as possible, especially for her role as VP,"" she wrote.

She then suggested he was exhibiting creepy behavior, adding, ""Women who’ve had men try to intimidate them will recognize this behavior. This could be a campaign about policy and substance, but it continues to be about stunts. It’s not the flex he wanted it to be."""
"CNN analyst triggered by JD Vance approaching Kamala Harris' plane, suggests it was threatening.",https://www.mediaite.com/news/creepy-cnn-morning-crew-torches-trump-pick-vance-over-bizarre-kamala-harris-plane-stunt/,"CNN’s morning show crew tore into Trump VP pick Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) over his stunt visit to Air Force Two as he and Vice President Kamala Harris shared a tarmac in Wisconsin.

Vance made a show of walking over to the vice president’s plane on Wednesday, then told reporters, “Figured I’d come by and wanted to just get a good look at the plane because hopefully it’ll be my plane in a few months,” and that he “wanted to go say hello to the vice president and ask her why does she refuse to answer questions.”

He did not speak to the VP.

On Thursday morning’s edition of CNN This Morning, anchor Kasie Hunt led her co-stars in trashing Vance as “creepy” and his stunt as “bizarre” and “childish” — and even GOP strategist Doug Heye warned this kind of thing can get “real creepy real quick”:

KASIE HUNT: This was a rather, shall we say, awkward moment. JD Vance approached Kamala Harris’s Air Force two while his plane and her plane were both on the same Wisconsin tarmac yesterday. Here was his explanation of what he was trying to do.

JD VANCE: Hey, guys. How are you? Good. I just I just wanted to check out my future plane, but I also wanted to go say hello to the vice president and ask her why Kamala Harris refuses–. Why does she refused to answer questions from the media?

And I also thought that the press gaggle following her might get a little lonely. I at least have enough respect for you all, and for the American people you report to, to come and talk to you and to answer some questions.

And so I thought, her reporters might actually benefit from that as well. So I had a little bit of fun. I don’t think the vice president waved at me as she drove away, but, I’m glad to have done it.

KASIE HUNT: So far fr–, I’m never going to question, you know, politician should talk to the media as a blanket rule.

However, I am a little curious, Isaac. What might have happened had he actually encountered Kamala Harris on the tarmac? How that would have gone down.

EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE: Yeah, and we’ll never know. (LAUGHTER).

JD Vance is obviously trying to have a better week for himself than he had last week. And, has been getting covered for other reasons now. But I guess he saw the opportunity on the tarmac yesterday and decided to try for it, but–.

DOUG HEYE: There are there like eight states that we’re focusing on. So this could happen again in any of those places any time.

KASIE HUNT: Well, he’s kind of following her around. Like if you look at the schedules.

DOUG HEYE: I, I would I would warn the Trump campaign, even though yes, you defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016. History is replete with male candidates overstepping their bounds against female candidates and the backfire that that can have, especially if you don’t have a real plan, or even if you do.

KASIE HUNT: It does feel a little uncomfortable!

DOUG HEYE: Yes, it gets real creepy real quick if you make a mistake.

KAREN FINNEY: And also like what was his vision? He was just going to roll up on her and Secret Service was not going to be like, “dude, what’s going–” I mean, it’s bizarre!

DOUG HEYE: Senator Rick Lazio, right, right. Senator Erskine Bowles.

KASIE HUNT: Right, right. Names that. Yes, yes. We have to dig deep. We have to dig deep here.

EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE: And it touches into Walz that on Tuesday, not just weird, but creepy. That’s what Democrats are going to want to try to play this into, and Doug you’re not a Democrat, but you’re–.

KAREN FINNEY: Immature! So childish!"
Pelosi admits she was ‘never that impressed’ with Biden.,https://nypost.com/2024/08/08/us-news/nancy-pelosi-concedes-she-was-never-that-impressed-with-president-bidens-political-operation/,"Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi opened up about her role in the mutiny against President Biden and admitted she’s “never been that impressed with his political operation” – days after suggesting he should be featured on Mt. Rushmore.

“They won the White House. Bravo. But my concern was: This ain’t happening, and we have to make a decision for this to happen. The president has to make the decision for that to happen,” Pelosi (D-Calif.) candidly told the New Yorker about her concerns about his 2024 prospects.

The speaker emerita did not elaborate on why she was unimpressed with Biden’s political machine.

Pelosi, 84, has been on a book tour, which has doubled as something of a cleanup expedition in recent days over her role in Biden’s withdrawal, which appears to have strained the pair’s decades-long relationship.

Throughout multiple interviews, Pelosi has been showering Biden with praise in public, hailing him as a “consequential president” worthy of recognition at the level of Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt.

When asked about rumors that Biden, 81, was “frustrated” with her, she told CBS News in an interview that aired Sunday, “He knows that I love him very much.”

Over the course of her career in Congress, which has spanned just under four decades, Pelosi developed a reputation for being a ruthless, calculating and slick political operative.

After Biden’s shocking debate performance against former President Donald Trump at the end of June triggered heart palpitations throughout the Democratic Party, Pelosi initially emerged as a defender.

But her tone soon shifted. Two days after Biden penned a letter insisting to Democrats in Congress that he was “firmly committed” to staying in the race, Pelosi appeared on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” rumored to be one of the president’s favorite political shows.

“It’s up to the president to decide if he is going to run,” she said on the program. “We’re all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.”

When she was pressed about how Biden had just committed to remaining in the race, Pelosi replied, “Whatever he decides, we go with.”

At one point, she pressed Biden about polling data indicating he couldn’t win the presidential election and when he disputed that, she had him put his longtime adviser Mike Donilon on the phone, CNN reported.

There were also reports of blunt conversations between Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) as well as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY). Schumer urged Biden to drop out, ABC News reported.

“I never called one person. I kept true to my word. Any conversation I had, it was just going to be with him. I never made one call. They said I was burning up the lines, I was talking to Chuck [Schumer]. I didn’t talk to Chuck at all,” Pelosi insisted.

She has repeatedly claimed she never made calls to foment the mutiny against Biden. She’s also refrained from detailing her private conversations with him at the time.

But while Pelosi denied calling people, she admitted that people called her.

“I never called one person, but people were calling me saying that there was a challenge there. So there had to be a change in the leadership of the campaign, or what would come next,” Pelosi told the outlet.

Pelosi underscored that her chief objective was to ensure that “Donald Trump would never set foot in the White House again.” She also claims she was merely trying to get Biden to run a better campaign.

The Golden State Democrat admits she has not been in touch with Biden since everything went down.

“I pray so. I cry so,” she said when asked if their relationship could survive. “I lose sleep on it, yeah.”

Reflecting on Biden’s debate performance, Pelosi conceded that she was “startled” by it and had downplayed the challenge on the president’s hands before the verbal bout began.

“Earlier in the day, when I was with the members, they were, like, Oh, how’s it going to be? ‘Trump will be so awful,’ I said. ‘Don’t worry about it. The Joe Biden of the State of the Union is going to show up. It’s going to be great.’ In fact, I didn’t even want him to be in a debate,” she recounted.

Pelosi contended that Trump, 78, is “doggy doo-doo” and Biden was going to get “doggy doo-doo” on his shoe by debating him.

“I just didn’t want him to be seen with that guy. And then that happened, and I think everybody was stunned. It was stunning,” she reflected.

She is promoting her memoir, “The Art of Power,” which hit bookshelves Tuesday and detailed her time helping to craft consequential legislation."

In recent days, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi has begun to open up about her views on President Joe Biden's decision to step aside.

That includes a rather blunt assessment of his political operation, despite her decades of friendship with the president.

""I've never been that impressed with his political operation,"" she told The New Yorker. ""They won the White House. Bravo. But my concern was: This ain't happening, and we have to make a decision for this to happen. The president has to make the decision for that to happen.""

Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., admitted Thursday she has never been “that impressed” with President Joe Biden’s “political operation”



The remark came during an on the New Yorker Radio Hour, during which Rep. Pelosi largely applauded Biden for his presidency. Host David Remnick steered the conversation toward the former House speaker’s noncommittal to MSNBC in July that neither supported nor condemned Biden’s reelection campaign. At the time, speculation was swirling about the president considering an exit from the race.

“It’s up to the president to decide if he is going to run,” Rep. Pelosi said in July. “I want him to do whatever he decides to do, and that’s the way it is.”

Revisiting her comments, Rep. Pelosi explained she didn’t want to appear to be putting pressure on the president to decide the direction of his campaign.

“Just as a little background, I’ve never been that impressed with his political operation,” Rep. Pelosi said of Biden. “I just haven’t. They won the White House, bravo. My concern was this ain’t happening and we have to make a decision for this to happen and the president has to make the decision for that to happen.”

She continued, noting she never “made one call” and only talked to Biden himself about the viability of his floundering campaign.

“I didn’t talk to Chuck [Schumer] at all,” Rep. Pelosi said.

Rep. Pelosi on Sunday that Biden has earned a place as the fifth face on Mount Rushmore, noting he has been “such a consequential president of the United States.”

“A Mount Rushmore kind of president of the United States,” she said of Biden. “You have Teddy Roosevelt up there. And he’s wonderful. I don’t say take him down. But you can add Biden.”

Biden notably awarded Rep. Pelosi thePresidential Medal of Freedom in May 2024.

Pelosi admits she was ‘never that impressed’ with Biden.,https://www.dailywire.com/news/pelosi-admits-she-has-never-been-that-impressed-with-bidens-political-operation,"During a tense interview in which she sought answers about how a crisis of confidence led to a massive shakeup in the Democratic Party’s 2024 presidential ticket, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) candidly admitted that she has “never been that impressed” with President Joe Biden‘s “political operation.”

The swipe came as The New Yorker editor David Remnick asked Pelosi about her much-discussed appearance last month on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” in which Pelosi insisted she would support whatever decision Biden made about his political future — even though Biden was already saying at the time he would not leave the race.

Remnick noted that people around Pelosi said her “Morning Joe” appearance gave them “space” to call on Biden to end his 2024 bid after a fumbling debate performance. Although more than 14 million people voted for Biden during the primaries, the president eventually dropped out amid a growing pressure campaign led by his own allies. His vice president, Kamala Harris, has since become the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee.

“When I pressed Pelosi to talk in greater detail about her language on ‘Morning Joe,’ she looked at me silently, unblinking,” Remnick wrote in a story published on Thursday. “Finally, as the silence expanded past the boundary of awkward, I said, ‘You’re looking at me and waiting for this moment to pass.'”

“Yeah, but I’m trying to think of why you’re even asking it, because, you know, I’m not going to answer it the way that you want,” Pelosi said. “I didn’t plan to do that on [‘Morning Joe.’] In fact, if I did, I probably would’ve worn a different suit or something, because I didn’t look too professional.”

Remnick wrote that he told Pelosi, “It was like you felt his pain.” In the moments that followed, “Pelosi dropped her calculated reserve,” according to Remnick’s write-up of his conversation.

“I’ve never been that impressed with his political operation,” Pelosi said. “They won the White House. Bravo. But my concern was: this ain’t happening, and we have to make a decision for this to happen. The president has to make the decision for that to happen. People were calling. I never called one person. I kept true to my word. Any conversation I had, it was just going to be with him. I never made one call.”

The response appeared to add more context to Pelosi’s comments in a recent interview for CBS. Journalist Lesley Stahl told Pelosi it had been said that Biden was “furious” with her, ostensibly for not having the president’s back. Pelosi denied she was “a leader of any pressure party,” and insisted she “did not call one person.” Also during the CBS interview that aired last weekend, Pelosi suggested Biden’s face should be added to Mount Rushmore.

A number of Democrats had been publicly urging Biden to end his campaign by the time he stepped aside. Pelosi was not one of them, though she did tell Biden in private that polls showed he could not defeat former President Donald Trump in the 2024 contest and warned the president he could hurt other Democrats in down-ticket races if he did not bow out, according to CNN. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) similarly did not publicly break with Biden but reportedly used a meeting to discourage the president from staying in the race.

“They said I was burning up the lines, I was talking to Chuck [Schumer]. I didn’t talk to Chuck at all,” Pelosi told Remnick during their conversation. “I never called one person, but people were calling me saying that there was a challenge there. So there had to be a change in the leadership of the campaign, or what would come next.”

Remnick wrote that Pelosi acknowledged she had not been in contact with Biden since the Sunday on which he announced his exit from the 2024 contest via a letter posted to X. Asked whether her relationship with Biden would survive, Pelosi did not appear certain. “I hope so,” she said. “I pray so. I cry so.” Pelosi claimed she had lost sleep on it. She said her goal was simply to make sure Trump “would never set foot in the White House again.”"
Pelosi admits she was ‘never that impressed’ with Biden.,https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/nancy-pelosi-not-impressed-bidens-operation-interview-1235076213/,"For the first time since President Joe Biden dropped his bid for reelection, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has spoken candidly about her role in the party upheaval, and her relationship with Biden.

In an interview with The New Yorker published Thursday, Pelosi spoke at length about her fateful decision to publicly put a question mark on Biden’s future as a candidate during a July 10 interview with MSNBC’s Morning Joe.

Earlier this week, Pelosi published her new memoir, The Art of Power, which in the wake of Biden’s exit from the campaign — and rumors about Pelosi’s role in rallying Democrats to call for him to step down — has shot up bestseller lists. The book does not discuss the recent developments in the 2024 elections, but their specter lingers.

“I really wanted him to make a decision for a better campaign, because they were not facing the fact of what was happening,” she told The New Yorker. “We couldn’t see it go down the drain, because Trump was going to be president and then he was going to take the House. Imagine! Imagine how that would be! Well, we don’t have to imagine. We saw.”

In a moment of candor, Pelosi — widely hailed as one of the most effective operatives in political history — made her views on Biden’s campaign abundantly clear.

“I’ve never been that impressed with his political operation,” she said. “They won the White House. Bravo. But my concern was: ‘this ain’t happening, and we have to make a decision for this to happen.’ The president has to make the decision for that to happen. People were calling.

Pelosi was also asked if she felt her relationship with Biden could ever recover from the political debacle. “I hope so […] I pray so. I cry so,” she said, adding that she’s lost sleep over the situation."

Pelosi admits she was ‘never that impressed’ with Biden.,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13723935/nancy-pelosi-joe-biden-drop-cries.html,"Nancy Pelosi revealed the 'goal in life' that was behind her push for Joe Biden to exit the presidential race and why she now cries over her decision.

The Speaker Emerita, in a series of interviews to promote her memoir, 'The Art of Power,' addressed her relationship with the current president and her thoughts on the former one, Donald Trump.

It was her concern that Trump would win in November that led to her urging Biden to step down as the Democratic nominee, she's said.

'My goal in life was that that man would never set foot in the White House again,' she said of Trump, pounding the table nine times for emphasis, the Washington Post reported.

But when she was asked whether she ever directly told Biden that he needed to step aside or else Trump would win, she flat out refused to say.

'I won't answer that question,' she said.

'My goal in life was that that man would never set foot in the White House again,' Pelosi said

When Trump was president and Pelosi was speaker the two had a bitter, antagonistic relationship. She impeached him twice. He called her 'Crazy Nancy' and 'unhinged.'

Pelosi noted that she couldn't stand to see 'an unfolding of events that were just putting rose petals in front of him' to go back to the White House.

And part of Pelosi's fears were based on the fact she was unimpressed with Biden's campaign team and political advisers, as she told the New Yorker's David Remnick.

'I've never been that impressed with his political operation,' she said. 'They won the White House. Bravo. But my concern was: this ain't happening, and we have to make a decision for this to happen. The President has to make the decision for that to happen.'

Democrats say it was Pelosi who was one of the guiding forces behind the pressure campaign on Biden.

The former speaker, in her book tour interviews, has not divulged the full role she played.

She has said that she 'never made one call' to knife Biden but instead received multiple calls from worried Democrats who feared that, with Biden on the top of the ticket, the party would lose both the House and Senate.

She noted she hasn't spoken with Biden since he left the race.

Remnick asked her if she thought her relationship with him - which goes back decades - would survive.

'I hope so,' she said. 'I pray so. I cry so.'

'I lose sleep on it,' she added.

Nancy Pelosi said she cries over her damaged relationship with Joe Biden

Nancy Pelosi and Donald Trump had an antagonistic relationship

Pelosi stepped down from her leadership perch with House Democrats about a year ago but her influence within the party is stronger than ever.

She never publicly called on Joe Biden to step down as the Democratic nominee after his disastrous debate performance with Trump - but she gave plenty of hints as to her thoughts.

Her biggest pressure move came during an interview with MSNBC's Morning Joe, when she answered a question about Biden as if he had never said - repeatedly - that he had no intention of dropping out.

'It's up to the President to decide if he's going to run,' she noted. 'We're all encouraging him to make that decision, because time is running short.'

Morning Joe is President Biden's favorite morning show and he's a regular viewer.

Pelosi claims she never planned her remarks.

'I didn't plan to do that on ['Morning Joe.'] In fact, if I did, I probably would've worn a different suit or something, because I didn't look too professional.'

She also said she told Biden not to debate Trump.

'I just thought it'd be like doggy-doo and you're going to get it on your shoe and you're all going to smell like him,' she said.

'I want to go onstage. I can handle this,' Biden told her, according to Pelosi's account.

She said that Biden 'wanted to do it, he felt confident,' she said.

Nancy Pelosi said she and husband Paul have never spoken about the attack on him

In her interviews, Pelosi also revealed she felt guilty about the 2022 attack on her husband Paul at their San Francisco home.

She also said the couple has never discussed it and that Paul Pelosi is still in recovery from the ordeal.

Pelosi's memoir is out now

She said that her husband is 'about eighty per cent' recovered, but the blow to his skull still has 'ramifications' and requires continued therapy and time to heal.

'It's a horrible thing,' Pelosi said. 'The physical damage is one thing. There's also the trauma of it all for our children, our grandchildren. It's really sad. It happened in our home. In our home.'

She said it was still 'creepy' to be in the bedroom or the garden room 'where he banged his way in.'

'We wouldn't go there for a long, long time,' she said.

Paul Pelosi was attacked with a hammer during a break-in in 2022 at the couple's San Francisco home. A federal grand jury found David DePape guilty of attempted kidnapping of a federal official and assault on the immediate family member of a federal official.

DePape was sentenced to 30 years in prison.

Paul Pelosi testified during the trial that he was awakened by 'a very large man' with a hammer and zip ties on the day of the break in who asked 'Where's Nancy?'

When he told his attacker that his wife was in Washington, D.C., DePape allegedly said he'd have to tie him up and they'd wait for her return. Paul Pelosi sustained a fractured skull in the attack.

Nancy Pelosi's book 'The Art of Power' is out now.

Asked if her book title was an intended nod at Trump's 'The Art of the Deal,' she told the Associated Press: 'Nothing that I do has anything to do with him, except his downfall.'"
Pelosi admits she was ‘never that impressed’ with Biden.,https://www.thedailybeast.com/nancy-pelosi-reveals-how-she-got-joe-biden-out-this-aint-happening,"California Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the silent operator who clutched the reigns of the House and steered it for nearly a decade, broke her silence on pushing President Joe Biden to suspend his re-election campaign in a new interview with New Yorker editor David Remnick published Thursday.

Pelosi told the New Yorker she had “never been that impressed with (Biden’s) political operation” but earlier in the day on that fateful June 27, Pelosi admitted she was the one assuaging fears about Biden’s competence.

“When I was with the members, they were, like, ‘Oh, how’s it going to be?’ ‘Trump will be so awful,’ I said. ‘Don’t worry about it. The Joe Biden of the State of the Union is going to show up. It’s going to be great,’” Pelosi said. “I just didn’t want him to be seen with that guy. And then that happened, and I think everybody was stunned. It was stunning.”

Like the New York Times editorial board, David Axelrod, the talking heads on MSNBC, and virtually every other person in Democratic circles, Pelosi knew Biden couldn’t last after that performance.

For weeks, following Biden’s decision to drop out, a quiet stream of reporting has pinned Pelosi as the king, or rather, queenmaker, behind Biden’s decision.

“Nancy made clear that they could do this the easy way or the hard way,” a Democrat close to the situation told Politico on July 21, adding, “She gave them three weeks of the easy way. It was about to be the hard way.”

Outwardly, Pelosi did not say much in the interim.

“It’s up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We’re all encouraging him to make that decision, because time is running short,” Pelosi told the MSNBC program, Morning Joe on July 10, being her only public remarks.

Now, nearly a month later, Pelosi told the New Yorker, “I didn’t plan to do that on [Morning Joe.] In fact, if I did, I probably would’ve worn a different suit or something, because I didn’t look too professional.”

She added, “My concern was: This ain’t happening, and we have to make a decision for this to happen. The President has to make the decision for that to happen.”

Pelosi insisted, as she had done before in an interview with CBS Sunday Morning on August 4, that she “never called one person” about Biden.

“I kept true to my word. Any conversation I had, it was just going to be with him. I never made one call,” she told New Yorker.

Pelosi said people were calling her saying there was a “challenge there.” She added, “So there had to be a change in the leadership of the campaign, or what would come next.”

Now that the dust has settled, Pelosi said she has not talked to Biden since his withdrawal on July 21. Pelosi said, “I lose sleep on it,” referring to her tattered relationship with Biden.

“I hope so,” she replied when asked whether her relationship with Biden would continue. “I pray so. I cry so.”"
Pelosi admits she was ‘never that impressed’ with Biden.,https://www.inkl.com/news/pelosi-has-never-been-that-impressed-with-biden-s-political-operation,"Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the House, in 2021.

Nancy Pelosi has “never been that impressed” with Joe Biden’s “political operation”, the former US House speaker said, discussing a judgment that helped her conclude the president could not beat Donald Trump and should step aside.

“They won the White House [in 2020]. Bravo. But my concern was: this ain’t happening, and we have to make a decision for [Biden’s withdrawal] to happen,” Pelosi told the New Yorker, in an interview published on Thursday.

On 21 July, in a historic moment, the 81-year-old president finally heeded those who said he was too old to beat Trump and serve a full second term.

Stepping aside as the Democratic nominee, Biden endorsed his 59-year-old vice-president, Kamala Harris, a move that transformed the election, placing Trump under pressure.

Pelosi was widely reported to have played a key role in the switch.

She told the New Yorker: “The president has to make the decision for that to happen. People were calling. I never called one person. I kept true to my word. Any conversation I had, it was just going to be with [Biden]. I never made one call. They said I was burning up the lines, I was talking to Chuck [Schumer, the Democratic Senate majority leader]. I didn’t talk to Chuck at all.

“I never called one person, but people were calling me saying that there was a challenge there. So there had to be a change in the leadership of the campaign, or what would come next.”

Pelosi said her goal was simple: “That Donald Trump would never set foot in the White House again.”

Now 84, Pelosi is in her 19th term in the House. Having been speaker between 2007 and 2011 and 2019 and 2023, she remains vastly influential.

Pelosi spoke to the New Yorker to promote her new memoir, The Art of Power. Last week, the Guardian first reported Pelosi’s descriptions of how she grew increasingly concerned about Trump’s mental fitness for office, even before his defeat by Biden and incitement of the January 6 attack on Congress.

Pelosi told the New Yorker she hoped her role in ending Biden’s presidency would not destroy her relationship with a man three years younger but elected as a senator in 1972, 14 years before Pelosi won her seat in the House.

“I hope so,” she said. “I pray so. I cry so.”

She said she had lost sleep over the situation. Asked if she thought Biden was angry with her, she said: “I don’t know. We haven’t had a conversation. But … ”

Pelosi said she thought Biden was “in a good state”, praising as “masterful” his handling of a large-scale prisoner swap with Russia which concluded last week.

But Biden’s legacy “will go right down the drain if what’s-his-name ever [returns to] the White House”, Pelosi said, adding: “One of the reasons I ran again [in 2022] was to make sure that Donald Trump never stepped foot in the White House again.

“He is a danger to our democracy … he’s a danger to the air our children breathe, the water they drink, their safety in terms of gun-violence prevention. Freedom of choice, the size, the timing of your family – all that.”

Asked if she had met Trump since her time as speaker, Pelosi said she had not.

“Oh, my God, what a horrible thought,” she said. “He knows he’s an impostor. He knows he shouldn’t be president of the United States.”"
Pelosi admits she was ‘never that impressed’ with Biden.,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/pelosi-says-she-didn-t-171405217.html,"Nancy Pelosi is finally making clear her role in the pressure campaign which led to Joe Biden making the painful, personal decision to step down as the Democratic Party’s 2024 candidate.

The former House speaker sat down with The New Yorker for an interview which published on Thursday; in it, she outlined a bleak outlook for the Biden campaign following the president’s concerning appearance at June’s presidential debate in Atlanta.

Pelosi told David Remnick that she didn’t see a path to victory for the incumbent president after he appeared lost onstage at points and was unable to complete his thoughts, trailing off before declaring, “...anyway” or coming to an incoherent stop.

“He felt great. And I had confidence in him,” Pelosi said of Biden before the debate. “And then that happened, and I think everybody was stunned. It was stunning.”

She went on to outline how she saw the race after the debate, and in doing so offered a frank characterization of the Biden campaign apparatus: “I’ve never been that impressed with his political operation.”

“They won the White House. Bravo,” the former speaker quipped. “But my concern was: this ain’t happening, and we have to make a decision for this to happen. The president has to make the decision for that to happen.”

For weeks, Pelosi has sought to downplay her involvement in the behind-the-scenes conversations which finally led to Biden’s announcement that he would step down on July 21. She did so this past weekend, in an interview on CBS Sunday Morning, insisting that she did not make a single call concerning her worries about the president.

But it was clear in her remarks to Remnick that she was providing herself with careful cover: “I never called one person, but people were calling me saying that there was a challenge there,” Pelosi explained.

“I never made one call. They said I was burning up the lines, I was talking to Chuck [Schumer]. I didn’t talk to Chuck at all,” she said. But as more and more House members came to her with concerns, she said she came to the conclusion that Biden needed to step aside for the good of the party.

The one-time House Democratic leader is set to go down as one of the most effective political operatives in the modern history of the United States. Her successful maneuvering on a wide range of issues over the course of her career, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to Biden’s withdrawal and, most recently, the selection of Tim Walz as Kamala Harris’s running mate, sets her aside as a Democrat whom few others can say they had more of a hand guiding the future of the party, or even the country.

She cleanly overshadowed her contemporaries, most notably former House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, who succeeded her as speaker when the lower chamber changed hands but lasted less than a year into the job, falling to a rebellion led by members of his own party.

But despite her years-long relationship with President Joe Biden, Pelosi seemed uncertain that her friendship with him would survive her role in discussions aimed around convincing him to step aside. The president is said to have personally believed he deserved a second term — and his party’s loyalty — given the accomplishments he notched over four years in the White House and many more in Congress.

In her interview with CBS, Pelosi did not deny an assertion that the president was “furious” with her.

“I think he’s in a good [mental] state. I mean, I think he did a remarkable thing, bringing home all these prisoners [from Russia]. Oh, my God, that was so masterful. . . . But my understanding is that he’s good,” she told Remnick.

Asked if she was worried about losing her friendship with the president, she answered: “I lose sleep on it, yeah.”"

But she makes no secret of her skepticism about the shortcomings of his campaign.

“I’ve never been that impressed with his political activities,” she said.

In recent days, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi has become more outspoken about her thoughts on President Joe Biden’s decision to leave office.

That means she offers a rather blunt assessment of his political activities, despite her decades-long friendship with the president himself.

Pelosi has been widely reported to have played a key role in Biden’s fateful decision to withdraw from the 2024 race. The New York Times reported that she told him directly that he had little chance of winning after his disastrous debate performance, and that Biden himself viewed Pelosi as a “chief instigator” of the party effort to convince him to step aside.

But Pelosi has played down all that, refusing to discuss her own private conversations with Biden, while insisting she has not coordinated any broad efforts.

What is clear is that Pelosi made at least one fateful move: declaring in an interview with “Morning Joe” that Biden had to make a decision about continuing his campaign, even after he had already said he would stay in the race. That interview reopened a conversation within the party that had seemed to have died down just a day earlier.

“That was not my intention,” Pelosi told The New Yorker. “If I had, I probably would have put on a different suit or something, because I didn’t look very professional.”

Pelosi also said she hopes her relationship with Biden, which has lasted more than 40 years since she was chair of the California Democratic Party, can remain intact after Biden’s decision.

“I hope so,” Pelosi said. “I pray so. I cry so.”

Taberon Honie is executed by lethal injection in Utah.,https://apnews.com/article/utah-execution-taberon-honie-lethal-injection-ddf42fa0a10d2170c6d1ddecda5dc901,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Tressa Honie is caught between anger and grief in the lead-up to Utah’s first execution since 2010. That’s because her father is the person set to die by lethal injection, and her maternal grandmother is the person he brutally murdered in 1998.

The heinous intrafamilial crime has placed a strain on her relationships for more than two decades as she’s kept in touch with her father in prison while her mother’s family has fought relentlessly for him to be put to death.

In her final 48 hours visiting Taberon Dave Honie before his execution, set for Thursday shortly after midnight, Tressa is grappling with how to carry out his dying wish: for her to move on and heal.

“My mom’s side, they can heal together,” she said in an interview. “I’m happy you guys are going to get this closure, this justice, but where does that leave me? I feel like I have to heal alone.”

Tressa left the Utah state prison in a daze Tuesday evening as it hit her that she would only have one more day with her father, who she credits as her most supportive parent after drug use drove a wedge between her and her mother. As the 27-year-old prepares to grieve her father, she’s also grieving the life she could have had if his crimes hadn’t trapped her family in a cycle of self-destruction and left them mourning the matriarch she believes could have kept them all in line.

Honie, one of six death row inmates in Utah, was convicted of aggravated murder for the July 1998 death of his girlfriend’s mother, Claudia Benn. He was 22 when he broke into Benn’s house in Cedar City, the tribal headquarters of the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah, after a day of heavy drinking and drug use. He repeatedly slashed Benn’s throat and stabbed other parts of her body. The judge who sentenced him to death also found that Honie had sexually abused one of Benn’s grandchildren who was in the house with a then 2-year-old Tressa at the time of the murder.

Utah’s execution is scheduled to occur a few hours after one in Texas, where a man described by his lawyers as intellectually disabled was executed for strangling and trying to rape a woman who went jogging near her Houston home more than 27 years ago.

Honie, now 48, told Tressa he has come to terms with his fate, she said.

The father and daughter spent their final days talking about anything but his crimes, sharing early childhood memories and laughing about how neither has a favorite color. After years of resentment, she’s ready to replace some of the anger she’s held for her father with reminders of his humanity.

But their meetings haven’t always been so cordial. Tressa grew up knowing her father was behind bars but didn’t know why until she approached him at 14, looking for answers. Honie struggled to look at her as he explained some of what he had done and told her where she could find the court records, she recalled.

“When I did find out fully why he was in prison or on death row, I thought, ‘Well, maybe if I wasn’t born, this wouldn’t have happened,’” Tressa said. “I did kind of blame myself. I didn’t know how to cope.”

Years of drug abuse followed, distancing Tressa from family members who tried to extend support while grieving Benn, who they described as a pillar in their family and community. Benn was a tribal council member, substance abuse counselor and caregiver for her children and grandchildren.

Tressa has few memories of her grandmother, but she’s found herself grieving the absence of a strong maternal role model.

“Hearing the type of woman my grandmother was, I would’ve loved that,” she said.

Her father also started using drugs such as cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine at a young age. Honie’s attorneys testified about his own childhood trauma from parents who abused alcohol. They and others on the Hopi Indian Reservation where he grew up had been placed in government boarding schools that were often abusive and stripped Indigenous children of their culture as part of assimilation efforts.

Now, Tressa is determined to break that cycle of generational trauma.

She is in recovery, raising a child of her own and has developed some empathy for her father after her own addiction struggle. Honie has said he wasn’t in his “right mind” when he killed Benn and doesn’t remember much about the murder.

Trevia Wall, Benn’s niece, said she’s had an “on-and-off” relationship with Tressa over the years but has tried to offer her extra support leading up to her father’s death. Wall was among those who testified in favor of Honie’s execution — an outcome she deemed necessary to get justice for her aunt. The two cousins embraced and cried together after the last hearing.

“It’s bittersweet,” Wall said in an interview. “Now we can finally move forward, we can finally heal, but it’s bitter because I hurt for my cousin, his daughter. He put her in the middle, and she was torn between her father and her grandmother.”

Randall Benn, another cousin who supported the family’s push to execute Honie, said he knows it will close a painful chapter in his life but will open a new one for Tressa. He said he and other family members will be waiting with open arms whenever she’s ready.

Even though Tressa had urged the parole board to commute her father’s death sentence, she plans to witness his execution. About a dozen family members are expected to attend.

“I just want to be there to the end,” she said, “for me and him.”"
Taberon Honie is executed by lethal injection in Utah.,https://www.sltrib.com/news/2024/08/08/taberon-honie-execution-an/,"If Taberon Honie felt pain as his heart’s final pulses pumped pentobarbital through his body, it was suffering that I couldn’t see while watching his execution early Thursday.

His final moments appeared peaceful — and he, too, seemed at peace, his life ending with a lethal injection under the harsh fluorescent lights of a bare room in the maximum security building of Utah’s prison. His death came more than 25 years after he was sentenced to be executed for brutally sexually assaulting and killing his ex-girlfriend’s mother, Claudia Benn, who was his own daughter’s grandmother. It was a murder that divided his family and is a loss that still echoes through their lives.

I was one of seven reporters who watched Honie die Thursday morning.

Just before midnight, we were brought into a small observation room. We stood silently, shoulder-to-shoulder, our own faces reflected back to us in the glass window as we waited for thick tan curtains to be drawn apart so we could see inside the death chamber. In three rooms just like ours, other witnesses waited — one room for Honie’s family, another for Benn’s relatives and a third where several state legislators and law enforcement would watch. We would not be able to see any of them; reflective glass would block witnesses — and Honie — from seeing into the separate rooms.

By the time the curtains were pulled back, Honie was already strapped to the execution table, lying face up with his arms spread wide, held down by tan leather straps. His legs were also strapped to the table, and a white sheet was draped over his lower half. He wore an orange prison jumpsuit.

The IV lines that would carry the deadly drug into his veins had already been put in place out of our view, and clear tubes ran from his arms through an opening in the wall to another room, where his executioners were located. We were never allowed to see who those people were; prison officials intentionally shielded them from the witnesses because of a state law that requires that the identities of those on the execution team remain private.

In lethal injections in other states, there have been reports that executions were delayed because the IV team couldn’t find a suitable vein. That didn’t happen with Honie; prison officials said their team was able to get the IV set on the first try.

After prison warden Bart Mortensen picked up a microphone and read Honie’s death warrant aloud, he brought the mic to Honie’s mouth so the 48-year-old man could say his official final words.

“From the start, it’s been, if it needs to be done for them to heal, let’s do this,” Honie said, immobilized by the straps that held him to the gurney. “If they tell you you can’t change, don’t listen to them. To all my brothers and sisters here, continue to change. I love you all, take care.”

He spoke calmly but quickly, so fast it was difficult to jot down those last words.

(Bethany Baker | The Salt Lake Tribune) Jessica Miller of The Salt Lake Tribune, who served as a media witness, speaks during a news conference after the execution of Taberon Honie at the Utah State Correctional Facility in Salt Lake City on Aug. 8, 2024.

Honie did speak a little more afterwards, but with the microphone hung back on the wall, it was impossible from the witness room to hear what he said. Randall Honey, director of prison operations, later told us that Honie thanked them for taking care of his family.

He also turned to the window where he knew his family was watching and told them, “I love you.”

Because the execution team was sequestered from our view, I couldn’t tell the exact moment when the lethal drug was pushed through the IV line and into Honie’s veins. I watched his right foot tap, which to me looked like a sign of nervousness. He then lifted his head and took a deep exhaling breath, his glasses slipping higher on his forehead. I watched his chest rise and fall for what felt like a few minutes.

Then there was stillness.

I studied Honie, carefully looking at the creases of the material draped over him for any trace movements. I didn’t want to blink. But the only outward signs I could see that indicated to me that he was dying was his skin coloring. I focused closely on his hand, watching his curled fingers pale, then begin to take on a blue tint.

Time felt like it stood still — without being able to take our cellphones or watches into the witness room, it was impossible to know in the moment how many minutes had passed after he stopped moving. We would later learn that it took 17 minutes from when the pentobarbital was pushed into his IV to when an electrocardiogram detected his heart was no longer beating.

After the EKG no longer measured a heartbeat, Honey and Mortensen stoically each grabbed a corner of the white sheet that had covered Honie’s legs and draped the fabric over the rest of his body. His hand, still in a loose relaxed fist, was still visible as the curtains were again closed. He was pronounced dead four minutes later, at 12:25 a.m.

Prison officials had allowed Honie’s father and cousin to enter the death chamber after he died to conduct a Hopi ceremony intended to release his soul from the prison. Honey later told us that the ceremony involved bird feathers and cornmeal to lead “a path for the soul to leave the room.” The curtains were drawn for this moment so we couldn’t see it, though I could hear faint murmurs in the execution room during this time.

The other reporters and I, along with Department of Corrections Communications Director Glen Mills, stood in that small observation room for about an hour after Honie’s death — comparing the notes we each scrawled during a monumental moment. The mood in the room remained focused on our drive to be accurate, as we talked through what his last words were and what each of us saw from our vantage points.

Soon, the smell of bleach began to hang heavy in the room, a sign that the medical examiner had removed Honie’s body and a crew was working to mop the death chamber’s gray floors. Finally, a door opened and we were allowed into the execution room where Honie had just died.

It was eerie to stand near the table Honie had been strapped to an hour or so before. But with the room now sanitized, it also didn’t feel like a place where a man had just taken his last breath."
Taberon Honie is executed by lethal injection in Utah.,https://kslnewsradio.com/2124364/utah-reacts-to-taberon-honie-execution/,"SALT LAKE CITY — Taberon Honie was executed by lethal injection early Thursday morning, a little after midnight, in Utah’s first execution since 2010.

Honie was sentenced to death in 1999 for the 1998 murder of 49-year-old Claudia Marie Benn. Three of Benn’s grandchildren were in the house when the murder took place. Police said that one of the grandchildren was sexually assaulted.

At 12:30 a.m., the Utah Department of Corrections said in an X post that the execution had taken place.

The execution warrant for Taberon Dave Honie has been carried out. More details will be available at the press conference when the media witnesses return to the media center. — UTDeptofCorrections (@UtahCorrections) August 8, 2024

According to a UDC statement, Honie’s last words were, “From the start it’s been, if it needs to be done for them to heal, let’s do this. If they tell you you can’t change, don’t listen to them. To all my brothers and sisters in here, continue to change. I love you all. Take care.”

Reactions to the death penalty

In a press release, Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes spoke about the beliefs and views surrounding the death penalty.

“We understand there are deeply held beliefs, powerful emotions and divergent views regarding the death penalty,” Reyes said. “Death by execution is one of the most extreme uses of government power. Many would argue it is ineffective, improper and beyond the authority of man to exercise. Many would disagree.”

Reyes said that murder “is among the crimes deemed by society to be most vile, repugnant and punishable by the harshest measures possible.” In Utah, he said, that includes the death penalty.

“The State of Utah approached the exercise of its power and attendant responsibilities with the seriousness and solemnity that such an act merits,” Reyes said.

“We hope opponents of the death penalty allow grace for those who carried out their duties as required by the law and did so with respect, professionalism, and, in some cases, in spite of their own personal views.”

Utah Gov. Cox issued a statement after the execution took place.

“Early this morning the state of Utah fulfilled its legal obligation to carry out the execution of Taberon Honie,” said Cox. “The actions of Mr. Honie that lead to his death sentence are heinous. I respect the process of our criminal justice system and recognize the countless public servants who meticulously planned and approached their responsibilities with professionalism.

“I hope this brings closure to those impacted by the crimes. My heart goes out to the victim’s family” the governor said.

Among those who reacted to the execution were groups of people protesting the sentence outside of the UDC.

The Utah Prisoner Advocate Network said in a Facebook post that it was there for those needing healing.

“During these challenging times, we are reminded of the importance of compassion and support,” UPAN said in the post. “To all who are processing this event, we are here to offer a space for healing and understanding. Please reach out if you need someone to talk to or simply a community that understands.”

According to the UDC, multiple members of Honie’s family visited him on his execution day. These included his mother, father, daughter, sisters and others.

“We appreciate the caring and professional approach our UDC team members took in fulfilling our duties required by the court’s sentence,” UDC Director Brian Redd said in a statement. “This is a serious task and it took significant effort and many hours of preparation.”

The execution

Before the execution, Honie had his last meal. It consisted of a cheeseburger, fries and a milkshake.

According to execution witnesses, Honie was given the lethal injection at 12:04 a.m. He was pronounced dead at 12:25 a.m. after receiving a second dose at 12:13 a.m.

Among the victim’s family who witnessed the execution were Franklin Honie, Sr., Teresita Honie, Sherwin Leslie, Tressa Honie and Therese Day.

There were multiple lawmakers and state officials present at the execution, including Gov. Spencer Cox’s Chief of Staff Jon Pierpont, Assistant Attorney General Justin Anderson, Sen. Derrin Owens, R-Fountain Green, Sen. Mike Kennedy, R-Utah County, House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Weber County, Cedar City Police Department Chief Darrin Adams and Rep. Casey Snider, R-Paradise.

Iron County police and other officials were also present, including Iron County District Attorney Scott Burns, County Attorney Chad Dotson, and Sherrif Ken Carpenter.

According to media witnesses, Honie thanked the warden and director of prison operations for taking care of his family.

Honie then turned to his family and said, “I love you.” His mother was reported to have responded from the witness room saying, “I love you, son.”

Taberon Honie is executed by lethal injection in Utah.,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/utah-man-killed-woman-put-death-lethal-injection-112668485,"Utah death row inmate Taberon Dave Honie has been put to death by lethal injection for the stabbing death of his girlfriend’s mother in the state’s first execution since 2010

SALT LAKE CITY -- A Utah man who killed his girlfriend's mother by slashing her throat was put to death by lethal injection early Thursday in the state's first execution since 2010.

Taberon Dave Honie, 48, was convicted of aggravated murder in the July 1998 death of Claudia Benn, the maternal grandmother of his now 27-year-old daughter, Tressa.

Honie was pronounced dead at 12:25 a.m. Mountain Time in an execution that went as planned and took about 17 minutes. He tapped his foot and mouthed “I love you” to family members watching from a witness chamber after he was given the lethal injection of two doses of pentobarbital.

Strapped to the execution table in a sterile white room at the state prison, Honie turned his head to thank correctional officers for taking care of his family before he lost consciousness, warden Bart Mortensen told reporters after the execution.

Honie let out a gasp as the drug flowed through IVs in both arms, and his torso jolted off the table. He then laid still for several minutes before he died, turning a pale shade of blue as his glasses slid back on his forehead.

His final words were, ""From the start it’s been, if it needs to be done for them to heal, let’s do this. If they tell you you can’t change, don’t listen to them. To all my brothers and sisters in here, continue to change. I love you all. Take care.”

Honie was 22 when he broke into Benn’s house in Cedar City, the tribal headquarters of the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah, after a day of heavy drinking and drug use. He repeatedly slashed Benn’s throat and stabbed other parts of her body. The judge who sentenced him to death also found that Honie had sexually abused one of Benn’s other grandchildren who was in the house with a then 2-year-old Tressa at the time of the murder.

Honie, who had grown up on the Hopi Indian Reservation in Arizona, spent the evening with his daughter and other immediate family before the execution. He told Tressa earlier this week that he had come to terms with his fate and hoped she could too, she told The Associated Press. His last meal was a cheeseburger, french fries and a milkshake, the Utah Department of Corrections said.

After the medical team removed Honie’s body from the chamber, his family was allowed in to perform a Native American grieving ritual with bird feathers and cornmeal that they told officers would help free his soul after death.

Outside the prison, a group of anti-death penalty protesters sang “Amazing Grace"" and held signs that said, “All life is precious.""

After decades of failed appeals, Honie's execution warrant was signed in June despite defense objections to the planned lethal drug. In July, the state changed its execution protocol to using only a high dose of pentobarbital — the nervous system suppressant used to euthanize pets.

The Utah Board of Pardons and Parole denied Honie's petition to commute his sentence to life in prison after a July hearing during which Honie's attorneys described his troubled childhood growing up on the reservation with parents who abused alcohol. He had started using hard drugs as a teenager and told the parole board he wouldn’t have killed Benn if he had been in his “right mind.” He asked the board to allow him “to exist"" so he could be a support for his daughter.

Tressa Honie told the board she has a complicated relationship with her mother and would lose her most supportive parent if her father were to be executed. She said in an interview Tuesday that she wasn't ready to lose her dad and felt abandoned by family on her mother's side who had fought for his execution.

Benn's close family argued that Taberon Honie deserved no mercy, and they said his execution was the justice they needed after decades of grief.

“He deserves an eye for an eye,” said Benn's niece, Sarah China Azule.

She and her cousins described Benn as a pillar in their family and southwestern Utah community. She was a Paiute tribal council member, substance abuse counselor and caregiver for her children and grandchildren.

Tressa, who has few memories of her grandmother, said she understands why her cousins needed closure in this way, but it has left her feeling alone. She has found herself grieving the absence of the strong maternal role model her father stole from her life.

Correctional officers kept Honie's immediate family separate from Benn's as they witnessed the execution. His brutal crime drove a wedge between family members that several said will be tough to repair.

Honie was one of six people facing execution in Utah. The death sentence for a seventh person, Douglas Lovell, who killed a woman to keep her from testifying against him in a rape case, was recently overturned by the Utah Supreme Court. He will be resentenced.

Hours before Honie's execution, a man described by his lawyers as intellectually disabled was executed in Texas for strangling and trying to rape a woman who went jogging near her Houston home more than 27 years ago."
Taberon Honie is executed by lethal injection in Utah.,https://www.kuer.org/politics-government/2024-08-08/utah-executes-death-row-inmate-taberon-honie-by-lethal-injection,"At 12:25 a.m., 48-year-old Taberon Dave Honie was pronounced dead by Utah Department of Corrections officials. It had been 14 years since the state last executed a prisoner.

The sentence was carried out by a lethal injection of pentobarbital.

Honie spent his final hours in an observation cell at the Utah State Correctional Facility northwest of Salt Lake City, officials said. He met with family, told them to “keep their heads up” and ate a cheeseburger, fries and a milkshake as his last meal.

At 12:03 a.m., Honie gave his final statement. It was provided by corrections spokesman Glen Mills and the panel of media witnesses.

“From the start it’s been, if it needs to be done for them to heal, let’s do this. If they tell you you can’t change, don’t listen to them. To all my brothers and sisters in here, continue to change. I love you all. Take care.”

At 12:04 a.m. the lethal injection began.

A second dose was delivered at 12:13 a.m.

At 12:21 a.m. the EKG machine showed a flatline and a sheet was drawn over the condemned.

“Today, our department fulfilled one of the most consequential responsibilities given to the Department of Corrections,” said department director Brian Redd. “No one involved today takes joy in carrying out this responsibility, but we recognize it as one of our statutory duties, and we take it seriously.”

Sean Higgins / KUER Janelle Wilson sits at the vigil leading up to the execution of Taberon Honie, Aug. 7, 2024. The protest was held in a free speech zone a mile and a half away from the Utah Correctional Facility in Salt Lake City.

At a designated free speech zone approximately a mile and a half from the prison, several dozen people attended a vigil in the hours leading up to the execution.

Karla Williams is originally from Chicago but now calls Vineyard home. She attended with the hope “that our legislators just stop this.”

“I just hate it, and it just doesn't solve anything, you know?” she said just after midnight.

“Believe me when I say, I feel for the victims' families. I never want to take away from that. But I don't know. I don't know. And just as a Christian woman, God chose mercy, you know?”

Honie was sentenced to death for the 1998 sexual assault and murder of his then-girlfriend’s mother, Claudia Benn. He was 22 when he broke into her house in Cedar City, the tribal headquarters of the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah, after a day of heavy drinking and drug use. He repeatedly slashed Benn's throat and stabbed other parts of her body. Three of Benn’s grandchildren, including Honie’s 2-year-old daughter, were in her home.

Benn was considered a pillar of her family and the community.

Honie had said he wasn’t in his “right mind” when he killed Benn and doesn’t remember much about the murder. He spent 25 years on death row after his 1999 sentencing and had been appealing his sentence throughout his incarceration.

In 2023, he and five other Utah death-row inmates sued to overturn the state’s death penalty calling it cruel and unusual punishment. The lawsuit was later dismissed.

After exhausting his appeals earlier this year, the state moved forward with plans for his execution. A judge signed his execution warrant on June 10.

In July, the board of pardons rejected his final request to have his sentence commuted to life in prison. During the two-day hearing, the family of the victim called for “an eye for an eye.”

“Taberon, you robbed us,” Benn’s cousin, Betsy China, said at the time. She was also a family witness to the execution.

The last Utah inmate to be executed was Ronnie Lee Gardner. He was killed by firing squad in 2010 for a murder committed in 1985. Capital punishment is rare in Utah, but five men are currently on death row.

Anti-death penalty advocates, including Gardner’s brother, Randy, gathered at the Utah State Capitol Wednesday morning to address the media and deliver a petition and letter to urge Gov. Spencer Cox to intervene.

In a statement on Tuesday, Cox said, unlike other governors, he does not have the authority to commute death sentences.

Sean Higgins / KUER A group of anti-death penalty advocates protest at the Utah State Capitol, Aug. 7, 2024. The group also delivered a petition and letter urging Gov. Spencer Cox to intervene in Taberon Honie’s execution.

Randy Gardner said he still suffers from post-traumatic stress from his brother’s execution.

“The collateral damage of what we call the death penalty, it's just not right,” he said. “It's not a moral thing that we should be executing our own citizens.”

Some Utah faith leaders have also spoken out against the state still having the death penalty on the books. Father Kenneth Vialpando with the Catholic Diocese of Salt Lake City said everyone is called to be ""our brother’s and our sister's keeper by promoting justice, not vengeance, by promoting life, not death.”

In the teachings of the Catholic Church “capital punishment is an offense against the inviolability of life and the dignity of the human person,” he said. “Which contradicts God's plan for man and society, which does not render justice to the victims and their families, but rather fosters vengeance.”

Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes released a statement shortly after it was announced that Honie’s execution warrant had been carried out. He acknowledged the “deeply held beliefs, powerful emotions and divergent views regarding the death penalty.”

“Death by execution is one of the most extreme uses of government power,” he said.

“Many would argue it is ineffective, improper and beyond the authority of man to exercise. Many would disagree.”

Reyes went on to say the state “approached the exercise of its power and attendant responsibilities with the seriousness and solemnity that such an act merits” and expressed hope that Honie’s execution would deter further “heinous crimes.”

Taberon Honie is executed by lethal injection in Utah.,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/08/08/taberon-dave-honie-utah-execution/74697293007/,"Utah executed a death row inmate for the 1998 murder of his then-girlfriend's mother on Thursday, the 12th execution in the nation this year and the state's first since a firing squad execution in 2010.

Taberon Dave Honie, 48, was executed by lethal injection and pronounced dead on Thursday, at 12:25 a.m. Mountain Time, according to the Utah Department of Corrections. Honie's execution came nearly seven hours after Texas executed Arthur Lee Burton on Wednesday for the murder of Nancy Adleman, a 48-year-old mother of three who was out on a jog in Houston in 1997.

Honie was convicted for the murder of 49-year-old Claudia Benn, a substance abuse counselor for Utah's Paiute Tribe and a devoted grandmother of three.

Benita Yracheta, Benn's daughter, told USA TODAY on Monday that she feels relief that she can put her mother's brutal death behind her, saying that justice is ""finally happening"" and at least Honie could prepare for the day.

""My mom, she never knew her death date,"" she said. ""She didn’t know she was gonna die that night.""

Here's what to know about the execution, the case, and the victim.

Taberon Dave Honie's last meal, moments with family

The Utah Department of Corrections hosted a press conference livestream, providing hourly updates on Honie. Honie spent most of the day visiting with family members, including his daughter and parents, who had been with him since 10 a.m., according to corrections spokesperson Glenn Mills.

He ate two hot meals over the course of the day, including a breakfast sandwich. His last meal was a cheeseburger, fries, and a milkshake.

Honie underwent multiple mental health checks over the course of the day, with a corrections team reporting that Honie was ""gracious and appreciative"" throughout, Mills said. One of Honie's attorneys had access to a phone in case they had a concern with the execution procedure.

The corrections team ran through the procedure over a handful times to ensure that they had ""everything down.""

Honie's last words

Honie spoke his last words at 12:03 a.m.,reminding others that change is possible.

“From the start it's been, if it needs to be done for them to heal, let's do this,"" said Honie. ""If they tell you you can't change, don't listen to them. To all my brothers and sisters in here, continue to change. I love you all. Take care.""

What happened during the execution?

Media witnesses said when the execution started, it was like watching someone fall asleep.

When a curtain was pulled back in the execution room, Honie was looking up, had an IV in both arms, which were strapped down to a table, said media witness Ben Winslow, a reporter from Fox 13, at a press conference.

Before Honie gave his final words, the warden read the death warrant to him.

Honie looked around the room and began tapping his foot. The witnesses said they weren't sure it was out of nervousness or ""just a reaction to what was happening.""

He mouthed something to the warden and the director of operations, but witnesses could not hear what he said and then he lifted his head again and took in a ""deep exhaling breath and opened his mouth wide.""

His breathing then began to accelerate before slowing down. His skin then turned pale and blue, then shortly after, he was pronounced dead.

Differences between lethal injection and firing squad

There isn't ""much similarity at all"" between Honie's execution and Ronnie Lee Gardner's execution by firing squad in 2010, said Pat Reavy, a reporter with KSL.com who witnessed both executions, at the press conference.

""I guess there's a peaceful way to put someone to death,"" said Reavy about Honie's execution ""That's what this was.""

Reavy described the firing squad execution as more traumatic.

""The firing squad execution I thought was much more violent,"" said Reavy. ""It shakes you, it's just so loud.""

While Honie's execution took longer, he adds that it really was ""like watching a person fall asleep and not wake up again.""

'He was worthy of redemption'

""We are saddened that despite this change, the State of Utah did not grant him mercy,"" said his attorneys, Therese Day and Eric Zuckerman, in a statement. ""Mr. Honie’s life had value—he was worthy of redemption, and not being judged solely by his worst actions.""

His attorneys said he wasn't the same person he was 26 years ago.

""Honie always accepted responsibility for his crimes and expressed deep remorse for his actions, which were committed while he was extremely intoxicated from drugs and alcohol,"" ""Over the past 25 years, Mr. Honie worked on himself to become a better person""

Utah Attorney General releases statement

Utah's Attorney General Sean D. Reyes released a statement addressing Honie's execution and the ""deeply held beliefs, powerful emotions and divergent views regarding the death penalty.""

""Death by execution is one of the most extreme uses of government power,"" said Reyes. ""Many would argue it is ineffective, improper and beyond the authority of man to exercise. Many would disagree.""

""But there is no dispute that the violent and unprovoked taking of innocent lives from fellow human beings is among the crimes deemed by society to be most vile, repugnant and punishable by the harshest measures possible. In states like Utah, that includes the death penalty.""

Claudia Benn murdered at home while babysitting

Benn was babysitting her three granddaughters on July 9, 1998. Her daughter, Carol Pikyavit, had been living with Benn along with her 2-year-old daughter, whom she shared with Honie, when Honie called.

He was drunk and angry, and at one point, threatened to kill everyone in the home and take their daughter if Pikyavit didn't make time to see him, court records say.

Not taking the threat seriously, Pikyavit left the home and headed to work.

Honie headed to the house and began arguing with Benn. Honie told police that Benn started the fight and was calling him names through a sliding glass door before he snapped, broke through the door and went inside.

Benn had grabbed a butcher knife but was overpowered by Honie, who grabbed the knife and brought it to her throat, court records say. Honie says the two of them both tripped while the knife was at Benn’s throat and that she fell on the blade.

Police said Benn was found face down in the living room, with numerous “stabbing and cutting wounds” to her neck and genitals, according to court documents. Honie confessed to the murder, telling police that same night he had “stabbed and killed her with a knife,” USA TODAY reported.

All three grandchildren were found at the home with varying degrees of blood on their clothes and body. There was also evidence that one of Benn’s granddaughters was sexually abused at some point, court documents say.

Honie was arrested, charged and convicted of aggravated murder.

Victim's family looks to execution for closure

Betsy China, Benn's cousin, told USA TODAY on Monday that she wants Benn to be remembered as someone ""who helped our people."" Coping hasn't been easy for China, as she frequently looked to Benn for guidance in life. Benn always encouraged China, like a coach or sister would, advising her in difficult times.

“There was a big gap there in leadership within the family” after Benn’s death that remains to this day, China said.

Right now, what she’s focused on is “trying to be here and finish this out,” remembering her cousin in a good way and knowing that justice was served on Thursday.

Yracheta feels similarly, still working to untangle her mother's memory from what happened that night, saying whenever that happens, she tries to “to go to the good memories I have with her.""

“I miss her a lot. And every time I think of her, I think of the house and whatnot,” Yracheta said.

Those “good memories” include an impromptu dance party with impersonators for The Supremes at the Utah State Fair or how her mom worked to put herself through college after she divorced her husband and left Kaibab, Arizona, and moved the family to Utah.

Yracheta and other family members traveled to Salt Lake to witness the execution, hoping to put the past behind them."
Taberon Honie is executed by lethal injection in Utah.,https://scdailygazette.com/2024/08/08/utah-executes-taberon-honie-by-lethal-injection-first-capital-punishment-since-2010/,"As a lethal dose of pentobarbital moved through an IV line and into his veins, Taberon Honie turned to the room where his family sat. The glass was reflective, and he couldn’t see who was in the room. But he knew.

“I love you,” he said.

On the other side of the glass was his mother. Cancer took one of her children years ago, and during a Utah Board of Pardons and Parole hearing in July, she said another child was recently diagnosed.

As she sat in a small room with her family, watching her son’s final moments, she responded: “I love you, son.”

At 12:25 a.m. Thursday, Utah’s first death row inmate to be executed since 2010 was pronounced dead, 22 minutes after he gave his final statement and the lethal injection was administered.

“From the start it’s been, ‘If it needs to be done for them to heal, let’s do this.’ If they tell you you can’t change, don’t listen to them. To all my brothers and sisters here, continue to change. I love you all, take care,” Honie said as the execution began.

Honie, 48, died from two doses of pentobarbital.

He was sentenced to death in 1999 for the violent murder of his ex-girlfriend’s mother, Claudia Benn. Prison officials moved forward with the execution after Honie exhausted years of unsuccessful appeals, including a recent commutation hearing and a petition to Utah Gov. Spencer Cox.

Utah News Dispatch was among the media witnesses for the execution. The witnesses agreed the death was quiet, with no outward signs of suffering.

The execution of Taberon Honie

At 11:35, the seven media witnesses were led through a security checkpoint; Kyle Dunphey with Utah News Dispatch; Sarah Murphy with ABC4; Pat Reavy with KSL.com; Hannah Schoenbaum with the Associated Press; Jessica Miller with The Salt Lake Tribune; Jim Spiewak with KUTV; and Ben Winslow with FOX 13. Glen Mills, communications director for the Utah Department of Corrections, also accompanied the media.

Witnesses were given a notepad and mechanical pencil. But everything else was left behind, including watches. As the execution unfolded, reporters noted how disorienting it was with no way to keep track of time.

After a short trip to the Antelope Unit, the prison’s maximum security unit, reporters filed into the witness room, a small area no more than 10 by 15 feet, possibly less. In the other four rooms sat members of Benn’s family, Honie’s family and state officials.

Despite the curtain being drawn, muffled voices could be heard through the door.

At one point, someone referred to something “flowing perfect,” presumably talking about the IV lines. After the execution, director of prison operations Randall Honey said the process of setting the IV lines was seamless, only requiring one poke in each of Honie’s arms. He reportedly told staff it was “painless.”

Right around midnight, the curtain opened.

Honie lay still, wearing an orange jumpsuit with his arms and legs strapped to the gurney and an IV line going into each arm. His hair appeared freshly cut, with a long, braided ponytail. He wore his black framed glasses, blinking rapidly as he stared at the ceiling.

A white sheet was pulled up slightly above his stomach and next to his head was an electrocardiogram reading his pulse. He would move occasionally during the process. But for the most part, he appeared calm.

The prison’s warden, Bart Mortensen, read the death warrant at about 12:02 a.m. Then came Honie’s last words.

Honie spoke quickly yet was composed. His demeanor remained calm. Honey, the prison director, would later tell reporters: “He appeared to have accepted it.”

At 12:04 p.m., the lethal injection began. Pentobarbital acts as a barbiturate, depressing brain activity and ultimately the nervous and respiratory system.

As the injection began, Honie turned to the two officials in the room, telling them, “Thank you for taking care of my family.”

Honie’s left leg twitched nervously. His eyes remained open, momentarily looking around the sterile, white concrete room, illuminated by harsh fluorescent lights.

Suddenly, he sat up as much as the gurney would allow and took a deep breath, his mouth wide open. His head rested back on the gurney and his eyes closed. His breathing grew rapid. Then it slowed. Within a minute or two, his chest stopped moving and his skin turned a palish blue. He would never move again.

At 12:14 a.m., a second dose of pentobarbital was injected through the IV line. The doctor present advised that it be used, since it had already been prepared.

Honie laid there, motionless, his eyes shut and his mouth slightly agape, just enough to see his teeth. It almost looked like he was grinning. His right arm remained in a relaxed fist.

At 12:21 a.m., the EKG near his head indicated his heart had stopped and Honey and Mortensen placed the white sheet over his head. Then the curtain closed. The last thing reporters saw was his right arm poking out from under the sheet, still in a relaxed fist.

After he was pronounced dead, Honie’s father and cousin were let into the room. As members of the Hopi tribe, they believe the soul can be trapped in the body. They performed a quick ceremony with some bird feathers and cornmeal, laying a path for the soul to leave the room. Honey described it as “very quick and simple.”

A cleaning crew then came in and through the curtains in the media witness room, a mop could be heard. Seconds later, the smell of bleach seeped into the room. At about 1:30 a.m. when the witnesses were allowed into the execution chamber, the aroma was overpowering.

For some, what happened during the early morning hours at the prison resembled a medical procedure. It almost looked peaceful. If someone with no knowledge of the execution somehow walked in during Honie’s final moments, it could have looked like a man falling asleep.

The reality is far different. Honie spent the day talking with his family. He ate a cheeseburger and drank a milkshake. He met with counselors and attorneys. He spoke with a spiritual leader from the Hopi Tribe. Then, the state of Utah executed him. A far cry from an act carried out under the admonition to “do no harm,” the analogy of a medical procedure is not accurate.

What he felt in his final moments will remain a mystery.

If done, an autopsy could show signs of a pulmonary edema, a potential side effect of a lethal dose of pentobarbital where the lungs fill with blood and the person feels like they’re drowning.

But an autopsy can’t show pain and it can’t show fear.

In a statement after the execution, Honie’s attorneys Therese Day and Eric Zuckerman described him as “a proud member of the Hopi-Tewa Tribe from First Mesa, Arizona.”

“Mr. Honie always accepted responsibility for his crimes and expressed deep remorse for his actions, which were committed while he was extremely intoxicated from drugs and alcohol. Over the past 25 years, Mr. Honie worked on himself to become a better person,” they said. “Today, he was not the same man he was 26 years ago when he committed these crimes. We are saddened that despite this change, the State of Utah did not grant him mercy. Mr. Honie’s life had value — he was worthy of redemption, and not being judged solely by his worst actions.”

Taberon Honie’s final hours

Shortly after 6 a.m., Honie was led into an observation room in the Utah State Correctional Facility in Salt Lake City, where prison officials say he slept for about two hours. By 7 a.m., both that prison and the Central Utah Correctional Facility in Gunnison were placed on lockdown.

Honie was given a tablet to watch movies and entertainment, but as of 6 p.m., corrections staff said he hadn’t used it — instead, he spent his time meeting with family.

That included his daughter, mother, father, three of his sisters, two cousins, a brother-in-law and his aunt. For security reasons, he was only able to see two people at a time. No physical contact was permitted as he spoke to them through a glass pane. He did not have a window with an outside view.

“His mood has been described by our team who have interacted with him as gracious and appreciative throughout the day,” said Glen Mills, communications director for the Utah Department of Corrections.

Honie also had three mental health checks through the day, but Mills said he did not accept any medication.

Technically, Honie’s last meal was a cheeseburger, french fries and milkshake. But Mills said Honie wanted his last meal to be remembered as one he had with his family previously on the prison campus.

By about 8:30 p.m., a deputy warden walked into the observation room, telling Honie and his family to prepare for their final goodbyes. Honie had declined to see his attorneys during the visitation time, opting instead to spend it with his family.

Shortly after the deputy warden walked in, Honie said goodbye to his family, Mills said, leaving them with one last message: “Keep your heads up.”

“There were lots of emotions and tears,” Mills said.

Honie then used his tablet for the first time Wednesday, listening to music before he met with his attorneys. Mills described his mood at that point as “jovial.”

Honie talked with his attorneys until the 10 p.m. deadline, Mills said. Once they were gone, prison officials offered Honie a Valium, which treats anxiety. He declined.

Honie’s final two hours were expected to be spent alone, listening to music on his bed. Mills wasn’t sure what kind of music.

At about 11:30 p.m., he was to be led into the execution chamber, where he would be strapped to a gurney.

There, a team of six people would begin to administer pentobarbital, a drug often used to quell seizures, but which is now commonly used in lethal injections. Two of the team were Department of Corrections officials, the prison’s warden and the chief of prison operations.

The department declined to disclose any identifying information about the other four individuals — for instance, their medical qualifications or place of employment — but said they made up a two-person IV team and a two-person execution team. All of them have some kind of medical experience, the department said.

Meanwhile, outside and nearly 2 miles away in a designated “free speech zone,” a crowd of about two dozen protesters had been building through the night, denouncing Honie’s execution and Utah’s death penalty laws. The prayed, sang and spoke together as they awaited word of his death.

Who is Taberon Honie?

Honie was 22 years old when he broke into Benn’s home. Benn, a member of the Paiute Tribe, was a substance abuse counselor in the Cedar City area who relatives described as a pillar in the community.

Leading up to that moment, Honie had struggled with addiction for much of his life. He likely experienced fetal alcohol syndrome, and at just 12 years old started drinking and using drugs regularly.

During his commutation hearing in July, witnesses said he suffered several traumatic brain injuries which impacted his decision making. Honie is also a member of the Hopi Tribe, and experts called to testify during his hearing said he’s a victim of intergenerational trauma.

Honie said he had been drinking since 8 a.m. on the day he murdered Benn in July 1998. He claims he doesn’t remember most of that night.

But court records and witness testimony paint a gruesome picture of the crime.

According to court documents, Honie took a taxi to Benn’s home at about 11:20 p.m. He proceeded to argue with her through a glass door, before using a rock to break into the home.

With her three young grandchildren inside — including Honie’s own daughter — he beat Benn before cutting her throat. Court records show he mutilated her body, stabbing her multiple times in the genitals. Prosecutors say he had intended to rape her, but stopped only when he realized she was dead.

Two of the three children inside had blood on them when police arrived. Court testimony would later reveal Honie admitted to molesting one of them.

In 1999, Honie was sentenced to death.

During his commutation hearing in July, Honie told the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole he was a changed man, comparing himself to fertilizer “helping things grow” in the prison.

Over 26 years of incarceration, Honie earned his diploma and the trust of prison staff, while supporting his daughter as she struggled with addiction, he said.

“I’ve shown you that I can exist in prison. I’m not a threat to the public, I’m not a threat to anyone,” Honie told the board.

But Benn’s family, who spoke during the hearing, pushed back on Honie’s testimony, calling for an “eye for an eye.”

“Where could we have been if she had survived? We could have accelerated as a tribe, individuals and family, but it was torn apart that dreadful day,” said Benn’s cousin, Betsy China. “The best thing for me, my choice, would be the death penalty. Let’s get this over.”

Honie will be Utah’s first inmate killed by lethal injection since Joseph Mitchell Parsons was executed in 1999. In 2010, Ronnie Lee Gardner was executed by firing squad.

Taberon Honie is executed by lethal injection in Utah.,https://www.deseret.com/utah/2024/08/08/utah-executes-taberon-honie/,"Media witnesses look at the lethal injection table in the execution chamber at the Utah State Correctional Facility after the execution of Taberon Honie, Thursday, Aug. 8, 2024, in Salt Lake City.

Taberon Honie, who murdered and sexually assaulted Cedar City, Utah, resident Claudia Benn in 1998, was executed in the early minutes of Thursday by lethal injection. The execution was carried out by personnel the Utah Department of Corrections designated, completing a death sentence first given May 20, 1999.

Honie was pronounced dead at 12:25 a.m. Thursday, said Glen Mills, spokesperson for Utah Department of Corrections. This was the first execution carried out in Utah since 2010.

Benn, a member of the Paiute tribe and the mother of Honie’s then ex-girlfriend, was a substance abuse counselor, mother and grandmother. On July 9, 1998, Honie broke into Benn’s home and took a butcher knife from Benn, 49, and repeatedly stabbed her and sexually assaulted her with the knife. Her three young grandchildren were in the home at the time.

The first lethal dose of pentobarbitol was administered at 12:04 a.m., said Mills. A second dose was administered nine minutes later. At 12:21 a.m., the EKG showed a flatline and Honie was pronounced dead four minutes later at 12:25 a.m.

The department will provide support to the staff and around 200 individuals were involved in this situation, Brian Redd, executive director of Utah Department of Corrections, said.

“His foot appeared to be twitching,” said Ben Winslow, a Fox 13 reporter, who acted as chair of the media witnesses. Winslow said Honie’s foot seemed to twitch after giving his final words. He mouthed words to the warden that witnesses were unable to hear. A corrections official later said when Honie mouthed the words, he thanked two officials for taking care of his family and told his family he loved them.

Honie took a deep breath and then his breath picked up pace.

“But it then slowed down very quickly and then his skin turned pale, turned blue and we observed the EKG being tested to measure his pulse again and again and again,” said Winslow. Two other media witnesses said the process seemed to be carried out seamlessly.

“Early this morning the state of Utah fulfilled its legal obligation to carry out the execution of Taberon Honie. The actions of Mr. Honie that lead to his death sentence are heinous,” said Utah Gov. Spencer Cox in a statement. “I respect the process of our criminal justice system, and recognize the countless public servants who meticulously planned and approached their responsibilities with professionalism. I hope this brings closure to those impacted by the crimes. My heart goes out to the victim’s family.”

“We understand there are deeply held beliefs, powerful emotions and divergent views regarding the death penalty,” said Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes in a statement. “Death by execution is one of the most extreme uses of government power. Many would argue it is ineffective, improper and beyond the authority of man to exercise. Many would disagree.”

Reyes said society does agree that taking an innocent life is “deemed by society to be most vile, repugnant and punishable by the harshest measures possible. In states like Utah, that includes the death penalty.”

“As such, the State of Utah approached the exercise of its power and attendant responsibilities with the seriousness and solemnity that such an act merits. We hope opponents of the death penalty allow grace for those who carried out their duties as required by the law and did so with respect, professionalism, and, in some cases, in spite of their own personal views,” said Reyes. “We also hope that this act is a deterrent to other heinous crimes and pray it provides some measure of comfort to those who have been awaiting justice for decades.”

In the hours leading up to his execution, Honie was visited by his daughter, mother, father, three sisters, two cousins, brother-in-law and aunt, said Mills. Mental health workers also checked in on his well-being. Around 30 protesters gathered to protest the execution at a designated free speech zone.

Mills said Honie spoke with a spiritual leader Tuesday for a long period of time. The call involved several prayers.

Honie was convicted of aggravated murder and he was sentenced to die on May 20, 1999. The last execution carried out in Utah previous to Honie’s was Ronnie Lee Gardner on June 18, 2010.

“It was not a sentence I gave to the defendant; he earned it. If this isn’t a death penalty case, I don’t know what is,” 5th District Judge Robert Braithwaite said at the time.

After an initial appeal, Honie’s case was heard by the Utah Supreme Court in 2002, which upheld the sentence. He appealed his sentence again in 2013, claiming his defense did not show enough evidence of mitigating circumstances — substance abuse by both him and his parents. The Utah Supreme Court again denied his appeal.

In 2015, Honie filed a petition to ask another court to hear his challenge to his sentence. His petition was denied in 2019 and though he appealed, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the decision to deny the petition in 2023.

In June, Honie asked the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole to commute his sentence. In Utah, governors cannot commute sentences — that power belongs to the five-person board. The board denied the request in July.

“We did not ask for you to take my aunt the way you did. Nor did we ask you to hurt the girls,” Trevia Wall, Benn’s niece, said at the the hearing in July. “You did all that. And again, this sentence is what I feel is best and is what you’ve earned. You’ve earned that sentence.”

Another family member, Benn’s daughter Benita Yracheta, said at the hearing that when she thinks of her mother, she now thinks of the crime scene.

“I can’t pick up a phone and call her anymore,” said Yracheta. “I can’t wish her a happy birthday or Mother’s Day. I have to go to the cemetery for holidays, Mother’s Day, her birthday. I go down on the anniversary of her death. We can’t make no more memories with her, no more pictures with her. We just have to live with the memories we have.”

Honie’s attorney, Therese Day, said she provided more details about his upbringing, especially the role of substance abuse, and argued for clemency. “This request is something he’s struggled with because he believes he is deserving of nothing. He’s not asking to be let out of prison nor does he think he deserves it.”

After the hearing, the board issued a statement saying they reviewed testimony from Honie, his witnesses and family members as well as from the victim representatives and denied clemency.

“After carefully reviewing all submitted information and considering all arguments from the parties, the Board does not find sufficient cause to commute Mr. Honie’s death sentence.”

Attorneys for Honie wrote Cox a letter requesting Cox delay the execution, arguing the Utah Department of Corrections engaged in a rushed process. The department denied the process was rushed.

Cox denied the request in a letter sent Tuesday. He said Honie exhausted all his appeals and he does not think a temporary reprieve is warranted.

Allred, Deseret News

National advocates against the death penalty arrived in Utah days before the execution to lead efforts to protest it. Abe Bonowitz, co-founder of Death Penalty Action, along with SueZann Bosler, founding board member of Journey of Hope, and Randy Gardner, brother of Ronnie Lee Gardner and on Death Penalty Action’s advisory committee, have held a public meeting and spoken to press to protest the execution.

A group of anti-death penalty advocates presented Cox with a petition requesting he stay the execution. The group gathered on the steps of the Utah Capitol to protest the execution. The Utah Department of Corrections set up a designated free speech zone for those who wanted to protest against or for the death penalty.

Mills recounted Honie’s final words as, “From the start, it’s been if it needs to be done for them to heal, let’s do this. If they tell you you can’t change, don’t listen to them. To all my brothers and sisters here, continue to change. I love you all, take care.”

“While Honie is scheduled for execution, the impact of his actions will continue to resonate deeply with those who knew and loved Claudia,” said Restoring Ancestral Winds in a statement, a coalition with the purpose to end violence in Native communities. “She was a beloved mother and grandmother and a beacon of strength and resilience in her community. Claudia’s precious grandchildren who witnessed the attack, still feel her loss.”

”The emotional and psychological scars borne by her grandchildren are a painful reminder of the ongoing consequences of this tragic event,” continued the statement. “We call attention to the high rates of violence against Native American women which have a profound impact on future generations within Native American families and communities.”"
Taberon Honie is executed by lethal injection in Utah.,https://www.foxnews.com/us/utah-man-who-slashed-womans-throat-gives-3-word-message-family-before-lethal-injection,"As a Utah man who slashed the throat of his girlfriend’s mother was being put to death by lethal injection early Thursday, he mouthed one final message to his family members: ""I love you.""

Taberon Dave Honie was 22 years old when he broke into the Cedar City home of Claudia Benn, the maternal grandmother of his now 27-year-old daughter, Tressa, in July 1998 after a day of heavy drinking and drug use. He repeatedly slashed Benn’s throat and stabbed other parts of her body.

Honie was convicted of aggravated murder and sentenced to death. The judge who sentenced him also found that Honie had sexually abused one of Benn’s other grandchildren who was in the house with a then 2-year-old Tressa at the time of the murder.

Now 48 years old, Honie was strapped to the execution table at the state prison while family members watched from the witness chamber.

Honie made one final statement before the two doses of lethal pentobarbital were administered.

""From the start it’s been, if it needs to be done for them to heal, let’s do this,"" Honie said. ""If they tell you you can’t change, don’t listen to them. To all my brothers and sisters in here, continue to change. I love you all. Take care.""

After the lethal injection was given, he tapped his foot and mouthed ""I love you"" to his family watching in the chamber.

Honie let out a gasp as the drug flowed through IVs in both arms, and his torso jolted off the table. He then laid still for several minutes before he died, turning a pale shade of blue as his glasses slid back on his forehead.

Honie turned his head to thank correctional officers for taking care of his family before he lost consciousness, warden Bart Mortensen told reporters after the execution.

The brutal murder drove a wedge between Honie’s immediate family and Benn’s, with several of Benn’s family saying that Honie deserved no mercy despite Tressa’s plea to the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole to save her dad.

Honie’s final message to his family before his death was ‘Keep your heads up’

By: Kyle Dunphey, Utah News Dispatch

This breaking story has been updated through the night.

As a lethal dose of pentobarbital moved through an IV line and into his veins, Taberon Honie turned to the room where his family sat. The glass was reflective, and he couldn’t see who was in the room. But he knew.

“I love you,” he said.

On the other side of the glass was his mother. Cancer took one of her children years ago, and during a Utah Board of Pardons and Parole hearing in July, she said another child was recently diagnosed. As she sat in a small room with her family, watching her son’s final moments, she responded: “I love you, son.”

At 12:25 a.m. Thursday, Honie, Utah’s first death row inmate to be executed since 2010 was pronounced dead, 22 minutes after he gave his final statement and the lethal injection was administered.

“From the start it’s been, if it needs to be done for them to heal, let’s do this. If they tell you you can’t change, don’t listen to them. To all my brothers and sisters here, continue to change. I love you all, take care,” Honie said as the execution began.

Honie, 48, died from two doses of pentobarbital. He was sentenced to death in 1999 for the violent murder of his ex-girlfriend’s mother, Claudia Benn. Prison officials moved forward with the execution after Honie exhausted years of unsuccessful appeals, including a recent commutation hearing and a petition to Utah Gov. Spencer Cox.

Utah News Dispatch was among the media witnesses for the execution. The witnesses agreed the death was quiet, with no outward signs of suffering.

The execution of Taberon Honie

At 11:35, the seven media witnesses were led through a security checkpoint; Kyle Dunphey with Utah News Dispatch; Sarah Murphy with ABC4; Pat Reavy with KSL.com; Hannah Schoenbaum with the Associated Press; Jessica Miller with The Salt Lake Tribune; Jim Spiewak with KUTV; and Ben Winslow with FOX 13. Glen Mills, communications director for the Utah Department of Corrections, also accompanied the media.

Witnesses were given a notepad and mechanical pencil, but everything else was left behind, including watches. As the execution unfolded, reporters noted how disorienting it was with no way to keep track of time.

After a short trip to the Antelope Unit, the prison’s maximum security unit, reporters filed into the witness room, a small area no more than 10 by 15 feet, possibly less. In the other four rooms sat members of Benn’s family, Honie’s family and state officials.

Despite the curtain being drawn, muffled voices could be heard through the door. At one point, someone referred to something “flowing perfect,” presumably talking about the IV lines. After the execution, director of prison operations Randall Honey said the process of setting the IV lines was seamless, only requiring one poke in each of Honie’s arms. He reportedly told staff it was “painless.”

Right around midnight, the curtain opened.

Honie lay still, wearing an orange jumpsuit with his arms and legs strapped to the gurney and an IV line going into each arm. His hair appeared freshly cut, with a long, braided ponytail. He wore his black framed glasses, blinking rapidly as he stared at the ceiling. A white sheet was pulled up slightly above his stomach and next to his head was an electrocardiogram reading his pulse. He would move occasionally during the process. But for the most part, he appeared calm.

The prison’s warden, Bart Mortensen, read the death warrant at about 12:02 a.m. Then came Honie’s last words.

Honie spoke quickly yet was composed. His demeanor remained calm. Honey would later tell reporters: “He appeared to have accepted it.”

At 12:04 p.m., the lethal injection began. Pentobarbital acts as a barbiturate, depressing brain activity and ultimately the nervous and respiratory system.

As the injection began, Honie turned to the two officials in the room, telling them, “Thank you for taking care of my family.”

Honie’s left leg twitched nervously. His eyes remained open, momentarily looking around the sterile, white concrete room, illuminated by harsh fluorescent lights. Suddenly, he sat up as much as the gurney would allow and took a deep breath, his mouth wide open. His head rested back on the gurney and his eyes closed. His breathing grew rapid. Then it slowed. Within a minute or two, his chest stopped moving and his skin turned a palish blue. He would never move again.

At 12:14 a.m., a second dose of pentobarbital was injected through the IV line. The doctor present advised that it be used, since it had already been prepared.

Honie laid there, motionless, his eyes shut and his mouth slightly agape, just enough to see his teeth. It almost looked like he was grinning. His right arm remained in a relaxed fist.

At 12:21 a.m., the EKG near his head indicated his heart had stopped and Honey and Mortensen placed the white sheet over his head. Then the curtain closed. The last thing reporters saw was his right arm poking out from under the sheet, still in a relaxed fist.

After he was pronounced dead, Honie’s father and cousin were let into the room. As members of the Hopi tribe, they believe the soul can be trapped in the body. They performed a quick ceremony with some bird feathers and cornmeal, laying a path for the soul to leave the room. Honey described it as “very quick and simple.”

A cleaning crew then came in and through the curtains in the media witness room, a mop could be heard. Seconds later, the smell of bleach seeped into the room. At about 1:30 a.m. when the witnesses were allowed into the execution chamber, the aroma was overpowering.

For some, what happened during the early morning hours at the prison resembled a medical procedure. It almost looked peaceful. If someone with no knowledge of the execution somehow walked in during Honie’s final moments, it could have looked like a man falling asleep.

The reality is far different. Honie spent the day talking with his family. He ate a cheeseburger and drank a milkshake. He met with counselors and attorneys. He spoke with a spiritual leader from the Hopi Tribe. Then, the state of Utah executed him. A far cry from an act carried out under the admonition to “do no harm,” the analogy of a medical procedure is not accurate.

What he felt in his final moments will remain a mystery.

If done, an autopsy could show signs of a pulmonary edema, a potential side effect of a lethal dose of pentobarbital where the lungs fill with blood and the person feels like they’re drowning.

But an autopsy can’t show pain and it can’t show fear.

In a statement after the execution, Honie’s attorneys Therese Day and Eric Zuckerman described him as “a proud member of the Hopi-Tewa Tribe from First Mesa, Arizona.”

“Mr. Honie always accepted responsibility for his crimes and expressed deep remorse for his actions, which were committed while he was extremely intoxicated from drugs and alcohol. Over the past 25 years, Mr. Honie worked on himself to become a better person,” they said. “Today, he was not the same man he was 26 years ago when he committed these crimes. We are saddened that despite this change, the State of Utah did not grant him mercy. Mr. Honie’s life had value — he was worthy of redemption, and not being judged solely by his worst actions.”

Taberon Honie’s final hours

Shortly after 6 a.m., Honie was led into an observation room in the Utah State Correctional Facility in Salt Lake City, where prison officials say he slept for about two hours. By 7 a.m., both that prison and the Central Utah Correctional Facility in Gunnison were placed on lockdown.

Honie was given a tablet to watch movies and entertainment, but as of 6 p.m corrections staff said he hadn’t used it — instead, he spent his time meeting with family.

That included his daughter, mother, father, three of his sisters, two cousins, a brother-in-law and his aunt. For security reasons, he was only able to see two people at a time. No physical contact was permitted as he spoke to them through a glass pane. He did not have a window with an outside view.

“His mood has been described by our team who have interacted with him as gracious and appreciative throughout the day,” said Glen Mills, communications director for the Utah Department of Corrections.

Honie also had three mental health checks through the day, but Mills said he did not accept any medication.

Technically, Honie’s last meal was a cheeseburger, french fries and milkshake. But Mills said Honie wanted his last meal to be remembered as one he had with his family previously on the prison campus.

By about 8:30 p.m., a deputy warden walked into the observation room, telling Honie and his family to prepare for their final goodbyes. Honie had declined to see his attorneys during the visitation time, opting instead to spend it with his family.

Shortly after the deputy warden walked in, Honie said goodbye to his family, Mills said, leaving them with one last message: “Keep your heads up.”

“There were lots of emotions and tears,” Mills said.

Honie then used his tablet for the first time Wednesday, listening to music before he met with his attorneys. Mills described his mood at that point as “jovial.”

Honie talked with his attorneys until the 10 p.m. deadline, Mills said. Once they were gone, prison officials offered Honie a Valium, which treats anxiety. He declined.

Honie’s final two hours were expected to be spent alone, listening to music on his bed. Mills wasn’t sure what kind of music.

At about 11:30 p.m., he was to be led into the execution chamber, where he would be strapped to a gurney.

There, a team of six people would begin to administer pentobarbital, a drug often used to quell seizures, but which is now commonly used in lethal injections. Two of the team were Department of Corrections officials, the prison’s warden and the chief of prison operations.

The department declined to disclose any identifying information about the other four individuals — for instance, their medical qualifications or place of employment — but said they made up a two-person IV team and a two-person execution team. All of them have some kind of medical experience, the department said.

Meanwhile, outside and nearly 2 miles away in a designated “free speech zone,” a crowd of about two dozen protesters had been building through the night, denouncing Honie’s execution and Utah’s death penalty laws. The prayed, sang and spoke together as they awaited word of his death.

Who is Taberon Honie?

Honie was 22 years old when he broke into Benn’s home. Benn, a member of the Paiute Tribe, was a substance abuse counselor in the Cedar City area who relatives described as a pillar in the community.

Leading up to that moment, Honie had struggled with addiction for much of his life. He likely experienced fetal alcohol syndrome, and at just 12 years old started drinking and using drugs regularly. During his commutation hearing in July, witnesses said he suffered several traumatic brain injuries which impacted his decision making. Honie is also a member of the Hopi Tribe, and experts called to testify during his hearing said he’s a victim of intergenerational trauma.

Honie said he had been drinking since 8 a.m. on the day he murdered Benn in July 1998. He claims he doesn’t remember most of that night. But court records and witness testimony paint a gruesome picture of the crime.

According to court documents, Honie took a taxi to Benn’s home at about 11:20 p.m. He proceeded to argue with her through a glass door, before using a rock to break into the home. With her three young grandchildren inside — including Honie’s own daughter — he beat Benn before cutting her throat. Court records show he mutilated her body, stabbing her multiple times in the genitals. Prosecutors say he had intended to rape her, but stopped only when he realized she was dead.

Two of the three children inside had blood on them when police arrived and court testimony would later reveal Honie admitted to molesting one of them.

In 1999, Honie was sentenced to death.

During his commutation hearing in July, Honie told the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole he was a changed man, comparing himself to fertilizer “helping things grow” in the prison.

Over 26 years of incarceration, Honie earned his diploma and the trust of prison staff, while supporting his daughter as she struggled with addiction, he said.

“I’ve shown you that I can exist in prison. I’m not a threat to the public, I’m not a threat to anyone,” Honie told the board.

But Benn’s family, who spoke during the hearing, pushed back on Honie’s testimony, calling for an “eye for an eye.”

“Where could we have been if she had survived? We could have accelerated as a tribe, individuals and family, but it was torn apart that dreadful day,” said Benn’s cousin, Betsy China. “The best thing for me, my choice, would be the death penalty. Let’s get this over.”

Honie will be Utah’s first inmate killed by lethal injection since Joseph Mitchell Parsons was executed in 1999. In 2010, Ronnie Lee Gardner was executed by firing squad."
Taberon Honie is executed by lethal injection in Utah.,https://www.fox13now.com/news/local-news/process-underway-in-execution-of-convicted-murderer-taberon-honie,"SALT LAKE CITY — Just after midnight Thursday, the state of Utah will conduct its first execution since 2010 when convicted murderer Taberon Honie is put to death.

WATCH: Here's how Utah's first execution since 2010 will take place

While the execution of Honie is set for the early morning hours, protocols are already underway at the Utah State Correctional Facility. FOX 13 News will continue to provide real-time updates on the execution throughout the day and evening.

2:44 a.m.

Shortly after midnight, the curtain was drawn and Taberon Honie was seen strapped to a table with IVs in both arms.

At 12:03 a.m., he was asked if he had any final words. His demeanor was calm.

""From the start, it's been if it needs to be done for them to heal, let's do this,"" he said, referencing the victim's family. Then he appeared to address his fellow inmates.

""If they tell you, you can't change, don't listen to them. To all my brothers and sisters here, continue to change. I love you all. Take care.""

Honie's foot was twitching, apparently out of nervousness. He looked around the room and mouthed something to the prison's chief of operations and the warden. They told reporters Honie said ""thank you for taking care of my family"" and mouthed to his family witnessing the execution: ""I love you.""

Honie lifted his head up, appeared to take a deep exhaling breath. At first, his breathing appeared rapid, but quickly slowed. His skin turned pale, then blue.

The director of prison operations kept checking an EKG meter. Reporters were told later that two doses of pentobarbitol were administered with the second dose coming at 12:07 a.m.

It took 17 minutes before Honie was declared dead.

10:37 p.m.

Taberon Honie spoke to his attorneys until 10 p.m. The prison warden and operations chief then met with Honie and offered him a Valium. He declined to take it, UDC Communications Director Glen Mills told reporters.

Honie is currently on his bed in an observation room, listening to music. The Utah Department of Corrections has not been informed of any last-minute legal challenges to halt the execution.

I ask why midnight for an execution? It is a time when it would have the least impact on operations, Mills said. The prison is already in lockdown as people go to sleep.

This is the last scheduled update from the Utah State Prison until the execution is carried out.

9:54 p.m.

Charles Rony, the first man who showed up at the designated ""Free Speech Zone"" outside the prison, is here on his own. He's not affiliated with any organization; some anti-death-penalty groups are planning to join later.

Rony says the death penalty is against his religious beliefs. He's holding a sign quoting John 8:7: ""Let him cast the first stone."" He's originally from Haiti, which abolished the death penalty in 1987.

""Where I'm from, we don't have that. Even in a third world country, they consider death penalty as something barbaric,"" he said.

-Emily Tencer

9:42 p.m.

At another news conference, the Utah Dept. of Corrections updated preparations for the execution and what Taberon Honie is doing.

The final run through for execution preparations went smoothly, UDC Communications Director Glen Mills said.

“We are highly confident in our plan to carry this out in an effective hours as we come into the final hours,"" he told reporters.

Honie said goodbye to his family. There were lots of emotions and tears. One thing he was heard saying to his family members was “keep your heads up” and he cracked a few jokes, Mills said.

Honie is now meeting with his attorneys. At 10 p.m., he will be alone in the cell. Then things will begin to proceed around 11:30 p.m.

-Ben Winslow

8:37 p.m.

In the past hour, Honie has continued to spend time with family members. In the observation room, a deputy warden has told him to prepare to say his final goodbyes before he is taken to the death chamber.

A judge has also denied a request for an injunction surrounding the ""free speech zone"" where anti-death penalty protesters are allowed to gather, Corrections officials said. The zone is near I-80 and 7200 West. Demonstrators wanted to be closer to the prison, but were denied.

Honie made two requests of the Utah Dept. of Corrections, which took place on Monday. A pipe and smudging ceremony. He has also requested a spiritual ceremony be performed with his remains. The agency has granted that request.

Seven members of Claudia Benn's family will be present to witness the execution. They will not speak to the news media afterward, Corrections communications director Glen Mills said.

A medical doctor will administer the fatal dose, he added.

-Ben Winslow

8:24 p.m.

The Cedar City judge who signed Honie's death warrant has denied a request to be available tonight ""if something goes wrong"" with the execution. Judge Jeffrey Wilcox said in a filing that Honie attorney Eric Zuckerman has not specified how the court could intervene or even have jurisdiction, so he would not entertain it.

-Ben Winslow

8:18 p.m.

In an interview with the Associated Press, Taberon Honie's daughter, Tressa Honie, spoke about being caught between anger and grief over the lethal injection execution. Her grandmother is Honie's victim. Her mother's family wants him put to death, but she has kept in touch with her father in prison.

""My mom's side, they can heal together,"" she said in an interview. ""I'm happy you guys are going to get this closure, this justice, but where does that leave me? I feel like I have to heal alone.""

7:34 p.m.

Utah Dept. of Corrections communications director Glen Mills said Honie met previously with a Native American spiritual adviser who called him. The call consisted of ""prayers.""

Corrections officials conducted another ""run through"" of how the execution will go down, including preparing for scenarios of resistance and IV preparation.

Honie continues to visit with family. At 6:40 p.m., he was notified that his attorneys were here. Honie declined to speak with them until later, opting to use all of his time with his family. At about 9 p.m., family visits will cease and he will meet with them. He can meet with attorneys or clergy up until 10 p.m. He has made no clergy requests.

He will be escorted into the death chamber around 11:30 p.m. If there is any resistance? Corrections officials will be prepared to take him in there.

-Ben Winslow

6:36 p.m.

At another news conference, Utah Dept. of Corrections provided an update:

Honie has been visiting with his family, including his daughter, mother and father, sister, cousins, a brother-in-law and an aunt. They are speaking through a barrier. There is no time limits to the visits.

He has also received another mental health check, which evaluates his mood on how he is feeling. His mood has been described as ""gracious and appreciative"" for being able to visit his family.

The Utah Dept. of Corrections said it will do another ""run through"" of the execution tonight to make sure they do it ""safely, humanely and appropriately."" They have done at least five run throughs.

Corrections communications director Glen Mills confirmed the agency has three doses of pentobarbital, in case the initial dose does not kill Honie.

How is the mood at the prison? For inmates, it varies based on those who knew it. For staff? No one takes joy in this, but they have a responsibility to carry it out ""in a professional manner.""

Honie had a call with a spiritual leader yesterday. He requested that person and the phone call was ""quite a long time.""

-Ben Winslow

5:42 p.m.

In their first news conference as Honie nears the time he will be executed, the Utah Department of Corrections offered updates:

Honie was taken to an observation room at 6:09 a.m. He slept for about two hours until about 8:15 a.m. Honie ate a breakfast sandwich. He was offered a tablet to allow him to watch movies, but he chose not to do that. He has instead, been busy with visitors.

He had a visit with his mother and father. Since that time, in numbers of twos, family members have been switching out and meeting with Honie. He had a chance to meet with the warden and three mental health checks have been made.

Honie's last meal was delivered around 4:30 p.m. It was a cheeseburger, fries and a milkshake. He conveyed through Corrections officials that he wanted his last meal to be remembered as one with his family.

His mood has been described by Corrections officials as “gracious and appreciative throughout the day.”

4:51 p.m.

As a young reporter living in Cedar City in 1998, I covered the murder of Claudia Benn. It was a gruesome crime. Taberon Honie was accused of breaking into her home through a sliding glass door. Iron County prosecutors said Benn tried to protect herself by grabbing a butcher knife. Police said he turned the knife on her, slit her throat and then sexually assaulted her with it.

Benn's three grandchildren (including Honie's daughter, who was two at the time) were in the home and prosecutors said they witnessed the murder. Honie was also accused of molesting one of the children. He was convicted and sentenced to death.

It is interesting to be here at the Utah State Prison all these years later where I am to witness his scheduled execution.

Taberon Honie is executed by lethal injection in Utah.,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/utah-carries-out-its-first-execution-since-2010-taberon-honie-killed-his-girlfriends-mother-by-slitting-her-throat/,"Salt Lake City — A Utah man who killed his girlfriend's mother by cutting her throat was put to death by lethal injection early Thursday in the state's first execution since 2010.

Taberon Dave Honie, 48, was convicted of aggravated murder in the July 1998 death of Claudia Benn.

Honie was 22 when he broke into Benn's house in Cedar City after a day of heavy drinking and drug use and repeatedly slashed her throat and stabbed her in other parts of her body. Benn's grandchildren, including Honie's then 2-year-old daughter, were in the house at the time.

The judge who sentenced him to death found that Honie had sexually abused one of the children, one of the aggravating factors used to reach that decision.

Honie's last meal before his execution was a cheeseburger, french fries and a milkshake, Utah Department of Corrections said. Honie spent the evening with his family before the execution.

After decades of failed appeals, Honie's execution warrant was signed in June despite defense objections to the planned lethal drug combination. In July, the state changed its execution protocol to using only a high dose of pentobarbital - the nervous system suppressant used to euthanize pets.

The Utah Board of Pardons and Parole denied Honie's petition to commute his sentence to life in prison after a two-day hearing in July during which Honie's attorneys said he grew up on the Hopi Indian Reservation in Arizona with parents who abused alcohol and neglected him.

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, also denied a final request by Honie to delay the execution.

Honie told the parole board he wouldn't have killed Benn if he had been in his ""right mind."" He asked the board to allow him ""to exist"" so he could be a support for his daughter.

Tressa Honie told the board she has a complicated relationship with her mother and said she would lose her most supportive parental figure if her father were to be executed.

However, other family members argued that Taberon Honie deserved no mercy.

They described Benn as a pillar in their family and southwestern Utah community - a Paiute tribal member, substance abuse counselor and caregiver for her children and grandchildren.

Sarah China Azule, Benn's niece, said she was happy with the board's decision to move forward with Honie's execution.

""He deserves an eye for an eye,"" she said.

Honie was one of six people facing execution in Utah.

The death sentence for a seventh person, Douglas Lovell, who killed a woman to keep her from testifying against him in a rape case, was recently overturned by the Utah Supreme Court. He will be resentenced.

A man described by his lawyers as intellectually disabled was executed a few hours earlier in Texas for strangling and trying to rape a woman who went jogging near her Houston home more than 27 years ago. Arthur Lee Burton had been sentenced to death for the July 1997 killing of Nancy Adleman, a 48-year-old mother of three who police found beaten and strangled with her own shoelace in a wooded area off a jogging trail along a bayou."

""Early this morning the state of Utah fulfilled its legal obligation to carry out the execution of Taberon Honie,"" Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said in a statement. ""The actions of Mr. Honie that lead to his death sentence are heinous.""

He added, "" I hope this brings closure to those impacted by the crimes. My heart goes out to the victim's family.""

Utah Department of Corrections announced, ""the sentence of Taberon Honie has been carried out.""

""From the start it's been, if it needs to be done for them to heal, let's do this. If they tell you you can't change, don't listen to them. To all my brothers and sisters here, continue to change. I love you all, take care,"" Honie said as the execution began.

""No concept of time in there. Seemed to go very long. All reporters stood to get a better view. Honie strapped to gurney, white sheet pulled up to below his chest.

Dozens of people protested the execution as they sang and prayed in a ""free speech zone"" over a mile away from the prison.

Rony Charles described himself as a Christian and member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints.

""It is barbarism, in my view,"" Charles said. ""Who gives me the right to take someone else's life? I don't think no one should have that right -- that power -- and reason to take someone else's life. It's barbarism killing another human being.""

Taberon Honie is executed by lethal injection in Utah.,https://ksltv.com/668882/taberon-honie-executed-for-1998-killing-of-claudia-marie-benn/,"SALT LAKE CITY — Taberon Dave Honie, 48, was put to death early Thursday morning for the murder of Claudia Marie Benn, who was 49 when she was killed in 1998.

The announcement was made at approximately 12:30 a.m. Thursday.

“The sentence, the execution of Taberon Dave Honie has been carried out,” Utah Department of Corrections spokeswoman Karen Tapahe said in a media briefing room at the prison. It was planned to bring journalists who witnessed the execution to the same people when the department planned to hold a final press conference.

Honie was given a lethal injection at the Utah State Prison while strapped to an execution gurney. He was connected to an IV in each arm, then the curtains were pulled back in the execution chamber. He was given an opportunity to speak his last words before the command of his death was given and a fatal drug administered.

The execution warrant for Taberon Dave Honie has been carried out. More details will be available at the press conference when the media witnesses return to the media center. — UTDeptofCorrections (@UtahCorrections) August 8, 2024

State officials revealed more about the execution process in a press conference that also featured media watchdog witnesses.

Witnesses watched through windows into the execution chamber, the first time it has been used at the new prison, built in 2022. It was previously stated by law enforcement that seven people related to Benn, or associated with her, would watch the death sentence carried out.

Seven journalists were among those in attendance in a separate witness room to watch what the Utah Department of Corrections characterized as a meticulously planned execution. Honie was expected to have five witnesses, four from his family and his attorney.

Over a mile away from the prison dozens of people gathered at a designated “free speech zone” to sing, pray and generally protest the execution.

Rony Charles was one of those who showed up to protest Honie’s execution.

Charles, who is originally from Haiti, said he is a Christian and a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and he does not believe capital punishment lines up with the teachings of Christ.

“It is barbarism, in my view,” Charles said. “Who gives me the right to take someone else’s life? I don’t think no one should have that right – that power – and reason to take someone else’s life. It’s barbarism killing another human being.”

The state keeps the source of its lethal drugs a secret but Honie was expected to receive pentobarbital for the lethal injection. Two people with medical training administered a drug through an IV, neither sure which of the chemicals introduced to his body was the lethal drug.

Honie was moved to an observation cell Wednesday morning where he was given his last meal. He was allowed to meet with family and his legal team on his final day. He ordered a cheeseburger as a final meal, prepared inside the prison.

Honie said through prison officials that he preferred that his last meal be remembered as the one he shared with family previously. Visitors met with Honie only in pairs and through a barrier. He reportedly visited with his daughter and his parents, among others.

He also reportedly spoke with a spiritual adviser from the Hopi Reservation.

Honie was tried and convicted in an Iron County court where he was also sentenced to die.

Prison and Department of Corrections officials held press conferences hourly Wednesday afternoon and evening.

As a matter of routine, the prison in placed on lockdown on the day of the execution. A group filed a lawsuit claiming the requirement to protest an execution from a mile away was too far. In a press conference, corrections officials said the area was designated because a lot of the land surrounding the prison is private and there aren’t a lot of ways into and out of the prison.

The protesting groups were made up of national organizations opposed to the death penalty — Death Penalty Action, the For Whom the Bell Tolls initiative, and Conservatives Concerned about the Death Penalty — they were also joined by the Catholic Diocese of Salt Lake City, and Randy Gardner, the brother of Ronnie Lee Gardner, the last person executed in Utah in 2010.

The group made an appeal to Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, who had previously denied a reprieve for Honie. The Utah Board of Pardons and Parole also denied Honie’s petition to commute his death sentence.

Honie was Utah’s eighth execution since the United States Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1977. Utah’s Gary Gilmore, was the first person in the nation to be executed after the death penalty became legal. His case was given national attention, partly because he elected to be killed by firing squad.

Since Gilmore, the following have been killed by the state:

Utah has five inmates on death row: Von Lester Taylor, Anthony Archuleta, Douglas Carter, Troy Kell and Ralph Menzies.

Douglas Lovell recently had his death sentence vacated and sent back to a district court to be resentenced.

In Texas Wednesday, Arthur Lee Burton was executed. According to deathpenaltyinfo.org, Texas has executed 586 since the death penalty’s return, with Oklahoma’s 123 as the next-highest total.

Taberon Honie is executed by lethal injection in Utah.,https://www.sltrib.com/news/2024/08/08/utah-executes-taberon-honie-by/,"Taberon Dave Honie died by lethal injection early Thursday, a quarter-century after he was sentenced to death for sexually assaulting and killing his ex-girlfriend’s mother in a brutal attack when he was 22 years old.

Claudia Benn was his own daughter’s grandmother, and the murder divided the family, with Benn’s daughter and other relatives recently urging officials to carry out the death sentence as Honie’s daughter and others pleaded for his life. Family members of both Benn and Honie witnessed his execution, which took place just after midnight.

Honie spoke his last words while strapped to the execution table.

“From the start, it’s been, if it needs to be done for them to heal, let’s do this,” he said into a microphone held by a prison worker. “If they tell you you can’t change, don’t listen to them. To all my brothers and sisters here, continue to change. I love you all, take care.”

Randall Honey, director of prison operations, later said Honie then spoke to him and prison warden Bart Mortensen — words that were not captured by the microphone, and not heard directly by those witnessing the execution. Honey said Honie told them, “Thank you for taking care of my family.” Honie then looked toward where his family was seated, Honey said, and told them, “I love you.” Honie’s mother replied, “I love you, son,” added Glen Mills, communications director for the Department of Corrections.

The execution was the state’s first in 14 years. Honie was 48 years old.

It took 17 minutes from when the first dose of pentobarbital was given to Honie to when an electrocardiogram detected his heart was no longer beating. He was pronounced dead at 12:25 a.m.

Honie was given a second dose of pentobarbital about five minutes into his execution at the advice of medical professionals, said Corrections Director Brian Redd.

In the minutes between midnight and the announcement that Honie’s execution had been carried out, a crowd of about 40 protesters waited in silence in a free speech zone two miles from the prison. At 12:34 a.m., Abraham Bonowitz, co-founder and executive director of Death Penalty Action, picked up a microphone and told the crowd, “the execution has been confirmed, and the world is no safer. Utah is no safer.”

After Honie gave his final remarks, he began tapping his right foot in what appeared to be a sign of nervousness. He then lifted his head and took a deep exhaling breath. His chest continued to rise and fall for the first few minutes of the execution before he became still.

Honie’s skin turned pale, then blue. At 12:21 a.m., after an EKG readout indicated his heart had stopped, Honey and Mortensen lifted a white sheet over the top of Honie’s body and a curtain was drawn.

After Honie’s death, his father and cousin were allowed into the execution room and performed a Hopi ceremony to help free his soul, Honey explained. The ceremony included using feathers and cornmeal to lead “a path for the soul to leave the room,” he said.

The last time the state executed a man was in 2010, when Ronnie Lee Gardner was killed by firing squad. Utah’s last lethal injection death was in 1999.

In a series of briefings hours before his death, prison officials said Honie had sat on the floor in an observation cell for most of the day, talking with family members he could see through a window in the room. They visited with him in pairs, rotating in and out of a room adjacent to his cell for nearly 10 hours. His mood was described by prison staff as “gracious and appreciative.”

He ate a cheeseburger, fries and a milkshake around 4:30 p.m. Wednesday. But prison officials said Honie told them that he wanted his last meal to be remembered as one he had recently shared with his family, Mills said.

Honie, who is from the Hopi-Tewa tribal community, also participated in a pipe ceremony and a smudging ceremony the Monday before his execution, according to prison officials. Both are considered sacred ceremonies in Indigenous culture. And earlier in the week, he spoke at length by phone with a spiritual leader from his Hopi reservation in Arizona, prison officials said.

Protesters rallied throughout the day to show their opposition to capital punishment — first on the steps of the state Capitol Wednesday morning, and later in the designated protest zone on the outskirts of Salt Lake City. It was the first execution at the new prison, built in 2022.

An attorney for the advocates filed a legal challenge to the location distant from the prison Wednesday afternoon, but 3rd District Judge Laura Scott found that evening that the court papers had been improperly filed, and that they didn’t contain enough information for her to force the prison to move the free speech zone.

On Wednesday evening, protesters gathered at the site just off a two-lane road that runs through dry green and yellow sagebrush and wild grasses. People began reciting the rosary at about the time Honie was set to be taken from the observation room into the execution room. A small speaker amplified the prayer over the steady hum of generators powering flood lights illuminating the protest zone.

“As I always ask the government, and the people in the prison, and the people who are going to put the needle in him: Why kill people who killed people to show us Americans that to kill people is wrong? It is not a deterrent,” said anti-death penalty advocate SueZanna Bosler. “It has not worked and never will work.”

Attorney General Sean Reyes, whose office defended against Honie’s appeals and ultimately sought his death warrant, defended that decision early Thursday after Honie’s death.

”Death by execution is one of the most extreme uses of government power. Many would argue it is ineffective, improper and beyond the authority of man to exercise,” Reyes wrote. “Many would disagree.” The “unprovoked taking of innocent lives” deserves the “harshest” possible punishment, he said, adding that in Utah, that includes the death penalty.

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said in a statement early Thursday morning that Honie’s crimes were “heinous.”

“I respect the process of our criminal justice system, and recognize the countless public servants who meticulously planned and approached their responsibilities with professionalism,” he said. “I hope this brings closure to those impacted by the crimes. My heart goes out to the victim’s family.”

Honie’s legal team, Eric Zuckerman and Therese Day, emphasized in a statement Thursday morning that Honie always accepted responsibility and expressed deep remorse for his crimes, which they said he committed while he was “extremely intoxicated” from drugs and alcohol.

“Over the past twenty-five years, Mr. Honie worked on himself to become a better person,” they wrote. “Today, he was not the same man he was twenty-six years ago when he committed these crimes. We are saddened that despite this change, the State of Utah did not grant him mercy. Mr. Honie’s life had value — he was worthy of redemption, and not being judged solely by his worst actions.”

Honie’s crimes

Honie didn’t plan to kill anyone on July 9, 1998, he told Utah’s parole board during his commutation hearing last month. That morning, he had tried to find work with friends — and when they couldn’t find any, they started partying.

At 8:30 a.m., he had his first drink. Honie, then 22, continued drinking alcohol during the day and started using drugs. He wanted to get drunk and pass out, he said. But that’s not what happened.

At some point, he called his ex-girlfriend — with whom he shared a daughter — and demanded that she see him, threatening to kill her family if she didn’t. He had made these types of threats before, prosecutors have said, without acting on them. So his ex-girlfriend went to work.

(Bethany Baker | The Salt Lake Tribune) Media witnesses who would be willing to serve as a witness in the future raise their hands during a news conference after the execution of Taberon Honie at the Utah State Correctional Facility in Salt Lake City on Aug. 8, 2024.

Later that evening, sometime before midnight, Honie took a cab to Benn’s Cedar City home, where his ex-girlfriend also lived. Honie told the parole board he planned to sleep under the porch until his ex-girlfriend returned home from work, and he thought he might be able to see their young daughter — one of three grandchildren Benn was babysitting while her daughters were working.

Instead, Honie broke open a glass door with a rock and went inside Benn’s home. He argued with her, and grabbed a butcher knife from her that prosecutors say she had grabbed to try to protect herself.

Trial testimony and evidence showed that Honie beat and bit Benn after breaking in, slashed her throat, stabbed her genitals multiple times, and had prepared to have anal sex with her before realizing she had died. He killed Benn in front of several children, including his young daughter and another child whom he also sexually assaulted that same night.

At Honie’s commutation hearing, Benn’s niece recalled seeing the bloody crime scene when she went to Benn’s home the next morning.

“We busted in the door and there was blood all over the damn house,” Sarah China said between sobs. “She fought for her life. She saved her grandkids, too. That’s a strong Paiute woman right there.”

Benn was born in Kingman, Arizona, in June 1949, but grew up in Page, according to her obituary. She later moved to towns in Arizona and Utah before she went on to earn a bachelor’s degree in sociology at the University of Utah. There, she worked at the Women’s’ Resource Center helping women get scholarships to pursue higher education.

After she graduated, she became a substance abuse counselor and “advocated sobriety amongst her people, and the traditional way of life,” the obituary said.

Her family remembered her as a loving mother, grandmother, aunt, cousin, friend and counselor, who loved bingo, going to powwows and playing cards with her family. ”Her greatest joy was her grandchildren,” it said, “and seeing her nephew and nieces achieve their goals.”

At the commutation hearing, Honie’s legal team presented evidence about his traumatic childhood growing up on a Hopi reservation — which he said contributed to his alcohol and drug abuse at an early age. These experiences, along with a number of head injuries he received as a child, had a “synergistic effect” with his “extreme intoxication” on the July night in 1998 when he killed Benn, his attorneys argued in his commutation petition.

Fighting a death sentence for 25 years

Some of the men who have previously been executed in Utah eventually gave up their appeals and were killed. But not Honie, who has fought his execution for 25 years.

None of his appeals were successful. That included arguing to the Utah Supreme Court after his 1999 sentencing that he was unfairly discriminated against because he is part of the Hopi tribe.

In the early appeal, he argued that the trial prosecutor acted improperly when he compared the value of Honie’s life to the value of Benn’s — and noted that Honie “did not murder a drunken Indian in the park” or someone who spent her life “drinking alcohol and puking and walking the streets and shoplifting” at Walmart.

“He murdered someone that these people look up to,” the prosecutor had argued. “He murdered a superstar in the Paiute community.”

But the state’s high court ruled that these statements likely didn’t influence the judge who ordered him to death. In his 1999 decision, that judge condemned the prosecutor’s statements and wrote that he would have decided the same “had the victim been ‘a drunken Indian in the park’ or a drunken white man in the park, or a sober doctor in his office, etc.”

“Each human life is of equal value,” the judge continued. “The murder of any victim under the circumstances of this case, no matter what that victim[’]s status, would have been just as painful, traumatic, and reprehensible, and would require the same punishment.”

Honie was the youngest man on Utah’s death row, and, at 25 years, he has spent the least amount of time awaiting his sentence. His legal team had pushed forward a flurry of appeals and lawsuits in his final days, but it didn’t change the outcome.

Those appeals included challenging the drugs the Department of Corrections was planning to use to execute him. Initially, prison officials planned to execute Honie with the never-before-used combination of ketamine, fentanyl and potassium chloride. This came at the recommendation of an unnamed pharmacist, according to court records, who advised Utah officials that the more commonly used death drug pentobarbital was not available.

But Honie sued over the three-drug combination, arguing that the novel concoction risked a torturous death in violation of Utah’s constitution, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. His attorneys offered in that lawsuit that pentobarbital would be a better alternative. It’s a proven death penalty drug that’s been used in 14 other states, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.

Prison officials eventually connected with a source for pentobarbital — a supplier which has been kept secret from the public — and they paid $200,000 for three doses of the death drug.

Taberon Honie is executed by lethal injection in Utah.,https://www.sltrib.com/news/2024/08/07/death-penalty-utah-will-execute/,"Update • Utah executes Taberon Honie by lethal injection

Taberon Honie visited with his parents and other family members throughout the day Wednesday in what were expected to be his final hours before his lethal injection execution later in the night.

His final meal, prison officials said, was a cheeseburger, fries and a milkshake — though Honie expressed to them that he wanted his last meal to be remembered as one he had recently shared with his family, said Glen Mills, who is the Department of Corrections communications director.

Honie’s mood throughout the day, Mills said, has been described by prison staff as “gracious and appreciative.”

The 48-year-old man has been in an observation cell since just after 6 a.m. on Wednesday, and Mills said he has mostly spent the day visiting with his family. He is expected to be executed just after midnight on Thursday — Utah’s first execution in 14 years.

Honie shared tearful final goodbyes with his family members before visiting ended at 9 p.m., Mills said. He listened to music on a tablet for a few minutes after his family left, Mills said, before talking with his legal team.

Honie is expected to sit alone in the observation cell for about 90 minutes before he is led into the death chamber. Mills said Honie will have that time to separate himself from the emotions surrounding seeing his family for the last time.

“It’s time to reflect on that,” he said. “To take it in and be on your own to think about what’s happening.”

Mills said Wednesday evening that since Honie’s attorneys left, he has spent his time lying on his bed, listening to music. He declined an offer to take the anxiety medication Valium, according to Mills.

Honie has been on death row for more than 25 years after he sexually assaulted and killed his ex-girlfriend’s mother, Claudia Benn, who was his own daughter’s grandmother, in 1998.

By 11:30 p.m., 25 to 30 protesters were in a designated free speech area about two miles from the Salt Lake City prison. Standing under police lights, being swarmed with mayflies, Janell Wilson of Layton said she doesn’t support the death penalty.

(Francisco Kjolseth | The Salt Lake Tribune) Janell Wilson of Layton joins the death penalty protest at a free speech zone outside the Utah State Correctional Facility in Salt Lake City, Wednesday, Aug. 7, 2024.

“I understand that this man did something very bad when he was young,” she said, “but in all reality I don’t think him killing one person warrants us to say we can kill him.”

An execution is a rare event in Utah. The last time the state executed a man was in 2010, when Ronnie Lee Gardner was killed by firing squad. Utah’s last lethal injection death was in 1999.

Gardner’s brother, Randy Gardner, was at the free speech zone Wednesday night. He said he has never supported the death penalty, and pointed out that South Carolina’s Supreme Court recently ruled that executions by firing squad (or lethal injection or the electric chair) are constitutional. He had hoped there would never be another firing squad in the U.S. after his brother’s execution, he said.

“I like being the one saying my brother was the last person executed by firing squad, but that could change,” he said. "" ... We shouldn’t be executing our own people.”

The prisons in Salt Lake City and Gunnison have both been locked down Wednesday until the completion of the execution, which is expected to begin shortly after midnight. The execution is happening at night, Mills said, to minimize disruptions to other inmates. The prisons are generally locked down nightly at 10 p.m., he added.

(Bethany Baker | The Salt Lake Tribune) Department of Corrections communications director Glen Mills speaks during a news conference ahead of the execution of Taberon Honie at the Utah State Correctional Facility in Salt Lake City on Aug. 7, 2024.

Members of the public who wanted to demonstrate about the death penalty or Honie’s execution — in support or opposition — were allowed to gather in the free speech area at 7800 West 700 North.

This will be the first execution at the new prison location, which opened in 2022.

A group of anti-death penalty advocates unsuccessfully challenged in 3rd District Court Wednesday the location of the free speech area. They argued in their request for an injunction that the zone is in a “completely uninhabited area,” away from residences, businesses and outside the view of the prison, which they contended violates their rights to free speech.

“It is impossible to see the prison from this location. Hence, it is impossible to be seen by anyone at the prison whether they be prison staff, guards, volunteers, inmates, or the general public,” the document states.

Judge Laura Scott denied the request Wednesday evening, saying attorney Tyler Ayers hadn’t properly filed the request and that she couldn’t determine from the “very limited information provided” whether the protest zone’s location “burdens substantially more speech than necessary.”

(Francisco Kjolseth | The Salt Lake Tribune) Rony Charles of Salt Lake City expresses his opposition to capital punishment at a free speech zone outside the Utah State Correctional Facility in Salt Lake City, Wednesday, Aug. 7, 2024.

The advocates had asked for an alternative protest area to be established closer to the prison, though still outside the facility’s gates. “In short, allowing the parties to demonstrate in this location creates an opportunity for free speech as opposed to eliminating all likelihood in the currently proposed Free Speech Zone,” the filing said.

Randy Gardner was one of the plaintiffs. “We should be able to be closer to the prison,” he said in the zone Wednesday night. At his brother’s execution, he said, protesters were allowed to gather across the street from the former prison in Draper.

Mills said the majority of the land near the prison is private property, limiting where officials could establish the free speech area. He also said the planned location was made public about two months ago.

“We understand and value the right to demonstrate both for and against the death penalty,” Mills said. “We found the closest and safest and most reasonable space to allow for protesters.”

Randy Gardner held a large sign that said, “All life is precious,” in the zone Wednesday night. SueZann Bosler, co-founder of Journey of Hope, held up the other side.

Bosler started advocating against the death penalty after she and her father were both assaulted by someone with a knife, she said. Her father died and she survived. She said it was his wish that his assailant not be executed, and it took her years to fully accept and share his belief.

Now she travels the country with other anti-death penalty advocates to protest capital punishment and, she hopes, eventually to help end it. ”I’m a victim survivor, that’s why I’m still here, is I’m going to abolish the death penalty,” she said.

She also took issue with the site of the free speech zone, saying she and other advocates held signs outside the prison on Tuesday. Why couldn’t they have returned there Wednesday night, she asked, also questioning the choice to execute Honie at midnight — “so that not as many people go (protest),” she said.

At the Capitol earlier Wednesday, about a dozen anti-death penalty advocates also called for an end to capital punishment in Utah. They said they collected thousands of signatures urging state leaders to halt all executions, including Honie’s planned lethal injection.

“The death penalty does nothing but repay suffering with suffering,” said the Rev. Kenneth Vialpando, the Catholic Diocese of Salt Lake City’s vicar for the clergy. “It does not provide justice, does not restore dignity, does not make us safer as a society.”

(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune) The Very Reverend Kenneth Vialpando from the Catholic Diocese of Salt Lake City speaks in opposition to the death penalty during a protest at the Capitol, on Wednesday, Aug. 7, 2024.

Vialpando was one of nearly 100 faith and community leaders who signed the petition, organizers said. A planned protest and vigil is expected in the free speech zone location beginning at about 11 p.m. Wednesday.

Randy Gardner also was one of the petitioners. He said at the afternoon protest that he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after his brother’s 2010 execution.

“That day is one that lives on forever,” he said Wednesday. “... Hopefully one day in the near future, Utah will step it up and end sanctioned murders.”

The letter that petitioners signed stated “we most certainly are not opposed to accountability for rightfully convicted persons.”

“However, we believe that the death penalty serves no moral purpose and executions are not necessary to keep society safe or to hold accountable those who have committed horrible crimes,” it continued.

In July 1998, Honie called his ex-girlfriend and demanded she visit him, threatening to kill her family if she refused. Later that evening, Honie took a cab to Benn’s home. He broke the door in with a rock and then Honie beat and bit her, slashed her throat, stabbed her genitals multiple times and had prepared to have anal sex with her before realizing she had died. Three children were in the home during the attack, including his daughter and a child that he also sexually assaulted that same evening.

A judge sentenced Honie to death in 1999, and he has been appealing that decision ever since — including several efforts in recent weeks where he asked Utah’s parole board for clemency and filed a lawsuit challenging the untested three-drug combination prison officials initially planned to use in his execution.

The parole board declined to commute his sentence. And prison officials changed course on the drugs, opting instead to pay $200,000 to obtain the nervous system depressant pentobarbital. That drug has been used in executions in other states, and acts as both the anesthetic to ensure that Honie does not feel pain and as the fatal drug that will kill him. A judge last week dismissed his lawsuit.

In a news release Wednesday, nonprofit Restoring Ancestral Winds honored Benn, who they said was a member of the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah. The tribal coalition works to address domestic violence and sexual assault in the Great Basin region of Utah, and in its statement, highlighted the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous relatives in the state.

“While Honie is scheduled for execution, the impact of his actions will continue to resonate deeply with those who knew and loved Claudia,” the release stated. “She was a beloved mother and grandmother and a beacon of strength and resilience in her community.”

The statement added that the children who witnessed the attack still bear “emotional and psychological scars” that continue to be a “painful reminder of the ongoing consequences of this tragic event.”

(Utah Department of Corrections) A table inside the execution chamber at the Utah State Correctional Facility. The execution of Utah death row inmate Taberon Honie is currently scheduled for Aug. 8, 2024.

Honie will be brought from the observation cell into the execution room and secured to a gurney. A team will then set up an IV line before curtains are opened for witnesses to observe the execution. Those witnesses will include reporters, law enforcement and possibly Utah’s attorney general, Honie’s chosen witnesses and possibly Benn’s close family members.

Honie will be given two minutes to say any last words before the execution begins. The execution team, according to prison protocols, should include at least two members who are either trained as a phlebotomist, emergency medical technician, paramedic or military corpsman.

Honie is one of seven men who have been sentenced to death in Utah and are currently in various stages of appealing their sentences. One man, Douglas Carter, had his death sentence vacated in 2022 after a judge found Provo police and prosecutors engaged in misconduct. Another man, Douglas Lovell, recently was granted a new sentencing hearing after the Utah Supreme Court ruled that religion had been improperly brought into his 2015 re-trial.

Taberon Honie is executed by lethal injection in Utah.,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/08/utah-lethal-injection,"A Utah man who killed his girlfriend’s mother by slashing her throat was put to death by lethal injection early on Thursday in the state’s first execution since 2010.

Taberon Dave Honie, 48, was convicted of aggravated murder in the July 1998 death of Claudia Benn, the maternal grandmother of his now 27-year-old daughter, Tressa.

Honie was pronounced dead at 12:25am local time in an execution that went as planned and took about 17 minutes. He tapped his foot and mouthed “I love you” to family members watching from a witness chamber after he was given the lethal injection of two doses of pentobarbital.

Honie was 22 when he broke into Benn’s house in Cedar City, the tribal headquarters of the Paiute Indian tribe of Utah, after a day of heavy drinking and drug use. He repeatedly slashed Benn’s throat and stabbed other parts of her body. The judge who sentenced him to death also found that Honie had sexually abused one of Benn’s other grandchildren who was in the house with a then two-year-old Tressa at the time of the murder.

Honie, who had grown up on the Hopi Indian reservation in Arizona, spent the evening with his daughter and other immediate family before the execution. He told Tressa earlier this week that he had come to terms with his fate and hoped she could too, she told the Associated Press.

After the medical team removed Honie’s body from the chamber, his family was allowed in to perform a Native American grieving ritual with bird feathers and cornmeal that they told officers would help free his soul after death.

Outside the prison, a group of anti-death penalty protesters sang Amazing Grace and held signs that said, “All life is precious.”

After decades of failed appeals, Honie’s execution warrant was signed in June despite defense objections to the planned lethal drug. In July, the state changed its execution protocol to using only a high dose of pentobarbital – the nervous system suppressant used to euthanize pets.

The Utah board of pardons and parole denied Honie’s petition to commute his sentence to life in prison after a July hearing during which Honie’s attorneys described his troubled childhood growing up on the reservation with parents who abused alcohol. He had started using hard drugs as a teenager and told the parole board he would not have killed Benn if he had been in his “right mind”. He asked the board to allow him “to exist” so he could be a support for his daughter.

Tressa Honie told the board she had a complicated relationship with her mother and would lose her most supportive parent if her father were to be executed. She said in an interview on Tuesday that she was not ready to lose her dad and felt abandoned by family on her mother’s side who had fought for his execution.

Benn’s close family argued that Taberon Honie deserved no mercy, and they said his execution was the justice they needed after decades of grief.

“He deserves an eye for an eye,” said Benn’s niece, Sarah China Azule.

She and her cousins described Benn as a pillar in their family and south-western Utah community. She was a Paiute tribal council member, substance abuse counselor and caregiver for her children and grandchildren.

Hours before Honie’s execution, a man described by his lawyers as intellectually disabled was executed in Texas for strangling and trying to rape a woman who went jogging near her Houston home more than 27 years ago."

Editor's note: KSL.com reporter Pat Reavy was one of seven reporters chosen to witness the execution of Taberon Dave Honie. It was the third execution he has witnessed.

SALT LAKE CITY — ""I love you all. Take care,"" Taberon Dave Honie said shortly before two doses of pentobarbital were injected into him.

Seventeen minutes later, a machine monitoring Honie's heart rate showed a flat line. Not long after that, at 12:25 a.m. Thursday, Honie was officially pronounced dead, becoming the eighth person executed by the state of Utah since 1977.

The death sentence for Honie, 48, was carried out by lethal injection for the July 9, 1998, murder of 49-year-old Claudia Marie Benn in Cedar City in front of her three granddaughters.

KSL.com was among the seven media witnesses to the execution. Four of Honie's family members and one of his lawyers were also chosen to be witnesses, while seven of Benn's relatives were expected to be there, though the Utah Department of Corrections says not all of them showed up. In addition, several current and former prosecutors and law enforcers from Iron Country witnessed the event as well as several state lawmakers.

Media witnesses gathered about 11:30 p.m. Wednesday and were loaded into a transport van to be driven a short distance to the Antelope facility, which houses maximum security male inmates and is where the execution chamber is located.

The 24 feet by 38 feet execution chamber had four small and separated rooms for each of the witness groups: media, Honie's relatives, Benn's relatives and government officials. Each room has a reflective window looking into the brightly lit chamber. Those inside the execution chamber could not see the witnesses.

After the witnesses were taken to their rooms, they waited as final preparations were made inside the chamber. When corrections officials were ready, they pulled back the curtains to each room.

Honie, wearing a bright orange prison jumpsuit and glasses and his hair in a ponytail, was already strapped down to a gurney with arms outstretched to each side and an IV in each arm. The tubes to his IVs ran through a slit in the wall behind his head to a back room where the people administrating the fatal drugs were never seen. Honie was also strapped down to the gurney at the ankles, right below his knees and at his thighs, according to corrections officials, although that could not be seen by witnesses because a white sheet covered him from the waist down.

Bart Mortensen, the warden of the Utah State Correctional Facility, and Randall Honey, the operations director at the prison, were in the room with Honie, standing on each side of him. After Mortensen read the execution warrant for Honie, he held a microphone up to him and asked if he had any last words.

""From the start it's been — if it needs to be done for them to heal, let's do this. If they tell you you can't change, don't listen to them. To all my brothers and sisters in here, continue to change. I love you all. Take care,"" he said in a clear and seemingly calm voice.

At 12:04 a.m. Thursday, the first dose of pentobarbital was given. From the beginning, Honie's right foot moved in a rapid motion, as if he was tapping his foot in the air. Even though corrections officials say Honie was cooperative throughout the entire evening, the foot twitching was likely due to nerves.

""He was nervous going in there, I mean, rightfully so,"" Honey said.

Not long after the lethal injection began, Honie lifted his head up and appeared to say something to the warden, although the microphone was turned off by that point.

""He simply stated, 'Thank you for taking care of my family,' And then he raised up his head and looked over to where his family was viewing and said, 'I love you,'"" Honey explained after the execution. His mother allegedly said ""I love you, son"" in return, according to witnesses.

After about 30 seconds of deep breaths, Honie's head laid back on the gurney for the final time. At 12:13 a.m., a second dose of pentobarbital was administered — something corrections officials say was pre-planned. For 17 minutes after the lethal injection process began, the color in Honie's body slowly faded away as his mouth remained open, his right hand stayed in a fist-like position, and his glasses slowly slid up his face. But he never moved again.

Honey kept checking the electrocardiogram, or EKG monitor, sitting on the gurney next to Honie's head. When it showed his heart had stopped, Honey and Mortensen pulled the white sheet over Honie's head so it now completely covered his body. The curtains for the witness rooms were then closed.

A medical person was brought into the room to confirm his death and made the pronouncement at 12:25 a.m.

Corrections officials then fulfilled one of Honie's wishes for a traditional Hopi death ritual. His father and a cousin were allowed to enter the room and used a few feathers and cornmeal in ""laying a path for the soul to leave the room.""

""According to their beliefs, the soul after their death could potentially get trapped … so they performed their ceremony to release the soul so that he can return back,"" Honey said.

A representative from the Utah State Medical Examiner's Office then took nearly an hour to document and remove Honie's body from the room. The room was then disinfected and the media was allowed inside the chamber where there was an almost overwhelming smell of cleaning chemicals.

SALT LAKE CITY — The state of Utah executed Taberon Dave Honie by lethal injection just after midnight Thursday, 25 years after he was convicted of brutally killing his ex-girlfriend's mother in front of her three granddaughters.

Corrections officials announced at 12:30 a.m. that the execution had successfully occurred.

At 12:03 a.m., Honie gave his final statement. ""From the start it's been — if it needs to be done for them to heal, let's do this. If they tell you you can't change, don't listen to them. To all my brothers and sisters here, continue to change. I love you all. Take care.""

Seven media witnesses representing local news organizations, including KSL.com, were present in the viewing chamber, and they held a 2 a.m. press conference to discuss the execution. By that time, about a couple dozen protesters had gone home. Every light in the prison parking lot attracted thick swarms of mosquitoes like chaotic snow falling in all directions.

The small insects coated the sidewalks and windows, stirring in circles on the ground.

About two dozen solemn protesters earlier held signs and some knelt in prayer about a mile away from the prison in a free speech area that the corrections department designated.

Ben Winslow from Fox 13 said when the curtain was drawn, the group saw Honie looking up, lifting his head. His arms were strapped to the table and IVs ran from both of his arms out of the room where unseen medical staff administered the drug.

""A white sheet was pulled up slightly above his stomach, below his chest,"" explained Sarah Murphy from ABC 4. ""You could see the rise and fall with every breath.""

Witness

'Continue to change,' Honie urges fellow inmates before being executed Taberon Dave Honie appeared ready, but nervous as he was executed by lethal injection early Thursday at the state prison. KSL.com was among media to witness the death.

The warden read the death warrant, Winslow said, while Honie's foot appeared to be twitching. ""We couldn't tell if it was out of nervousness or whether it was just a reaction that was happening."" The lethal injection began at 12:04, according to Utah Department of Corrections spokesman Glen Mills.

""He did continue to look around. He closed his eyes. His foot continued to tap and then stop,"" Winslow said. The reporters noticed Honie appeared to be mouthing something to Warden Bart Mortenson and director of prison operations Randall Honey.

Honey said the condemned man ""simply stated, 'Thank you for taking care of my family.' And then he raised up his head and looked over to where his family was viewing and just said, 'I love you.'""

Reporters reported seeing Honie take a ""deep exhaling breath and opened his mouth wide,"" his rapid breathing slowed very quickly and his skin ""turned pale, turned blue.""

KSL.com reporter Pat Reavy said the atmosphere among reporters was somber and quiet. ""You're watching a person die. It's not lost on you,"" he said, but added that reporters were in ""work mode"" and there to observe and accurately report how the state conducted the execution.

At 12:13 a.m., a second lethal dose was administered, though witnesses were not aware that had occurred until the press conference. Eight minutes later, the electrocardiogram flatlined, showing no heartbeat.

Mills said a sheet was placed over the Honie's head at that point, and he was pronounced dead at 12:25 a.m.

Honie, 48, spent much of Wednesday meeting with family members for the final time and told them to ""keep your heads up.""

According to staff members who witnessed Honie's final goodbyes, there were ""lots of emotions and tears,"" but he still managed to crack a few jokes, said Mills. He spent much of his last hours alone listening to music on a tablet provided to him.

Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes issued a prepared statement after the execution.

""The state of Utah approached the exercise of its power and attendant responsibilities with the seriousness and solemnity that such an act merits. We hope opponents of the death penalty allow grace for those who carried out their duties as required by the law and did so with respect, professionalism, and in some cases in spite of their own personal views. We also hope that this act is a deterrent to other heinous crimes and pray it provides some measure of comfort to those who have been awaiting justice for decades,"" he said.

Last day

From about 10 a.m. until 9 p.m. Wednesday, Honie met with family members who rotated two at a time for security purposes in seeing him, starting with his mother and father. He has also met with his daughter, three sisters, two cousins, a brother-in-law, and an aunt, Mills said. Honie and his visitors are separated by a window. Mills says for most of the day, Honie has been talking while sitting on the floor of his room, but by 8:22 p.m. he moved to his bed to sit on it. Family visits ended at 9 p.m.

Other visits had been with the warden at the prison, as well as four checkups by mental health workers. His mood had been described by corrections employees as ""gracious and appreciative"" throughout the day.

After visiting with his family, Honie listened to music on a tablet until his attorneys arrived, Mills said. Mills said according to staff members, the conversation was ""jovial."" After his attorneys left, Honie has ""just been on his bed with his tablet, listening to music,"" Mills said at 10:30 p.m. He was offered a Valium but declined. Honie was alone in the observation cell from about 10 p.m. until 11:30 p.m. when corrections staff members began prepping him for movement into the execution chamber.

Honie was moved from his regular prison cell to an observation cell adjacent to the execution chamber sometime about 6:10 a.m. Wednesday. Honie spoke on the phone with a spiritual adviser from the Hopi Reservation and mostly said prayers, Mills said.

The final meal that he requested — a cheeseburger, fries and a milkshake — was delivered about 4:30 p.m. However, Mills said Honie wanted administrators to convey to the public that he considered his final meal was one he had recently with his family at the prison.

Utah Department of Corrections Executive Director Brian Redd thanked members of the media for being present Wednesday and said he wants his department to be ""known as a transparent and accountable organization."" He discussed the challenges of setting up a free speech zone during the execution that balances prison security and the rights of people to express their opinions. One of the challenges, he said, is that most of the land surrounding the prison is private property and there are few roads leading in and out to the prison.

Honie, who has been on death row since 1999, was convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend's mother, 49-year-old Claudia Marie Benn, in front of her three granddaughters on July 9, 1998, in Cedar City.

It was the first execution at the new Utah State Correctional Facility, which officially opened in July 2022, and the first in the state in 14 years.

The prison was placed on lockdown in preparation for the execution Wednesday and remained locked down until 6 a.m. Thursday. Roadblocks were set up on all roads leading into the facility, located west of the Salt Lake City International Airport.

""We really want to put an emphasis on making sure we do this effectively, humanely and professionally,"" Mills said Wednesday evening.

Mills admits there had been a different feeling among officers and staff members at the prison this week knowing the execution was approaching.

""It's not something that anyone who's involved with this looks forward to or takes joy in, in any means. However, we all see that as a responsibility of ours in the department, and we take it seriously, and we intend to carry it out in a caring and professional manner,"" he said.

The execution chamber is 24 feet by 38 feet. There were separate witness rooms, both with reflective glass to protect the identity of witnesses. The windows are also bulletproof ""to protect the witnesses from unintended ricochet, if firing squad is used,"" according to the department.

According to the plan, after Honie was strapped to a gurney in the room, two people were to enter and insert an IV. Those two were set to leave the room and two other people would do the injection. Those people were to be in a separate room and would not be seen by any witnesses or Honie in order to protect their identities.

Utah set for first execution in 14 years; how did we get here? Taberon Dave Honie, convicted of aggravated murder for the 1998 death of his ex-girlfriend's mother, appealed his case over 26 years.

The two people chosen are ""trained in accordance with accepted medical practices to administer intravenous injections, who shall each administer a continuous intravenous injection, one of which shall be of a lethal quantity of sodium thiopental or other equally or more effective substance sufficient to cause death. Based on the recommendation of medical professionals, the drug being used will be pentobarbital,"" according to the Utah Department of Corrections.

Before the lethal injection begins, Honie was to be given the opportunity as he is strapped to the gurney to speak any last words. After the injection, a physician will be brought into the chamber to confirm his death.

While not revealing their identities, corrections officials say those participating in the lethal injection are not members of the Department of Health and Human Services or the Division of Correctional Health Services.

After he is pronounced deceased, Mills says the prison is allowing Honie's request for his family to be brought into the room and perform a brief spiritual ceremony before his body is removed. Likewise, he said the corrections administrators allowed him to have a pipe ceremony on Monday with a relative.

Utah's execution history: Honie would be state's 8th execution since 1977 Utah executed six people from 1977 to 2000 after the death penalty was reinstated. Only one person has been put to death since then. Taberon Honie is set to be executed Thursday.

Honie was allowed to choose up to five people who are either a religious representative, a friend or a relative to witness his execution. Mills says Honie has picked four family members and his attorney. The identities of the family members are expected to be revealed after the execution. Seven of Benn's relatives will also be witnessing the execution. Their identities will not be revealed until after it is concluded. Seven members of the media, all from Utah, were selected to be witnesses, including KSL.com.

Other witnesses will include law enforcers from Iron County, a prosecuting attorney from Iron County, a representative from the Utah Attorney General's Office and up to three corrections officials.

Honie's body will be turned over to the Utah State Medical Examiner's Office. Once their assessment is completed, Honie's remains will be dealt with based on his wishes, but those wishes were not disclosed.

Correction: Two people will be ready to administer pentobarbital. If one dose does not kill him, the second person will administer another dose. A previous version incorrectly stated the two would not know who was administering the pentobarbital."
Taberon Honie is executed by lethal injection in Utah.,https://wbznewsradio.iheart.com/content/2024-08-08-utah-executes-murderer-by-lethal-injection-for-first-time-since-2010/,"A Utah man, Taberon Dave Honie, 48, was executed by lethal injection early on Thursday (August 8), marking the state's first execution since 2010. Honie was convicted of the aggravated murder of Claudia Benn, his girlfriend's mother, in July 1998. The execution took place at 12:25 am local time and lasted approximately 17 minutes.

Honie was 22 when he broke into Benn's house in Cedar City, the tribal headquarters of the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah, after a day of heavy drinking and drug use. He repeatedly slashed Benn's throat and stabbed other parts of her body. The judge who sentenced him to death also found that Honie had sexually abused one of Benn's other grandchildren, who was in the house at the time of the murder.

Despite decades of failed appeals, Honie's execution warrant was signed in June. In July, the state changed its execution protocol to using only a high dose of pentobarbital, a nervous system suppressant used to euthanize pets. The Utah Board of Pardons and Parole denied Honie’s petition to commute his sentence to life in prison after a July hearing.

Outside the prison, a group of anti-death penalty protesters sang Amazing Grace and held signs that said, ""All life is precious."" After the execution, Honie's family was allowed to perform a Native American grieving ritual with bird feathers and cornmeal, which they believed would help free his soul after death.

Benn's close family argued that Honie deserved no mercy, and they said his execution was the justice they needed after decades of grief. Benn was a Paiute tribal council member, substance abuse counselor, and caregiver for her children and grandchildren."
Taberon Honie is executed by lethal injection in Utah.,https://www.deseret.com/utah/2024/08/08/protests-outside-utah-execution/,"From left, Deacon Mike Bulson, Michelle Beasley, of Sandy, and Father John Evans pray the Rosary with others during a gathering held in a free speech zone established by the Utah Department of Corrections near the Utah State Correctional Facility in Salt Lake City before the execution of Taberon Honie on Wednesday, Aug. 7, 2024.

A crowd of about 30 people gathered outside in the dark on a back road nearly two miles outside the Utah State Correctional Facility late Wednesday night. Beginning at 9 p.m. and going past midnight, the crowd — ranging from young children to the elderly — was protesting the execution of death row inmate Taberon Honie, who was executed by lethal injection shortly after midnight on Thursday.

Honie received the death sentence on May 20, 1999. He is one of six inmates on death row in Utah and was found guilty of murdering his ex-girlfriend’s mother, Claudia Benn, in July of 1998.

It is the first execution in the state of Utah since 2010, when Ronnie Lee Gardner was executed by firing squad. Now, 14 years later, his brother, Randy Gardner, stood with protesters Wednesday night to oppose Honie’s capital punishment.

“I’m here tonight because I don’t believe in capital punishment whatsoever,” Gardner told the Deseret News. “I think the state has no right in executing our own citizens.” He added that it’s a moral issue and quoted the moral imperative of the Sixth Commandment in the Bible, “Thou shalt not kill.”

Losing a family member to capital punishment is “definitely a club you don’t want to belong to,” Gardner said when asked what advice he would give to the Honie family as they go through this experience. “It’s a terrible thing to go through.” After his brother’s death, he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.

“I probably had it from Day 1 (after Ronnie died). I thought I was really tough and could fight it off — I didn’t. I finally had to seek out help and had to go to therapy for a couple years just to get rid of the dreams and the nightmares. ... It’s a terrible thing. It’s so close to my heart, matter of fact, it’s close to my brother’s heart.”

Gardner is on the advisory committee of Death Penalty Action, a nonprofit organization trying to abolish the death penalty in America, and a member of Journey of Hope from Violence to Healing.

Religious leaders advocate for compassion before execution

About 30 minutes before the execution, Deacon Mike Bulson of the Catholic Diocese of Salt Lake City led the crowd in the Hail Mary Prayer.

“Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death.”

Father John Evans, vicar general and moderator of the Curia for the Diocese of Salt Lake City, held a poster in his hand that read, “Life is precious.” He told the Deseret News that to keep society safe, rather than killing criminals, we should be granting them “restorative justice.”

“The criminals have to pay their debt to society, as it’s so commonly said, but they also have to live with the mistakes they’ve made, and hopefully move to wanting forgiveness, wanting healing, not just for them, but for the victims and their families,” Father Evans said. “So there’s a hope that we can do better here and work for that as a society and not just be punitive.”

He added that capital punishment is like returning evil for evil.

“The whole idea that people want the death penalty (because) it’s out of vengeance, sometimes it’s out of a woundedness, but it doesn’t bring healing.”

Michelle Beasley, a parishioner at Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church in Salt Lake City, has been volunteering at Catholic services in prisons and jails for nearly 10 years. She said she helps with gospel lessons and communion with the inmates centered around Christ.

“There are so many times in that chapel that those men and women will say that that’s where they find peace. That’s the one time out of the week where they find joy and acceptance and love and that’s why they keep coming back,” and the reason Beasley said she continues to go after so many years.

“We all screw up, and they’re human,” she said. “They just want to be loved and accepted and forgiven. ... If they’re guilty, they have to still face the consequences. But death should not be one of them.”"
Taberon Honie is executed by lethal injection in Utah.,https://www.dailyworld.com/story/news/nation/2024/08/08/taberon-dave-honie-utah-execution/74697293007/,"Utah executed a death row inmate for the 1998 murder of his then-girlfriend's mother on Thursday, the 12th execution in the nation this year and the state's first since a firing squad execution in 2010.

Taberon Dave Honie, 48, was executed by lethal injection and pronounced dead on Thursday, at 12:25 a.m. Mountain Time, according to the Utah Department of Corrections. Honie's execution came nearly seven hours after Texas executed Arthur Lee Burton on Wednesday for the murder of Nancy Adleman, a 48-year-old mother of three who was out on a jog in Houston in 1997.

Honie was convicted for the murder of 49-year-old Claudia Benn, a substance abuse counselor for Utah's Paiute Tribe and a devoted grandmother of three.

Benita Yracheta, Benn's daughter, told USA TODAY on Monday that she feels relief that she can put her mother's brutal death behind her, saying that justice is ""finally happening"" and at least Honie could prepare for the day.

""My mom, she never knew her death date,"" she said. ""She didn’t know she was gonna die that night.""

Here's what to know about the execution, the case, and the victim.

Taberon Dave Honie's last meal, moments with family

The Utah Department of Corrections hosted a press conference livestream, providing hourly updates on Honie. Honie spent most of the day visiting with family members, including his daughter and parents, who had been with him since 10 a.m., according to corrections spokesperson Glenn Mills.

He ate two hot meals over the course of the day, including a breakfast sandwich. His last meal was a cheeseburger, fries, and a milkshake.

Honie underwent multiple mental health checks over the course of the day, with a corrections team reporting that Honie was ""gracious and appreciative"" throughout, Mills said. One of Honie's attorneys had access to a phone in case they had a concern with the execution procedure.

The corrections team ran through the procedure over a handful times to ensure that they had ""everything down.""

Honie's last words

Honie spoke his last words at 12:03 a.m.,reminding others that change is possible.

“From the start it's been, if it needs to be done for them to heal, let's do this,"" said Honie. ""If they tell you you can't change, don't listen to them. To all my brothers and sisters in here, continue to change. I love you all. Take care.""

What happened during the execution?

Media witnesses said when the execution started, it was like watching someone fall asleep.

When a curtain was pulled back in the execution room, Honie was looking up, had an IV in both arms, which were strapped down to a table, said media witness Ben Winslow, a reporter from Fox 13, at a press conference.

Before Honie gave his final words, the warden read the death warrant to him.

Honie looked around the room and began tapping his foot. The witnesses said they weren't sure it was out of nervousness or ""just a reaction to what was happening.""

He mouthed something to the warden and the director of operations, but witnesses could not hear what he said and then he lifted his head again and took in a ""deep exhaling breath and opened his mouth wide.""

His breathing then began to accelerate before slowing down. His skin then turned pale and blue, then shortly after, he was pronounced dead.

Differences between lethal injection and firing squad

There isn't ""much similarity at all"" between Honie's execution and Ronnie Lee Gardner's execution by firing squad in 2010, said Pat Reavy, a reporter with KSL.com who witnessed both executions, at the press conference.

""I guess there's a peaceful way to put someone to death,"" said Reavy about Honie's execution ""That's what this was.""

Reavy described the firing squad execution as more traumatic.

""The firing squad execution I thought was much more violent,"" said Reavy. ""It shakes you, it's just so loud.""

While Honie's execution took longer, he adds that it really was ""like watching a person fall asleep and not wake up again.""

'He was worthy of redemption'

""We are saddened that despite this change, the State of Utah did not grant him mercy,"" said his attorneys, Therese Day and Eric Zuckerman, in a statement. ""Mr. Honie’s life had value—he was worthy of redemption, and not being judged solely by his worst actions.""

His attorneys said he wasn't the same person he was 26 years ago.

""Honie always accepted responsibility for his crimes and expressed deep remorse for his actions, which were committed while he was extremely intoxicated from drugs and alcohol,"" ""Over the past 25 years, Mr. Honie worked on himself to become a better person""

Utah Attorney General releases statement

Utah's Attorney General Sean D. Reyes released a statement addressing Honie's execution and the ""deeply held beliefs, powerful emotions and divergent views regarding the death penalty.""

""Death by execution is one of the most extreme uses of government power,"" said Reyes. ""Many would argue it is ineffective, improper and beyond the authority of man to exercise. Many would disagree.""

""But there is no dispute that the violent and unprovoked taking of innocent lives from fellow human beings is among the crimes deemed by society to be most vile, repugnant and punishable by the harshest measures possible. In states like Utah, that includes the death penalty.""

Claudia Benn murdered at home while babysitting

Benn was babysitting her three granddaughters on July 9, 1998. Her daughter, Carol Pikyavit, had been living with Benn along with her 2-year-old daughter, whom she shared with Honie, when Honie called.

He was drunk and angry, and at one point, threatened to kill everyone in the home and take their daughter if Pikyavit didn't make time to see him, court records say.

Not taking the threat seriously, Pikyavit left the home and headed to work.

Honie headed to the house and began arguing with Benn. Honie told police that Benn started the fight and was calling him names through a sliding glass door before he snapped, broke through the door and went inside.

Benn had grabbed a butcher knife but was overpowered by Honie, who grabbed the knife and brought it to her throat, court records say. Honie says the two of them both tripped while the knife was at Benn’s throat and that she fell on the blade.

Police said Benn was found face down in the living room, with numerous “stabbing and cutting wounds” to her neck and genitals, according to court documents. Honie confessed to the murder, telling police that same night he had “stabbed and killed her with a knife,” USA TODAY reported.

All three grandchildren were found at the home with varying degrees of blood on their clothes and body. There was also evidence that one of Benn’s granddaughters was sexually abused at some point, court documents say.

Honie was arrested, charged and convicted of aggravated murder.

Victim's family looks to execution for closure

Betsy China, Benn's cousin, told USA TODAY on Monday that she wants Benn to be remembered as someone ""who helped our people."" Coping hasn't been easy for China, as she frequently looked to Benn for guidance in life. Benn always encouraged China, like a coach or sister would, advising her in difficult times.

“There was a big gap there in leadership within the family” after Benn’s death that remains to this day, China said.

Right now, what she’s focused on is “trying to be here and finish this out,” remembering her cousin in a good way and knowing that justice was served on Thursday.

Yracheta feels similarly, still working to untangle her mother's memory from what happened that night, saying whenever that happens, she tries to “to go to the good memories I have with her.""

“I miss her a lot. And every time I think of her, I think of the house and whatnot,” Yracheta said.

Those “good memories” include an impromptu dance party with impersonators for The Supremes at the Utah State Fair or how her mom worked to put herself through college after she divorced her husband and left Kaibab, Arizona, and moved the family to Utah.

Yracheta and other family members traveled to Salt Lake to witness the execution, hoping to put the past behind them."

Taberon Honie is executed by lethal injection in Utah.,https://www.stargazette.com/story/news/nation/2024/08/08/taberon-dave-honie-utah-execution/74697293007/,"Utah executed a death row inmate for the 1998 murder of his then-girlfriend's mother on Thursday, the 12th execution in the nation this year and the state's first since a firing squad execution in 2010.

Taberon Dave Honie, 48, was executed by lethal injection and pronounced dead on Thursday, at 12:25 a.m. Mountain Time, according to the Utah Department of Corrections. Honie's execution came nearly seven hours after Texas executed Arthur Lee Burton on Wednesday for the murder of Nancy Adleman, a 48-year-old mother of three who was out on a jog in Houston in 1997.

Honie was convicted for the murder of 49-year-old Claudia Benn, a substance abuse counselor for Utah's Paiute Tribe and a devoted grandmother of three.

Benita Yracheta, Benn's daughter, told USA TODAY on Monday that she feels relief that she can put her mother's brutal death behind her, saying that justice is ""finally happening"" and at least Honie could prepare for the day.

""My mom, she never knew her death date,"" she said. ""She didn’t know she was gonna die that night.""

Here's what to know about the execution, the case, and the victim.

Taberon Dave Honie's last meal, moments with family

The Utah Department of Corrections hosted a press conference livestream, providing hourly updates on Honie. Honie spent most of the day visiting with family members, including his daughter and parents, who had been with him since 10 a.m., according to corrections spokesperson Glenn Mills.

He ate two hot meals over the course of the day, including a breakfast sandwich. His last meal was a cheeseburger, fries, and a milkshake.

Honie underwent multiple mental health checks over the course of the day, with a corrections team reporting that Honie was ""gracious and appreciative"" throughout, Mills said. One of Honie's attorneys had access to a phone in case they had a concern with the execution procedure.

The corrections team ran through the procedure over a handful times to ensure that they had ""everything down.""

Honie's last words

Honie spoke his last words at 12:03 a.m.,reminding others that change is possible.

“From the start it's been, if it needs to be done for them to heal, let's do this,"" said Honie. ""If they tell you you can't change, don't listen to them. To all my brothers and sisters in here, continue to change. I love you all. Take care.""

What happened during the execution?

Media witnesses said when the execution started, it was like watching someone fall asleep.

When a curtain was pulled back in the execution room, Honie was looking up, had an IV in both arms, which were strapped down to a table, said media witness Ben Winslow, a reporter from Fox 13, at a press conference.

Before Honie gave his final words, the warden read the death warrant to him.

Honie looked around the room and began tapping his foot. The witnesses said they weren't sure it was out of nervousness or ""just a reaction to what was happening.""

He mouthed something to the warden and the director of operations, but witnesses could not hear what he said and then he lifted his head again and took in a ""deep exhaling breath and opened his mouth wide.""

His breathing then began to accelerate before slowing down. His skin then turned pale and blue, then shortly after, he was pronounced dead.

Differences between lethal injection and firing squad

There isn't ""much similarity at all"" between Honie's execution and Ronnie Lee Gardner's execution by firing squad in 2010, said Pat Reavy, a reporter with KSL.com who witnessed both executions, at the press conference.

""I guess there's a peaceful way to put someone to death,"" said Reavy about Honie's execution ""That's what this was.""

Reavy described the firing squad execution as more traumatic.

""The firing squad execution I thought was much more violent,"" said Reavy. ""It shakes you, it's just so loud.""

While Honie's execution took longer, he adds that it really was ""like watching a person fall asleep and not wake up again.""

'He was worthy of redemption'

""We are saddened that despite this change, the State of Utah did not grant him mercy,"" said his attorneys, Therese Day and Eric Zuckerman, in a statement. ""Mr. Honie’s life had value—he was worthy of redemption, and not being judged solely by his worst actions.""

His attorneys said he wasn't the same person he was 26 years ago.

""Honie always accepted responsibility for his crimes and expressed deep remorse for his actions, which were committed while he was extremely intoxicated from drugs and alcohol,"" ""Over the past 25 years, Mr. Honie worked on himself to become a better person""

Utah Attorney General releases statement

Utah's Attorney General Sean D. Reyes released a statement addressing Honie's execution and the ""deeply held beliefs, powerful emotions and divergent views regarding the death penalty.""

""Death by execution is one of the most extreme uses of government power,"" said Reyes. ""Many would argue it is ineffective, improper and beyond the authority of man to exercise. Many would disagree.""

""But there is no dispute that the violent and unprovoked taking of innocent lives from fellow human beings is among the crimes deemed by society to be most vile, repugnant and punishable by the harshest measures possible. In states like Utah, that includes the death penalty.""

Claudia Benn murdered at home while babysitting

Benn was babysitting her three granddaughters on July 9, 1998. Her daughter, Carol Pikyavit, had been living with Benn along with her 2-year-old daughter, whom she shared with Honie, when Honie called.

He was drunk and angry, and at one point, threatened to kill everyone in the home and take their daughter if Pikyavit didn't make time to see him, court records say.

Not taking the threat seriously, Pikyavit left the home and headed to work.

Honie headed to the house and began arguing with Benn. Honie told police that Benn started the fight and was calling him names through a sliding glass door before he snapped, broke through the door and went inside.

Benn had grabbed a butcher knife but was overpowered by Honie, who grabbed the knife and brought it to her throat, court records say. Honie says the two of them both tripped while the knife was at Benn’s throat and that she fell on the blade.

Police said Benn was found face down in the living room, with numerous “stabbing and cutting wounds” to her neck and genitals, according to court documents. Honie confessed to the murder, telling police that same night he had “stabbed and killed her with a knife,” USA TODAY reported.

All three grandchildren were found at the home with varying degrees of blood on their clothes and body. There was also evidence that one of Benn’s granddaughters was sexually abused at some point, court documents say.

Honie was arrested, charged and convicted of aggravated murder.

Victim's family looks to execution for closure

Betsy China, Benn's cousin, told USA TODAY on Monday that she wants Benn to be remembered as someone ""who helped our people."" Coping hasn't been easy for China, as she frequently looked to Benn for guidance in life. Benn always encouraged China, like a coach or sister would, advising her in difficult times.

“There was a big gap there in leadership within the family” after Benn’s death that remains to this day, China said.

Right now, what she’s focused on is “trying to be here and finish this out,” remembering her cousin in a good way and knowing that justice was served on Thursday.

Yracheta feels similarly, still working to untangle her mother's memory from what happened that night, saying whenever that happens, she tries to “to go to the good memories I have with her.""

Utah has now ended its decade-long execution hiatus after an inmate was put to death for the murder of his ex-girlfriend’s mother.

Taberon Dave Honie died by lethal injection early on Thursday morning at the Utah State Correctional Facility in Salt Lake City.

In his final words, the 48-year-old said: “If it needs to be done for them to heal, let’s do this.”

“If they tell you you can’t change, don’t listen to them. To all my brothers and sisters in here, continue to change. I love you all. Take care.”

When the executioner then administered two doses of the lethal drug pentobarbital, Honie reportedly tapped his foot and mouthed “I love you” to his family members who were watching from the witness chamber.

Warden Bart Mortensen told reporters that Honie also turned and thanked correctional officers for taking care of his family before he lost consciousness.

It took about 17 minutes for him to die.

Honie – who grew up on the Hopi Indian Reservation in Arizona – spent his last evening with his daughter Tressa, who said she felt caught between her mother’s family mourning her grandmother and her own grief for her father.

“I feel like I have to heal alone”, she explained in an interview.

For his last meal, Honie then requested a cheeseburger, french fries and a milkshake.

Taberon Dave Honie’s execution was Utah’s first since 2010 ( Associated Press )

His family was given permission to perform a Native American grieving ritual to help free his soul following the removal of his body.

He had been on death row for 25 years after his 1999 conviction for the brutal murder of Claudia Benn in July 1998.

After a day of heavy drinking, the then-22-year-old broke into Benn’s home in Cedar City before slashing her throat and stabbing other parts of her body.

He was also found to have sexually abused one of Benn’s two grandchildren – one of them aged just two years old – who were both in the house at the time.

In July, Honie’s attorneys unsuccessfully petitioned the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole to commute his sentence to life in prison.

The legal team described Honie’s troubled childhood growing up with parents who abused alcohol and asked that he be allowed “to exist” so he could support his own daughter. The bid was denied.

As well as being the first since 2010, Honie’s execution was also Utah’s eighth since 1976, when the Supreme Court ruled capital punishment legal in the US.

The last inmate put to death in the state was Ronnie Lee Gardner who chose to be executed by firing squad – the first time the method was used in the US in 14 years. Gardner was shot by a team of five marksmen using .30 calibre rifles.

Douglas Lovell was on death row until July when the Utah Supreme Court overturned his death sentence ( Associated Press )

Although Utah had adopted lethal injection as the default execution method in 2004, Gardner retained the right to choose the controversial method as he was sentenced before a change in law.

According to the Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC), no other executions are currently scheduled for Utah. There are now five remaining inmates on death row in the state, after Utah’s Supreme Court overturned Douglas Lovell’s death sentence last month.

Lovell was twice convicted for murdering Joyce Yost in 1985 to prevent her from testifying against him on charges that he raped her. Lovell’s death sentence was overturned after he argued his lawyers “rendered ineffective assistance” when they failed to object or respond to testimony from bishops of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who volunteered at the prison.

A 2020 poll found 64 per cent of people in Utah supported the death penalty – 10 per cent higher than the national average, KUTV reported.

Honie’s execution marked the second in the US this week, after Arthur Lee Burton was put to death on Wednesday in Texas for the murder of mother-of-three Nancy Adleman in 1997."

The Utah Department of Corrections hosted a press conference livestream, providing hourly updates on Honie. Honie spent most of the day visiting with family members, including his daughter and parents, who had been with him since 10 a.m., according to corrections spokesperson Glenn Mills.

He ate two hot meals over the course of the day, including a breakfast sandwich. His last meal was a cheeseburger, fries, and a milkshake.

Honie underwent multiple mental health checks over the course of the day, with a corrections team reporting that Honie was ""gracious and appreciative"" throughout, Mills said. One of Honie's attorneys had access to a phone in case they had a concern with the execution procedure.

The corrections team ran through the procedure over a handful times to ensure that they had ""everything down.""

Honie's last words

Honie spoke his last words at 12:03 a.m.,reminding others that change is possible.

“From the start it's been, if it needs to be done for them to heal, let's do this,"" said Honie. ""If they tell you you can't change, don't listen to them. To all my brothers and sisters in here, continue to change. I love you all. Take care.""

What happened during the execution?

Media witnesses said when the execution started, it was like watching someone fall asleep.

When a curtain was pulled back in the execution room, Honie was looking up, had an IV in both arms, which were strapped down to a table, said media witness Ben Winslow, a reporter from Fox 13, at a press conference.

Before Honie gave his final words, the warden read the death warrant to him.

Honie looked around the room and began tapping his foot. The witnesses said they weren't sure it was out of nervousness or ""just a reaction to what was happening.""

He mouthed something to the warden and the director of operations, but witnesses could not hear what he said and then he lifted his head again and took in a ""deep exhaling breath and opened his mouth wide.""

His breathing then began to accelerate before slowing down. His skin then turned pale and blue, then shortly after, he was pronounced dead.

Differences between lethal injection and firing squad

There isn't ""much similarity at all"" between Honie's execution and Ronnie Lee Gardner's execution by firing squad in 2010, said Pat Reavy, a reporter with KSL.com who witnessed both executions, at the press conference.

""I guess there's a peaceful way to put someone to death,"" said Reavy about Honie's execution ""That's what this was.""

Reavy described the firing squad execution as more traumatic.

""The firing squad execution I thought was much more violent,"" said Reavy. ""It shakes you, it's just so loud.""

While Honie's execution took longer, he adds that it really was ""like watching a person fall asleep and not wake up again.""

'He was worthy of redemption'

""We are saddened that despite this change, the State of Utah did not grant him mercy,"" said his attorneys, Therese Day and Eric Zuckerman, in a statement. ""Mr. Honie’s life had value—he was worthy of redemption, and not being judged solely by his worst actions.""

His attorneys said he wasn't the same person he was 26 years ago.

""Honie always accepted responsibility for his crimes and expressed deep remorse for his actions, which were committed while he was extremely intoxicated from drugs and alcohol,"" ""Over the past 25 years, Mr. Honie worked on himself to become a better person""

Utah Attorney General releases statement

Utah's Attorney General Sean D. Reyes released a statement addressing Honie's execution and the ""deeply held beliefs, powerful emotions and divergent views regarding the death penalty.""

""Death by execution is one of the most extreme uses of government power,"" said Reyes. ""Many would argue it is ineffective, improper and beyond the authority of man to exercise. Many would disagree.""

""But there is no dispute that the violent and unprovoked taking of innocent lives from fellow human beings is among the crimes deemed by society to be most vile, repugnant and punishable by the harshest measures possible. In states like Utah, that includes the death penalty.""

Claudia Benn murdered at home while babysitting

Benn was babysitting her three granddaughters on July 9, 1998. Her daughter, Carol Pikyavit, had been living with Benn along with her 2-year-old daughter, whom she shared with Honie, when Honie called.

He was drunk and angry, and at one point, threatened to kill everyone in the home and take their daughter if Pikyavit didn't make time to see him, court records say.

Not taking the threat seriously, Pikyavit left the home and headed to work.

Honie headed to the house and began arguing with Benn. Honie told police that Benn started the fight and was calling him names through a sliding glass door before he snapped, broke through the door and went inside.

Benn had grabbed a butcher knife but was overpowered by Honie, who grabbed the knife and brought it to her throat, court records say. Honie says the two of them both tripped while the knife was at Benn’s throat and that she fell on the blade.

Police said Benn was found face down in the living room, with numerous “stabbing and cutting wounds” to her neck and genitals, according to court documents. Honie confessed to the murder, telling police that same night he had “stabbed and killed her with a knife,” USA TODAY reported.

All three grandchildren were found at the home with varying degrees of blood on their clothes and body. There was also evidence that one of Benn’s granddaughters was sexually abused at some point, court documents say.

Honie was arrested, charged and convicted of aggravated murder.

Victim's family looks to execution for closure

Betsy China, Benn's cousin, told USA TODAY on Monday that she wants Benn to be remembered as someone ""who helped our people."" Coping hasn't been easy for China, as she frequently looked to Benn for guidance in life. Benn always encouraged China, like a coach or sister would, advising her in difficult times.

“There was a big gap there in leadership within the family” after Benn’s death that remains to this day, China said.

Right now, what she’s focused on is “trying to be here and finish this out,” remembering her cousin in a good way and knowing that justice was served on Thursday.

Yracheta feels similarly, still working to untangle her mother's memory from what happened that night, saying whenever that happens, she tries to “to go to the good memories I have with her.""

“I miss her a lot. And every time I think of her, I think of the house and whatnot,” Yracheta said.

Those “good memories” include an impromptu dance party with impersonators for The Supremes at the Utah State Fair or how her mom worked to put herself through college after she divorced her husband and left Kaibab, Arizona, and moved the family to Utah.

Yracheta and other family members traveled to Salt Lake to witness the execution, hoping to put the past behind them."
Taberon Honie is executed by lethal injection in Utah.,https://www.ithacajournal.com/story/news/nation/2024/08/08/taberon-dave-honie-utah-execution/74697293007/,"Utah executed a death row inmate for the 1998 murder of his then-girlfriend's mother on Thursday, the 12th execution in the nation this year and the state's first since a firing squad execution in 2010.

Taberon Dave Honie, 48, was executed by lethal injection and pronounced dead on Thursday, at 12:25 a.m. Mountain Time, according to the Utah Department of Corrections. Honie's execution came nearly seven hours after Texas executed Arthur Lee Burton on Wednesday for the murder of Nancy Adleman, a 48-year-old mother of three who was out on a jog in Houston in 1997.

Honie was convicted for the murder of 49-year-old Claudia Benn, a substance abuse counselor for Utah's Paiute Tribe and a devoted grandmother of three.

Benita Yracheta, Benn's daughter, told USA TODAY on Monday that she feels relief that she can put her mother's brutal death behind her, saying that justice is ""finally happening"" and at least Honie could prepare for the day.

""My mom, she never knew her death date,"" she said. ""She didn’t know she was gonna die that night.""

Here's what to know about the execution, the case, and the victim.

Taberon Dave Honie's last meal, moments with family

The Utah Department of Corrections hosted a press conference livestream, providing hourly updates on Honie. Honie spent most of the day visiting with family members, including his daughter and parents, who had been with him since 10 a.m., according to corrections spokesperson Glenn Mills.

He ate two hot meals over the course of the day, including a breakfast sandwich. His last meal was a cheeseburger, fries, and a milkshake.

Honie underwent multiple mental health checks over the course of the day, with a corrections team reporting that Honie was ""gracious and appreciative"" throughout, Mills said. One of Honie's attorneys had access to a phone in case they had a concern with the execution procedure.

The corrections team ran through the procedure over a handful times to ensure that they had ""everything down.""

Honie's last words

Honie spoke his last words at 12:03 a.m.,reminding others that change is possible.

“From the start it's been, if it needs to be done for them to heal, let's do this,"" said Honie. ""If they tell you you can't change, don't listen to them. To all my brothers and sisters in here, continue to change. I love you all. Take care.""

What happened during the execution?

Media witnesses said when the execution started, it was like watching someone fall asleep.

When a curtain was pulled back in the execution room, Honie was looking up, had an IV in both arms, which were strapped down to a table, said media witness Ben Winslow, a reporter from Fox 13, at a press conference.

Before Honie gave his final words, the warden read the death warrant to him.

Honie looked around the room and began tapping his foot. The witnesses said they weren't sure it was out of nervousness or ""just a reaction to what was happening.""

He mouthed something to the warden and the director of operations, but witnesses could not hear what he said and then he lifted his head again and took in a ""deep exhaling breath and opened his mouth wide.""

His breathing then began to accelerate before slowing down. His skin then turned pale and blue, then shortly after, he was pronounced dead.

Differences between lethal injection and firing squad

There isn't ""much similarity at all"" between Honie's execution and Ronnie Lee Gardner's execution by firing squad in 2010, said Pat Reavy, a reporter with KSL.com who witnessed both executions, at the press conference.

""I guess there's a peaceful way to put someone to death,"" said Reavy about Honie's execution ""That's what this was.""

Reavy described the firing squad execution as more traumatic.

""Death by execution is one of the most extreme uses of government power,"" said Reyes. ""Many would argue it is ineffective, improper and beyond the authority of man to exercise. Many would disagree.""

Claudia Benn murdered at home while babysitting

Benn was babysitting her three granddaughters on July 9, 1998. Her daughter, Carol Pikyavit, had been living with Benn along with her 2-year-old daughter, whom she shared with Honie, when Honie called.

He was drunk and angry, and at one point, threatened to kill everyone in the home and take their daughter if Pikyavit didn't make time to see him, court records say.

Not taking the threat seriously, Pikyavit left the home and headed to work.

Honie headed to the house and began arguing with Benn. Honie told police that Benn started the fight and was calling him names through a sliding glass door before he snapped, broke through the door and went inside.

Benn had grabbed a butcher knife but was overpowered by Honie, who grabbed the knife and brought it to her throat, court records say. Honie says the two of them both tripped while the knife was at Benn’s throat and that she fell on the blade.

Police said Benn was found face down in the living room, with numerous “stabbing and cutting wounds” to her neck and genitals, according to court documents. Honie confessed to the murder, telling police that same night he had “stabbed and killed her with a knife,” USA TODAY reported.

All three grandchildren were found at the home with varying degrees of blood on their clothes and body. There was also evidence that one of Benn’s granddaughters was sexually abused at some point, court documents say.

Honie was arrested, charged and convicted of aggravated murder.

Victim's family looks to execution for closure

Betsy China, Benn's cousin, told USA TODAY on Monday that she wants Benn to be remembered as someone ""who helped our people."" Coping hasn't been easy for China, as she frequently looked to Benn for guidance in life. Benn always encouraged China, like a coach or sister would, advising her in difficult times.

“There was a big gap there in leadership within the family” after Benn’s death that remains to this day, China said.

Right now, what she’s focused on is “trying to be here and finish this out,” remembering her cousin in a good way and knowing that justice was served on Thursday.

Yracheta feels similarly, still working to untangle her mother's memory from what happened that night, saying whenever that happens, she tries to “to go to the good memories I have with her.""

“I miss her a lot. And every time I think of her, I think of the house and whatnot,” Yracheta said.

Those “good memories” include an impromptu dance party with impersonators for The Supremes at the Utah State Fair or how her mom worked to put herself through college after she divorced her husband and left Kaibab, Arizona, and moved the family to Utah.

Taberon Honie is executed by lethal injection in Utah.,https://www.knopnews2.com/2024/08/08/man-who-killed-girlfriends-mother-put-death-utahs-first-execution-since-2010/,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - A Utah man who killed his girlfriend’s mother by slashing her throat was put to death by lethal injection early Thursday in the state’s first execution since 2010.

Taberon Dave Honie, 48, was convicted of aggravated murder in the July 1998 death of Claudia Benn, the maternal grandmother of his now 27-year-old daughter, Tressa.

Honie was pronounced dead at 12:25 a.m. Mountain Time in an execution that went as planned and took about 17 minutes. He tapped his foot and mouthed “I love you” to family members watching from a witness chamber after he was given the lethal injection of two doses of pentobarbital.

Strapped to the execution table in a sterile white room at the state prison, Honie turned his head to thank correctional officers for taking care of his family before he lost consciousness, warden Bart Mortensen told reporters after the execution.

Honie let out a gasp as the drug flowed through IVs in both arms, and his torso jolted off the table. He then laid still for several minutes before he died, turning a pale shade of blue as his glasses slid back on his forehead.

His final words were, “From the start it’s been, if it needs to be done for them to heal, let’s do this. If they tell you you can’t change, don’t listen to them. To all my brothers and sisters in here, continue to change. I love you all. Take care.”

Honie was 22 when he broke into Benn’s house in Cedar City, the tribal headquarters of the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah, after a day of heavy drinking and drug use. He repeatedly slashed Benn’s throat and stabbed other parts of her body. The judge who sentenced him to death also found that Honie had sexually abused one of Benn’s other grandchildren who was in the house with a then 2-year-old Tressa at the time of the murder.

Honie, who had grown up on the Hopi Indian Reservation in Arizona, spent the evening with his daughter and other immediate family before the execution. He told Tressa earlier this week that he had come to terms with his fate and hoped she could too, she told The Associated Press. His last meal was a cheeseburger, french fries and a milkshake, the Utah Department of Corrections said.

After the medical team removed Honie’s body from the chamber, his family was allowed in to perform a Native American grieving ritual with bird feathers and cornmeal that they told officers would help free his soul after death.

Outside the prison, a group of anti-death penalty protesters sang “Amazing Grace” and held signs that said, “All life is precious.”

After decades of failed appeals, Honie’s execution warrant was signed in June despite defense objections to the planned lethal drug. In July, the state changed its execution protocol to using only a high dose of pentobarbital — the nervous system suppressant used to euthanize pets.

The Utah Board of Pardons and Parole denied Honie’s petition to commute his sentence to life in prison after a July hearing during which Honie’s attorneys described his troubled childhood growing up on the reservation with parents who abused alcohol. He had started using hard drugs as a teenager and told the parole board he wouldn’t have killed Benn if he had been in his “right mind.” He asked the board to allow him “to exist” so he could be a support for his daughter.

Tressa Honie told the board she has a complicated relationship with her mother and would lose her most supportive parent if her father were to be executed. She said in an interview Tuesday that she wasn’t ready to lose her dad and felt abandoned by family on her mother’s side who had fought for his execution.

Benn’s close family argued that Taberon Honie deserved no mercy, and they said his execution was the justice they needed after decades of grief.

“He deserves an eye for an eye,” said Benn’s niece, Sarah China Azule.

She and her cousins described Benn as a pillar in their family and southwestern Utah community. She was a Paiute tribal council member, substance abuse counselor and caregiver for her children and grandchildren.

Tressa, who has few memories of her grandmother, said she understands why her cousins needed closure in this way, but it has left her feeling alone. She has found herself grieving the absence of the strong maternal role model her father stole from her life.

Correctional officers kept Honie’s immediate family separate from Benn’s as they witnessed the execution. His brutal crime drove a wedge between family members that several said will be tough to repair.

Honie was one of six people facing execution in Utah. The death sentence for a seventh person, Douglas Lovell, who killed a woman to keep her from testifying against him in a rape case, was recently overturned by the Utah Supreme Court. He will be resentenced.

Hours before Honie’s execution, a man described by his lawyers as intellectually disabled was executed in Texas for strangling and trying to rape a woman who went jogging near her Houston home more than 27 years ago.

Taberon Dave Honie, 48, was executed by lethal injection and pronounced dead on Thursday, at 12:25 a.m. Mountain Time, according to the Utah Department of Corrections. Honie's execution came nearly seven hours after Texas executed Arthur Lee Burton on Wednesday for the murder of Nancy Adleman, a 48-year-old mother of three who was out on a jog in Houston in 1997.

Honie was convicted for the murder of 49-year-old Claudia Benn, a substance abuse counselor for Utah's Paiute Tribe and a devoted grandmother of three.

Benita Yracheta, Benn's daughter, told USA TODAY on Monday that she feels relief that she can put her mother's brutal death behind her, saying that justice is ""finally happening"" and at least Honie could prepare for the day.

""My mom, she never knew her death date,"" she said. ""She didn’t know she was gonna die that night.""

Here's what to know about the execution, the case, and the victim.

Taberon Dave Honie's last meal, moments with family

The Utah Department of Corrections hosted a press conference livestream, providing hourly updates on Honie. Honie spent most of the day visiting with family members, including his daughter and parents, who had been with him since 10 a.m., according to corrections spokesperson Glenn Mills.

He ate two hot meals over the course of the day, including a breakfast sandwich. His last meal was a cheeseburger, fries, and a milkshake.

Honie underwent multiple mental health checks over the course of the day, with a corrections team reporting that Honie was ""gracious and appreciative"" throughout, Mills said. One of Honie's attorneys had access to a phone in case they had a concern with the execution procedure.

The corrections team ran through the procedure over a handful times to ensure that they had ""everything down.""

Honie's last words

Honie spoke his last words at 12:03 a.m.,reminding others that change is possible.

“From the start it's been, if it needs to be done for them to heal, let's do this,"" said Honie. ""If they tell you you can't change, don't listen to them. To all my brothers and sisters in here, continue to change. I love you all. Take care.""

What happened during the execution?

Media witnesses said when the execution started, it was like watching someone fall asleep.

When a curtain was pulled back in the execution room, Honie was looking up, had an IV in both arms, which were strapped down to a table, said media witness Ben Winslow, a reporter from Fox 13, at a press conference.

Before Honie gave his final words, the warden read the death warrant to him.

Honie looked around the room and began tapping his foot. The witnesses said they weren't sure it was out of nervousness or ""just a reaction to what was happening.""

He mouthed something to the warden and the director of operations, but witnesses could not hear what he said and then he lifted his head again and took in a ""deep exhaling breath and opened his mouth wide.""

His breathing then began to accelerate before slowing down. His skin then turned pale and blue, then shortly after, he was pronounced dead.

Differences between lethal injection and firing squad

There isn't ""much similarity at all"" between Honie's execution and Ronnie Lee Gardner's execution by firing squad in 2010, said Pat Reavy, a reporter with KSL.com who witnessed both executions, at the press conference.

""I guess there's a peaceful way to put someone to death,"" said Reavy about Honie's execution ""That's what this was.""

Reavy described the firing squad execution as more traumatic.

""The firing squad execution I thought was much more violent,"" said Reavy. ""It shakes you, it's just so loud.""

While Honie's execution took longer, he adds that it really was ""like watching a person fall asleep and not wake up again.""

'He was worthy of redemption'

""We are saddened that despite this change, the State of Utah did not grant him mercy,"" said his attorneys, Therese Day and Eric Zuckerman, in a statement. ""Mr. Honie’s life had value—he was worthy of redemption, and not being judged solely by his worst actions.""

His attorneys said he wasn't the same person he was 26 years ago.

""Honie always accepted responsibility for his crimes and expressed deep remorse for his actions, which were committed while he was extremely intoxicated from drugs and alcohol,"" ""Over the past 25 years, Mr. Honie worked on himself to become a better person""

Utah Attorney General releases statement

Utah's Attorney General Sean D. Reyes released a statement addressing Honie's execution and the ""deeply held beliefs, powerful emotions and divergent views regarding the death penalty.""

""Death by execution is one of the most extreme uses of government power,"" said Reyes. ""Many would argue it is ineffective, improper and beyond the authority of man to exercise. Many would disagree.""

""But there is no dispute that the violent and unprovoked taking of innocent lives from fellow human beings is among the crimes deemed by society to be most vile, repugnant and punishable by the harshest measures possible. In states like Utah, that includes the death penalty.""

Taberon Honie, who murdered and sexually assaulted Cedar City, Utah, resident Claudia Benn in 1998, was executed in the early minutes of Thursday by lethal injection. The execution was carried out by personnel the Utah Department of Corrections designated, completing a death sentence first given May 20, 1999.

Honie was pronounced dead at 12:25 a.m. Thursday, said Glen Mills, spokesperson for Utah Department of Corrections. This was the first execution carried out in Utah since 2010.

Benn, a member of the Paiute tribe and the mother of Honie’s then ex-girlfriend, was a substance abuse counselor, mother and grandmother. On July 9, 1998, Honie broke into Benn’s home and took a butcher knife from Benn, 49, and repeatedly stabbed her and sexually assaulted her with the knife. Her three young grandchildren were in the home at the time.

The first lethal dose of pentobarbitol was administered at 12:04 a.m., said Mills. A second dose was administered nine minutes later. At 12:21 a.m., the EKG showed a flatline and Honie was pronounced dead four minutes later at 12:25 a.m.

The department will provide support to the staff and around 200 individuals were involved in this situation, Brian Redd, executive director of Utah Department of Corrections, said.

“His foot appeared to be twitching,” said Ben Winslow, a Fox 13 reporter, who acted as chair of the media witnesses. Winslow said Honie’s foot seemed to twitch after giving his final words. He mouthed words to the warden that witnesses were unable to hear. A corrections official later said when Honie mouthed the words, he thanked two officials for taking care of his family and told his family he loved them.

Honie took a deep breath and then his breath picked up pace.

“But it then slowed down very quickly and then his skin turned pale, turned blue and we observed the EKG being tested to measure his pulse again and again and again,” said Winslow. Two other media witnesses said the process seemed to be carried out seamlessly.

“Early this morning the state of Utah fulfilled its legal obligation to carry out the execution of Taberon Honie. The actions of Mr. Honie that lead to his death sentence are heinous,” said Utah Gov. Spencer Cox in a statement. “I respect the process of our criminal justice system, and recognize the countless public servants who meticulously planned and approached their responsibilities with professionalism. I hope this brings closure to those impacted by the crimes. My heart goes out to the victim’s family.”

“We understand there are deeply held beliefs, powerful emotions and divergent views regarding the death penalty,” said Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes in a statement. “Death by execution is one of the most extreme uses of government power. Many would argue it is ineffective, improper and beyond the authority of man to exercise. Many would disagree.”

Reyes said society does agree that taking an innocent life is “deemed by society to be most vile, repugnant and punishable by the harshest measures possible. In states like Utah, that includes the death penalty.”

“As such, the State of Utah approached the exercise of its power and attendant responsibilities with the seriousness and solemnity that such an act merits. We hope opponents of the death penalty allow grace for those who carried out their duties as required by the law and did so with respect, professionalism, and, in some cases, in spite of their own personal views,” said Reyes. “We also hope that this act is a deterrent to other heinous crimes and pray it provides some measure of comfort to those who have been awaiting justice for decades.”

In the hours leading up to his execution, Honie was visited by his daughter, mother, father, three sisters, two cousins, brother-in-law and aunt, said Mills. Mental health workers also checked in on his well-being. Around 30 protesters gathered to protest the execution at a designated free speech zone.

Mills said Honie spoke with a spiritual leader Tuesday for a long period of time. The call involved several prayers.

Honie was convicted of aggravated murder and he was sentenced to die on May 20, 1999. The last execution carried out in Utah previous to Honie’s was Ronnie Lee Gardner on June 18, 2010.

“It was not a sentence I gave to the defendant; he earned it. If this isn’t a death penalty case, I don’t know what is,” 5th District Judge Robert Braithwaite said at the time.

After an initial appeal, Honie’s case was heard by the Utah Supreme Court in 2002, which upheld the sentence. He appealed his sentence again in 2013, claiming his defense did not show enough evidence of mitigating circumstances — substance abuse by both him and his parents. The Utah Supreme Court again denied his appeal.

In 2015, Honie filed a petition to ask another court to hear his challenge to his sentence. His petition was denied in 2019 and though he appealed, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the decision to deny the petition in 2023.

In June, Honie asked the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole to commute his sentence. In Utah, governors cannot commute sentences — that power belongs to the five-person board. The board denied the request in July.

“We did not ask for you to take my aunt the way you did. Nor did we ask you to hurt the girls,” Trevia Wall, Benn’s niece, said at the the hearing in July. “You did all that. And again, this sentence is what I feel is best and is what you’ve earned. You’ve earned that sentence.”

Another family member, Benn’s daughter Benita Yracheta, said at the hearing that when she thinks of her mother, she now thinks of the crime scene.

“I can’t pick up a phone and call her anymore,” said Yracheta. “I can’t wish her a happy birthday or Mother’s Day. I have to go to the cemetery for holidays, Mother’s Day, her birthday. I go down on the anniversary of her death. We can’t make no more memories with her, no more pictures with her. We just have to live with the memories we have.”

Honie’s attorney, Therese Day, said she provided more details about his upbringing, especially the role of substance abuse, and argued for clemency. “This request is something he’s struggled with because he believes he is deserving of nothing. He’s not asking to be let out of prison nor does he think he deserves it.”

After the hearing, the board issued a statement saying they reviewed testimony from Honie, his witnesses and family members as well as from the victim representatives and denied clemency.

“After carefully reviewing all submitted information and considering all arguments from the parties, the Board does not find sufficient cause to commute Mr. Honie’s death sentence.”

Attorneys for Honie wrote Cox a letter requesting Cox delay the execution, arguing the Utah Department of Corrections engaged in a rushed process. The department denied the process was rushed.

Cox denied the request in a letter sent Tuesday. He said Honie exhausted all his appeals and he does not think a temporary reprieve is warranted.

Allred, Deseret News

National advocates against the death penalty arrived in Utah days before the execution to lead efforts to protest it. Abe Bonowitz, co-founder of Death Penalty Action, along with SueZann Bosler, founding board member of Journey of Hope, and Randy Gardner, brother of Ronnie Lee Gardner and on Death Penalty Action’s advisory committee, have held a public meeting and spoken to press to protest the execution.

A group of anti-death penalty advocates presented Cox with a petition requesting he stay the execution. The group gathered on the steps of the Utah Capitol to protest the execution. The Utah Department of Corrections set up a designated free speech zone for those who wanted to protest against or for the death penalty.

Mills recounted Honie’s final words as, “From the start, it’s been if it needs to be done for them to heal, let’s do this. If they tell you you can’t change, don’t listen to them. To all my brothers and sisters here, continue to change. I love you all, take care.”

“While Honie is scheduled for execution, the impact of his actions will continue to resonate deeply with those who knew and loved Claudia,” said Restoring Ancestral Winds in a statement, a coalition with the purpose to end violence in Native communities. “She was a beloved mother and grandmother and a beacon of strength and resilience in her community. Claudia’s precious grandchildren who witnessed the attack, still feel her loss.”

”The emotional and psychological scars borne by her grandchildren are a painful reminder of the ongoing consequences of this tragic event,” continued the statement. “We call attention to the high rates of violence against Native American women which have a profound impact on future generations within Native American families and communities.”

Taberon Honie is executed by lethal injection in Utah.,https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/nation/2024/08/08/taberon-dave-honie-utah-execution/74697293007/,"Utah executed a death row inmate for the 1998 murder of his then-girlfriend's mother on Thursday, the 12th execution in the nation this year and the state's first since a firing squad execution in 2010.

Taberon Dave Honie, 48, was executed by lethal injection and pronounced dead on Thursday, at 12:25 a.m. Mountain Time, according to the Utah Department of Corrections. Honie's execution came nearly seven hours after Texas executed Arthur Lee Burton on Wednesday for the murder of Nancy Adleman, a 48-year-old mother of three who was out on a jog in Houston in 1997.

Honie was convicted for the murder of 49-year-old Claudia Benn, a substance abuse counselor for Utah's Paiute Tribe and a devoted grandmother of three.

Benita Yracheta, Benn's daughter, told USA TODAY on Monday that she feels relief that she can put her mother's brutal death behind her, saying that justice is ""finally happening"" and at least Honie could prepare for the day.

""My mom, she never knew her death date,"" she said. ""She didn’t know she was gonna die that night.""

Here's what to know about the execution, the case, and the victim.

Taberon Dave Honie's last meal, moments with family

The Utah Department of Corrections hosted a press conference livestream, providing hourly updates on Honie. Honie spent most of the day visiting with family members, including his daughter and parents, who had been with him since 10 a.m., according to corrections spokesperson Glenn Mills.

He ate two hot meals over the course of the day, including a breakfast sandwich. His last meal was a cheeseburger, fries, and a milkshake.

Honie underwent multiple mental health checks over the course of the day, with a corrections team reporting that Honie was ""gracious and appreciative"" throughout, Mills said. One of Honie's attorneys had access to a phone in case they had a concern with the execution procedure.

The corrections team ran through the procedure over a handful times to ensure that they had ""everything down.""

Honie's last words

Honie spoke his last words at 12:03 a.m.,reminding others that change is possible.

“From the start it's been, if it needs to be done for them to heal, let's do this,"" said Honie. ""If they tell you you can't change, don't listen to them. To all my brothers and sisters in here, continue to change. I love you all. Take care.""

What happened during the execution?

Media witnesses said when the execution started, it was like watching someone fall asleep.

When a curtain was pulled back in the execution room, Honie was looking up, had an IV in both arms, which were strapped down to a table, said media witness Ben Winslow, a reporter from Fox 13, at a press conference.

Before Honie gave his final words, the warden read the death warrant to him.

Honie looked around the room and began tapping his foot. The witnesses said they weren't sure it was out of nervousness or ""just a reaction to what was happening.""

He mouthed something to the warden and the director of operations, but witnesses could not hear what he said and then he lifted his head again and took in a ""deep exhaling breath and opened his mouth wide.""

His breathing then began to accelerate before slowing down. His skin then turned pale and blue, then shortly after, he was pronounced dead.

Differences between lethal injection and firing squad

There isn't ""much similarity at all"" between Honie's execution and Ronnie Lee Gardner's execution by firing squad in 2010, said Pat Reavy, a reporter with KSL.com who witnessed both executions, at the press conference.

""I guess there's a peaceful way to put someone to death,"" said Reavy about Honie's execution ""That's what this was.""

Reavy described the firing squad execution as more traumatic.

""The firing squad execution I thought was much more violent,"" said Reavy. ""It shakes you, it's just so loud.""

While Honie's execution took longer, he adds that it really was ""like watching a person fall asleep and not wake up again.""

'He was worthy of redemption'

""We are saddened that despite this change, the State of Utah did not grant him mercy,"" said his attorneys, Therese Day and Eric Zuckerman, in a statement. ""Mr. Honie’s life had value—he was worthy of redemption, and not being judged solely by his worst actions.""

His attorneys said he wasn't the same person he was 26 years ago.

""Honie always accepted responsibility for his crimes and expressed deep remorse for his actions, which were committed while he was extremely intoxicated from drugs and alcohol,"" ""Over the past 25 years, Mr. Honie worked on himself to become a better person""

Utah Attorney General releases statement

Utah's Attorney General Sean D. Reyes released a statement addressing Honie's execution and the ""deeply held beliefs, powerful emotions and divergent views regarding the death penalty.""

""Death by execution is one of the most extreme uses of government power,"" said Reyes. ""Many would argue it is ineffective, improper and beyond the authority of man to exercise. Many would disagree.""

""But there is no dispute that the violent and unprovoked taking of innocent lives from fellow human beings is among the crimes deemed by society to be most vile, repugnant and punishable by the harshest measures possible. In states like Utah, that includes the death penalty.""

Claudia Benn murdered at home while babysitting

Benn was babysitting her three granddaughters on July 9, 1998. Her daughter, Carol Pikyavit, had been living with Benn along with her 2-year-old daughter, whom she shared with Honie, when Honie called.

He was drunk and angry, and at one point, threatened to kill everyone in the home and take their daughter if Pikyavit didn't make time to see him, court records say.

Not taking the threat seriously, Pikyavit left the home and headed to work.

Honie headed to the house and began arguing with Benn. Honie told police that Benn started the fight and was calling him names through a sliding glass door before he snapped, broke through the door and went inside.

Benn had grabbed a butcher knife but was overpowered by Honie, who grabbed the knife and brought it to her throat, court records say. Honie says the two of them both tripped while the knife was at Benn’s throat and that she fell on the blade.

Police said Benn was found face down in the living room, with numerous “stabbing and cutting wounds” to her neck and genitals, according to court documents. Honie confessed to the murder, telling police that same night he had “stabbed and killed her with a knife,” USA TODAY reported.

All three grandchildren were found at the home with varying degrees of blood on their clothes and body. There was also evidence that one of Benn’s granddaughters was sexually abused at some point, court documents say.

Honie was arrested, charged and convicted of aggravated murder.

Victim's family looks to execution for closure

Betsy China, Benn's cousin, told USA TODAY on Monday that she wants Benn to be remembered as someone ""who helped our people."" Coping hasn't been easy for China, as she frequently looked to Benn for guidance in life. Benn always encouraged China, like a coach or sister would, advising her in difficult times.

“There was a big gap there in leadership within the family” after Benn’s death that remains to this day, China said.

Right now, what she’s focused on is “trying to be here and finish this out,” remembering her cousin in a good way and knowing that justice was served on Thursday.

Yracheta feels similarly, still working to untangle her mother's memory from what happened that night, saying whenever that happens, she tries to “to go to the good memories I have with her.""

“I miss her a lot. And every time I think of her, I think of the house and whatnot,” Yracheta said.

Those “good memories” include an impromptu dance party with impersonators for The Supremes at the Utah State Fair or how her mom worked to put herself through college after she divorced her husband and left Kaibab, Arizona, and moved the family to Utah.

Yracheta and other family members traveled to Salt Lake to witness the execution, hoping to put the past behind them."
Taberon Honie is executed by lethal injection in Utah.,https://www.eastidahonews.com/2024/08/utah-man-scheduled-for-execution-has-his-last-meal-heres-whats-next/,"SALT LAKE CITY (KSL.com) — Taberon Dave Honie has been meeting with family members for most of the day as he prepares for his execution by lethal injection just after midnight.

Honie was moved from his regular prison cell to an observation cell adjacent to the execution chamber sometime about 6:10 a.m. on Wednesday, according to corrections officials. He then slept until about 8:15 a.m. and ate a breakfast sandwich just after 8:30 a.m., said corrections spokesman Glen Mills.

Since about 10 a.m., Honie has had several visits from family members, two at a time for security purposes, starting with his mother and father. He has also met with his daughter, three sisters, two cousins, a brother-in-law and an aunt, Mills said. Honie and his visitors are separated by a window. Other visits have been with the warden at the prison as well as four checkups by mental health workers. His mood has been described by corrections employees as “gracious and appreciative” throughout the day.

Honie spoke on the phone with a spiritual adviser from the Hopi Reservation and mostly said prayers, Mill said.

Family visits will end at 9 p.m. From 9 p.m. until 10 p.m., Honie will be allowed to meet with a spiritual adviser and his attorneys. At some point between 11:30 p.m. and midnight, he will be moved from the observation room to the execution chamber.

The final meal that he requested — a cheeseburger, fries and a milkshake — was delivered about 4:30 p.m. However, Mills said Honie wanted administrators to convey to the public that he considered his final meal was one he had recently with his family at the prison.

Utah Department of Corrections Executive Director Brian Redd thanked members of the media for being present Wednesday afternoon and said he wants his department to be “known as a transparent and accountable organization.” He discussed the challenges of setting up a free speech zone during the execution that balances prison security and the rights of people to express their opinions. One of the challenges, he said, is that most of the land surrounding the prison is private property and there are few roads leading in and out to the prison.

Honie, who has been on death row since 1999, was convicted of brutally killing his ex-girlfriend’s mother, 49-year-old Claudia Marie Benn, in front of her three granddaughters on July 9, 1998, in Cedar City.

It will be the first execution at the new Utah State Correctional Facility, which officially opened in July 2022, and the first in the state in 14 years.

The prison was placed on lockdown in preparation for the execution at 6 a.m. on Wednesday and will remain locked down until 6 a.m. Thursday. Roadblocks have been set up on all roads leading into the facility, located west of the Salt Lake City International Airport.

The Department of Corrections is scheduled to give hourly updates starting at 5:30 p.m. lasting until about 10:30 p.m., then one more after the execution is done.

“We really want to put an emphasis on making sure we do this effectively, humanely and professionally,” Mills said during the 6:30 p.m. update, while adding the staff will have a final “run through” of what to expect tonight at 7 p.m., on top of the seven they have already conducted. A “run through” includes practicing moving a person who is about the same height and weight into the execution chamber and inserting a needle into his arm, both as a willing participant and with resistance, Mills said.

Mills admits there has been a different feeling among officers and staff members at the prison this week knowing the execution was approaching.

“It’s not something that anyone who’s involved with this looks forward to or takes joy in, in any means. However, we all see that as a responsibly of ours in the department, and we take it seriously, and we intend to carry it out in a caring and professional manner,” he said.

The execution chamber is 24 feet by 38 feet. There are separate witness rooms, both with reflective glass to protect the identity of witnesses. The windows are also bulletproof “to protect the witnesses from unintended ricochet, if firing squad is used,” according to the department. Honie is set to die by lethal injection.

After Honie is strapped to a gurney in the room, two people will enter and insert an IV. Those two will then leave the room and two other people will do the injection. Those people will be in a separate room and will not be seen by any witnesses or Honie in order to protect their identities.

The two people chosen are “trained in accordance with accepted medical practices to administer intravenous injections, who shall each administer a continuous intravenous injection, one of which shall be of a lethal quantity of sodium thiopental or other equally or more effective substance sufficient to cause death. Based on the recommendation of medical professionals, the drug being used will be pentobarbital,” according to the Utah Department of Corrections.

Neither of the two people will be told which one has the lethal dose.

Before the lethal injection begins, Honie will be given the opportunity as he is strapped to the gurney to speak any last words. After the injection, a physician will be brought into the chamber to confirm his death.

While not revealing their identities, corrections officials say those participating in the lethal injection are not members of the Department of Health and Human Services or the Division of Correctional Health Services.

Honie can choose up to five people who are either a religious representative, a friend or a relative to witness his execution. Mills says Honie has picked four family members and his attorney. The identities of the family members are expected to be revealed after the execution. Up to five members of the victim’s family may be also witnesses. Seven members of the media, all from Utah, have been selected to be witnesses, including KSL.com.

Other witnesses will include law enforcers from Iron County, a prosecuting attorney from Iron County, a representative from the Utah Attorney General’s Office and up to three corrections officials.

After he is dead, Honie’s body will be turned over to the Utah State Medical Examiner’s Office. Once their assessment is completed, Honie’s remains will be dealt with based on his wishes, but those wishes have not yet been disclosed."

Here's what to know about the execution, the case, and the victim.

Taberon Dave Honie's last meal, moments with family

The Utah Department of Corrections hosted a press conference livestream, providing hourly updates on Honie. Honie spent most of the day visiting with family members, including his daughter and parents, who had been with him since 10 a.m., according to corrections spokesperson Glenn Mills.

He ate two hot meals over the course of the day, including a breakfast sandwich. His last meal was a cheeseburger, fries, and a milkshake.

Honie underwent multiple mental health checks over the course of the day, with a corrections team reporting that Honie was ""gracious and appreciative"" throughout, Mills said. One of Honie's attorneys had access to a phone in case they had a concern with the execution procedure.

The corrections team ran through the procedure over a handful times to ensure that they had ""everything down.""

Honie's last words

Honie spoke his last words at 12:03 a.m.,reminding others that change is possible.

“From the start it's been, if it needs to be done for them to heal, let's do this,"" said Honie. ""If they tell you you can't change, don't listen to them. To all my brothers and sisters in here, continue to change. I love you all. Take care.""

What happened during the execution?

Media witnesses said when the execution started, it was like watching someone fall asleep.

When a curtain was pulled back in the execution room, Honie was looking up, had an IV in both arms, which were strapped down to a table, said media witness Ben Winslow, a reporter from Fox 13, at a press conference.

Before Honie gave his final words, the warden read the death warrant to him.

Honie looked around the room and began tapping his foot. The witnesses said they weren't sure it was out of nervousness or ""just a reaction to what was happening.""

He mouthed something to the warden and the director of operations, but witnesses could not hear what he said and then he lifted his head again and took in a ""deep exhaling breath and opened his mouth wide.""

His breathing then began to accelerate before slowing down. His skin then turned pale and blue, then shortly after, he was pronounced dead.

Differences between lethal injection and firing squad

There isn't ""much similarity at all"" between Honie's execution and Ronnie Lee Gardner's execution by firing squad in 2010, said Pat Reavy, a reporter with KSL.com who witnessed both executions, at the press conference.

""I guess there's a peaceful way to put someone to death,"" said Reavy about Honie's execution ""That's what this was.""

Reavy described the firing squad execution as more traumatic.

""The firing squad execution I thought was much more violent,"" said Reavy. ""It shakes you, it's just so loud.""

While Honie's execution took longer, he adds that it really was ""like watching a person fall asleep and not wake up again.""

'He was worthy of redemption'

""We are saddened that despite this change, the State of Utah did not grant him mercy,"" said his attorneys, Therese Day and Eric Zuckerman, in a statement. ""Mr. Honie’s life had value—he was worthy of redemption, and not being judged solely by his worst actions.""

His attorneys said he wasn't the same person he was 26 years ago.

""Honie always accepted responsibility for his crimes and expressed deep remorse for his actions, which were committed while he was extremely intoxicated from drugs and alcohol,"" ""Over the past 25 years, Mr. Honie worked on himself to become a better person""

Utah Attorney General releases statement

Utah's Attorney General Sean D. Reyes released a statement addressing Honie's execution and the ""deeply held beliefs, powerful emotions and divergent views regarding the death penalty.""

""Death by execution is one of the most extreme uses of government power,"" said Reyes. ""Many would argue it is ineffective, improper and beyond the authority of man to exercise. Many would disagree.""

""But there is no dispute that the violent and unprovoked taking of innocent lives from fellow human beings is among the crimes deemed by society to be most vile, repugnant and punishable by the harshest measures possible. In states like Utah, that includes the death penalty.""

Claudia Benn murdered at home while babysitting

Benn was babysitting her three granddaughters on July 9, 1998. Her daughter, Carol Pikyavit, had been living with Benn along with her 2-year-old daughter, whom she shared with Honie, when Honie called.

He was drunk and angry, and at one point, threatened to kill everyone in the home and take their daughter if Pikyavit didn't make time to see him, court records say.

Not taking the threat seriously, Pikyavit left the home and headed to work.

Honie headed to the house and began arguing with Benn. Honie told police that Benn started the fight and was calling him names through a sliding glass door before he snapped, broke through the door and went inside.

Benn had grabbed a butcher knife but was overpowered by Honie, who grabbed the knife and brought it to her throat, court records say. Honie says the two of them both tripped while the knife was at Benn’s throat and that she fell on the blade.

Police said Benn was found face down in the living room, with numerous “stabbing and cutting wounds” to her neck and genitals, according to court documents. Honie confessed to the murder, telling police that same night he had “stabbed and killed her with a knife,” USA TODAY reported.

All three grandchildren were found at the home with varying degrees of blood on their clothes and body. There was also evidence that one of Benn’s granddaughters was sexually abused at some point, court documents say.

Honie was arrested, charged and convicted of aggravated murder.

Victim's family looks to execution for closure

Betsy China, Benn's cousin, told USA TODAY on Monday that she wants Benn to be remembered as someone ""who helped our people."" Coping hasn't been easy for China, as she frequently looked to Benn for guidance in life. Benn always encouraged China, like a coach or sister would, advising her in difficult times.

“There was a big gap there in leadership within the family” after Benn’s death that remains to this day, China said.

Right now, what she’s focused on is “trying to be here and finish this out,” remembering her cousin in a good way and knowing that justice was served on Thursday.

Yracheta feels similarly, still working to untangle her mother's memory from what happened that night, saying whenever that happens, she tries to “to go to the good memories I have with her.""

“I miss her a lot. And every time I think of her, I think of the house and whatnot,” Yracheta said.

Those “good memories” include an impromptu dance party with impersonators for The Supremes at the Utah State Fair or how her mom worked to put herself through college after she divorced her husband and left Kaibab, Arizona, and moved the family to Utah.

Yracheta and other family members traveled to Salt Lake to witness the execution, hoping to put the past behind them."

Taberon Honie is executed by lethal injection in Utah.,https://www.fox13now.com/news/local-news/if-it-needs-to-be-done-for-them-to-heal-lets-do-this-taberon-honie-executed,"SALT LAKE CITY — When the curtain was pulled back, we could see Taberon Honie strapped to the table in the death chamber. He was looking around with IVs in his arms.

Prison warden Bart Mortensen read the death warrant that had been signed by a judge for his execution. Honie was asked if he had any last words.

""From the start, it's been if it needs to be done for them to heal, let's do this,"" Honie said, appearing to address his victim's family.

Honie then appeared to address his fellow inmates at the Utah State Prison.

""If they tell you, you can't change, don't listen to them,"" he said. ""To all my brothers and sisters in here, continue to change. I love you all. Take care.""

FOX 13 News was among the news media who witnessed the execution. Others included members of Honie's family; those of his victim, Claudia Benn; and government officials including several members of the Utah State Legislature.

Honie's right foot appeared to be twitching as he looked around. He mouthed something to the warden and the prison's director of operations.

""He simply stated 'Thank you for taking care of my family,'"" Randall Honey, the director of prison operations, recalled: ""And then he raised up his head and looked over to where his family was viewing and said 'I love you.'""

Glen Mills, the Utah Department of Corrections communications director, said in the family's witness room, Honie's mother said ""I love you son."" Honey said Honie was calm and appeared ""ready to accept it.""

Honie took a deep breath and as the lethal dose of pentobarbital was administered, his breathing appeared to slow. Prison officials later said they administered a second dose.

""Initially, the plan was to push a second dose at 20 minutes. Because the second dose was prepared and could not be used again. The doc made the recommendation to move it up to five minutes,"" said Utah Department of Corrections Executive Director Brian Redd.

Honie's skin turned a pale blue. Prison officials checked an electrocardiogram repeatedly to see his pulse. After about 17 minutes, he was pronounced dead.

""Today our department fulfilled one of the most consequential responsibilities given to the Department of Corrections,"" Redd said. ""No one involved today takes joy in carrying out this responsibility, but we recognize our statutory duties and we take it seriously.""

Afterward, reporters were told that Honie's family was granted permission to perform a Native American spiritual ceremony inside the death chamber.

""Mr. Honie’s father and his cousin just wanted to come in. According to their beliefs, the soul after the death could potentially get trapped where the place of death,"" Honey said. ""They performed the ceremony to release the soul so it could return to the mesa.""

Honie's last day was spent visiting with his family. His last meal, prison officials said, was a cheeseburger, fries and a milkshake.

Honie was sentenced to die for the 1998 murder of his ex-girlfriend's mother, Claudia Benn. A respected council member for a band of the Paiute tribe and a substance abuse counselor, Honie was convicted of breaking into her home and taking the butcher knife Benn tried to protect herself with, slitting her throat and sexually assaulting her with it.

Benn's grandchildren were in the home and police said witnessed the gruesome crime.

Honie admitted to the crime at his commutation hearing, but said he did not remember the details because he was intoxicated. He appealed his sentence for years, until he exhausted those legal options.

Initially, the Utah Department of Corrections sought to use a unique three drug cocktail to carry out the execution. When faced with legal challenges by Honie's attorneys, the agency pivoted to something that the defense suggested — pentobarbital. The state spent about $200,000 to acquire it.

""Early this morning the state of Utah fulfilled its legal obligation to carry out the execution of Taberon Honie. The actions of Mr. Honie that lead to his death sentence are heinous,"" Governor Spencer Cox said in a statement. ""I respect the process of our criminal justice system, and recognize the countless public servants who meticulously planned and approached their responsibilities with professionalism. I hope this brings closure to those impacted by the crimes. My heart goes out to the victim's family."""

Taberon Honie is executed by lethal injection in Utah.,https://truecrimenews.com/2024/08/08/salt-lake-city-taberon-honie-death-row-executed/,"SALT LAKE CITY (TCN) -- A 48-year-old man was put to death early Thursday morning, 25 years after he was convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend’s mother in front of her three grandchildren.

The Utah Department of Corrections confirmed at 12:30 a.m. that Taberon Honie died by lethal injection.

Department of Corrections officials said in a news conference that Honie said prior to the execution, ""From the start, it’s been, if it needs to be done for them to heal, let’s do this. If they tell you you can’t change, don’t listen to them. To all my brothers and sisters here, continue to change. I love you all, take care.""

Prison officials administered pentobarbital at 12:04 a.m. A second dose was administered at 12:13 a.m. Honie was declared dead at 12:25 a.m. His father and cousin reportedly performed a Hopi death ceremony after he was pronounced deceased.

The Salt Lake Tribune reports Honie’s death marks the first death row execution in the state since 2010. The last time a lethal injection was administered was 1999.

The Utah Department of Corrections provided details about Honie’s last day, saying he spent time with his parents, sisters, daughter, and other relatives. His last meal consisted of a cheeseburger, milkshake, and fries. He reportedly told his family to ""keep their heads up"" and ""was even cracking jokes."" He was described as being in a ""jovial mood.""

According to court documents , on July 9, 1998, at approximately 8 p.m., Honie called his ex-girlfriend, Carol Pikyavit, and told her to come over to his house. She reportedly declined, and he threatened that he would kill her mother and nieces. Pikyavit and her sister left for work at around 10:30 p.m., and they left their three children in Claudia Benn’s care. Honie called a cab at 11:20 p.m. and went to Benn’s house. The cab driver reportedly ""could tell that Mr. Honie was intoxicated,"" but he still knew how to get there.

At 12:20 a.m., police arrived at Benn’s house after several neighbors called. When they got there, police noticed a sliding door to enter the home was broken. Officers saw Honie fleeing the house from the garage and ordered him to get on the ground. He reportedly had blood ""from his fingertips to his elbows,"" and told one of the officers, ""I stabbed her. I killed her with a knife.""

Police found Benn partially nude and face-down on the living room floor. A bloody kitchen knife was left close to her head.

Court documents say two of the three children ""had some blood on them,"" but one of them, identified as D.R., ""was covered, literally, head to toe with blood.""

D.R. was not wearing underwear at the time. A social worker gave the girl a new pair of underwear, but doctors decided to examine her after finding blood on the undergarment. She reportedly sustained ""abrasions in her genital area that were consistent with rubbing or fondling."" Doctors believe she got the wounds within less than 24 hours.

The medical examiner said Benn’s throat had been cut from her neck to her ear, and there was a cut through her backbone. Court documents say her genitalia had been mutilated and stabbed.

Honie reportedly confessed to detectives that he broke into Benn’s house and killed her. He reportedly ""expressed remorse for killing the victim, stating repeatedly that Claudia was not meant to die.""

Honie went to trial in 1999 and was convicted of aggravated murder with aggravating factors of object rape, forcible sodomy, aggravated sexual assault, burglary, and aggravated burglary. The jury could not reach a verdict on a final aggravating factor of aggravated child sexual abuse.

Honie appealed the verdict and sentence throughout the years, arguing he had ineffective counsel and insufficient evidence to convict him, among other reasons. The Utah Supreme Court affirmed the ruling in May 2014.

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said following the execution, ""Early this morning the state of Utah fulfilled its legal obligation to carry out the execution of Taberon Honie. The actions of Mr. Honie that lead to his death sentence are heinous. I respect the process of our criminal justice system, and recognize the countless public servants who meticulously planned and approached their responsibilities with professionalism. I hope this brings closure to those impacted by the crimes. My heart goes out to the victim’s family.""

Attorney General Sean Reyes also released a statement saying, ""We understand there are deeply held beliefs, powerful emotions and divergent views regarding the death penalty. Death by execution is one of the most extreme uses of government power. Many would argue it is ineffective, improper, and beyond the authority of man to exercise. Many would disagree. But there is no dispute that the violent and unprovoked taking of innocent lives from fellow human beings is among the crimes deemed by society to be most vile, repugnant and punishable by the harshest measures possible. In states like Utah, that includes the death penalty.""

His statement went on, ""As such, the State of Utah approached the exercise of its power and attendant responsibilities with the seriousness and solemnity that such an act merits. We hope opponents of the death penalty allow grace for those who carried out their duties as required by the law and did so with respect, professionalism, and, in some cases, in spite of their own personal views.""

Reyes wrote that he hopes Honie’s execution ""is a deterrent to other heinous crimes and pray it provides some measure of comfort to those who have been awaiting justice for decades."""

Taberon Dave Honie, 48, is scheduled to be put to death by lethal injection for killing 49-year-old Claudia Benn, a substance abuse counselor for the Paiute Tribe who was killed on July 9, 1998, at her home in Cedar City in southwestern Utah.

If the execution proceeds as scheduled, he will become the 12th inmate to be executed in the U.S. this year and the first executed in Utah since a 2010 execution by firing squad. It will also come just two days after an execution in Texas.

""Yes, I'm a monster,"" Honie told the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole last month. ""The only thing that kept me going all these years, the only thing I know 100%, this would never happen if I was in my right mind ... I make no excuses.""

The board denied his request for a reprieve.

As his execution day approaches, USA TODAY is looking back at the crime, who Honie is and what led him down a path that ended in a woman’s horrific death.

Taberon Dave Honie executed:Utah executes inmate in murder of then-girlfriend's mother

A ‘domestic dispute’ ends in tragedy

On July 9, 1998, Honie was drunk and fighting over the phone with girlfriend Carol Pikyavit, who was staying at her mother's house along with the daughter she shared with Honie, according to court records. At one point, records say, Honie threatened to kill everyone in her home and take the couple's daughter if Pikyavit didn't make time to see him, records say.

Not taking the threat seriously, Pikyavit left the home and headed to work.

Honie headed to the house, saying he had planned to sleep under the porch until Pikyavit came home. But as soon as he arrived, he began arguing with Pikyavit's mother, Claudia Benn, who was babysitting her three granddaughters.

Honie told police that Benn started the argument and was calling him names through a sliding glass door before he snapped, broke through the door and went inside, saying he just wanted to scare Benn.

Benn had grabbed a butcher knife but was overpowered by Honie, who grabbed the knife and brought it to her throat, court records say. Honie says the two of them both tripped while the knife was at Benn’s throat and that she fell on the blade.

When police arrived shortly after, Honie − covered in blood − emerged from the home and said he had “stabbed and killed her with a knife,” court documents say. Benn was found face down in the living room, with numerous “stabbing and cutting wounds” to her neck and genitals, according to court documents.

All three grandchildren were found at the home with varying degrees of blood on their clothes and body. There was also evidence that one of Benn’s granddaughters was sexually abused at some point, court documents say.

Honie was arrested, charged and convicted of aggravated murder.

‘Traumatic childhood experiences’ had lasting effects

Honie was raised with five siblings in First Mesa, a village on the eastern side of the Hopi Reservation in northern Arizona, and is considered Hopi-Tewa. His childhood was marked by “neglect, violence and chaos,” according to a commutation petition filed in June seeking to have Honie's death sentence thrown out in favor of life in prison.

Life on the mesa was ""extremely difficult,"" as the family of eight survived without access to basic resources like running water or toilets for nearly a decade, the petition says.

“We had no recreation center, no after-school activities, nothing,"" Honie says in the petition. ""We lived at a poverty level below the city slums. We all had a view that, 'I will never amount to anything. I will never be able to leave the mesa, so what is the use?’”

Honie and his siblings often were left to fend for themselves, with the older children starting fires to cook or warm the house since Honie’s parents were always “absent, drinking and fighting,"" the petition says.

Honie began to act out at the age of 10, turning to alcohol and drugs after falling in with the “wrong people,"" and later stealing things to obtain booze and drugs. His substance abuse problems continued into adulthood until his arrest.

Honie has also grappled with bouts of depression, getting a formal diagnosis in 2009 following various suicide attempts.

Honie’s traumatic childhood, brain damage, long-standing substance abuse and extreme intoxication all had a “synergistic effect,” impacting his ability to control his judgment and behavior on July 9, 1998, the commutation petition says.

“Honie also inherited generations of trauma from his parents, extended family, and his Hopi-Tewa community, which is referred to as intergenerational trauma,"" the petition says.

‘Worthy of mercy’ despite horrible crime, attorneys argue

Honie may have done a “horrible” thing but he has paid for it by serving nearly 25 years on death row, according to the petition. And even if his death sentence is thrown out, he will continue to pay by spending the rest of his life in prison.

“Mr. Honie does not have to be executed and is worthy of mercy,” according to the commutation petition, which says Honie has led a positive and productive life in prison, earning a high school diploma, learning a trade (plumbing) and staying close with family.

Honie’s execution would only “create more pain,” devastating his daughter Tressa and his granddaughter Alana, who have spent years worried about “Mr. Honie and his circumstances in the prison.”

“His family loves him very much,"" the petition says. ""His family has suffered much throughout their own lives and losing Mr. Honie to an execution would be devastating to them.""

State attorney general, family members want justice

Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes argued against Honie's clemency petition, citing “Honie's horrific acts, their life-long impact on Claudia's family and her tribal community.""

He said combined, they all demonstrate a ""failure to own up to the terror and gravity of his conduct.""

One of Honie's daughters, Benita Yracheta, told USA TODAY that she's feeling relief that she can soon put her mother's death behind her, saying that justice for her mother is “finally happening.”

“I had told them that I had cried for this man that killed because now that he knows his death date, he’s trying to throw everything out there to stop it,"" she said. ""My mom, she never knew her death date. She didn’t know she was gonna die that night, but I know that he needs to end it.”"

Utah death row inmate Taberon Honie was executed for the 1998 slashing of his ex-girlfriend's mother on Thursday. Honie, who branded himself 'a monster', had asked the parole board to commute his sentence to life in prison, saying he would never have killed 49-year-old Claudia Benn after a day of heavy drinking and drug use had he been in his “right mind.”

Benn’s family urged the parole board to allow him to be executed, saying they have been devastated by their loss. They described Benn as a pillar in their family and southwestern Utah community — a tribal member, substance abuse counselor, and caregiver for her children and grandchildren.

He died by lethal injection on Thursday, August 8 just after midnight 25 years after he was sentenced to die. His execution makes him the eighth person to be executed in Utah since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976.

Honie was pronounced dead at 12:25 a.m. Mountain Time was an execution that went as planned and took about 17 minutes. He tapped his foot and looked around a few times after he was given the lethal injection of two doses of pentobarbital.

He gasped once as the drug flowed through IVs in both arms, and his torso jolted off the table. Honie laid still for several minutes before he died and his glasses slid back on his forehead.

His final words were, ""From the start it's been, if it needs to be done for them to heal, let's do this. If they tell you you can't change, don't listen to them. To all my brothers and sisters in here, continue to change. I love you all. Take care.""

Honie was 22 when he broke into Benn's house in Cedar City after a day of heavy drinking and drug use and repeatedly slashed her throat and stabbed her in other parts of her body. Benn's grandchildren, including Honie's then 2-year-old daughter, were in the house at the time.

Honie's last meal before his execution was a cheeseburger, french fries and a milkshake, Utah Department of Corrections said. Honie spent the evening with his family before the execution.

Outside the prison, a group of anti-death penalty protesters held signs that said, ""All life is precious"" and prayed and sang ""Amazing Grace.""

After decades of failed appeals, Honie's execution warrant was signed in June despite defense objections to the planned lethal drug. In July, the state changed its execution protocol to using only a high dose of pentobarbital - the nervous system suppressant used to euthanize pets.

The Utah Board of Pardons and Parole denied Honie's petition to commute his sentence to life in prison after a two-day hearing in July during which Honie's attorneys said he grew up on the Hopi Indian Reservation in Arizona with parents who abused alcohol and neglected him.

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, also denied a final request by Honie to delay the execution. Honie told the parole board he wouldn't have killed Benn if he had been in his ""right mind."" He asked the board to allow him ""to exist"" so he could be a support for his daughter.

Tressa Honie told the board she has a complicated relationship with her mother and would lose her most supportive parental figure if her father were to be executed. However, other family members argued that Taberon Honie deserved no mercy.

Honie was one of six people facing execution in Utah. The death sentence for a seventh person, Douglas Lovell, who killed a woman to keep her from testifying against him in a rape case, was recently overturned by the Utah Supreme Court. He will be resentenced."
Taberon Honie is executed by lethal injection in Utah.,https://ksltv.com/668956/media-witnesses-report-taberon-honies-final-words-before-his-death/,"SALT LAKE CITY — Taberon Dave Honie was pronounced dead at 12:25 a.m. Thursday, after two doses of lethal pentobarbital were put into his body through a medical IV.

Witnessing the execution were representatives of the woman he murdered, Claudia Benn, members of the media, and members of his own family that he expressed love for in his final moments of life, according to corrections officials.

Media witnesses were not allowed to make recordings of Honie’s final words but were allowed to take notes and report what they heard. After Honie was pronounced dead, media members — who said they had not spoken at all previously while in the witness room — compared their notes to construct the condemned man’s final words.

From the start, it’s been, if it needs to be done for them to heal, let’s do this. If they tell you you can’t change, don’t believe them. To all my brothers and sisters here, continue to change. I love you all, take care.

Ben Winslow spoke for the group of journalists, explaining what they witnessed but several others spoke as they were asked questions by gathered members of the media. The witnesses seemed to all agree that the events were relatively somber and relatively peaceful. Pat Reavy, a KSL.com reporter who has witnessed two previous executions, said the lethal-injection death was not like the firing squad death he witnessed.

“I don’t think there’s much similarity at all … this was far less traumatic. The firing-squad execution I witnessed was much more violent. It shakes you because it’s just so loud, and this was really like watching a person fall asleep and not wake up again,” Reavy said.

“If there’s a peaceful way to put somebody to death, that’s what this was.”

Witnesses didn’t see Honie until he was strapped down to a gurney and had an IV in each arm. Corrections officers reported that the medical professionals sent the lethal drugs from behind walls, unseen by witnesses, as law dictates.

Officers said Honie walked into the execution chamber on his own and was compliant with the procedures, placing himself on the gurney before he was fastened to the gurney with straps on his ankles, below his knees, and on his thighs.

Law enforcement officials were also present to witness the execution as were elected officials.

Department of Corrections officer Randall Honey, who is the director of prison operations, said Honie spoke to him and the prison’s warden during the execution process and thanked them for taking care of his family.

“Then he raised up his head and looked to where his family was viewing and said, ‘I love you,’ ” Honey said.

Honie’s father and a cousin were allowed to perform a ritual in the room afterward that they believed would help Honie’s soul return back to the mesa. Honie is from the Hopi tribe.

Several media members reported feeling a duty to watch the state kill a person, exercising its most final power."

Strapped to the execution table in a sterile white room at the state prison, Honie turned his head to thank correctional officers for taking care of his family before he lost consciousness, warden Bart Mortensen told reporters after the execution.

Honie let out a gasp as the drug flowed through IVs in both arms, and his torso jolted off the table. He then laid still for several minutes before he died, turning a pale shade of blue as his glasses slid back on his forehead.

Honie was 22 when he broke into Benn’s house in Cedar City, the tribal headquarters of the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah, after a day of heavy drinking and drug use. He repeatedly slashed Benn’s throat and stabbed other parts of her body. The judge who sentenced him to death also found that Honie had sexually abused one of Benn’s other grandchildren who was in the house with a then 2-year-old Tressa at the time of the murder.

Honie, who had grown up on the Hopi Indian Reservation in Arizona, spent the evening with his daughter and other immediate family before the execution. He told Tressa earlier this week that he had come to terms with his fate and hoped she could too, she told The Associated Press. His last meal was a cheeseburger, french fries and a milkshake, the Utah Department of Corrections said.

After the medical team removed Honie’s body from the chamber, his family was allowed in to perform a Native American grieving ritual with bird feathers and cornmeal that they told officers would help free his soul after death.

Benn's close family argued that Taberon Honie deserved no mercy, and they said his execution was the justice they needed after decades of grief.

“He deserves an eye for an eye,” said Benn's niece, Sarah China Azule.

She and her cousins described Benn as a pillar in their family and southwestern Utah community. She was a Paiute tribal council member, substance abuse counselor and caregiver for her children and grandchildren.

Tressa, who has few memories of her grandmother, said she understands why her cousins needed closure in this way, but it has left her feeling alone. She has found herself grieving the absence of the strong maternal role model her father stole from her life.

Correctional officers kept Honie's immediate family separate from Benn's as they witnessed the execution. His brutal crime drove a wedge between family members that several said will be tough to repair.

He gasped as the drugs entered his body through IVs and his torso jolted on the execution table. His skin turned a pale blue and he was motionless for a few minutes, then pronounced dead at 12.25am Thursday.

Honie was put to death for slitting the throat of substance abuse counselor Claudia Benn, 49, in her Cedar City home on July 9, 1998.

He was drunk and fighting with his girlfriend, Carol Pikyavit, who was staying at her mom’s house along with the daughter they shared, court records showed.

Honie said that if Pikyavit did not make time to see him, he would kill everyone in the home and take their daughter away. But Pikyavit did not take his words seriously and went to work, according to the records.

When Honie got to the home, he started arguing with Benn, who was babysitting three granddaughters. Honie claimed that Benn began calling him names and that he broke through a sliding glass door to scare her.

Benn grabbed a butcher knife, which Honie took and moved toward her throat,according to the records. Honie claimed that they tripped and that Benn fell on the blade.

Cops arrived to find Honie covered in blood and he admitted he ‘stabbed and killed her with a knife’, according to the documents. She had ‘stabbing and cutting wounds’ on her genitals and neck.

‘The only thing that kept me going all these years, the only thing I know 100%, this would never happen if I was in my right mind,’ he said.

‘I make no excuses.’

Honie’s request for reprieve was denied by the board, and he became the first inmate to be executed in Utah since 2010 and the 12th in the US this year.

Taberon Honie is executed by lethal injection in Utah.,https://wacotrib.com/ap/national/utah-man-who-killed-woman-is-put-to-death-by-lethal-injection-in-states-first/article_7c79deaa-7e3f-5306-aa9b-7fb36dfd3640.html,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — A Utah man who killed his girlfriend's mother by slashing her throat was put to death by lethal injection early Thursday in the state's first execution since 2010.

Taberon Dave Honie, 48, was convicted of aggravated murder in the July 1998 death of Claudia Benn, the maternal grandmother of his now 27-year-old daughter, Tressa.

Honie was pronounced dead at 12:25 a.m. Mountain Time in an execution that went as planned and took about 17 minutes. He tapped his foot and mouthed “I love you” to family members watching from a witness chamber after he was given the lethal injection of two doses of pentobarbital.

Strapped to the execution table in a sterile white room at the state prison, Honie turned his head to thank correctional officers for taking care of his family before he lost consciousness, warden Bart Mortensen told reporters after the execution.

Honie let out a gasp as the drug flowed through IVs in both arms, and his torso jolted off the table. He then laid still for several minutes before he died, turning a pale shade of blue as his glasses slid back on his forehead.

His final words were, ""From the start it’s been, if it needs to be done for them to heal, let’s do this. If they tell you you can’t change, don’t listen to them. To all my brothers and sisters in here, continue to change. I love you all. Take care.”

Honie was 22 when he broke into Benn’s house in Cedar City, the tribal headquarters of the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah, after a day of heavy drinking and drug use. He repeatedly slashed Benn’s throat and stabbed other parts of her body. The judge who sentenced him to death also found that Honie had sexually abused one of Benn’s other grandchildren who was in the house with a then 2-year-old Tressa at the time of the murder.

Honie, who had grown up on the Hopi Indian Reservation in Arizona, spent the evening with his daughter and other immediate family before the execution. He told Tressa earlier this week that he had come to terms with his fate and hoped she could too, she told The Associated Press. His last meal was a cheeseburger, french fries and a milkshake, the Utah Department of Corrections said.

After the medical team removed Honie’s body from the chamber, his family was allowed in to perform a Native American grieving ritual with bird feathers and cornmeal that they told officers would help free his soul after death.

Outside the prison, a group of anti-death penalty protesters sang “Amazing Grace"" and held signs that said, “All life is precious.""

After decades of failed appeals, Honie's execution warrant was signed in June despite defense objections to the planned lethal drug. In July, the state changed its execution protocol to using only a high dose of pentobarbital — the nervous system suppressant used to euthanize pets.

The Utah Board of Pardons and Parole denied Honie's petition to commute his sentence to life in prison after a July hearing during which Honie's attorneys described his troubled childhood growing up on the reservation with parents who abused alcohol. He had started using hard drugs as a teenager and told the parole board he wouldn’t have killed Benn if he had been in his “right mind.” He asked the board to allow him “to exist"" so he could be a support for his daughter.

Tressa Honie told the board she has a complicated relationship with her mother and would lose her most supportive parent if her father were to be executed. She said in an interview Tuesday that she wasn't ready to lose her dad and felt abandoned by family on her mother's side who had fought for his execution.

Benn's close family argued that Taberon Honie deserved no mercy, and they said his execution was the justice they needed after decades of grief.

“He deserves an eye for an eye,” said Benn's niece, Sarah China Azule.

She and her cousins described Benn as a pillar in their family and southwestern Utah community. She was a Paiute tribal council member, substance abuse counselor and caregiver for her children and grandchildren.

Tressa, who has few memories of her grandmother, said she understands why her cousins needed closure in this way, but it has left her feeling alone. She has found herself grieving the absence of the strong maternal role model her father stole from her life.

Correctional officers kept Honie's immediate family separate from Benn's as they witnessed the execution. His brutal crime drove a wedge between family members that several said will be tough to repair.

Honie was one of six people facing execution in Utah. The death sentence for a seventh person, Douglas Lovell, who killed a woman to keep her from testifying against him in a rape case, was recently overturned by the Utah Supreme Court. He will be resentenced.

Hours before Honie's execution, a man described by his lawyers as intellectually disabled was executed in Texas for strangling and trying to rape a woman who went jogging near her Houston home more than 27 years ago."

News of his demise was announced at 12:30 a.m. Thursday, after his execution by lethal injection by the state of Utah for the brutal 1999 murder of Claudia Benn, his ex-girlfriend’s mother.

Prison officials confirmed the death, the result of Utah’s first execution since 2010.

Events Wednesday leading up to the execution were detailed by prison officials all day online and later with periodic live-streamed press updates, beginning with the 6:09 a.m. announcement that Honie had been taken to an observation cell.

By 7 a.m. both the Utah State Correctional Facility, the state’s main prison in Salt Lake City where the execution was to take place, and the Central Utah Correctional Facility, in Gunnison, had been placed on lockdown. By 4:15 p.m. the road to the USCF was closed.

In the first hourly press update at 5:30 p.m. by prison spokesman Glen Mills, he said Honie had been visiting with family throughout the day, allowed to talk to and see him through a barrier, two at a time. They consisted of a daughter, his mother and father, three sisters, two cousins, a brother-in-law and an aunt.

His mood was described as “gracious and appreciative” in the visits. Honie had also had another visit from a mental health team to assess him. Reports had been positive.

At the 7:30 p.m. briefing, the eighth “run-thru” of the day, a rehearsal, for the execution was reported underway. All had gone well, and included a staffer the size of the large Honie, volunteering for the lethal injection team to practice on locating suitable veins for the intravenous needles.

At 8:40 p.m. Honie said his final goodbyes to family, where he was reportedly jovial, cracking jokes and telling his tearful relatives to “keep their heads up.”

His attorneys had arrived at 6:40 p.m. but he declined to see them until 9 p.m. After 10 p.m. with outside visitation ended he was visited by the warden and the director of prison operations. He was offered a valium, which he declined. He spent the time listening to music on a tablet.

It was announced he would be walked to the death chamber between 11:30 p.m. and midnight for the 12:01 a.m. scheduled execution, escorted by a “tie-up” team should there be any signs of resistance, which was not expected."

Death row inmate Taberon Honie picked a cheeseburger and fries for his final meal in the hours before his execution.

He died by lethal injection on Thursday August 8 just after midnight 25 years after he was sentenced to die. His execution makes him the eighth person to be executed in Utah since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976 and the first since 2010.

Utah Department of Corrections officials issued an update on the process at around 5.30 pm on Wednesday where they confirmed details of Honie's last day. Spokesperson Glen Mills said that he had been given his last meal at 4.30 pm which consisted of a cheeseburger, fries and a milkshake.

Honie ate at the prison campus with members of his family. He had started his day at 6.09 am and had been moved to an observation room at Utah State Prison in Salt Lake City. He slept there until 8.15 am when he was given a breakfast sandwich.

Honie was visited by his mother and father and 10.02 am with his family members then visiting him in groups of two and switching through the day. He was given three mental health checks and also had a visit with the warden.

Honie picked five witnesses for his execution. It is believed he chose four of his family members and his attorney. Names are expected to be released in the Utah Department of Corrections final media briefing at 2 am.

Several members of the media including KUTV anchor/reporter Jim Spiewak also witnessed the execution having been selected to attend several weeks ago. A member of the Utah Attorney General’s office was scheduled to watch from the command center.

Honie was sentenced to die by lethal injection 25 years ago after he brutally murdered his ex-girlfriend's mother, Claudia Benn. Benn was also his daughter's grandmother. Court documents detailed how he stabbed her to death after threatening his ex-girlfriend that he would kill her family if she didn't see him.

Honie began dating Carol Pikyavit in 1995 and they had a baby together but by 1998 they broke up. On July 9 1998 he made threats to Pikyavit and her family members. On July 10 he broke into Benn's home where he sexually assaulted and murdered her by stabbing her multiple times and cutting her throat. He was arrested by police at the scene.

Benn’s grandchildren, including Honie’s 2-year-old daughter, were in the house at the time. On May 20 1999 he was sentenced to death for aggravated murder, burglary, object rape, and forcible sodomy.

Honie, who branded himself ""a monster"", asked the parole board to commute his sentence to life in prison, saying he would never have killed Benn after a day of heavy drinking and drug use had he been in his “right mind.”"

SALT LAKE CITY — Taberon Dave Honie was 23 years old when he was sentenced to die in 1999.

Now 48, Honie has spent more than half of his life on death row. Just after midnight on Thursday morning, he is scheduled to become the eighth person executed by the state of Utah since 1977 after the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty the year before.

It will be the first execution at the new Utah State Correctional Facility that officially opened in July 2022 and the first in the state since 2010.

The crime

Late on the evening of July 9, 1998, Honie, 22, broke into the Cedar City home of his ex-girlfriend's mother, 49-year-old Claudia Marie Benn, by smashing a rock into a glass door. Benn tried to protect herself and her three young granddaughters with a butcher knife. Honie turned the knife on her, cut Benn's throat and sexually assaulted her with the knife. He also beat her severely on her face and head. The children had blood on them when police found them.

Honie, who was extremely intoxicated, claims he went to the home to fall asleep under the porch. But he got into an argument with Benn before brutally killing her.

On April 30, 1999, Honie informed Judge Robert T. Braithwaite that, if convicted, he would let the judge decide his sentence instead of a jury. With a jury, all 12 jurors would have to unanimously agree on the death penalty for that sentence to be carried out.

""It's not anything a judge would want to do. It's the last thing a judge would want to do, to impose a death penalty. But if I felt it was appropriate, and the facts and circumstances of the case, I would impose it,"" Braithwaite said, according to a court transcript of the hearing. ""I haven't made my mind up in this case ... I don't have a philosophical opposition to the death penalty. That's not what I would want to do, but I would do it if it's appropriate.""

On May 18, 1999, Honie was convicted of aggravated murder and Braithwaite sentenced him to death.

""It was not a sentence I gave to the defendant; he earned it. If this isn't a death penalty case, I don't know what is,"" the judge said at the time.

The appeals

The death sentence was immediately stayed, however, pending Honie's appeals.

In 2002, both Honie's conviction and sentence were upheld by the Utah Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court opted not to hear his case.

Honie then filed a petition for post conviction relief, which was denied, and the decision was upheld by the Utah Supreme Court in 2014.

In 2015, Honie filed a federal petition for habeas corpus, which is used to ask for another court hearing to either challenge a conviction or the conditions in which an inmate is being held. That petition was denied in 2019 and the decision upheld by the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals on Dec. 11, 2023.

The U.S. Supreme Court then denied a petition for writ of certiorari, which is a request to have the nation's high court order a lower court to send up a case for review. At that point, Honie's legal appeals were over.

""He has exhausted state and federal remedies challenging his conviction and sentence, Therefore, no legal reason exists to delay issuing an execution warrant,"" the state said in its execution warrant filed on June 10.

On June 18, Honie filed a petition asking the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole to commute his sentence to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The five-member board agreed to consider it and hold a hearing. On July 22 and 23, Honie and his attorneys testified before the board that Honie's extensive substance abuse and alcohol use, the psychological trauma he endured as a child, his mental health as an adult and his rough upbringing on the Hopi Reservation in northeastern Arizona should have been considered as mitigating factors during his sentencing.

He also claimed, according to his petition for commutation, that he tried to rescind his decision to have a judge sentence him but was told he couldn't, and that two jurors later claimed they would not have voted for the death penalty.

But prosecutors testified to the board that the death penalty is reserved only for Utah's worst crimes, and this is one of them. Relatives of Benn testified they believe Honie should be put to death.

On July 26, the Utah Board of Pardonsand Parole rejected Honie's commutation request and said the Utah Department of Corrections should continue with its preparations for his execution by lethal injection.

Honie also asked Gov. Spencer Cox last week to issue an order for temporary reprieve because of questions over how the preparations for the execution were being handled by the department. His attorneys noted the state originally said it would use an experimental three-drug cocktail of ketamine, fentanyl and potassium chloride for the execution, but later stated it had acquired pentobarbital for about $200,000.

""Information about the source of the pentobarbital is being kept secret from both Mr. Honie and the public,"" his attorneys argued to Cox. ""The Department (of Corrections) refuses to provide any original documentation verifying the source's licensing and other relevant legal compliance, or the drug's validity, including a certificate of analysis.""

On Tuesday, Cox denied the request, stating the department has ""gone above and beyond in planning and preparing for Mr. Honie's execution.""

Cox also noted in his reply that, unlike the governors of other states, ""I do not have the authority to grant clemency or commute sentences. I am only given the authority to grant temporary reprieves that last until reviewed by the Board of Pardons and Parole."""

She was found with deep cuts to her throat, and stab wounds around her genitals

A Utah man who slit his ex-girlfriend's mother's throat in 1998 was put to death in the early hours of Thursday morning, becoming the first person to be executed by the state in 14 years.

Taberon Dave Honie, 48, was convicted of aggravated murder in the July 1998 death of Claudia Benn, after he broke into her house in Cedar City and repeatedly slashed her and stabbed her to death while her grandchildren, including Honie's own then-two-year-old daughter, were home.

Cops, who were called by neighbors in the early hours of the following day, found him in Benn's garage with her blood under his fingertips. He admitted during his arrest: 'I stabbed her. I killed her with a knife.'

Forensic investigators who swarmed Benn's Cedar City home found that Honie had cut the tragic grandmother's throat four time ear to ear to deeply that the knife reached her spine.

They also found he had stabbed her several times in and around her genitals, as well as evidence that he had sexually abused one of her grandchildren immediately after her death.

Despite admitted two days ago that he was 'a monster' to the state's parole board during his final appeal against the death penalty, he spent a quarter of a century trying to fight the sentence, which was handed down in 1999.

Claims of racially motivated prosecutors, abuse suffered at the hands of his parents and even long-term brain damage he said he suffered from a 30-ft fall from a ladder all failed to convince appeals judges, including the state's Supreme Court.

His final appeal, based on the claim that he needed to be alive to support his daughter, Tressa Honie, in any way he could given her troubled relationship with her mother, Benn's daughter, was denied.

Her mother's side of the family has staunchly fought to ensure Honie gets executed.

They described Benn as a pillar in their family and southwestern Utah community - a Paiute tribal member, substance abuse counselor and caregiver for her children and grandchildren.

Sarah China Azule, Benn's niece, said she was happy with the board's decision to move forward with Honie's execution.

But Tressa told the AP that she has always felt out of place from her mother's family.

'My mom's side, they can heal together,' she said in an interview. 'I'm happy you guys are going to get this closure, this justice, but where does that leave me? I feel like I have to heal alone.'

Trevia Wall, Benn's niece, said she's had an 'on-and-off' relationship with Tressa over the years but has tried to offer her extra support leading up to her father's death. Wall was among those who testified in favor of Honie´='s execution - an outcome she deemed necessary to get justice for her aunt. The two cousins embraced and cried together after the last hearing.

'It's bittersweet,' Wall said in an interview. 'Now we can finally move forward, we can finally heal, but it´s bitter because I hurt for my cousin, his daughter. He put her in the middle, and she was torn between her father and her grandmother.'

Honie's last meal before his execution was a cheeseburger, french fries and a milkshake, Utah Department of Corrections said. Honie spent the evening with his family before the execution.

Outside the prison, a group of anti-death penalty protesters held signs that said, 'All life is precious' and prayed and sang 'Amazing Grace.'

Honie's death came just hours after Arthur Lee burton, a man described by his lawyers as intellectually disabled, was executed in Texas for strangling and trying to rape a woman who went jogging near her Houston home more than 27 years ago.

Arthur Lee Burton had been sentenced to death for the July 1997 killing of Nancy Adleman, a 48-year-old mother of three who police found beaten and strangled with her own shoelace in a wooded area off a jogging trail along a bayou."

As part of execution protocol, a lockdown was initiated at 6 a.m. Wednesday at the prison in Salt Lake County and the facility in Sanpete County. That lockdown will remain in place until about six hours after Honie's death, if everything goes according to plan.

Preparation has been underway at the Utah State Correctional Facility since Honie's death warrant was delivered to the Department of Corrections on June 11.

Honie is guilty of killing his ex-girlfriend's mother and his daughter's grandmother, Claudia Benn, in 1998. He was sentenced to death the following year.

MORE on TABERON HONIE:







Honie will be the first person to be executed in the state in 14 years; Ronnie Lee Gardner was executed by firing squad in 2010.

Honie will be put to death at midnight Thursday.

KUTV spoke with the UDC Director of Communications Glen Mills about the changes occurring at the prison, ahead of the scheduled execution.

""It's a somber week here; it's definitely a different tone,"" Mills said. ""It's not something that anyone sits around the table and takes joy in doing. It's a court-ordered responsibility that we take seriously.""

Honie's execution will affect everyone in the Utah prisons - workers and prisoners alike.

Prison employees will be required to use their IDs to get through certain checkpoints. For inmates, regular-scheduled programs and work opportunities won't be available throughout the day.



Mills added that Honie will be moved to observation in the hours before the execution. While there, he can eat and have some visitations.

""Up until about three hours before the execution, that would then be limited down to clergy and attorneys only,"" Mills said.

Honie made two requests for a pipe ceremony and a smoke-smudging ceremony. Mills said those happened on Monday.

The drug being used for the execution, pentobarbital, is at the prison. It is being stored at room temperature, as is suggested on the label, Mills added.

He said that family visited Honie on Tuesday, and he had a call with a spiritual advisor that morning.

There will be hourly updates from the state correctional facility starting at 5:30 p.m. Wednesday.

There is also a designated free speech zone for anyone from the public to be in. There will be security and restrooms there. That opens at 5 p.m. Wednesday at 7800 West and 700 North.

A man who brutally murdered his girlfriend's mother by slashing her throat was executed via lethal injection in the early hours of Thursday.

It marks Utah's first execution since 2010 as Taberon Honie, 48, was found guilty of aggravated murder for the horrific death of Claudia Benn in July 1998.

Honie was just 22 when he broke into Ms Benn's Cedar City home after a day filled with heavy drinking and drug use, where he repeatedly slashed her throat and stabbed her multiple times.

At the time of the gruesome attack Ms Benn's grandchildren including Honie's two-year-old daughter were present in the house. The judge who sentenced Honie to death discovered that he had sexually abused one of the children, a factor that contributed to the decision of his sentence.

Before his execution, Honie enjoyed a last meal of a cheeseburger, French fries and a milkshake, as reported by the Utah Department of Corrections. He spent his final evening with his family before the execution.

Despite numerous failed appeals over the years, Honie's death warrant was signed in June, despite defence objections to the planned lethal drug combination. In July, the state altered its execution protocol to use only a high dose of pentobarbital, a nervous system suppressant typically used to euthanise pets.

The Utah Board of Pardons and Parole rejected Honie's plea to commute his sentence to life imprisonment after a two-day hearing in July. His lawyers argued that he grew up on the Hopi Indian Reservation in Arizona with parents who abused alcohol and neglected him.

Republican Utah Governor Spencer Cox also denied a final request by Honie to delay the execution. Honie told the Parole Board that while he was a ""monster"", he wouldn't have killed Ms Benn if he had been in his ""right mind"", and asked to be allowed ""to exist"" so he could support his daughter.

Tressa Honie told the board she has a difficult relationship with her mother and said if her father were to be executed, she would lose her biggest source of parental support. However, other family members argued that Honie didn't deserve any mercy.

They described Ms Benn as a pillar of their family and the south-western Utah community. A Paiute tribal member, substance abuse counsellor and carer for her children and grandchildren.

Ms Benns niece Sarah China Azule said she was pleased with the boards decision to go ahead with Honies execution. ""He deserves an eye for an eye,"" she said.

Honie was one of six people facing execution in Utah. The death sentence for a seventh person, Douglas Lovell, who killed a woman to stop her testifying against him in a rape case, was recently overturned by the Utah Supreme Court and he will be re-sentenced.

A man described by his lawyers as intellectually disabled was executed a few hours earlier in Texas for strangling and trying to rape a woman who went jogging near her Houston home more than 27 years ago.

Arthur Lee Burton was handed a death sentence for the brutal murder of Nancy Adleman, a 48-year-old mother of three. In July 1997, police discovered her body in a wooded area off a jogging trail along a bayou; she had been beaten and strangled with her own shoelace.

Taberon Honie, 48, was convicted of aggravated murder over the July 1998 death of Claudia Benn.

Ms Benn’s grandchildren, including Honie’s then two-year-old daughter, were in the house at the time.

The judge who sentenced him to death found that Honie had sexually abused one of the children, one of the aggravating factors used to reach that decision.

Honie’s last meal before his execution was a cheeseburger, french fries and a milkshake, Utah Department of Corrections said. Honie spent the evening with his family before the execution.

After decades of failed appeals, Honie’s execution warrant was signed in June despite defence objections to the planned lethal drug combination.

In July, the state changed its execution protocol to using only a high dose of pentobarbital – the nervous system suppressant used to euthanise pets.

The Utah Board of Pardons and Parole denied Honie’s petition to commute his sentence to life in prison after a two-day hearing in July during which his lawyers said he grew up on the Hopi Indian Reservation in Arizona with parents who abused alcohol and neglected him.

Utah Governor Spencer Cox, a Republican, also denied a final request by Honie to delay the execution.

Honie told the Parole Board he would not have killed Ms Benn if he had been in his “right mind”, and asked the board to allow him “to exist” so he could be a support for his daughter.

Taberon Honie is executed by lethal injection in Utah.,https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/law-order/3045473-utah-executes-man-for-1998-murder-following-decades-long-legal-battle,"In a significant legal and moral moment, Utah executed Taberon Dave Honie early Thursday via lethal injection, marking the state's first execution since 2010. Honie, 48, was convicted of the aggravated murder of Claudia Benn in 1998. The brutal crime, which involved throat-slashing and stabbing, occurred in Benn's Cedar City home while her grandchildren, including Honie's daughter, were present.

Despite numerous appeals and interventions, including a last-minute plea for clemency, the execution proceeded under a new protocol using a high dose of pentobarbital. The Utah Board of Pardons and Parole had denied his petition to commute the sentence, citing, among other factors, Honie's admission to sexually abusing one of the children present during the crime.

Benn's family remains divided over the execution, with some calling for mercy and others advocating for the death penalty as a just punishment. Honie's case brings to light ongoing debates over capital punishment and its ethical implications, particularly for individuals with troubled backgrounds and histories of substance abuse.

Taberon Honie is executed by lethal injection in Utah.,https://www.ruetir.com/2024/08/08/usa-one-death-sentence-carried-out-in-texas-another-expected-in-utah-11-executions-already-this-year/,"A death sentence was carried out yesterday in Texas and another is scheduled for today in Utah: 11 executions have already been carried out this year in the United States, and tomorrow there could be 12.

Arthur Lee Burton, 54, who was sentenced to death for murder in 1997, was executed by lethal injection yesterday at the Huntsville Penitentiary in Walker County, Texas. He was pronounced dead at 6:47 p.m. local time (1:47 a.m. AEDT), and was found guilty of killing Nancy Adleman, a mother of three, who was attacked while jogging near her Houston home in July 1997 and then strangled with her own shoelaces.

Burton’s lawyers had asked the Supreme Court to stay the death penalty, arguing that the inmate was “intellectually disabled,” but the justices rejected the request. This is the third execution carried out in Texas this year and the 11th nationwide in the United States.

Another is scheduled for today in Utah, the first in 14 years. Taberon Honie, 48, is scheduled to be executed, again by lethal injection, in Salt Lake City around midnight (8:00 tomorrow morning in Italy). The man was sentenced to death in 1998 for the sexual assault and murder of his ex-girlfriend’s mother.

If the sentence is not suspended, it will be the 12th execution carried out in the United States since the beginning of 2024. The last one recorded in Utah dates back to 2010 when a convicted person was executed by firing squad. The death penalty has been abolished in 23 of the 50 U.S. states. Six others, Arizona, California, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Tennessee, have a moratorium on executions."

Taberon Dave Honie, 48, was convicted of aggravated murder in connection with the death of Claudia Benn in July 1998.

Honie was 22 when he broke into Benn’s Cedar City home after a day of heavy drinking and drug use and repeatedly slit her throat and stabbed her in other parts of her body. Benn’s grandchildren, including Honie’s then 2-year-old daughter, were in the house at the time.

Utah Governor Spencer Cox, a Republican, also rejected a final request from Honie to stay the execution.

Honie told the parole board that he would not have killed Benn if he had been of “sane mind” and asked the board to let him “exist” so that he could support his daughter.

Tressa Honie told the board she has a complicated relationship with her mother and would lose the parent who supported her most if her father were executed.

However, other family members felt that Taberon Honie did not deserve mercy.

They described Benn as a pillar of support to their family and the southwestern Utah community: a member of the Paiute Tribe, a substance abuse counselor, and a caregiver to her children and grandchildren.

Sarah China Azule, Benn’s cousin, said she was pleased with the board’s decision to proceed with Honie’s execution.

“He deserves an eye for an eye,” she said.

Honie was one of six people threatened with execution in Utah.

A seventh man, Douglas Lovell, who murdered a woman to prevent her from testifying against him in a rape case, recently had his death sentence overturned by the Utah Supreme Court. He will be resentenced.

A man described by his lawyers as mentally handicapped was executed a few hours earlier in Texas for strangling and attempting to rape a woman who had been jogging near her Houston home more than 27 years ago.
