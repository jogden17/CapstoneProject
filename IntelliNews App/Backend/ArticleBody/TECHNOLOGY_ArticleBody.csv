"Apple could charge up to $20 for some Apple Intelligence AI features, analysts say.",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/08/apple-could-charge-20-for-some-apple-intelligence-features-analysts.html,"When Apple announced its AI system in June, the company promised a bolstered Siri voice assistant, as well as features including the ability to automatically generate emails and images. While these features will roll out slowly, with regions such as China and Europe initially not receiving access , Apple could charge a subscription for the more advanced apps, analysts said.

The Cupertino giant plans to rollout Apple Intelligence , its forthcoming AI system, across some of its devices later this year.

Apple could charge its users up to $20 for its advanced artificial intelligence features, analysts told CNBC, as the company looks to boost the growth of its lucrative services business.

Neil Shah, partner at Counterpoint Research, said investment in AI is expensive and Apple will want to pass that cost onto its users.

""Software and services makes it more lucrative for Apple to pass it on with the Apple One subscription model,"" Shah told CNBC in an interview last week.

Apple One costs $19.95 a month and gives users access to various Apple services including Apple Music.

Shah said Apple could charge between $10 and $20 for Apple Intelligence, potentially as part of Apple One, for more premium AI features.

Apple's services division brought in $24.2 billion in the June quarter, making it unique as many other hardware firms have not managed to monetize software.

""Apple is one of the few connected devices companies that has successfully monetized the value-added services it offers,"" Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, told CNBC this week.

""As a result, it has set a precedent with its users that they have to pay for more premium services. On this basis, it can't be ruled out that Apple may choose to charge for more advanced features within its Apple Intelligence offering.""

Wood added that Apple Intelligence could give the U.S. giant an option to launched a bundled subscription service with various services under a single price.

""But equally Apple will be reluctant to dilute revenue from individual products subscriptions,"" he said.

It is not unusual for technology firms to charge for their AI offerings. OpenAI, for example has a subscription fee for more advanced ChatGPT features and Microsoft charges for its AI Copilot tool.

Apple's biggest rival Samsung, which has already begun rolling out its artificial intelligence services known as Galaxy AI, is still considering various revenue models for its software, its mobile boss told CNBC last month.

For Apple, AI gives the company a chance to further lock in its already loyal customer base, according to Shah, because Apple Intelligence will learn from a user's behavior and become more personalized.

""The beauty of AI is as you use [it] more and more, it learns about you, and you get locked into the model itself because you can't bring your own model from Apple to Android,"" Shah said.

""That is where you start using more and more, you get used to it more and that is where Apple monetization hits."""
"Apple could charge up to $20 for some Apple Intelligence AI features, analysts say.",https://nypost.com/2024/08/08/business/apple-could-charge-up-to-20-for-ai-features-report/,"Apple’s new AI features may not come cheap.

The Cupertino, Calif.-based company could charge up to a $20 subscription fee for access to some of its advanced artificial intelligence features when they are finally made available this fall, analysts told CNBC.

“Software and services makes it more lucrative for Apple to pass it on with the Apple One subscription model,” Neil Shah, partner at Counterpoint Research, said.

Apple already charges customers $19.95 a month for Apple One, its package that bundles up to six premium subscriptions including Apple Music, Apple TV+ and Apple News+.

Shah told CNBC the company could charge $10 to $20 for premium AI features, or even bundle the AI features in Apple One for a higher price.

“Apple is one of the few connected devices companies that has successfully monetized the value-added services it offers,” Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, told CNBC.

“[It] has set a precedent with its users that they have to pay for more premium services. On this basis, it can’t be ruled out that Apple may choose to charge for more advanced features within its Apple Intelligence offering,” Wood told CNBC.

The Post reached out to Apple for comment.

Costs for AI can start as low as $5,000 and reach far beyond $500,000 for cutting-edge developments, according to tech consulting firm Future Processing.

And for big tech, the costs are even higher – Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and Amazon are expected to spend more than $1 trillion on AI investments, according to Goldman Sachs.

OpenAI charges a subscription fee for advanced ChatGPT features. Microsoft charges $20 a month for Copilot Pro, a version of the free Copilot program that is more advanced and uses AI.

Apple revealed the new AI features during its June conference.

The tech company made its AI program available to some software developers for testing in late July but reportedly will delay the rollout to the public until October — a few weeks after Apple had initially planned to make it available as part of its iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 releases.

Apple Intelligence includes improvements to Siri, enabling the voice assistant to better understand what users are asking and allowing it to access users’ personal information.

The AI will automatically create summaries of text messages, voicemails and emails, as well as generate emojis and images.

Last week, Apple reported second-quarter services revenue of $24.21 billion, above LSEG analysts’ expectations of $24.01 billion. The company expects its services division to continue growing at the same rate it reported over the past year, which is about 14%.

Apple Intelligence gives the company an opportunity to create an even more loyal customer base.

As customers use Apple Intelligence more and more often, it will gather more data and become more personalized. So moving on from Apple Intelligence will be a tougher move, and customers will be unable to transfer the AI to rival brands’ devices.

“The beauty of AI is as you use [it] more and more, it learns about you, and you get locked into the model itself because you can’t bring your own model from Apple to Android,” Shah told CNBC.

“That is where you start using more and more, you get used to it more and that is where Apple monetization hits.”

Rival Samsung has already begun rolling out its version of AI – Galaxy AI – onto some of its devices.

Galaxy AI can automatically generate summaries for notes, translate live conversations and translate phone calls. Samsung phones with Galaxy AI have cameras with auto zoom capabilities.

Samsung is still considering different revenue models, the president of Samsung’s mobile division told CNBC last month, so it is unclear whether the two companies will go head-to-head with AI subscriptions."
"Apple could charge up to $20 for some Apple Intelligence AI features, analysts say.",https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/apple-intelligence-subscription-price/,"Apple reportedly plans to turn some Apple Intelligence features into paid subscription services, and some analysts believe the company could charge users up to $20 per month for the privilege.



Last month, Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman said that while Apple Intelligence will be free to start, Apple's long-term plan is to launch something like ""Apple Intelligence+,"" with extra features that users pay monthly fees to access, similar to iCloud+.

Speaking to CNBC, Counterpoint Research's Neil Shah said Apple could offer the features as part of a modified Apple One subscription, and he believes an additional figure of between $10 and $20 is a realistic possibility.

""Software and services makes it more lucrative for Apple to pass it on with the Apple One subscription model,"" Shah told CNBC in an interview last week.

Apple One costs $19.95 a month and gives users access to various Apple services like Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, additional cloud storage, and more.

""Apple is one of the few connected devices companies that has successfully monetized the value-added services it offers,"" Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, told CNBC.

""As a result, it has set a precedent with its users that they have to pay for more premium services. On this basis, it can't be ruled out that Apple may choose to charge for more advanced features within its Apple Intelligence offering.""

Wood added that Apple Intelligence could give the company an option to launched a bundled subscription service with various services under a single price, akin to a new Apple One tier.

Apple in the June quarter saw a steep increase in services revenue at $24.2 billion, up from $21.2 billion a year ago and a new all-time revenue record. Analysts believe that making its own AI features another services revenue stream could allow Apple to compensate for the slower pace of hardware upgrades and also enable the company to pass the high cost of its investment in AI onto customers.

Apple has reportedly started building its own AI servers that use the M2 Ultra chip, and it is said to be developing its own AI server processor using TSMC's 3nm process for use as soon as 2025, which could enhance the performance of its data centers and future AI tools that rely on the cloud.

Apple is expected to spend several billion on hardware to support its artificial intelligence development in 2024, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Kuo said he expects Apple to spend ""at least"" $620 million on servers in 2023 and $4.75 billion on servers in 2024."
"Apple could charge up to $20 for some Apple Intelligence AI features, analysts say.",https://9to5mac.com/2024/08/08/apple-intelligence-features-costs/,"Analysts have claimed that Apple may charge for some of the more advanced Apple Intelligence features at some stage, with fees of $10-20 per month.

One possibility, they say, is that the company would require an Apple One subscription for access to the full set of AI features …

The rollout of Apple Intelligence features

Apple Intelligence will roll out in stages, with the first features already available in developer betas, and likely to officially launch (albeit labeled as a beta product) shortly after the time the iPhone 16 line-up goes on sale.

The all-new Siri isn’t expected to be available until close to the end of the year, or in 2025.

Analysts claim Apple may charge

Two analysts raised the monetization prospect when speaking to CNBC.

Neil Shah, partner at Counterpoint Research, said investment in AI is expensive and Apple will want to pass that cost onto its users […] Shah said Apple could charge between $10 and $20 for Apple Intelligence, potentially as part of Apple One, for more premium AI features […] “Apple is one of the few connected devices companies that has successfully monetized the value-added services it offers,” Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, told CNBC this week. “As a result, it has set a precedent with its users that they have to pay for more premium services. On this basis, it can’t be ruled out that Apple may choose to charge for more advanced features within its Apple Intelligence offering.”

They suggest that Apple might follow the model used by OpenAI and Microsoft: Free access to a limited number of AI features, with a subscription required to use the complete set.

9to5Mac’s Take

There is exactly zero prospect of Apple charging for any of the Apple Intelligence features rolling out this year, nor the new Siri features expected by early next year. If that had been the plan, the company would have revealed it before now.

The possibility of Apple choosing to introduce a paid Apple Intelligence tier down the road can’t be ruled out, however. Service revenue has long been an important part of the company’s revenue stream, and Apple continues to seek new subscription offerings.

Ultimately, Apple will need to find a balance between included AI features which generate hardware sales, and optional features for which customers would be willing to pay a subscription.

Apple's highly-anticipated artificial intelligence features could come with an equally high price tag.

Apple Intelligence is set to launch in two months, and analysts told CNBC that the tech giant could charge users up to $20 monthly for its premium AI tools. That's on top of owning a suitably new Apple computer or iPhone to run the technology on (unlike, say, OpenAI's ChatGPT app, which can be run off most phones).

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Like other Big Tech players, Apple is prioritizing a push forward in AI — and the spending necessary to develop it — in the hopes that its bet will pay off big.

And, according to other experts, offering the software for free is a way to get at least some return on its investments.

""Apple's consideration of a paid subscription model for premium Apple Intelligence features is a strategic move to offset the substantial costs of AI development,"" said tech analyst Jacob Bourne at Emarketer, a sister company to Business Insider.

Although its other subscription services have been booming, according to Apple's most recent earnings calls, Bourne said it should be mindful of the ""crowded market"" of monthly fees.

Apple already charges subscribers for Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, and more. Customers can combine them by paying $19.95 a month for Apple One.

At its June Worldwide Developers Conference, the company showcased AI features like AI-generated emojis, a more intuitive Siri, and an image generator. During the introduction to Apple Intelligence, the company said that its full capabilities will roll out over the course of a year starting in the fall.

Still, it'll be a balancing act if Apple wants people to pay for its AI tools, Bourne said.

He added, ""A dual approach with both free and paid tiers could be the best strategy, allowing Apple to showcase its AI capabilities while monetizing advanced features and further bolstering its already thriving services business.""

Generative AI rivals, including Microsoft, Anthropic, and Midjourney, also charge monthly fees for premium features, but Apple has an advantage that they don't: the hardware.

As long as they can ""deliver seamless, ecosystem-integrated AI tools that outperform competitors' offerings,"" Apple can rely on its extensive user base to at least test Apple Intelligence on their devices.

Apple isn’t just banking on its upcoming Apple Intelligence to spur hardware sales, it’s also hoping to monetize it as a service to bolster revenue once users are hooked . According to some analysts, the price Apple could charge for these new AI features is anywhere from $10 to $20 a month, with a possibility it gets rolled into the Apple One bundle.Services have become an increasingly large part of the revenue Apple relies on, with CNBC reporting the company earned $24.2 billion in the third quarter alone. Therefore, it’s not too surprising it will try and figure out a way to monetize Apple Intelligence to keep this type of revenue growing.The pricing the analysts are predicting might be a tough sell, though, as consumers are growing weary needing so many subscriptions that keep seeing price increases. It will be especially difficult to justify Apple Intelligence at $20 a month, when Apple One includes Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple News+, Apple Arcade, iCloud+ and more for the same amount of money. Including it as part of Apple One would undoubtedly push up the price of the bundle, and risk driving off customers who enjoy the other services.However, it's unlikely this monetization move comes anytime soon, or perhaps not at all if the planned rollout of this new feature is any indication. Apple is seemingly struggling to get Apple Intelligence up to a level where it can be released to a customer base that expects a polished product. The plan is for a piecemeal release, where more and more features get added in the months following the release of iOS 18 and iPad OS 18.Apple Intelligence will be making its partial debut later this year, and it will be interesting to see the reception from users. This reception could set the tone for whether or not Apple Intelligence finds a way to become another slice of the service revenue pie for the company."

Set to launch later this year, Apple Intelligence will initially be free but could transition to a tiered model similar to OpenAI’s ChatGPT Plus or Microsoft’s AI Copilot. While Apple has a history of offering free software updates, analysts suggest the company may follow the industry trend of monetizing advanced AI capabilities.

Apple is not doing this, at least not yet

Last updated 6 hours ago

Analysts are spitballing that Apple could charge $20 per month for Apple Intelligence — but the problem is, in the short term, this isn't based on anything and is mostly wishful analyst thinking.

This is the kind of analyst predictions that are not technically incorrect, and might come true in some form in the future on an infinite timeline — but they're also entirely wrong for the timetable that matters. Apple could charge $20 for parts of Apple Intelligence, just as the company could launch a range of furniture.

According to stock analysts who always seem to ask the same questions over and over at the earnings conference calls speaking to CNBC, it's coming real soon. Specifically, assorted analysts have pointed out to the broadcaster that Apple charges for services, and that AI costs money.

Apple prefers to make money instead of spending it — this is the quality of analysis on show here. Anyway, the stock analysts postulate that Apple could pass on that AI cost to its subscribers.

Plus, ChatGPT charges for more advanced AI features, and so does Microsoft, therefore Apple could, too. Also, reportedly Samsung is said to be ""considering various revenue models"" for its Galaxy AI.

But Apple isn't charging yet. It's hard to give away something like Apple Intelligence for free and then start charging for it later.

For instance, Apple would find it very difficult to turn around and say the Writing Tools feature now requires a subscription. It would be easier if it later introduced some wholly new feature, but none of these analysts have the remotest clue what that could be.

Given that the analysts are not wrong that AI costs money and that, startlingly, Apple likes earning cash, there is already one thing that might fit as a chargeable extra. It's that Apple has already said it is working with ChatGPT now, but it's going to add additional partners.

Those partners, such as Google Gemini, could also be fully baked into the system like ChatGPT is. But they, and other AI tools, could be offered through a new App Store.

That's been rumored before, and it is a better guess than just saying Apple will want to pass on costs to users.

But none of this is going to happen this year or next. Right now, Apple has a lot to do getting Apple Intelligence right, and getting it established, before trying to build on it."
"Apple could charge up to $20 for some Apple Intelligence AI features, analysts say.",https://www.techtimes.com/articles/307098/20240808/apple-turn-ai-features-paid-subscription-services-analysts.htm,"Apple is reportedly considering transforming some of its advanced AI features into paid subscription services, a move that could reshape how users interact with the tech giant's ecosystem.

According to recent reports, analysts speculate that these new services could cost users up to $20 per month, reflecting Apple's growing emphasis on monetizing software and services.

Would you subscribe to Apple Intelligence if it's released today?

Apple Intelligence: A New Frontier in Subscription Services

Paid subscription services are common among tech giants. If you happen to upgrade your Google Drive storage, you can pay the basic plan to add an extra 100GB for $2 per month. Microsoft also implements this in Xbox Game Pass Core at $10 per month. Apple is no different from them.

Bloomberg's Mark Gurman revealed in July that while Apple Intelligence is initially expected to be free, the company's long-term strategy might involve launching a premium version, tentatively dubbed ""Apple Intelligence+.""

Similar to the iCloud+ model, this service would offer enhanced features for a monthly fee, providing users with advanced AI capabilities that could justify the additional cost.

Pricing Expectations and the Apple One Model

Neil Shah, an analyst from Counterpoint Research, told CNBC that Apple might integrate these AI features into a modified version of its existing Apple One subscription.

Shah said that a realistic price for the upgraded service could range between $10 and $20 per month. Given that Apple One currently costs $19.95 per month and includes popular services like Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, and additional cloud storage, adding AI-powered features could make this package even more appealing to users.

""Apple has successfully monetized value-added services across its product ecosystem, and AI could be the next frontier,"" Shah stated.

The Precedent of Paid Services

Ben Wood, Chief of Research at CCS Insight, pointed out that the iPhone maker has already established a strong precedent for charging users for premium services.

As a result, it wouldn't be surprising if the company extends this approach to its AI offerings. Wood also mentioned that Apple could introduce a new tier within Apple One, bundling various services under a single, unified price.

Either way, this strategy aligns with Apple's broader goals of expanding its services revenue, which has seen substantial growth, according to MacRumors.

In the June quarter alone, Apple reported a record-breaking $24.2 billion in services revenue, up from $21.2 billion the previous year.

Analysts believe that by making AI features a part of this revenue stream, Apple can offset the slower pace of hardware innovation and pass on the high costs associated with AI development to customers.

Apple's AI Ambitions and Infrastructure Investments

Apple's commitment to AI extends beyond software. The company has reportedly begun building its own AI servers powered by the M2 Ultra chip. Additionally, Apple is said to be developing a custom AI server processor using TSMC's 3nm process, which could be deployed as early as 2025. These developments suggest that Apple is investing heavily in the infrastructure needed to support its AI ambitions.

According to renowned Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the company is expected to spend several billion dollars on hardware to bolster its AI capabilities in 2024. Kuo predicts that Apple will invest ""at least"" $620 million on servers in 2023, with spending projected to soar to $4.75 billion in 2024.

As Apple continues to refine its AI technologies, the introduction of a paid subscription model could be a game-changer. By integrating advanced AI features into its existing services ecosystem, the company not only enhances the user experience but also opens up new revenue streams.

Earlier this month, Tech Times reported that Apple is working with regulators to make Apple Intelligence accessible to other parts of the world. The report says that AI will come to China and Europe.

AAPL could charge its users up to $20 for its advanced artificial intelligence features, according to a top analyst. The move could further bolster the company’s already lucrative services business.

What Happened: Apple is gearing up to roll out Apple Intelligence, its new AI system, across some of its devices later this year. The system, announced in June, includes enhanced features for the Siri voice assistant and other generative AI features aimed at enhancing the email and image editing experience, among other things.

Neil Shah, a partner at Counterpoint Research, explained that the high cost of AI development could prompt Apple to pass on the expense to its users. ""Software and services makes [sic] it more lucrative for Apple to pass it on with the Apple One subscription model,"" Shah said in an interview with CNBC.

Apple One currently costs $19.95 a month and provides access to various Apple services, including Apple Music. The potential introduction of a premium AI feature subscription could further boost Apple’s services segment, which generated $24.2 billion in the previous quarter.

Alphabet Inc.‘s GOOGL GOOG Google, Apple’s rival, offers many AI features in its Pixel phones for free.

The Pixel 8 Pro, the first to run Gemini Nano, powers features like Summarize in the Recorder app, Magic Compose for rewriting messages, and Magic Editor in Google Photos for object movement and lighting enhancement. Google also leverages AI to reduce blur and visual noise in photos.

It is common for technology companies to charge for their AI services. For instance, OpenAI has a subscription fee for advanced ChatGPT features, and Microsoft Corp. MSFT charges for its AI Copilot tool. Another Apple rival, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd., also offers AI services with its latest flagship smartphones, but it has yet to charge a fee for them.

These features will be gradually rolled out, with some regions possibly being charged a subscription fee for the more advanced apps.

Why It Matters: The tech industry has been witnessing a surge in AI-related developments. At the Google I/O event in May, Google announced several AI-related features, including AI Overviews, a revamped version of Search Generative Experiences designed for complex questions.

Apple’s potential AI subscription model follows its rivals’ moves. In March, Google introduced a new bundle for its subscribers in the UK, adding value to its cloud storage plans with the inclusion of Nest Aware and Fitbit Premium.

Recently, a Reddit user found pre-prompt instructions embedded in Apple's developer beta for macOS 15.1. These instructions offer a rare glimpse into the backend of Apple's AI features, such as the Smart Reply feature in Apple Mail and the Memories feature in Apple Photos.

Apple Intelligence could be part of Apple One subscription

Apple may charge $20 monthly fee for advanced AI features

By Mudit Dube 12:31 pm Aug 08, 202412:31 pm

What's the story Apple is considering a fee of up to $20 for its upcoming advanced artificial intelligence (AI) features, according to industry analysts. The tech giant plans to roll out 'Apple Intelligence,' a new AI system, across select devices later this year. This system, announced in June, promises an improved Siri voice assistant and capabilities such as automatic generation of emails and images.

Subscription speculation

Apple Intelligence could be part of Apple One subscription

Analysts predict that Apple may introduce a subscription fee for these advanced AI features. Neil Shah, partner at Counterpoint Research, suggested that the company could charge between $10 and $20 for Apple Intelligence. He further speculated that this could potentially be included in the existing Apple One subscription model for premium AI services.

Monetization strategy

Apple's successful monetization of value-added services

Apple's services division generated a whopping $24.2 billion in the June quarter, highlighting its successful software monetization strategy. Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, told CNBC that ""Apple is one of the few connected devices companies that has successfully monetized the value-added services it offers."" He also suggested that Apple Intelligence could provide an opportunity for the company to launch a bundled subscription service with various services under a single price.

AI pricing

Apple's approach to AI offerings and market competition

Charging for advanced AI features is a common practice among tech firms, with companies like OpenAI and Microsoft already implementing subscription fees for their advanced ChatGPT features and AI Copilot tool, respectively. Samsung, a major competitor of Apple, has begun rolling out its Galaxy AI services but is still exploring various revenue models for its software."

Mark Gurman for Bloomberg News:

‎

Apple Inc. is planning a new version of the Mac mini that will be its smallest desktop computer yet, part of a broader overhaul of the Mac line with AI-focused chips.

The new model — due later this year — will mark the first major design change to the mini since it was revamped under Steve Jobs in 2010, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The device will be far smaller than its predecessor, approaching the size of an Apple TV set-top box, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the work is secret.

Apple has tested models with at least three USB-C ports on the back of the mini, in addition to an area for plugging in the power cable and an HDMI port for connecting the device to TV sets and monitors.

People involved in the development of the new Mac mini say it’s essentially an iPad Pro in a small box — an approach that takes advantage of the lower power requirements of the company’s in-house silicon…

Apple is preparing two versions of the new Mac mini, both of which are codenamed J773. The first will use the base configuration of the M4 chip, similar to the component inside of the iPad Pro. There will also be a higher-end Mac mini that uses a yet-to-be-announced M4 Pro chip…

Apple suppliers are planning to begin shipping units of the standard M4 version this month for release later in the year. Units with the higher-end M4 Pro won’t be ready for consumers until October."
"Apple could charge up to $20 for some Apple Intelligence AI features, analysts say.",https://www.pc-tablet.com/apple-could-charge-up-to-20-for-some-apple-intelligence-ai-features-analysts-say/,"Explore why Apple might charge up to $20 for premium Apple Intelligence AI features and how this could affect users and the broader tech industry.

In a move that could shift how consumers engage with artificial intelligence, Apple is reportedly considering a pricing model for its advanced AI features, potentially up to $20 per month. This strategic decision seems to align with Apple’s aim to enhance its lucrative services segment while integrating more AI into user experiences across its devices.

What’s Happening?

Apple Intelligence, the tech giant’s forthcoming suite of AI capabilities, is speculated to include premium features that might come with a cost. Analysts are predicting a fee structure where users might have to pay between $10 and $20 monthly, particularly for more advanced functionalities. This fee could potentially be bundled with the Apple One subscription service, which already offers a combination of Apple’s digital services at a unified price​.

Why Consider Charging?

The development and deployment of generative AI are resource-intensive, requiring significant investments in computing power and data management. Apple, known for its robust ecosystem and high consumer trust levels, may leverage this pricing strategy to offset the high costs associated with AI development. This approach also follows a trend where tech companies are increasingly seeking to monetize advanced AI capabilities through subscription models.

Consumer Impact

The potential introduction of a paywall for premium AI features could influence consumer decisions, especially regarding device upgrades and service subscriptions. Users with older iPhone models lacking the necessary specifications for Apple Intelligence might face pressure to upgrade to newer models to access these AI features. This strategy not only drives hardware sales but also enhances user reliance on Apple’s ecosystem, potentially increasing customer loyalty over time​.

Industry Context

Apple is not alone in exploring paid AI services; other tech giants like Samsung and Google have also been integrating AI more deeply into their product offerings. However, Apple’s approach might differ by incorporating these services into an existing subscription model, which could simplify access for users but also raise questions about the overall value proposition, especially if the price of Apple One increases​.

As Apple rolls out its AI features, the exact pricing and packaging will be crucial in determining user acceptance and market impact. The company’s strategy will likely evolve based on user feedback and competitive dynamics in the tech industry. Observers and consumers alike are keenly watching to see how Apple will balance innovation, user experience, and monetization in an increasingly AI-driven market landscape.

The possibility of Apple charging for AI features underscores a broader industry trend towards monetized digital services. While this move could enhance Apple’s service offerings and revenue, it also poses new choices for consumers balancing cost against the value of advanced AI functionalities."
"Apple could charge up to $20 for some Apple Intelligence AI features, analysts say.",https://www.gearrice.com/update/apple-intelligence-to-be-paid-for-report-says-apple-could-charge-20-a-month/,"Apple Intelligence is one of the biggest investments Apple has made, and it could be used on a subscription basis in the future, according to analysts.

Apple Intelligence and its future features could be paid

Apple Intelligence is in full development and this can be seen with the launch of the first beta of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1 and macOS Sequoia 15.1. Being One of the greatest features developed and released in recent yearsthere is speculation about what it could offer in the future and whether Apple could benefit from this by charging for using features that turn out to be novel.. Mark Gurman already anticipated it at the beginning of July as a subscription scheme, now Other analysts are suggesting a new service for which Apple could charge up to $20 a month..

Those from Cupertino would charge for using Apple Intelligence

Apple’s investment in artificial intelligence is not cheap. According to a Interview conducted by CNBC analysts Neil Shah of Counterpoint Research; Ben Wood, head of research at CCS Insight, It will be imminent that in the future those from Cupertino will pass on this investment cost to their users..

The most viable scheme is that join Apple One starting at a fee of $10 and could be capped at 20. The direct benefit would be more “premium” AI features.

The reality is that time and history prove the analysts right. They claim that Apple is one of the few companies that has “very successfully monetized its value-added services”Apple’s services arm has become one of the most profitable business models in the world.

Considering that Apple already charges additional fees for premium services, including Apple One itself, There is no doubt that those in Cupertino will charge a fee for using the most advanced features of Apple IntelligenceMicrosoft is already doing this with Copilot, which can be used for free but with limited AI features. By paying for the subscription, the user has access to the full set of functionalities.

When will I start being charged for using Apple Intelligence?

Apple has a problem for now, its artificial intelligence is in a beta stage and with a limitation regarding languages.This could lead to a long-term and long-term delay in the use of Apple Intelligence. The features that are present today are not even the most brilliant, and the real dish that is Siri is not present either.

What is a reality is that Apple Intelligence will consolidate Apple’s services division. Subscription for its AI is imminent and there will surely be different ways to access it. First you will have to launch several compatible devices, make it functional in a good part of languages and then we’ll see if there are any new developments that are important enough to consider paying for.

Next year will be crucial for Apple Intelligence as the new Siri is expected to be released and will be out of beta sometime in 2025. Another very important point will be to resolve the availability and use of Apple Intelligence in the EU and China.

Apple announced iOS 18 at its WWDC developers conference in June, unveiling one of the most significant software updates in its history. The standout feature in this update is the introduction of Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-powered tools for iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

Apple Intelligence is expected to launch in October, a month later than initially planned, following Apple’s September iPhone event. When it does become available, the AI features will be free for users, but this might not be a permanent arrangement. Reports suggest that Apple could introduce a paid version of these features down the line.

In July, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman speculated that while Apple Intelligence will start as a free offering, it could eventually evolve into “Apple Intelligence+,” a premium version requiring a subscription. This view is supported by Neil Shah of Counterpoint Research, who recently told CNBC that Apple might integrate these advanced AI features into an upgraded Apple One subscription, potentially increasing the monthly cost by $10 to $20.

Adding to this, Ben Wood from CCS Insight pointed out that Apple’s track record of monetizing its services makes it likely that the company will charge for its most advanced AI tools. As noted by iMore, he suggested that Apple might introduce a new, even more premium tier within the Apple One bundle to include these features. Given that Apple’s services revenue reached $24.2 billion in the June quarter alone, up from $21.2 billion the previous year, it’s clear why the company would want to explore AI as a new revenue stream.

While users will initially enjoy Apple Intelligence for free, the most powerful features—such as the revamped Siri and image generation capabilities—might eventually come with a price tag. As Apple continues to shift focus from hardware sales to service-based revenue, the potential paywalling of these AI tools could be a strategic move to sustain growth in an increasingly competitive market."
"Apple could charge up to $20 for some Apple Intelligence AI features, analysts say.",http://www.econotimes.com/Apple-Intelligence-Subscription-Analysts-Estimate-Monthly-Features-at-20-1683716,"Experts suggest Apple Intelligence may charge up to $20 monthly for its advanced features, echoing other Apple subscription models.

Analysts Estimate Apple Intelligence Pricing

While Apple Intelligence will initially be free, Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman reported last month that Apple is planning to provide a paid service similar to iCloud+ in the future, called ""Apple Intelligence+,"" which will offer additional functionality to consumers for a monthly subscription.

If Apple were to include the capabilities in a revamped Apple One membership, according to Neil Shah of Counterpoint Research, who spoke with CNBC, the extra $10–$20 would be a reasonable price.

""Software and services makes it more lucrative for Apple to pass it on with the Apple One subscription model,"" Shah told CNBC last week.

Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, extra cloud storage, and more are all part of Apple One, which users may access for $19.95 per month.

Premium Features for Apple Users

""Apple is one of the few connected devices companies that has successfully monetized the value-added services it offers,"" Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, said to CNBC. ""As a result, it has set a precedent with its users that they have to pay for more premium services. On this basis, it can't be ruled out that Apple may choose to charge for more advanced features within its Apple Intelligence offering.""

According to Wood, Apple Intelligence may provide the business with the opportunity to introduce a subscription service that bundles multiple services into one, similar to the new Apple One tier, but with a single pricing.

With $24.2 billion, up from $21.2 billion a year ago, services revenue set a new record for Apple in the June quarter, marking a sharp increase. Experts think that Apple may make up for the sluggish rate of hardware improvements and pass the high cost of its investment in AI onto users by creating its own AI features as an additional revenue stream from services.

AI Server Advancements

Per MacRumors, it has been alleged that Apple has begun manufacturing its own AI servers utilizing the M2 Ultra chip. Rumor has it that the company is also working on an AI server processor using TSMC's 3nm technology, which may be ready for usage as early as 2025. If true, this might improve the efficiency of Apple's data centers and any future cloud-based AI tools.

Apple expert Ming-Chi Kuo predicts that in 2024, the tech giant would invest billions in hardware to bolster its AI research and development efforts. Analyst Kuo predicted that Apple would invest ""at least"" $620 million in servers in 2023 and $4.75 billion in 2024."

"Apple could charge up to $20 for some Apple Intelligence AI features, analysts say.",https://emeatribune.com/putin-accuses-ukraine-of-major-provocation-in-attack-on-russias-kursk/,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused Ukraine of a “major provocation” after Moscow said it was battling a major cross-border attack on the southwestern Kursk region.

Alexey Smirnov, the region’s acting governor, said he had introduced a state of emergency amid two days of fierce fighting.

The Ministry of Health said 31 civilians, including six children, had been injured on Wednesday. Smirnov said the day before that five people had been killed as Ukrainian troops backed by tanks and armoured vehicles breached the border.

Russia did not provide any information on military casualties.

“The Kyiv regime has launched another major provocation,” Putin told Russian government officials on Wednesday, referring to the attack in the Kursk region, which borders Ukraine’s northern Sumy region.

Ukraine has not commented directly on the attack, but Russia’s Ministry of Defence said Ukrainian forces were pushing to the northwest of the border town of Sudzha, 530km (330 miles) southwest of Moscow.

Russia said it used air and artillery firepower to repel the attack throughout Wednesday, after earlier rushing reinforcements to the region.

Witnesses interviewed on Russian television said they had fled border areas in cars under drone fire. A priest in Sudzha, Evgeny Shestopalov, said in a video shared by Russian media, that the town of about 5,000 people was “on fire” and that residents unable to evacuate had taken shelter in his church.

The extent of the damage and the depth of the Ukrainian advance remains unclear, however.

Several reports from Ukrainian and Russian military bloggers suggested the fighters had gained several kilometres.

The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington, DC-based think tank, said in its August 7 update that geolocated footage suggested Ukraine may have advanced as far as 10km (6.2 miles) inside Russia. It said the troops appeared to be trying to advance along the Sudzha-Korenovo highway.

At the meeting with Putin, Valery Gerasimov, the chief of Russia’s General Staff, said Russian forces had halted an attack by as many as 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers – more than three times the figure that the Defence Ministry had stated as involved on Tuesday – and would push them back to the border.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made no reference to the events in Kursk in his nightly video address, while the General Staff did not mention it in its daily battlefield update. In a late evening report, it said fighting had intensified in the Sumy region, where authorities have evacuated about 6,000 people.

The General Staff said Russian forces had deployed aircraft, helicopters and heavy weapons in the area, “but made no headway and suffered significant losses”.

In Washington, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said the United States was seeking an understanding from Ukraine on the incursion, and said it had had no advance knowledge of it.

US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby stressed the US had not changed its policy on Ukraine’s use of US-supplied weaponry, which could be used only “to target imminent threats just across the border”.

US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said of the Kremlin: “It is a little bit rich, them calling it a provocation, given Russia violated Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.”

The battles around Sudzha come as Russia announces advances along the front line in Ukraine’s east and claims to have taken 420 square kilometres (162 square miles) of territory from Ukrainian forces since June 14.

Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Pro-Kyiv forces, including units of Russians fighting on Ukraine’s side, such as the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Freedom of Russia Legion, have made several brief incursions into Russia since then.

Financial services companies and their digital technology suppliers are under intense pressure to achieve compliance with strict new rules from the EU that require them to boost their cyber resilience. By the start of next year, financial services firms and their technology suppliers will have to make sure that they’re in compliance with a new incoming law from the European Union known as DORA, or the Digital Operational Resilience Act. CNBC runs through what you need to know about DORA — including what it is, why it matters, and what banks are doing to make sure they’re prepared for it.

What is DORA?

DORA requires banks, insurance companies and investment to strengthen their IT security. The EU regulation also seeks to ensure the financial services industry is resilient in the event of a severe disruption to operations. Such disruptions could include a ransomware attack that causes a financial company’s computers to shut down, or a DDOS (distributed denial of service) attack that forces a firm’s website to go offline. The regulation also seeks to help firms avoid major outage events, such as the historic IT meltdown last month caused by cyber firm CrowdStrike when a simple software update issued by the company forced Microsoft’s Windows operating system to crash. Multiple banks, payment firms and investment companies — from JPMorgan Chase and Santander , to Visa and Charles Schwab — were unable to provide service due to the outage. It took these firms several hours to restore service to consumers. In the future, such an event would fall under the type of service disruption that would face scrutiny under the EU’s incoming rules. Mike Sleightholme, president of fintech firm Broadridge International, notes that a standout factor of DORA is that it doesn’t just focus on what banks do to ensure resiliency — it also takes a close look at firms’ tech suppliers.

Under DORA, banks will be required to undertake rigorous IT risk management, incident management, classification and reporting, digital operational resilience testing, information and intelligence sharing in relation to cyber threats and vulnerabilities, and measures to manage third-party risks. Firms will be required to conduct assessments of “concentration risk” related to the outsourcing of critical or important operational functions to external companies. These IT providers often deliver “critical digital services to customers,” said Joe Vaccaro, general manager of Cisco-owned internet quality monitoring firm ThousandEyes. “These third-party providers must now be part of the testing and reporting process, meaning financial services companies need to adopt solutions that help them uncover and map these sometimes hidden dependencies with providers,” he told CNBC. Banks will also have to “expand their ability to assure the delivery and performance of digital experiences across not just the infrastructure they own, but also the one they don’t,” Vaccaro added.

When does the law apply?

DORA entered into force on Jan. 16, 2023, but the rules won’t be enforced by EU member states until Jan. 17, 2025. The EU has prioritised these reforms because of how the financial sector is increasingly dependent on technology and tech companies to deliver vital services. This has made banks and other financial services providers more vulnerable to cyberattacks and other incidents. “There’s a lot of focus on third-party risk management” now, Sleightholme told CNBC. “Banks use third-party service providers for important parts of their technology infrastructure.” “Enhanced recovery time objectives is an important part of it. It really is about security around technology, with a particular focus on cybersecurity recoveries from cyber events,” he added. Many EU digital policy reforms from the last few years tend to focus on the obligations of companies themselves to make sure their systems and frameworks are robust enough to protect against damaging events like the loss of data to hackers or unauthorized individuals and entities. The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, for example, requires companies to ensure the way they process personally identifiable information is done with consent, and that it’s handled with sufficient protections to minimize the potential of such data being exposed in a breach or leak. DORA will focus more on banks’ digital supply chain — which represents a new, potentially less comfortable legal dynamic for financial firms.

What if a firm fails to comply?

For financial firms that fall foul of the new rules, EU authorities will have the power to levy fines of up to 2% of their annual global revenues. Individual managers can also be held responsible for breaches. Sanctions on individuals within financial entities could come in as high a 1 million euros ($1.1 million). For IT providers, regulators can levy fines of as high as 1% of average daily global revenues in the previous business year. Firms can also be fined every day for up to six months until they achieve compliance. Third-party IT firms deemed “critical” by EU regulators could face fines of up to 5 million euros — or, in the case of an individual manager, a maximum of 500,000 euros.

That’s slightly less severe than a law such as GDPR, under which firms can be fined up to 10 million euros ($10.9 million), or 4% of their annual global revenues — whichever is the higher amount. Carl Leonard, EMEA cybersecurity strategist at security software firm Proofpoint, stresses that criminal sanctions may vary from member state to member state depending on how each EU country applies the rules in their respective markets. DORA also calls for a “principle of proportionality” when it comes to penalties in response to breaches of the legislation, Leonard added. That means any response to legal failings would have to balance the time, effort and money firms spend on enhancing their internal processes and security technologies against how critical the service they’re offering is and what data they’re trying to protect.

Are banks and their suppliers ready?

Stephen McDermid, EMEA chief security officer for cybersecurity firm Okta, told CNBC that many financial services firms have prioritized using existing internal operational resilience and third-party risk programs to get into compliance with DORA and “identify any gaps they may have.” “This is the intention of DORA, to create alignment of many existing governance programs under a single supervisory authority and harmonise them across the EU,” he added. Fredrik Forslund vice president and general manager of international at data sanitization firm Blancco, warned that though banks and tech vendors have been making progress toward compliance with DORA, there’s still “work to be done.” On a scale from one to 10 — with a value of one representing noncompliance and 10 representing full compliance — Forslund said, “We’re at 6 and we’re scrambling to get to 7.” “We know that we have to be at a 10 by January,” he said, adding that “not everyone will be there by January.”

Hackers have Exploited An 18-year-old ‘0.0’.,https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/0000-day-18-year-old-browser.html,"Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new ""0.0.0.0 Day"" impacting all major web browsers that malicious websites could take advantage of to breach local networks.

The critical vulnerability ""exposes a fundamental flaw in how browsers handle network requests, potentially granting malicious actors access to sensitive services running on local devices,"" Oligo Security researcher Avi Lumelsky said.

The Israeli application security company said the implications of the vulnerability are far-reaching, and that it stems from the inconsistent implementation of security mechanisms and a lack of standardization across different browsers.

As a result, a seemingly harmless IP address such as 0.0.0.0 could be weaponized to exploit local services, resulting in unauthorized access and remote code execution by attackers outside the network. The loophole is said to have been around since 2006.

0.0.0.0 Day impacts Google Chrome/Chromium, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari that enables external websites to communicate with software that runs locally on MacOS and Linux. It does not affect Windows devices as Microsoft blocks the IP address at the operating system level.

Particularly, Oligo Security found that public websites using domains ending in "".com"" are able to communicate with services running on the local network and execute arbitrary code on the visitor's host by using the address 0.0.0.0 as opposed to localhost/127.0.0.1.

It's also a bypass of Private Network Access (PNA), which is designed to prohibit public websites from directly accessing endpoints located within private networks.

Any application that runs on localhost and can be reached via 0.0.0.0 is likely susceptible to remote code execution, including local Selenium Grid instances by dispatching a POST request to 0.0.0[.]0:4444 with a crafted payload.

In response to the findings in April 2024, web browsers are expected to block access to 0.0.0.0 completely, thereby deprecating direct access to private network endpoints from public websites.

""When services use localhost, they assume a constrained environment,"" Lumelsky said. ""This assumption, which can (as in the case of this vulnerability) be faulty, results in insecure server implementations.""

""By using 0.0.0.0 together with mode 'no-cors,' attackers can use public domains to attack services running on localhost and even gain arbitrary code execution (RCE), all using a single HTTP request."""
Hackers have Exploited An 18-year-old ‘0.0’.,https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40244247/popular-browsers-chrome-safari-and-firefox-fall-prey-to-major-18-year-old-security-hole-that-allows,"A significant security loophole has been exploited in major browsers, including Apple Inc.’s AAPL Safari, Alphabet Inc.’s GOOG GOOGL Google Chrome, and Mozilla’s Firefox. This vulnerability, present for nearly two decades, has allowed hackers to infiltrate private networks, even those protected by firewalls.

What Happened: The issue stems from the way these browsers process queries to a 0.0.0.0 IP address. These queries are redirected to other IP addresses, including “localhost,” a server typically used for testing code in a private setting, reported Forbes.

Israeli cybersecurity startup Oligo discovered that hackers have been exploiting this vulnerability to gain access to private data. The attack, known as a “0.0.0.0-day” attack, involves luring the target into visiting a seemingly innocuous website that sends a malicious request to access files via 0.0.0.0.

“Developer code and internal messaging are good examples of some of the info that can be accessed right away,” stated Avi Lumelsky, an AI security researcher at Oligo.

“But more importantly, exploiting 0.0.0.0-day can let the attacker access the internal private network of the victim, opening a wide range of attack vectors,” added Lumelsky.

Apple has confirmed to Forbes that it plans to block all attempts by websites to access 0.0.0.0 in the macOS 15 Sequoia beta. Google's Chromium and Chrome security teams are also considering a similar move, according to online posts, the report noted.

On the other hand, Mozilla has not yet introduced a solution in Firefox, citing concerns that blocking 0.0.0.0 could disrupt servers that use the address as a substitute for localhost.

Apple, Google, and Mozilla did not immediately respond to Benzinga’s request for comments.

Notably, Microsoft Corp.’s MSFT Windows systems are immune to this attack as the tech giant has blocked 0.0.0.0 on its operating system.

The researchers are scheduled to present their findings at the DEF CON conference in Las Vegas this weekend.

Why It Matters: The IP address 0.0.0.0 is a non-routable IPv4 address with several uses, primarily as a default or placeholder address.

The Internet Engineering Task Force defines the IP address 0.0.0.0 as a reserved, special-purpose address for “this host, this network,” according to TechTarget.

Despite its valid address syntax, a client device using it as a source IP address cannot communicate on a network. This makes exploiting this address by hackers a significant concern, as it allows them to breach private networks undetected.

The breach is being presented by cybersecurity firm Oglio at Def Con later this week and involves an IP address with a special purpose.

Devices connected to the internet use IP addresses for device and location identification, and the IP address 0.0.0.0 is used for special circumstances (it’s usually used as a stand-in address until the actual address is available). Oglio researcher found that hackers have been exploiting the way Safari, Chrome, and Firefox handle queries to a 0.0.0.0 IP address. According to Forbes, the browsers send the queries “to other IP addresses, including ‘localhost,’ a server on a network or computer that is typically private and is often used to test in-development code.” A hacker can send a request to the address to get private data.

Forbes confirmed with Apple that Safari in macOS Sequoia will block any website attempting to contact the 0.0.0.0 IP address. Google has a blog post that describes its plans to do a similar thing with Chrome. Mozilla told Forbes that it does not have plans to block 0.0.0.0 queries in Mozilla, but the company is researching the issue.

Since the fix is based on Safari and not OS based, it will be included in Safari 18 when it becomes available for older versions of macOS, such as Sonoma and Ventura.

How to protect yourself from hacker attacks

Apple has protections in place within macOS and the company releases security patches through OS updates, so it’s important to install them when they are available. If Apple pulls back an update, the company will reissue it as soon as it is properly revised with corrections.

Macworld has several guides to help, including a guide on whether or not you need antivirus software, a list of Mac viruses, malware, and trojans, and a comparison of Mac security software."
Hackers have Exploited An 18-year-old ‘0.0’.,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/18-year-old-security-flaw-in-firefox-and-chrome-exploited-in-attacks/,"A vulnerability disclosed 18 years ago, dubbed ""0.0.0.0 Day"", allows malicious websites to bypass security in Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari and interact with services on a local network.

However, it should be noted that this only affects Linux and macOS devices, and does not work on Windows.

For impacted devices, threat actors can exploit this flaw to remotely change settings, gain unauthorized access to protected information, and, in some cases, achieve remote code execution.

Despite being reported in 2008, 18 years ago, this problem remains unresolved on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, though all three have acknowledged the problem and are working towards a fix.

Report from 18 years ago

Source: Oligo Security

Researchers at Oligo Security report that the risk not only makes attacks theoretically possible, but has observed multiple threat actors exploiting the vulnerability as part of their attack chains.

The 0.0.0.0 Day flaw

The 0.0.0.0 Day vulnerability stems from inconsistent security mechanisms across different browsers and the lack of standardization that allows public websites to communicate with local network services using the ""wildcard"" IP address 0.0.0.0.

Typically, 0.0.0.0 represents all IP addresses on the local machine or all network interfaces on the host. It can be used as a placeholder address in DHCP requests or interpreted as the localhost (127.0.0.1) when used in local networking.

Malicious websites can send HTTP requests to 0.0.0.0 targeting a service running on the user's local machine, and due to a lack of consistent security, these requests are often routed to the service and processed.

Existing protection mechanisms like Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and Private Network Access (PNA) fail to stop this risky activity, explains Oligo.

By default, web browsers prevent a website from making requests to a third-party website and utilizing the returned information. This was done to prevent malicious websites from connecting to other URLs in a visitor's web browser that they may be authenticated on, such as an online banking portal, email servers, or another sensitive site.

Web browsers introduced Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow websites to access data from another site if they are explicitly allowed to.

""CORS is also great, and already makes the internet much safer. CORS prevents the responses from reaching the attacker, so attackers cannot read data when making invalid requests. When submitting a request, If the CORS headers are not present in the response, the attacker’s Javascript code will not be able to read the response’s content.

‍

CORS would only stop the response before it propagates to JavaScript, but opaque requests can be dispatched in mode “no-cors” and reach the server successfully—if we don’t care about the responses. "" ❖ Oligo ❖ Oligo

For example, if a threat actor's goal is simply to reach an HTTP endpoint running on a local device that could be used to change a setting or execute a task, then the output is unnecessary.

Oligo explains that the Private Network Access (PNA) security feature does it a bit differently than CORs by blocking any requests attempting to connect to IP addresses considered local or private.

However, Oligo's research uncovered that the special 0.0.0.0 IP address is not included in the list of restricted PNA addresses, like 127.0.0.1 is, for example, so the implementation is weak.

Therefore, if a request is made in ""no-cors"" mode to this special address, it can bypass PNA and still connect to a webserver URL running on 127.0.0.1.

BleepingComputer confirmed the flaw worked in a test on Linux with the Firefox browser.

Actively exploited

Unfortunately, the risk isn't just theoretical. Oligo Security has identified several cases where the ""0.0.0.0 Day"" vulnerability is activity exploited in the wild.

The first case is the ShadowRay campaign, which the same researchers documented last March. This campaign targets AI workloads running locally on developers' machines (Ray clusters).

The attack begins with the victim clicking on a link sent via email or found on a malicious site that triggers JavaScript to send an HTTP request to 'http://0[.]0[.]0[.]0:8265', typically used by Ray.

Those requests reach the local Ray cluster, opening up scenarios of arbitrary code execution, reverse shells, and configuration alterations.

Another case is a campaign targeting Selenium Grid, discovered by Wiz last month. In this campaign, attackers use JavaScript on a public domain to send requests to 'http://0[.]0[.]0[.]0:4444.'

Those requests are routed to the Selenium Grid servers, enabling the attackers to execute code or conduct network reconnaissance.

Finally, the ""ShellTorch"" vulnerability was reported by Oligo in October 2023, where the TorchServe web panel was bound to the 0.0.0.0 IP address by default instead of localhost, exposing it to malicious requests.

Browsers developer's responses

Oligo reports a sudden uptick in the number of public websites communicating with 0.0.0.0 since last month, which has now reached about 100,000.

In response to Oligo's disclosure of this activity, the web browser developers are finally starting to take action:

Google Chrome, the world's most popular web browser, has decided to take action and block access to 0.0.0.0 via a gradual rollout lasting from version 128 (upcoming) until version 133.

Mozilla Firefox does not implement PNA, but it's a high development priority. Until PNA is implemented, a temporary fix has been set in motion, but no rollout dates were provided.

Apple has implemented additional IP checks on Safari via changes on WebKit and blocks access to 0.0.0.0 on version 18 (upcoming), which will be introduced with macOS Sequoia.

Until browser fixes arrive, Oligo recommends that app developers implement the following security measures:

Implement PNA headers.

Verify HOST headers to protect against DNS rebinding attacks.

Don't trust localhost—add authorization, even locally.

Use HTTPS whenever possible.

Implement CSRF tokens, even for local apps.

Most importantly, developers must remember that until fixes roll out, it's still possible for malicious websites to route HTTP requests to internal IP addresses. Therefore, they should keep this security consideration in mind when developing their apps."
Hackers have Exploited An 18-year-old ‘0.0’.,https://www.gearrice.com/update/apple-to-patch-18-year-old-0-0-0-0-flaw-in-safari/,"A security flaw that has been exploited for nearly 20 years by hackers to gain access to internal networks will finally be fixed by Apple in the next version of macOS. Researchers at Oligo Security, who discovered the vulnerability, dubbed “0.0.0.0-day,” will present it this weekend at the DEF CON conference.

A hole in the navigators’ racket

Safari, Chrome, and Firefox are all affected by the flaw, which is in how they handle requests to the 0.0.0.0 IP address. Instead of blocking them, the browsers redirect them to other IP addresses, including “localhost,” which is often used as an internal test server.

Hackers can thus send malicious requests to 0.0.0.0 to access private files and data on their victim’s network. “Development code or internal messages can be recovered immediately,” explains Avi Lumelsky, researcher at Oligo. “But more importantly, exploiting the 0.0.0.0-day allows the attacker to access the victim’s internal private network, opening up a wide range of attack vectors.”

Apple and Google will patch, not Mozilla

Oligo responsibly disclosed the flaw to Apple, Google, and Mozilla. The Cupertino company confirmed to Forbes that it will block all attempts by websites to access 0.0.0.0 starting with the macOS Sequoia beta. Google plans to do the same in an upcoming Chrome update.

Mozilla is more reluctant because blocking 0.0.0.0 could break some servers that use that address as a substitute for localhost. “Imposing stricter restrictions carries a significant risk of introducing compatibility issues,” a Mozilla spokesperson said. Firefox will therefore not apply this fix for the moment.

A critical vulnerability that is greatly underestimated

Still, Oligo researchers say the risk of leaving this door open is significant. “By allowing 0.0.0.0, you’re actually allowing everything you’ve been blocking for years,” says Gal Elbaz, Oligo’s co-founder. The flaw, he says, allows firewalls and other network protections to be bypassed.

Attacks exploiting the 0.0.0.0-day aren’t just theoretical. Google has received “multiple reports of malware leveraging this flaw to attack specific development frameworks.” It was high time to patch this 18-year-old vulnerability. This flaw is a reminder that even tech giants like Apple aren’t immune to letting vulnerabilities go unnoticed for years, hence the importance of having an outside eye and security researchers analyzing their systems. In any case, let’s hope that Mozilla eventually follows Apple and Google’s lead.

Hackers have Exploited An 18-year-old ‘0.0’.,https://passionategeekz.com/chrome-finally-addresses-decades-old-security-loophole/,"Google Chrome has finally addressed a long-standing security vulnerability in the browser for nearly two decades. The loophole, tied to how Chrome and other systems interpret the IP address 0.0.0.0, has been a significant security concern for years. Hackers have exploited this gap to bypass Chrome’s Private Network Access (PNA) protections. The issue has persisted for at least 18 years, according to a recent report by Oligo Security via Forbes.

Understanding the old Chrome loophole

The loophole revolves around the IP address 0.0.0.0, which, unlike other IP addresses, lacks a universally agreed-upon standard for handling. Some systems don’t recognize it as a valid address, while others treat it similarly to the well-known 127.0.0.1 loopback address. This inconsistency creates confusion, leading to potential exploitation by malicious actors.

Hackers have found a way to misuse the 0.0.0.0 address to circumvent Chrome’s security mechanisms. Private Network Access (PNA) in Chrome prevents unauthorized access to local network resources by separating them from the broader internet. However, due to the loophole, attackers could bypass PNA protections using the 0.0.0.0 address, potentially gaining access to sensitive information on local networks.

Chrome’s Private Network Access Vulnerability

Chrome’s Private Network Access system was built to secure users by blocking unauthorized external access to internal network resources. This system protects users from potential attacks when browsing the web. For instance, an attacker could create a malicious webpage that tricks a user’s browser into requesting internal network addresses, such as a router’s configuration page. If successful, this could expose private data or allow unauthorized changes to network settings.

The problem, however, is that the 0.0.0.0 address was not properly accounted for when PNA was initially developed. While the system effectively blocked unauthorized access to well-known IP addresses like 127.0.0.1, it overlooked the peculiarities of 0.0.0.0. As a result, this address became a potential gateway for hackers to exploit.

The decision to address this long-standing issue in Chrome is a critical step in enhancing the browser’s security. By closing this loophole, Google is taking a significant step toward protecting users from potential threats that have existed for nearly two decades. The fix ensures that Chrome’s PNA protections fully cover the 0.0.0.0 address, closing off a significant attack vector that hackers have exploited.

This update is part of a broader effort by Google to continually improve Chrome’s security and safeguard users’ online experiences. As the internet evolves and new vulnerabilities emerge, browser developers must stay vigilant and proactive in addressing these issues."
"Google Pixel 9 buyers will reportedly get free access to Google One AI Premium, YouTube Premium, and Google One AI Premium.",https://www.techradar.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/google-pixel-9-buyers-will-reportedly-get-free-access-to-google-one-ai-premium-youtube-premium-and-fitbit-premium,"Leaks suggest that the Google Pixel 9 series could be rather expensive, but it seems Google might have found some ways to significantly sweeten the deal, including subscriptions to various premium services.

According to Android Headlines, anyone who buys a Pixel 9, a Pixel 9 Pro, a Pixel 9 Pro XL, or a Pixel 9 Pro Fold before October 31, 2025, will get one year of Google One AI Premium, which includes access to Gemini Advanced and 2TB of cloud storage, among other perks. This is usually priced at $19.99 / £18.99 / AU$32.99 per month, so a year of it is worth $239.88 / £227.88 / AU$395.88.

Those who buy one of these phones before December 31, 2025, will additionally apparently get six months of Fitbit Premium, which is usually $9.99 / £7.99 / AU$15.49 per month, and three months of YouTube Premium, which otherwise costs $13.99 / £12.99 / AU$16.99 per month.

A hefty haul

So the total value of all these freebies combined is $341.79 / £314.79 / AU$539.79. That’s fairly decent assuming you actually want them all. And they’re apparently available for some time (assuming that ‘2025’ isn’t a typo).

We’d take this with a pinch of salt, but we’ve heard of some of these Pixel 9 perks previously, and we’ve also elsewhere heard that buyers of the Pixel 9 Pro might initially be able to get a free storage upgrade, from 256GB to 512GB.

So while these are likely to be expensive phones, you might at least get a lot of extras for your money.

You can see some of these above, but these aren’t the first leaked images we’ve seen so there’s not much new here. That said, they look like genuine marketing materials, so these are probably the phones we’ll get an official look at on August 13.

TechRadar will be covering the Pixel 9 launch in full, so head back to the site on August 13 for all the announcements and our analysis, but stick around in the meantime too, for any further leaks and rumors."
"Google Pixel 9 buyers will reportedly get free access to Google One AI Premium, YouTube Premium, and Google One AI Premium.",https://www.techradar.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/pixel-9-pro,"Google looks set to unveil the Google 9 Pixel Pro on August 13, with this successor to the Google Pixel 8 Pro expected to stand alongside the Google Pixel 9, Google Pixel 9 XL and Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold in the company’s 2024 lineup.

It’s been 10 months since the Pixel 8 series hit shelves, so we’re quietly confident that we know what to expect from the next generation of Google’s best Pixel phones. Indeed, we’ve now heard several consistent rumors about the Pixel 9 Pro, and in this guide, we’ve pulled together the leaks with the most credence.

Below, you’ll find everything we’ve heard about the Pixel 9 Pro so far, including details about its potential price, design, display, cameras, chipset and battery.

Cut to the chase

Set to be announced on August 13

Will likely cost at least $999 / £999 / AU$1,699

Google has now confirmed that the Pixel 9 series (and therefore the Pixel 9 Pro) will be announced at its upcoming Made by Google event on Tuesday, August 13. The phone will likely begin shipping towards the end of August.

Interestingly, Google usually hosts its Pixel launch events in October, so this year’s August event marks a change in strategy for the company. Perhaps it wants to steal a march on Apple’s rumored iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro models.

As for the Pixel 9 Pro’s price, it’s safe to expect an equal or higher price than the $999 / £999 / AU$1,699 starting price of the Pixel 8 Pro. Here’s how much that phone launched for in the US, UK and Australia:

Swipe to scroll horizontally Google Pixel 8 Pro prices Storage US price UK price AU price 128GB $999 £999 AU$1,699 256GB $1,059 £1,059 AU$1,799 512GB $1,179 £1,179 AU$1,999 1TB $1,399 N/A N/A

A Pixel 9 Pro Price leak supports that, suggesting that it will start at $999.99 (which might convert to £999 / AU$1,699). However, the Pixel 9 Pro XL could be much more expensive at $1,199 (which might convert to around £1,199 / AU$1,999).

One Pixel 9 price leak suggests that the Pixel 9 Pro could come with a full year of free access to Gemini Advanced though, which could soften the blow of those four-figure prices.

We've heard similar elsewhere, with a second source adding that it will additionally come with six months of Fitbit Premium and three months of YouTube Premium.

Google Pixel 9 Pro: potential design and display

Confirmed to have a redesigned rear camera bump

Expected to have a 6.3-inch display

Google itself has already teased the rear design of the Pixel 9 Pro, confirming that the phone’s camera array will now sit on a rounded, isolated island, rather than being integrated into the rear panel, as on the Pixel 8 Pro.

Additionally, where the sides of the Pixel 8 Pro are curved, the Pixel 9 Pro will have polished sides that sit flush against a flat rear panel. The phone’s corners will still be curved, mind, and the rear panel looks like it’ll remain matte rather than glossy.

As for the Pixel 9 Pro’s size, leakers are divided. An unnamed Android Authority source claims the phone will be around the same size as the Pixel 8 Pro (at 6.7 inches), but reputable leaker Ross Young says the Pixel 9 Pro will have a bigger screen than its predecessor.

To make matters more confusing, an even more recent leak (this time from reliable leaker OnLeaks and MySmartPrice) suggests that the Pixel 9 Pro could have a 6.5-inch screen, making it smaller than the current model.

Interestingly, we’re expecting to see Google announce a Pixel 9 Pro XL model this year, which will presumably be the largest of the three Pixel 9 phones. Leaked hands-on photos of all three rumored Pixel 9 models (below) suggest the Pixel 9 has a 6.24-inch screen, the Pixel 9 Pro has a 6.34-inch display and the Pixel 9 Pro XL has a 6.73-inch screen, so these could well be the most accurate measurements.

The rumored Pixel 9 Pro colors include Hazel, Obsidian, Porcelain and Rose, while a more recent Pixel 9 colors leak mentions Pink, which is presumably the same color as Rose. For reference, the Pixel 8 Pro shipped in Porcelain, Obsidian and Bay Blue.

As for the Pixel 9 Pro’s display, its screen size will of course depend on the size of the phone itself, though leakers seem to agree that Google’s Super Actua panel, which brings a 120Hz refresh rate, will return unchanged. The phone’s peak brightness may be slightly increased over the Pixel 8 Pro’s 2,400-nit peak.

Google Pixel 9 Pro: potential cameras

Three-camera setup will remain

New Sony lenses rumored for all three cameras

As per Google’s official teaser for the Pixel 9 Pro, the phone will stick with a three-lens rear setup, likely comprising a wide camera, an ultra-wide camera and a periscope telephoto camera, as on the Pixel 8 Pro.

We haven't heard many specifics about the megapixel count of these cameras, though the Pixel 8 Pro boasts a 50MP main camera, a 48MP ultra-wide camera and a 48MP periscope telephoto camera (with 5x optical zoom), so expect the same or better. Similarly, the Pixel 9 Pro will probably get the same 10.5MP selfie camera as its predecessor.

Google is, however, reportedly ditching the Pixel 8 series’ Sony IMX386 ultra-wide lens in place of a 50MP Sony IMX858 lens on all three Pixel 9 devices, so it’s safe to expect better low-light performance from the Pixel 9 Pro. Both the Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL will also reportedly house this IMX858 lens on their respective telephoto and selfie cameras.

Another Pixel 9 Pro camera rumor suggests that the phone might support 8K video recording, though a more recent leak suggests that footage will instead be upscaled to 8K using Video Boost.

Google Pixel 9 Pro: potential chipset and battery

Google Tensor G4 chipset is a shoo-in

16GB RAM tipped

Battery size is unclear

30W wired charging is likely

The Pixel 9 Pro will almost certainly use Google’s Tensor G4 chipset, since the previous three Pro models used the first three generations of Tensor, respectively.

The Tensor G4 is tipped to offer improved performance, power efficiency and heat management over the Tensor G3, however we’ve also heard that the Tensor G4 will be a “smaller upgrade than initially planned”. We’ve since heard this from a second source, so the Pixel 9 Pro may not be dramatically faster than the Pixel 8 Pro.

We do, however, expect the Pixel 9 Pro to boast 16GB of RAM, which would mark an upgrade over the Pixel 8 Pro’s 12GB. This improved RAM capacity should enable plenty of software-based upgrades, and indeed we’ve heard that the phone might boast a new AI assistant called Pixie, which is described as more personalized and powerful than the current Google Assistant.

Also on the AI front, there's evidence that Google is working on an AI-powered sticker creator, possibly called Creative Assistant, and the Google Pixel 9 Pro could get one of Apple Intelligence's coolest features before any iPhone, namely the ability to record, transcribe and summarize phone calls.

As for the Pixel 9 Pro’s battery, a Taiwanese regulatory agency has stated that the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro have 4,558mAh batteries, while the Pixel 9 Pro XL has a 4,942mAh cell.

These are likely minimum rather than rated capacities, so we doubt that 4,558mAh will be the official battery capacity of the Pixel 9 Pro. In any case, for reference, the Pixel 8 Pro has a 4,950mAh rated battery capacity and a 5,050mAh typical one.

The same source also suggests that the Pixel 9 Pro will charge at 30W, just like the Pixel 8 Pro, while the Pixel 9 Pro XL might charge at 35W or more. Mind you, another leak has hinted that all three phones could charge marginally faster than their predecessors. So, the jury is out on the Pixel 9 Pro battery front.

One of the few things we're not fairly sure about at this point is the prices, but now those have leaked too – at least for the Pixel 9 Pro and the Pixel 9 Pro XL.

According to a Reddit post showing a screenshot of pricing at T-Mobile (spotted by GSMArena), the Google Pixel 9 Pro will start at $999.99. That’s the same starting price as the Pixel 8 Pro, and while we don’t have prices for other regions, if that price is accurate there’s a good chance they’ll be the same elsewhere too, meaning we might be looking at £999 / AU$1,699.

While that might sound like good news, however, we'd note that the Pixel 9 Pro is reportedly a much smaller phone than the Pixel 8 Pro. The latter is 6.7 inches, while according to leaks the former has just a 6.3-inch screen.

An XL price for an XL phone

The real successor to the Pixel 8 Pro is the Pixel 9 Pro XL, which is said to have a roughly 6.7-inch screen, and which according to this price list starts at $1,199. So we could essentially be looking at a $200 price rise compared to the 8 Pro (there was no Pro XL model last year).

Again, there’s no pricing for other regions, but based on pricing for other configurations of the Pixel 8 Pro, that might translate to around £1,199 / AU$1,999.

There is a little bit of confusion here in that both the 256GB and 512GB Pixel 9 Pro XL models are listed as costing $1,199, so we’d take this list with a pinch of salt. However, according to leaker Roland Quandt, one of Google’s pre-order offers will be selling a 512GB model for the price of a 256GB one, so that’s probably what’s happening here.

That deal could take some of the sting out of the rumored price hike, but this still amounts to a hefty increase. Whether the Pixel 9 Pro XL will be worthy of such a price rise remains to be seen, but we'll find out very soon – stay tuned to TechRadar for all the last-minute leaks, and for our coverage of the launch event and our impressions of the Pixel 9 line on August 13.

The Pixel 9 launch event that Google has scheduled for Tuesday, August 13 is fast approaching, and information about these phones continues to leak on a daily basis. Today's installment is what seems to be a promo video showing off the Pixel 9 Pro's new AI tricks.

The clip was posted by regular tipster @MysteryLupin (via Android Headlines), and given the backing track and editing style, it looks very much like a reel that Google is going to use as part of its launch event next week.

We get a decent look at the Pixel 9 Pro, and some hints about the new Gemini AI features arriving with the phone. In one demo, a Pixel user snaps the contents of their fridge, and then gets Gemini to come up with a dish that can be made using those ingredients.

It's the sort of multimodal AI magic that was shown off at the Google I/O 2024 event earlier this year, where different forms of input (like images) are used as prompts. As always, be wary of hallucinations, which may ruin your cooking prep.

Add Me to your photos

Another AI-powered feature in this video that we've not seen before is called Add Me. The idea is that you take a photo with your friends in it, then you swap places and they take a photo of you – so you're all able to appear against the same backdrop.

It's similar to some of the AI photo editing tricks that have already been launched under the Magic Editor umbrella on Android, and at the moment it's not clear if these same features are going to be rolling out to older Pixel handsets and phones made by other manufacturers in due course.

The video also mentions a ""pro-level camera"" and ""super res zoom video"", which appears to be the video equivalent of the existing Super Res Zoom for photos feature: using a combination of hardware tricks and machine learning algorithms to boost the zoom capabilities on images (and now, it would seem, video).

All of this should be made official on Tuesday, when alongside the Pixel 9 Pro we're expecting to hear about the standard Pixel 9, the Pixel 9 Pro XL, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold (replacing the Google Pixel Fold), and the Google Pixel Watch 3."
"Google Pixel 9 buyers will reportedly get free access to Google One AI Premium, YouTube Premium, and Google One AI Premium.",https://www.techradar.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/the-pixel-9s-new-weather-app-is-like-dark-sky-for-android-and-you-can-try-it-right-now,"The Google Pixel 9 series is due to launch next week, and while we've already seen leaks around its design and specs, it's also apparently going to come with a newly upgraded weather app – an app which you can try out right now, if you want to.

As reported by Android Authority, the new and improved Weather app can now be sideloaded from APKMirror. It should work on devices running Android 14 or later, but as this isn't yet the finished version of the app, expect some bugs and crashes – and when it is launched properly, it may end up being exclusive to Pixel phones.

If you're new to the idea of sideloading, it simply means installing apps from outside the Google Play Store. You should always do it with caution, and only using apps and sources you can trust – and you always do it at your own risk.

To install the app, open the APKMirror link in Chrome on your Android device, go to the download link (ignoring the adverts with ""download"" on them), then tap through the security warnings to confirm you're happy sideloading the app. You may also be prompted to change Chrome's settings to allow installs from unknown sources.

Take the weather with you

So called AI weather summaries strings from the Google Weather app. These seems like just instructions for the whatever AI (gemini?) they are using.

As we've seen from earlier screenshots, the new Weather app manages to stuff plenty of information into a simple interface, designed around Android's Material You guidelines. You get all the basics here, including temperatures and precipitation levels, plus details of wind speed, UV levels, sunset and sunrise times, and visibility.

It also looks as though the Weather app will be able to deliver forecasts and warnings about rain straight to your phone, ahead of time – something that will appeal to those of us missing the Dark Sky app after Apple acquired it.

As for what's coming, seasoned tipsters AssembleDebug and Dylan Roussel have hinted that AI-powered weather summaries and detailed weather maps are on the way, too. We'd actually be surprised at this point if Google launched something that didn't have artificial intelligence features included.

We should see this new Weather app, and all four Pixel 9 models, officially revealed next Tuesday, August 13. There's also a good chance that a full release for Android 15 will be announced, and it's likely that the Google Pixel Watch 3 is going to be unveiled too."
"Google Pixel 9 buyers will reportedly get free access to Google One AI Premium, YouTube Premium, and Google One AI Premium.",https://www.techradar.com/phones/the-worlds-first-tri-folding-phone-could-finally-land-soon-and-not-from-samsung,"Samsung teased a tri-folding display concept (above) back in 2021, but Huawei could beat it to a full launch

Tri-foldable phones have been teased and mooted for over four years now, but it looks like the world's first could finally get a full launch – and beat Samsung to an official announcement.

Some new rumors on Chinese social media suggest that Huawei has recently cleared a durability hurdle that should see its tri-foldable phone (a triple-screen phone with two hinges) launch, in China at least, within the next month.

The Weibo tipster Bad Review Emperor (via Huawei Central) claims that Huawei's tri-foldable phone has just ""passed the 28μm test"", which is apparently a durability test for its impressively thin screen and how visible the crease lines will be after multiple folds. Huawei's foldable is expected to debut a new 'inside-out' mechanism with a dual-hinge design.

A tri-foldable phone makes sense for Huawei because it will likely run HarmonyOS Next, a new iteration of its operating system. According to the Weibo tipster, this means it'll be able to run ""PC-level applications"", potentially melding the lines between phone, tablet and laptop.

These rumors follow a separate post from Digital Chat Station on Weibo stating that ""a certain large manufacturer has started scheduling the production of a tri-fold phone"". According to the leak, it'll have a 10-inch internal screen and both its specs and pricing ""are going to hit new highs"".

Putting the two rumors together, it looks increasingly likely that Huawei will beat Samsung to the 'world's first' bragging rights for a tri-foldable phone. However, given that Huawei's banned from selling phones in the US, Samsung may still become the first tech giant to make a truly global tri-foldable.

Fortunately for tech fans, we seem to be finally reaching the end of the concepts and teasers stage for these next-gen foldables, and towards the first actual launches of the form factor.

An extra hinge or a lower price?

These rumors fit the timescale we heard earlier this year for the world's first tri-foldable. Back then, the display analyst Ross Young claimed that Huawei's tri-folding phone was supposed to launch in late 2023, but got pushed back to later this year. Senior Huawei exec Richard Yu Chengdong also hinted in an interview in July that Huawei was close to launching a tri-foldable.

Given how expensive the best foldable phones remain, you could argue that a price drop is more important than adding an extra hinge for more screen real estate. And we have heard rumors, which haven't yet come to fruition, that a Galaxy Z Fold 6 FE model is in the pipeline.

Still, a new phone form factor is always exciting, so the launch of Huawei's first tri-foldable is certainly intriguing. The recent launch of Samsung's new Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 foldables show that the tech has matured and early teething problems, like durability issues and noticeable creases, have been addressed. Our Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 review concluded that it's ""an excellent foldable"" that ""edges closer to perfection"".

Then again, the Z Fold 6 starts at $1,899 / £1,799 / AU$2,749, so we're already talking laptop-style prices for a foldable with a single hinge. A triple-screened phone with two hinges would presumably go well beyond that, making the first models a luxury reserved for only the most well-heeled tech fans.

If Huawei does beat Samsung to the punch with the first tri-foldable, it'll hopefully prompt the Korean tech giant to show its hand beyond the concepts we've seen so far – and start the journey towards making the devices a more realistic prospect for the rest of us."
"Google Pixel 9 buyers will reportedly get free access to Google One AI Premium, YouTube Premium, and Google One AI Premium.",https://www.techradar.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/latest-android-14-security-patch-finally-fixes-major-pixel-6-factory-rest-bug,"Google might be about to launch new Pixel 9 smartphones next week at its Made by Google event, and is actively beta-ing Android 15 ahead of its rollout later this month, but it hasn’t forgotten about the software running on its older phones – with Android 14’s August security patch's landing.

The software is hitting the Pixel 5a, Pixel 6 models, Pixel 7 models, and Pixel 8 models, plus the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.

It’s correcting a handful of vulnerabilities as you’d expect from a security update – including a ‘High’ severity issue discovered in a Pixel subcomponent, and more minor potential problems found in some Qualcomm parts – though other fixes have been thrown in, too.

The most significant fix is what the patch notes call an “issue occasionally causing devices to be in a reboot loop after factory reset.” This refers to a Pixel 6 bug found in July in which a Pixel 6 wouldn’t turn on properly after a factory reset – with an error message reporting a problem with Android and that the users data may have been corrupted.

Pixel 8 improvements

Google did roll out a workaround sooner, but this patch now offers a far simpler solution – and should (fingers crossed) prevent the bug from happening to newly reset devices.

In addition to this the updates solves screen brightness flickering in Pixel 8 and 8 Pros, generally improves display performance and stability in the Pixel 8, and fixes a glitch in all Pixel devices which could occur when switching between a user with a lock screen and someone without one.

You should always install security patches when they roll out to keep your device protected from potential threats – and your Pixel phone should update manually in the coming days if it hasn’t already – but these fixes provide an extra incentive to get your phone on the latest software (especially the reboot loop fix).

The latest one claims to show a hands-on look at the complete range of iPhone 16 colors – and it mixes in a couple of interesting surprises for good measure.

Showcased on the Zollotech YouTube channel run by Aaron Zollo, the video depicts a set of iPhone 16 dummy models in five colors: blue, green, white, black and pink. Unexpectedly, the colors are notably more saturated than those used in the iPhone 15, which were quite pale in comparison.

Instead of the frosted glass effect seen in the iPhone 15, Zollotech’s dummy units indicate Apple could be opting for more vibrant, solid colors. Though we'll only know for sure when they're fully unveiled, most likely in mid-September.

The video follows a leaked photo that surfaced at the end of July on X (formerly Twitter). There, leaker Sonny Dickson posted a photo of five iPhone 16 units in the same colors as those that appeared in Zollotech’s later video, which could give the leak more credibility.

New buttons and display sizes

There are few other tidbits that Zollotech's video picks up on. The iPhone 16 dummy models seen in the YouTube channel come with an Action button, meaning this feature may no longer be limited to Apple’s Pro models.

As well as that, Zollotech’s iPhones feature an extra button on the lower-right side, something that was also seen in a recent video from Unbox Therapy. Zollotech speculates that this might be a 'capture' button for quickly taking photos and videos.

The video also backs up another long-standing iPhone 16 rumor: that it will come with a vertical camera orientation, breaking from the diagonal layout used in the iPhone 15. It’s thought that this new arrangement will enable users to take spatial videos for use with the Vision Pro headset.

Like previous rumors, Zollotech also predicts that we'll see the display sizes increase from 6.1 inches to 6.3 inches, and thinner bezels to go with that. However, the thinner bezels could mean the physical footprint doesn’t actually increase much, if at all.

Based on previous years’ event dates, Apple’s iPhone launch show could fall on around September 10 this year. If that’s the case, we’ve got about a month until we find out exactly how accurate this iPhone 16 leak is."
OpenAI says its latest GPT-4o model is ‘medium’.,https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/8/24216193/openai-safety-assessment-gpt-4o,"OpenAI has released its GPT-4o System Card, a research document that outlines the safety measures and risk evaluations the startup conducted before releasing its latest model.

GPT-4o was launched publicly in May of this year. Before its debut, OpenAI used an external group of red teamers, or security experts trying to find weaknesses in a system, to find key risks in the model (which is a fairly standard practice). They examined risks like the possibility that GPT-4o would create unauthorized clones of someone’s voice, erotic and violent content, or chunks of reproduced copyrighted audio. Now, the results are being released.

According to OpenAI’s own framework, the researchers found GPT-4o to be of “medium” risk. The overall risk level was taken from the highest risk rating of four overall categories: cybersecurity, biological threats, persuasion, and model autonomy. All of these were deemed low risk except persuasion, where the researchers found some writing samples from GPT-4o could be better at swaying readers’ opinions than human-written text — although the model’s samples weren’t more persuasive overall.

An OpenAI spokesperson, Lindsay McCallum Rémy, told The Verge that the system card includes preparedness evaluations created by an internal team, alongside external testers listed on OpenAI’s website as Model Evaluation and Threat Research (METR) and Apollo Research, both of which build evaluations for AI systems.

Moreover, the company is releasing a highly capable multimodal model just ahead of a US presidential election. There’s a clear potential risk of the model accidentally spreading misinformation or getting hijacked by malicious actors — even if OpenAI is hoping to highlight that the company is testing real-world scenarios to prevent misuse."
OpenAI says its latest GPT-4o model is ‘medium’.,https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/8/24216348/chatgpt-free-users-dall-e-3-images,"OpenAI is going to let users of ChatGPT’s free tier make up to two images per day with its DALL-E 3 model, the company announced on Thursday. When the company launched DALL-E 3 in September, it was available first to users who paid for ChatGPT Plus.

One of DALL-E 3’s key improvements is that ChatGPT can come up with a prompt to make an image, which should make it easier to make images. For example, as my former colleague Emilia David wrote last year:

In a demo to The Verge, Aditya Ramesh, lead researcher and head of the DALL-E team, prompted ChatGPT to help him come up with a logo for a ramen restaurant in the mountains. ChatGPT then wrote a longer prompt, and DALL-E came up with four options."

OpenAI Releases GPT-4o System Card

The GPT-4o System Card that OpenAI has recently published sheds light on the measures that OpenAI has taken to ensure the safety of its new AI and the possible dangers of the new model. The report touches on various issues, which include the possibility of users growing fond of the AI.

In addition, it touches on the possibility of the AI imbibing prejudices from the society, and the possibility of it being used to produce undesirable things such as fake news or illicit substances.The document also reveals measures that OpenAI has put in place to manage these risks such as post-training techniques, output classifiers, and vigorous moderation practices.

The System Card also contains the Preparedness Framework evaluations which are a crucial part of the model’s assessment on safety based on certain criteria. Specifically, the assessment identified that GPT-4o’s persuasion functionalities presented a borderline medium risk, which OpenAI has mitigated in certain ways.

According to Joaquin Quiñonero Candela, the head of preparedness at OpenAI, the firm has plans to continue the research and tracking of these risks especially for practical use.

Anthropomorphization and Emotional Reliance

One of the primary concerns detailed in the GPT-4o System Card is the risk of users anthropomorphizing the AI, particularly with the introduction of the model’s voice mode. This characteristic, through which the AI can mimic human interactions, may result in the users developing an emotional bond with the AI.

The document mentions cases in which users felt emotions more characteristic of interpersonal relationships during testing and called into question the possibility of users over-relying on the AI’s content.

OpenAI admits that these relationships may have positive effects, including giving a sense of belonging to those in need of a companion, on the other hand, they may undermine users’ relations with other people. The company also intends to observe how these interactions develop and, based on internal studies and external research from academics, try to tackle this problem more effectively.

Ongoing Efforts and Considerations

The GPT-4o System Card is a part of OpenAI’s efforts to increase the organization’s accountability and increase public confidence in the company and its AI solutions. The company has come under fire in the last few months, particularly in regards to the dangers presented by more sophisticated AI models.

In sharing the information about its safety assessment and the measures it has taken to minimize the risks, OpenAI seeks to calm down the public and its stakeholders that it is being responsible in developing AI.

In addition, OpenAI has also put in place several measures to control the voice aspect of the model; for instance, to prevent the production of copyrighted content and to block out any output that has violent or erotic language. These steps demonstrate the organization’s planning in tackling the new issues raised by the new AI model of the company.

While the BIOS updates won’t fix CPUs that are already damaged, they include Intel’s new microcode update that should help further address the instability issues.

If it works well, this could be a very big deal for Intel, which lost some of its reputation after its flagship chips were found to crash earlier this year and, after a long investigation, discovered there would be no true fix, requiring customers to replace any damaged chips. Intel also isn’t having a great year, period, recently announcing layoffs of at least 15,000 workers and stopping “non-essential work.”

Asus has released its beta BIOS updates through its ROG forums for a variety of Z790 motherboards. These are also typically posted to Asus’ support pages a few days after they’re posted to its ROG forums. MSI’s BIOS updates can be found on the individual motherboard support pages for its motherboards:

While we wouldn’t normally recommend using a beta BIOS update, given that this addresses an “elevated operating voltages” issue, you might want to go ahead and install these as soon as possible.

If you use a board other than MSI and Asus, or the microcode BIOS update isn’t available for your particular motherboard right now, make sure you’re on the latest BIOS update either way. Even if they’re missing the latest fix, recent BIOS updates should already include Intel’s recommended power delivery profiles, which could reduce the likelihood of your chip getting damaged.

“Please help us get the word out to all Raptor Lake desktop users, especially i9 users, in big screaming headlines that they need to update their PC to the latest BIOS now to stop/prevent the CPU wear and hopefully avoid the need for an RMA,” said Falcon Northwest founder Kelt Reeves in an email to The Verge earlier this week.

If you have an Asus board and want to check that your BIOS is set to the right power profile, Falcon Northwest has a good overview we’ve embedded below. The very latest Asus BIOS updates should already default to Intel’s settings instead of the company’s own overclocking profile.

Intel reportedly said these BIOS updates shouldn’t cause any performance loss, and reviewers are already gearing up to test Intel’s latest microcode to ensure there are no big changes for its 13th and 14th Gen chips."
OpenAI says its latest GPT-4o model is ‘medium’.,https://www.wired.com/story/openai-voice-mode-emotional-attachment/,"In late July, OpenAI began rolling out an eerily humanlike voice interface for ChatGPT. In a safety analysis released today, the company acknowledges that this anthropomorphic voice may lure some users into becoming emotionally attached to their chatbot.

The warnings are included in a “system card” for GPT-4o, a technical document that lays out what the company believes are the risks associated with the model, plus details surrounding safety testing and the mitigation efforts the company’s taking to reduce potential risk.

OpenAI has faced scrutiny in recent months after a number of employees working on AI’s long-term risks quit the company. Some subsequently accused OpenAI of taking unnecessary chances and muzzling dissenters in its race to commercialize AI. Revealing more details of OpenAI’s safety regime may help mitigate the criticism and reassure the public that the company takes the issue seriously.

The risks explored in the new system card are wide-ranging, and include the potential for GPT-4o to amplify societal biases, spread disinformation, and aid in the development of chemical or biological weapons. It also discloses details of testing designed to ensure that AI models won’t try to break free of their controls, deceive people, or scheme catastrophic plans.

Some outside experts commend OpenAI for its transparency but say it could go further.

Lucie-Aimée Kaffee, an applied policy researcher at Hugging Face, a company that hosts AI tools, notes that OpenAI's system card for GPT-4o does not include extensive details on the model’s training data or who owns that data. ""The question of consent in creating such a large dataset spanning multiple modalities, including text, image, and speech, needs to be addressed,"" Kaffee says.

Others note that risks could change as tools are used in the wild. “Their internal review should only be the first piece of ensuring AI safety,” says Neil Thompson, a professor at MIT who studies AI risk assessments. “Many risks only manifest when AI is used in the real world. It is important that these other risks are cataloged and evaluated as new models emerge.”

The new system card highlights how rapidly AI risks are evolving with the development of powerful new features such as OpenAI’s voice interface. In May, when the company unveiled its voice mode, which can respond swiftly and handle interruptions in a natural back and forth, many users noticed it appeared overly flirtatious in demos. The company later faced criticism from the actress Scarlett Johansson, who accused it of copying her style of speech.

A section of the system card titled “Anthropomorphization and Emotional Reliance” explores problems that arise when users perceive AI in human terms, something apparently exacerbated by the humanlike voice mode. During the red teaming, or stress testing, of GPT-4o, for instance, OpenAI researchers noticed instances of speech from users that conveyed a sense of emotional connection with the model. For example, people used language such as “This is our last day together.”

Anthropomorphism might cause users to place more trust in the output of a model when it “hallucinates” incorrect information, OpenAI says. Over time, it might even affect users’ relationships with other people. “Users might form social relationships with the AI, reducing their need for human interaction—potentially benefiting lonely individuals but possibly affecting healthy relationships,” the document says.

Joaquin Quiñonero Candela, head of preparedness at OpenAI, says that voice mode could evolve into a uniquely powerful interface. He also notes that the kind of emotional effects seen with GPT-4o can be positive—say, by helping those who are lonely or who need to practice social interactions. He adds that the company will study anthropomorphism and the emotional connections closely, including by monitoring how beta testers interact with ChatGPT. “We don’t have results to share at the moment, but it’s on our list of concerns,” he says."

Back in May, OpenAI announced GPT-4o, its most advanced multimodal model. It is faster and cheaper than the ﻿GPT-4 Turbo, with stronger vision capabilities. Today, OpenAI shared the System Card for the GPT-4o model. Along with the model System Card, OpenAI also released the Preparedness Framework scorecard to provide an end-to-end safety assessment of GPT-4o and shared details on the model's capabilities, limitations, and safety evaluations across multiple categories.

In addition to the safety evaluations and mitigations conducted for GPT-4 and GPT-4V, OpenAI conducted more safety work focusing on GPT-4o's audio capabilities. The risks evaluated include speaker identification, unauthorized voice generation, the potential generation of copyrighted content, ungrounded inference, and disallowed content. Based on the results of these evaluations, OpenAI has implemented safeguards at both the model and system levels.

GPT-4o scored low in three of the four Preparedness Framework categories, with a medium score in persuasion alone. According to OpenAI's Preparedness Framework, only models with a score of ""medium"" or below can be deployed, and only models with a score of ""high"" or below can be developed further.

OpenAI also collaborated with more than 100 external red teamers to evaluate the model before releasing it to the general public. Red teamers will make exploratory capability discovery, assess novel potential risks posed by the model, and stress-test mitigations.

The OpenAI team wrote the following regarding GPT-4o's System Card:

""OpenAI has implemented various safety measurements and mitigations throughout the GPT-4o development and deployment process. As part of our iterative deployment process, we will continue to monitor and update mitigations in accordance with the evolving landscape.""

OpenAI's release of the System Card for its models demonstrates its commitment to responsible AI development, ensuring the safe and accessible use of AI for everyone. You can download the PDF version of the GPT-4o System Card here for further reference."

Despite an executive shuffle at the top of the company, OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman seems unbothered — so much so that he posted on an image to his personal account on the social network X today showing a pleasant view of strawberries growing in planters in a garden, captioned with “i love summer in the garden” in his typical all-lowercase text style.

While the photo on its own seems fairly innocuous and even a little bland, it has Altman’s followers on X and others in the large and active AI community on the site giddy with excitement that Altman is actually acknowledging one of the longest-standing rumors about OpenAI’s efforts to develop a new foundation model supposedly codenamed “Strawberry,” which may or may not be equivalent to the expected GPT-5 foundation model.

“What other clues do we need?” posted @kimmonismus on X, a leading AI rumor and information dissemination account.

Bindu Reddy, CEO of open-source AI startup Abacus AI, also posted on X weighing in that it was a “reference to Project Strawberry.”

This is a reference to Project Strawberry (the new Q*)—the reasoning project OAI has been rumored to work on for over a year now.

Further adding fuel to the fire is the fact that a new “anonymous-chatbot” AI model has been added to the popular open-source lmsys arena, where numerous AI model provider companies including OpenAI itself often test upcoming releases with users prior to an announcement.

New model on arena again. It is simply named 'anonymous-chatbot' this time. There is speculation already that this is Q*. Whatever it is, something new is on the way. https://t.co/Zvpr2XUSxG — Andrew Curran (@AndrewCurran_) August 7, 2024

The new “anonymous-chatbot” when asked claims to be part of OpenAI’s GPT-4 family of models, and follows similar language to the “gpt2-chatbot” that appeared on lmsys before the release of OpenAI’s GPT-4o multimodal model in May 2024.

Early users of the new “anonymous-chatbot” report that it exhibits more advanced reasoning capabilities than GPT-4o and other rival frontier models, suggesting it may be more powerful than them.

Rumors of a massively powerful new OpenAI model kicked off with a report from Reuters in November 2023 describing a new AI model called “Q*” (pronounced “Q-Star,” according to the report):

“Some at OpenAI believe Q* (pronounced Q-Star) could be a breakthrough in the startup’s search for what’s known as artificial general intelligence (AGI), one of the people told Reuters. OpenAI defines AGI as autonomous systems that surpass humans in most economically valuable tasks.“

Reuters followed by with an exclusive report in mid-July stating:

“ChatGPT maker OpenAI is working on a novel approach to its artificial intelligence models in a project code-named “Strawberry,” according to a person familiar with the matter and internal documentation reviewed by Reuters.”

As for what specific new capabilities Strawberry may offer, Reuters reports:

“The document describes a project that uses Strawberry models with the aim of enabling the company’s AI to not just generate answers to queries but to plan ahead enough to navigate the internet autonomously and reliably to perform what OpenAI terms “deep research,” according to the source.

In addition, it has been nearly 17 months, or about 1.5 years, since OpenAI released GPT-4, its last major new foundation model class.

And while it has released new foundation models GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini in that time — the first trained to be natively multimodal rather than natively text — the competition from Anthropic and Google and Meta with equally or in some cases more powerful models, at least in certain tasks, has only increased markedly as well.

We’ve reached out to OpenAI for more information about Altman’s post on X and will update when we hear back."
OpenAI says its latest GPT-4o model is ‘medium’.,https://www.techzine.eu/news/applications/123252/openai-once-again-lowers-its-prices-for-the-latest-model-of-gpt-4o/,"OpenAI is intensifying its price war with other GenAI LLMs, especially Google’s Gemini. The company is doing this by further lowering the cost of GPT-4o. In addition, the AI giant is making it possible for JSON outputs from its LLMs to 100 percent match developers’ JSON Schemas.

Competition among LLMs is cutthroat, and OpenAI must also respond. Recently, the AI giant announced that it will lower the prices of its latest LLM GPT-4o.

This latest version, fully named gpt-4o-2024-08-06, now costs 2.50 dollars (2.29 euros) for the input of 1 million tokens and 10 dollars (9.16 euros) for the output of 1 million tokens. Compared to the previous version, this is 50 percent cheaper for input tokens. For output tokens, the price reduction amounts to one-third.

By comparison, using Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro LLM costs 3.50 dollars (3.21 euros) per 1 million input tokens and 10.50 dollars (9,62 euros) per 1 million output tokens.

Structured Outputs

Not only is OpenAI lowering prices, but it is also now introducing Structured Outputs in its API. This feature ensures that valid JSON outputs generated via JSON mode from its GPT-LLMs exactly match developers’ JSON Schemas.

Availability

To this end, the company has provided its Python and Node SDKs with native support for Structured Outputs. The functionality is now available to all OpenAI LLMs that support function calling in the API. These include gpt-4o, gpt-4o mini, gpt-4-0613 and gpt-3.5-turbo-0613, as well as more finetuned models.

Structured Outputs with so-called response formats are also available for gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o-2024-08-06 and all finetuned models based on these LLMs.

For example, the feature is suitable for the Chat Completions API, the Assistants API, and the Batch API. OpenAI indicates that it even works with vision inputs (i.e., image analysis and generating text and explanations based on that).

However, there are still some limitations. For example, JSON Schemas with Structured Outputs are not possible for Zero Data Retention.

Yet another co-founder leaves OpenAI

The battle between LLM providers also sometimes results in personnel transfers. For example, co-founder John Schulman has traded OpenAI for competitor Anthropic. According to Schulman on X, this explicitly is not because of a dispute over the company’s direction but because of personal ambitions. Another OpenAI co-founder, Ilya Sutskever, stepped down from the role of Chief Scientist some time ago, a role he had held since 2018.

CEO Sam Altman called his former colleague Sutskever a “genuinely remarkable genius” at the time. As friendly as the OpenAI boss sounded, Sutskever cleared the field a few months after he and a few others fired Altman. That decision was reversed during a remarkable soap opera in which Microsoft claimed a board role for itself, albeit without voting rights.

Blockchain Council

Llama 3 and GPT-4o (Omni) are two of the latest language models making waves in the tech world. Both are designed to help with different tasks, from coding to natural language processing. But who wins the race between LLAMA 3 Vs GPT 4o? Let’s find out!

LLAMA 3: Architecture and Capabilities

Llama 3 is an advanced language model developed by Meta, with two key versions featuring 8 billion (8B) and 70 billion (70B) parameters. It builds on its predecessor, Llama 2, with several enhancements that make it more effective and efficient.

Architecture

Llama 3 uses a decoder-only transformer architecture, a common choice for language models.

OpenAI says its latest GPT-4o model is ‘medium’.,https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/8/24216233/thumby-tinycircuits-nintendo-game-boy-advance-handheld-gaming-console,"How small can you shrink the Nintendo Game Boy Advance? That’s a question TinyCircuits is answering with the Thumby Color, a GBA clone measuring just two inches in size that still manages to fit a directional pad, shoulder buttons, a rumble motor, a 16-bit color screen, and the ability to link two of them together with a USB-C cable for multiplayer gaming.

Unlike the myriad Game Boy and GBA clones released by companies like Anbernic, the Thumby Color is not an emulator. It doesn’t have enough processing power to play retro games nor enough storage to hold hundreds of ROM files.

It’s powered by a 150MHz Raspberry Pi RP2350 processor that’s paired with just 16MB of storage — yes, that’s megabytes, not gigabytes. Not being able to play actual GBA games on the Thumby Color is probably a good thing because its 0.85-inch square LCD screen has a resolution of just 128 x 128 pixels, which is less than half the resolution of the GBA.

Games are instead programmed in MicroPython. The Thumby Color will come with six open-source titles preinstalled, including a first-person shooter called Monstra and a dungeon crawler called Thumbgeon 2. It will also come with all the monochromatic games that shipped with the original Thumby back in 2021, which was the company’s ultra-tiny clone of the original Game Boy.

The Thumby Color isn’t a handheld you’re going to want to play for hours on end, but it is one you can potentially sneak into any setting where you want a distraction — without trying to hide more conspicuous handhelds like the Steam Deck. It’s also a good excuse to learn a programming language, as TinyCircuits has created tutorials and guides available for free through its website.

The Thumby Color is available in several different colorways, including transparent case options. Image: TinyCircuits

TinyCircuits has opted for a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign to bring the Thumby Color to consumers. The original Thumby still sells for $42, but this new color screen version is available with a pledge of $49 for a purple version, with shipping expected as early as November. If you want a Thumby Color with a clear or transparent purple housing, the price jumps to $55, and if you want a Kickstarter-exclusive black version, it’s $75."
Cohere co-founder Nick Frosst thinks everyone needs to be more realistic about their situation.,https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/08/cohere-co-founder-nick-frosst-thinks-everyone-needs-to-be-more-realistic-on-what-ai-can-and-cannot-do/,"AI companies are gobbling up investor money and securing sky-high valuations early in their life cycle. This dynamic has many calling the AI industry a bubble.

Nick Frosst, a co-founder of Cohere, which builds custom AI models for enterprise customers, recently said on TechCrunch’s Found podcast that he doesn’t think the AI industry is in a bubble. While he acknowledges the froth, he thinks calling it a bubble discredits the companies, like his own Cohere, that are creating genuinely useful features for its customers.

“Frequently I’ll run into something where I’ll see somebody using our model, and they will have enabled some completely new feature that wasn’t possible before or they’ll have automated some process that was really bogging them down and slowing everything up,” Frosst said. “And like that’s tangible value. It’s hard for there to be a complete bubble when you have something so useful.”

But that doesn’t mean Frosst is bullish on everything the industry is building. He doesn’t think AI is really ever going to get to artificial general intelligence, defined as human-level intelligence, which is a noticeably different narrative from some of Frosst’s AI peers like Mark Zuckerberg and Jensen Huang. He added that if the industry does get there, it’s not going to be for a long time.

“I don’t think we’re gonna have digital gods anywhere, anytime soon,” Frosst said. “And I think more and more people are kind of coming to that realization, saying this technology is incredible. It’s super powerful, super useful. It’s not a digital god. And that requires adjusting how you’re thinking about the technology.”

Frosst said they try to be realistic at Cohere about what AI technology can and can’t do and what types of neural networks can provide the most value. Cohere’s approach to building its business model is based on the research work of Cohere co-founder and CEO Aidan Gomez while at Google Brain. Gomez is, of course, known for his extensive AI research. He’s most famous for co-writing a paper that bought AI the transformer model that ushered in this generative AI era. But he also co-wrote a paper in 2017 called One Model to Learn Them All. This research came to the conclusion that an all-encompassing large language model is more useful than small models trained for a specific task or on data from a specific industry, Frosst said.

Today, Cohere uses that main model as a base to build custom models for enterprise clients.

“We specialize as people. We go into particular fields. But the first part of our education is just about how to use language in general,” Frosst said. “We spent a long time learning how to read and write. It’s not until very later that you kind of specify on a particular subfield of language. So there’s something kind of similar going on with neural nets as well.”

But despite thinking larger, foundational models will win in his market — among those building such services — he doesn’t think enterprise companies should ask their own single models to do everything: consumer tasks, B2B tasks, product tasks.

Frosst says that companies that want to use AI technology successfully should focus and also be aware of what AI technology can and can’t do.

“We’re pretty sober about how this technology is useful, and what value it can deliver, and to be clear, an insane amount of value,” Frosst said. “But I don’t think it’s going to bring about the death of all humans. And so we’re able to kind of have this realistic approach that maybe spares us from some of the extreme rhetoric on either side.”"
Cohere co-founder Nick Frosst thinks everyone needs to be more realistic about their situation.,https://www.devhardware.com/israel-revokes-diplomatic-status-of-norwegian-envoys-israeli-palestinian-conflict-news/,"Norway’s foreign minister criticizes “extremist action,” saying it will affect the country’s ability to help the Palestinian people.

Israel has revoked the diplomatic status of eight Norwegian diplomats working in the occupied Palestinian territories.

“There is a price for anti-Israel behavior,” Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said Thursday, citing Norway’s recognition of Palestinian statehood and its support for an International Criminal Court case implicating Israeli leaders in war crimes and crimes against humanity as reasons for the move.

The Norwegian ambassador was summoned to the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem on Thursday, where he was informed that the diplomats, all based in Tel Aviv, would have their accreditation revoked within seven days and their visas cancelled within three months.

“This is an extreme act that primarily affects our ability to assist the Palestinian people,” Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said in a statement, warning that the decision would have “consequences” for its relationship with the Israeli government.

Norway is still considering its response to this situation.

The United States said the move was unproductive and hindered Norwegian efforts to encourage cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.

“Norway has a long history of playing a constructive role when it comes to engaging with the government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority,” State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters on Thursday.

“We don’t think taking steps to prevent them from playing that role would be particularly helpful,” he added.

The European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, also issued a statement condemning the move and expressing “full solidarity” with Norway.

The Israeli Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Thursday referring to “serious statements by senior Norwegian officials” that were considered hostile to Israel.

In an official memorandum delivered to the Norwegian embassy in Tel Aviv, the ministry also accused Norway of pursuing “unilateral policies and statements” since the Hamas-led attack on October 7 in southern Israel that preceded the Israeli offensive on the Gaza Strip.

Spain, Ireland and Norway announced their decision to recognize a Palestinian state last May, drawing strong criticism from Israel, whose leaders have repeatedly spoken out against the establishment of a Palestinian state.

Israel reacted angrily, accusing the three countries of “rewarding terrorism” and immediately withdrew its ambassadors from Ireland, Norway and Spain.

Israel also ordered the Spanish consulate in Jerusalem to stop providing consular services to Palestinians as of June 1, with Katz calling the move “punitive” at the time.

In May, ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan applied for arrest warrants against senior Israeli and Hamas leaders for alleged war crimes.

Khan said his office had “reasonable grounds” to believe that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant bore “criminal responsibility” for “war crimes and crimes against humanity.”"

Apple reportedly plans an updated M4 Mac mini that’s actually mini.,https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/report-apple-plans-mini-er-mac-mini-its-first-design-update-in-14-years/,"Apple hasn't updated its Mac mini desktop lineup since the beginning of 2023, when it added M2 and M2 Pro chips and discontinued the last of the Intel models. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reports that the update drought will end later this year, when the mini will skip right from the M2 to the M4, something he originally reported back in April.

But the mini will reportedly come with more than just new chips: it will also get a new, smaller design, which Gurman says will be closer in size to an Apple TV box (specifically, he says it may be a bit taller, but will have a substantially smaller footprint). The new mini could have ""at least three USB-C ports,"" as well as a power connector and an HDMI port.

This would be Apple's first overhaul of the Mac mini's design since the original aluminum unibody version was released back in June of 2010. That model did include a slot for a built-in SuperDrive DVD burner, something Apple dropped from later models as optical drives became less necessary, but the M2 Mac mini has the same basic design and the same footprint as that Core 2 Duo Mac mini introduced over a decade ago.

Intel and other PC makers have been releasing computers smaller than the Mac mini for years now, starting with Intel's (discontinued, then handed off) NUC desktops and proliferating from there. Often, these systems would save space by including an external power brick, while the mini has always used an integrated power supply. But the Apple TV, also powered by Apple Silicon chips and also with an internal power supply, suggested that it was possible to design a physically smaller system without making that particular design compromise.

Though the design is changing, Apple's general approach to the Mac mini is staying the same as it is now. There will be a base model with a regular Apple M4 processor in it, and an upgraded model with the yet-to-be-released M4 Pro in it to help bridge the gap between the low-end mini and the more powerful Mac Studio. If the new mini has dramatically fewer ports than current models, that would also be a point of differentiation, though hopefully it would continue to include enough USB-C ports to support multiple external monitors along with other accessories.

Gurman doesn't know whether Apple will change the pricing of the Mac mini to go with the new design, though he does think the new mini ""may be cheaper to make.""

The new Mac minis will reportedly be available later in the year, though the M4 Pro models could be announced or released later than the standard M4 models. Gurman says that new iMac and MacBook Pro models with M4-series chips could release ""as early as this year,"" while M4 MacBook Airs would wait for the spring of 2025, and Mac Studio and Mac Pro desktops wouldn't be updated until ""the middle of next year.""

The M4 chip was introduced in this year's iPad Pro refresh, just a few months after the launch of the M3; this was the first time one of Apple's M-series processors debuted in anything other than a Mac."
Apple reportedly plans an updated M4 Mac mini that’s actually mini.,https://gizmodo.com/apple-wants-to-make-the-mac-mini-even-smaller-why-2000484805,"The thing about mini PCs is… well it’s spelled out in the name. They’re relatively small, small enough to lay comfortably on your desktop and stay out of the way. The $600 M2 Mac Mini is already a fine specimen of performance at scale, but a new report details how Apple is planning to completely revitalize its small-scale computer along with its entire Mac lineup with AI-centric M4 chips first seen in the latest iPad Pro. The Mac Mini, however, is going to get even more miniaturized, even smaller than the Apple TV.

The report comes from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman who cites several anonymous sources that claim the Mac Mini, a revamped iMac, and MacBook Pro are all getting sequels with the M4 chip. Those are slated for release this year. In spring of next year, we’ll get MacBook Airs with M4. Just a few months after that, Apple will reportedly drop an M4 Mac Pro and Mac Studio into our waiting hands.

The footprint of the Mac Mini effectively hasn’t changed since the days of Steve Jobs. It’s a 7.75-inch square weighing in at about 2.6 pounds (slightly more with M2 Pro). It measures 1.41 inches high, or about three stacks of Post-it notes laid on top of each other. The new Mac Mini would be “approaching the size of an Apple TV” box, according to Bloomberg. That means a length and width of about 3.66 inches.

The Mac Mini might be slightly taller than before, but if we’re griping about millimeters we’re probably obsessed about all the wrong things. The more important thing is ports, and the new small-form computer could have three USB-C ports, a power connector, and an HDMI port.

Apple is jumping with both feet on the AI hype train with the release of M4. The rest of the M-series chips contained neural processing capabilities, with the M3 hitting up to 19 TOPS (trillions of operations per second, a common way to measure NPU speeds). The M4 can do 38 TOPS, which is still slightly less than the latest ARM-based Qualcomm chips powering Copilot+ PCs.

The M4 is a more powerful chip than the M3, though by a very slim margin. It comes with one more core and thread along with higher GPU speeds, but in Gizmodo’s own tests, we didn’t find too wide a gulf between the M4 on iPad and M3 on MacBook Air. That’s a very loose comparison considering the difference in operating systems, so we’ll have to wait for an M4 with MacOS to offer a true comparison. Like the M3, Apple’s likely going to put out a M4 Pro version of the Mac Mini that won’t arrive until October, according to Gurman’s sources. There’s no additional word on an M4 Max, which would likely power the ultra-high-end MacBook Pros, Mac Pros, and Mac Studios."
Apple reportedly plans an updated M4 Mac mini that’s actually mini.,https://www.techradar.com/computing/macs/the-mac-mini-m4-is-coming-and-it-could-be-the-smallest-mac-that-apples-ever-made,"We've already heard that the Mac Mini M4 is likely to land later this year, but some fresh rumors have just revealed that Apple's tiny Mac is likely to get even smaller thanks to its first design refresh for 14 years.

According to Bloomberg's reliable Apple insider Mark Gurman, the new Mac Mini will be the company's ""smallest desktop computer yet."" In fact, the new M4-powered Mini will be so compact that it'll be ""approaching the size of an Apple TV set-top box,"" according to Gurman's sources.

In reality, the redesign wouldn't functionally change the Mac Mini very much. The current version measures 1970 x 1970 x 358mm, while the Apple TV 4K is 93 x 93 x 31mm. Gurman's report claims that the new Mac Mini may actually be taller than the current version to achieve that reduced overall footprint.

Still, that would ensure it hits the milestone of being Apple's smallest desktop so far, and the upgrade to an M4 chip could make it hugely popular. That chip is apparently the main reason for Apple's Mac Mini redesign due to its lower power requirements – with Gurman's sources stating that the computer is ""essentially an iPad Pro in a small box.""

What other upgrades might the M4 Mac Mini get? Naturally, the Apple Intelligence features inside macOS Sequoia will be one of the mainstays. Still, it appears Apple has also tested versions with three USB-C ports on the back (the current M2 version has two Thunderbolt 4 ports) alongside an HDMI port, like the current model.

According to Bloomberg, there will also apparently be two versions of the Mac Mini. One is expected to be powered by the base M4 chip, while another has been tipped to run on the unannounced M4 Pro chip. It sounds like the base M4 version will be available sooner, with production ramping up in August ahead of a release ""later this year."" We may have to wait until October for the M4 Pro model.

One thing we don't yet know is whether or not Apple plans to keep the Mac Mini's tempting pricing at the same low level. The current one starts at only $599 / £649 / AU$999, and according to Gurman, ""the new model may be cheaper to make."" We don't yet know if that'll result in an even lower price tag, a similar one, or potentially a higher one.

Our Mac mini (2023) review called it ""the best mini PC you can buy right now,"" and it remains at the top of our guide to the best mini PCs. A new M4 chip and redesign certainly wouldn't harm its chances of remaining there unless Apple drops a clanger with the connectivity or performance.

The appeal of the Mac mini has always been the combination of its size and the fact that you get to add your own keyboard, mouse, and monitor. If Apple manages to keep the base model at $599 / £649 / AU$999, then it'll surely continue to be popular among Mac fans and even some die-hard Windows users.

The main competition for the new Mac Mini may actually come from within Apple. This Bloomberg report has reiterated previous rumors that Apple is planning M4 refreshes for the iMac and MacBook Pro in 2024 as well, which means we'd advise holding off from buying a new Mac right now if you can.

The exceptions to that might be if you're considering a MacBook Air, Mac Pro, or Mac Studio. The Air apparently won't get an M4 reboot until the spring of 2025 (in other words, sometime between March and April), while the M4-flavored Mac Pro and Mac Studio apparently won't arrive until ""the middle of next year."""
Apple reportedly plans an updated M4 Mac mini that’s actually mini.,https://wccftech.com/m4-mac-mini-redesign-will-be-most-compact-computer-from-apple/,"Apple is planning to release a host of machines powered by its latest chipset, but out of all of them, a new report states that the M4 Mac mini will be the only one sporting a redesign. With the change, this model is said to become the company’s smallest computer ever. Given that the Apple Silicon Mac mini range has existed since 2020, it was long overdue that these machines received an aesthetics makeover.

The upcoming M4 Mac mini could be as small as an Apple TV but will boast desktop-class performance thanks to the new Apple Silicon

It is possible that Apple gained inspiration from the 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro models sporting the M4 chipset, as both of these are the thinnest tablets that the company has ever produced. Unfortunately, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman did not mention it as a reason for introducing the M4 Mac mini redesign. An interesting fact is that the Mac mini family has not received a design overhaul since 2010, and what should get potential buyers excited is how small Apple intends to make it.

Based on information from the report, it is said that the M4 Mac mini will share the same size as an Apple TV, but it could be slightly taller to accommodate the powerful components and cooling system. For reference, the current-generation Apple TV is 1.4 inches tall. As for the build materials, the technology giant will continue to employ an aluminum chassis, making it as robust as previous-generation releases. Strange enough, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo previously predicted that the M4 MacBook Pro family will not feature any redesign, making the M4 Mac mini the only device arriving this year to do so.

However, the report does not mention what specification changes will be made to ensure that it successfully reduces the M4 Mac mini’s size. Given that the latest Wi-Fi standards negate the use of a wired Ethernet connection thanks to their upgraded speeds and reduced latency, our gut tells us that the RJ45 jack will be removed first, possibly getting replaced with a Thunderbolt port that can deliver the same experience, but through the use of a compatible dongle.

The M4 Mac mini is just another one of Apple’s products that are in the pipeline of becoming thinner and more compact. According to Gurman, the latest 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro models were just the start of the company’s plans, with the design change expected to branch out to future MacBook Pro lineups and the iPhone 17, which is reported to feature a ‘skinnier’ chassis.

Apple reportedly plans an updated M4 Mac mini that’s actually mini.,https://www.macworld.com/article/2422215/the-mac-mini-is-getting-even-smaller-with-first-redesign-in-15-years.html,"Earlier this week, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that Apple plans to start its M4 Mac rollout later this year. He also said that “at least one Mac model will get more dramatic changes,” and on Thursday, Gurman provided more details, reporting that Apple plans to redesign the M4 Mac mini as the smallest Mac ever.

The first redesign of the Mac mini since 2010 will make it similar in size to the Apple TV, which measures 3.7 by 3.7 by 1.2 inches (93 by 93 by 31 millimeters)–that’s nearly half the height and width of the current Mac mini’s 7.7 by 7.7 by 1.4 inches (19.7 by 19.7 by 3.6 centimeters). The M4 Mac mini may be taller than the current model, and the case will still be aluminum. The original Mac mini released in 2005 measured 6.5 by 6.5 by 2 inches (16.5 by 16.5 by 5.1 centimeters) and had an aluminum body with a plastic top.

Gurman reports that Apple has tested three models that have at least three USB-C ports, a power connector, and an HDMI port. He did not clarify if any of the USB-C ports are also Thunderbolt ports–but it’d be surprising if Apple did not offer Thunderbolt connectivity.

Like the M2 models, Apple will likely offer the Mac mini with a base M4 chip like the one in the iPad Pro and a new M4 Pro chip. The base M4 model will be available immediately, while the M4 Pro Mac mini might not be available until later in October, Gurman reports.

Apple’s decision to make the Mac mini smaller isn’t surprising. There have been rumors for years that Apple is working on a Mac mini redesign with a thinner case. Teardowns of the M1 and M2 Mac mini show that the switch to M-series chips allows for smaller motherboards and other components, leaving a lot of space inside those Macs. One of the largest components in the M1 and M2 Mac mini is the fan; it doesn’t seem likely that Apple would get rid of it in the new Mac mini, since a fan is probably necessary for the M4 Pro chip."
Apple reportedly plans an updated M4 Mac mini that’s actually mini.,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/new-mac-mini-is-going-to-be-tiny/,"Apple is planning a new version of the Mac mini using the M4 chip, according to reports from Bloomberg. It’s expected sometime before the end of the year, and insider information suggests that it will be significantly smaller than the previous generation — almost as small as the Apple TV box. This will be the first significant redesign of the product since it was overhauled in 2010 under late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.

It seems there will be two versions of the new Mac mini, one with the standard M4 chip and one with an M4 Pro chip that has yet to be announced. Like other Pro chips, it’s expected that the M4 Pro will support additional memory and enhanced graphic performance.

Apple has also reportedly tested models of the mini with at least three USB-C ports alongside the power and HDMI ports, and Bloomberg speculates that it will be cheaper to make than the previous model. Whether this will translate to a smaller price tag is yet to be seen.

Mac mini is not the only Mac getting upgraded to the M4 chip, however. If the rumors are true, Apple will be putting an M4 chip in every one of its Macs, and this will be the first time the entire lineup has shared the same chip generation.

The iMac desktop and MacBook Pros with M4 chips could launch as early as this year, with M4 MacBook Airs planned for spring 2025 and Mac Pro and Mac Studio models expected in mid-2025. Whether we’ll truly see M4 MacBook Pros before 2024 ends, however, is currently in question after some cryptic comments during Apple’s recent quarterly earnings call. This is despite assurances by Mark Gurman of Bloomberg that things are still on track for later this year.

The reason for these upgrades could be to make sure the entire Mac lineup benefits from the AI-focused M4 chip, which will enable each model to handle upcoming and future Apple Intelligence features smoothly."
Apple reportedly plans an updated M4 Mac mini that’s actually mini.,https://mobilesyrup.com/2024/08/08/apple-small-mac-mini/,"A new leak from Bloomberg‘s Mark Gurman suggests that Apple will release a super tiny Mac mini later this year with an M4 chip.

This new model will be closer in size to the Apple TV than the existing Mac mini, but the report mentions that it’s likely taller than an Apple TV, making it more of a cube or a tower than a flack puck. It will still be made from aluminum and should have at least three USB-C ports and an HDMI jack, we don’t know more than that.

People working on this device are reportedly calling it an iPad Pro in a box, but a higher-end option with an M4 Pro chipset will be released afterward.

It will be interesting to see if Apple keeps a fan in the unit or removes it. If it’s taken out, it will bring the mini more in line with the MacBook Air and iMac. However, since one of the models is slated to have an M4 Pro chipset, I believe that the new mini will have a fan to help the redesign work for higher-end chipsets over the next decade.

The previous Mac mini has maintained its design since Steve Jobs revealed it in 2010, so I’d expect the next model’s design to last at least another ten years.

There’s actually a small cottage industry of people on YouTube transplanting their Mac minis into smaller cases, if you want to see how much actual hardware is in the current iteration. However, I expect since Apple can design its motherboards around the hardware limitations of a smaller case it should be able to create a smaller unit than most content creators.

While this redesign is really exciting, we can only hope it leads us closer to the computer in a keyboard design that Apple patented and was revealed to the public in 2022. However, it will likely be another decade before we see this redesign.

The standard M4 version should be shipping from suppliers to Apple soon, suggesting it’s ready to go on sale sometime in the next few months. The high-end version isn’t slated to finish production until October.

Beyond the Mac mini’s redesign, the report mentions that Apple is on track to unify its Mac lineup over the next 12 months, with each model getting an M4 chipset of some kind. After the mini, it’s expected that Apple will do a new iMac and a MacBook Pro, and those might even come out this year. Next year, there will be a MacBook Air, a Mac Pro, and a Mac Studio.

Sonos delays two new products as it races to fix a buggy app.,https://www.investopedia.com/sonos-slashes-guidance-delays-products-fix-app-bug-8692444,"Key Takeaways Sonos lowered its outlook and delayed two product launches as it worked to fix a bug in its new app.

The company said it had to put its full attention on repairing the app problem, which has led to problems for some customers of its audio products.

The news overshadowed the firm's better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter results.

Sonos (SONO) shares slumped on Thursday, a day after the maker of headphones and home sound systems cut its guidance and delayed two hardware releases as it races to fix bugs in its app.

Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Patrick Spence explained that while the company's launch of its Ace headphones led to better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter results, those were ""overshadowed by the problems that our customers and partners experienced as a result of the rollout of our new app.""

Spence pointed out that in the weeks following the app's release on May 7, it was clear ""that there were stubborn bugs we had not discovered in our testing,"" which led to poor performance for some users.

App Glitch Delays Products, Hurts Sales

Spence said the company would delay two major product releases scheduled for the fourth quarter. ""We believe our focus needs to be addressing the app ahead of everything else,"" he said.

The product delays and sales headwinds stemming from the app's issues led Sonos to reduce its outlook. It now sees full-year revenue between $1.5 billion and $1.52 billion, down from previous guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion.

In its fiscal third quarter, Sonos posted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.03, up from a per-share loss of 18 cents in the year-ago quarter, and revenue of $397.1 million. Both the top and bottom lines exceeded forecasts.

Shares of Sonos fell about 6% as of 12:45 p.m. ET Thursday to $11.27, their lowest level since November. The stock has shed a third of its value so far this year.

Sonos delays two new products as it races to fix a buggy app.,https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215589/sonos-q3-2024-earnings-ace-headphone-buggy-app,"Sonos CEO Patrick Spence said the new Ace headphones got off to a strong start and helped spur “year over year revenue growth” that slightly exceeded the company’s expectations as part of its third quarter earnings on Wednesday afternoon. But that success was immediately “overshadowed” by ongoing woes with the redesigned Sonos app.

The company is now delaying two hardware releases originally planned for later this year as it deploys an all-hands-on-deck approach to fixing the app. “I will not rest until we’re in a position where we’ve addressed the issues and have customers raving about Sonos again,” Spence said during the afternoon earnings call.

“We believe our focus needs to be addressing the app ahead of everything else,” he continued. “This means delaying the two major new product releases we had planned for Q4 until our app experience meets the level of quality that we, our customers, and our partners expect from Sonos.” One of those two products is almost certainly Sonos’ next flagship soundbar, codenamed Lasso, which I revealed last month. “These products were ready to ship in Q4,” Spence said in response to a question on the call.

He also went in-depth on the app issues and how Sonos plans to fix them. Spence remains adamant that overhauling the app and its underlying infrastructure “was the right thing to do” for the company’s future; the new app “has a modular developer platform based on modern programming languages that will allow us to drive more innovation faster,” he said.

But Spence also now acknowledges that the project was rushed. “With the app, my push for speed backfired,” he said. “As we rolled out the new software to more and more users, it became evident that there were stubborn bugs we had not discovered in our testing. As a result, far too many of our customers are having an experience that is worse than what they previously had.”

Last month, Spence issued an apology for the bugs, missing features, unstable system performance, and other problems that customers have encountered since the redesigned app first rolled out in May. Just this morning, a temporarily cloud services outage caused problems for some systems. Sonos has promised app updates every two weeks as it works to earn back the trust of its customers. The app is in a better place now than it was two months ago, but some features like queue management won’t be restored until the fall.

For now, Sonos is turning to some longtime experts for help. “I’ve asked Nick Millington, the original software architect of the Sonos experience, to do whatever it takes to address the issues with our new app,” Spence said. Sonos board member Tom Conrad is helping to oversee the app improvement effort and “ensure” things stay on the right track."

Hugging Face acquires Seattle data storage startup XetHub.,https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-news-updates/hugging-face-acquires-xethub-to-build-and-scale-millions-of-large-llms/,"Hugging Face, an AI and machine learning platform, has acquired XetHub, a Seattle-based company focused on scaling Git for large datasets and AI models. The acquisition aims to enhance Hugging Face’s capabilities in managing and versioning large datasets and models, a critical need as the AI community scales to even larger models and datasets.

“This is the real 🍓—welcome to @xetdata. We’re just getting started!” posted Hugging Face Chief Clement Delangue on X, in reference to OpenAI’s project Strawberry.

​​“Big models are here to stay,” said Delangue. “What we want is to make the development of AI closer to what software engineering is — make it drastically faster,” he added.

I am super excited to announce that we've acquired XetHub! 🎊



The @xetdata team has developed technologies to enable Git to scale to TeraByte-size repositories.



Under the hood they've been adding file chunking and deduplication inside Git.



This will help us unlock the next 5… pic.twitter.com/0rlVRJxElF — Julien Chaumond (@julien_c) August 8, 2024

Founded in 2021 by Yucheng Low, Ajit Banerjee, and Rajat Arya, XetHub has developed technology that enables Git to handle terabyte-scale repositories, allowing teams to work efficiently with evolving datasets and models. This acquisition aligns with Hugging Face’s long-term goal of optimising storage and versioning for AI development, moving away from the limitations of Git LFS, which was not designed to handle the immense file sizes typical in AI.

“The XetHub team will help us unlock the next 5 years of growth of HF datasets and models by switching to our own, better version of LFS as storage backend for the Hub’s repos,” said Hugging Face CTO Julien Chaumond.

He further added that XetHub’s technology would unlock significant growth for the platform by enabling more efficient data management. For example, instead of re-uploading entire files, users will only need to upload modified chunks, streamlining updates and reducing storage needs. This improvement is crucial as AI models continue to grow in size, with trillion-parameter models like the BigLlama-3.1-1T already on the horizon.

XetHub, which started in 2021 with support from Madrona and other angel investors, was built by a team experienced in scaling AI infrastructure, including work on Apple’s internal machine learning infrastructure.

The team will now integrate XetHub’s technology into the Hugging Face platform, aiming to make AI collaboration and development easier for its vast community of users.

In the announcement, Yucheng Low, co-founder of XetHub, highlighted the importance of data in AI’s evolution and expressed excitement about joining Hugging Face to continue their mission of enhancing AI collaboration at scale.

Hugging Face is currently handling a significant volume of data, with over 1.3 million model repositories, 450,000 datasets, and 680,000 spaces, totaling 12 petabytes of data stored in LFS. The acquisition of XetHub is expected to help manage this growing demand more efficiently.

Hugging Face’s infrastructure team is also expanding and actively hiring to support the ongoing development of its platform.

Previously Hugging Face acquired Spanish-based startup Agrilla for $10 million. Argilla specialises in collaborative software for AI professionals, focusing on data annotation and enhancing NLP with human-machine collaboration. This acquisition helps Hugging Face improve its data annotation capabilities and integrate human feedback into AI model training.

Hugging recently announced profitability as well. Founded in 2016, Hugging Face secured $235 million at a $4.5 billion valuation in a Series D funding round last year from major players including Google, Amazon, NVIDIA, Salesforce, AMD, Intel, IBM, and Qualcomm."
"Tenways AGO-T is a well-equipped, but heavy e-bike.",https://www.engadget.com/transportation/tenways-ago-t-is-a-well-equipped-but-heavy-e-bike-133005101.html,"Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products .

There’s a problem with most e-bikes, which is that you’ll never find one that does every job perfectly. A city cruiser with no grunt will leave you stranded when you reach an incline while a beefy cargo bike can haul gear, but it’s too big for commuting. Tenways’ AGO-T has tried to square many of these circles by sticking almost too much power onto a Dutch-style step-thru frame.

It’s marketed as a bike for city living, but for cities where you’re not just dealing with flat, well paved roads. It’s got a beefy motor and battery, giving it enough power to tackle the steepest hill with ease, and a decent pannier rack for cargo capacity. But all of that extra power comes with the weight that comes with it, and so while it’s meant to be nimble, it’s also hefty.

Photo by Daniel Cooper / Engadget

The e-bike market is sufficiently homogeneous that I won’t look at a unit unless it’s got some eye-catching features. The AGO-T’s spec-list sold me on a test ride given the sheer volume of stuff bolted onto its frame: A Bafang M420 mid-drive motor with 80 Nm max torque (although you’ll get less of that in day-to-day-use); a Gates carbon belt; and Enviolo’s stepless shifting hub. You also get hydraulic disc brakes, a Selle Royal seat, an integrated front light and an integrated rear light built into the pannier rack.

There’s often something a little medicinal about most bikes with a step-through frame. But a combination of paneling to hide away a lot of its mechanisms and the fancy “Jungle Green” paint job sets the AGO-T apart. In fact, I’d go so far as to say that it's a rather stylish way to get around town, even if it’s built more for power than maneuverability.

You can expect to pay a pretty penny for those sorts of specs, and the AGO-T is priced £2,699 (around $3,500). That’s a lot of cash for a bike, but not unreasonable given the gear on show, and the fact it’s been packaged so neatly. You can get a cheaper alternative like Gazelle’s Paris C7+ for a grand less, but you’ll notice compromises, like the weaker motor.

Photo by Daniel Cooper / Engadget

The AGO-T has a range of 100km (62 miles) with its motor-assisted top speed limited, as per the law, to 15 miles per hour. Put it this way, I rarely if ever felt like I was going too slow on this thing, and often had to dial down its speed.

The last few e-bikes I’ve tested had basic digital displays offering little more than your speed and how much assist the bike was giving you. By comparison, the AGO-T’s full-color LCD display comes across almost as too much, especially given its enormous size. There’s a lot of negative space in the UI, too, and it looks more like the instrument cluster on a car. Sometimes less is more. And, yes, a TFT LCD isn’t ideal when you’re out in really strong sunlight.

Photo by Daniel Cooper / Engadget

Up top is the time and battery level, while the middle shows speed in miles or kilometers per hour. The lower third indicates the assist level (from 0-5) and then there are two boxes, which cycle through a number of data points: Average speed, maximum speed, trip time, range, the amount of CO2 you haven’t burned and the trees you’ve commensurately saved. I’m not sure I’d ever need those last two data points available to me all the time, and I’m not sure what the basis for that claim is anyway. Especially when those sorts of metrics are far better suited to the app than the primary display.

As for the app, it’s like every other e-bike app in that you probably won’t ever look at it except to satisfy your curiosity. There is a built-in GPS that you can use by mounting your phone to the handlebars or, even better, with the directions pushed to the bike display. Sadly, the quality of the GPS on offer is well below Google or Apple Maps, with many local landmarks not listed. Similarly, the turn-by-turn directions routed to the bike screen consist only of turn signal and distance, which is a far cry from what a good GPS should offer. This is a feature that could be world class and suffers by merely being adequate, if that.

Photo by Daniel Cooper / Engadget

The AGO-T weighs 31kg (68 pounds) and you will feel every gram of that weight when you’re holding it. I do not recommend carrying it up and down stairs unless you’re built like the worst person you see at the gym. If you live in a poorly-served apartment building I don’t think this is the bike for you, but if you can safely store this at ground level, go for it. It’s like owning an SUV which is great when you’re tooling around town, and awful when you can’t fit into a small space in the parking lot.

Its heaviness means it’s a little stodgier when you’re on the road, especially at low speeds where you’ll have to work harder to maintain balance. There’s an accessibility argument often made about e-bikes that they help empower folks who may not be as physically strong. A bike like this might fall at this hurdle given its heft. But in motion, the AGO-T is tuned to be sedate, gliding around the roads rather than zooming down them. This smoothness makes sense, because you’re looking at this to get you from A to B, as well as haul some bags or a kid along with you.

Tenways markets the AGO-T on the basis it can take whatever a city can throw at it. I had no doubts, given the power of that Bafang mid-drive motor, that it would be able to tackle the steep hills in my home city of Norwich. When I test e-bikes or scooters, I try to zip up a hill with an incline of 22.4 degrees, which regularly defeats lesser bikes. But with the AGO-T, I actually had to turn the gears down because it felt too easy and weightless with the assist up to the max. Even after I’d tweaked things, I think this is the first time I’ve ridden up that hill and not broken even the merest hint of a sweat.

This does, however, come at the cost of the range, and the estimates quickly started dropping once I’d started tackling hills. That said, you can easily get 30 miles out of this on a charge, which is more than enough for most days, right?

Tenways also claims the AGO-T can tackle rough terrain on this bike, so I took it over a few dirt tracks. The adjustable front forks and suspension seat meant that the bike evened out some pretty bumpy areas. Obviously, I wouldn’t want to take this off-roading but I was surprised at how well it coped with gravel tracks and dirt pathways riddled with tree branches.

Photo by Daniel Cooper / Engadget

As a city cruiser that can eat hills like they’re cotton candy, the Tenways’ AGO-T is a bit of a fantasy bike. I could easily see myself using this as my primary bike, especially given the variable terrain of my home city. Whether you should buy one becomes less a question of its qualities that your needs in the given moment. Are you in need of a bike that can handle all types of terrain at any gradient that’ll also give you cargo space? Are you strong enough to wrestle with its considerable weight? And, of course, do you have enough cash in the bank to buy it and then make sure there’s safe places to park it? If the answer to all of those is yes, then this is pretty much a slam dunk."

There’s a lot of negative space in the UI, too, and it looks more like the instrument cluster on a car. Sometimes less is more. And, yes, a TFT LCD isn’t ideal when you’re out in really strong sunlight.

Up top is the time and battery level, while the middle shows speed in miles or kilometers per hour. The lower third indicates the assist level (from 0-5) and then there are two boxes, which cycle through a number of data points: Average speed, maximum speed, trip time, range, the amount of CO2 you haven’t burned and the trees you’ve commensurately saved. I’m not sure I’d ever need those last two data points available to me all the time, and I’m not sure what the basis for that claim is anyway. Especially when those sorts of metrics are far better suited to the app than the primary display.

As for the app, it’s like every other e-bike app in that you probably won’t ever look at it except to satisfy your curiosity. There is a built-in GPS that you can use by mounting your phone to the handlebars or, even better, with the directions pushed to the bike display. Sadly, the quality of the GPS on offer is well below Google or Apple Maps, with many local landmarks not listed. Similarly, the turn-by-turn directions routed to the bike screen consist only of turn signal and distance, which is a far cry from what a good GPS should offer. This is a feature that could be world class and suffers by merely being adequate, if that.

The AGO-T weighs 31kg (68 pounds) and you will feel every gram of that weight when you’re holding it. I do not recommend carrying it up and down stairs unless you’re built like the worst person you see at the gym. If you live in a poorly-served apartment building I don’t think this is the bike for you, but if you can safely store this at ground level, go for it. It’s like owning an SUV which is great when you’re tooling around town, and awful when you can’t fit into a small space in the parking lot.

Its heaviness means it’s a little stodgier when you’re on the road, especially at low speeds where you’ll have to work harder to maintain balance. There’s an accessibility argument often made about e-bikes that they help empower folks who may not be as physically strong. A bike like this might fall at this hurdle given its heft. But in motion, the AGO-T is tuned to be sedate, gliding around the roads rather than zooming down them. This smoothness makes sense, because you’re looking at this to get you from A to B, as well as haul some bags or a kid along with you.

Tenways markets the AGO-T on the basis it can take whatever a city can throw at it. I had no doubts, given the power of that Bafang mid-drive motor, that it would be able to tackle the steep hills in my home city of Norwich. When I test e-bikes or scooters, I try to zip up a hill with an incline of 22.4 degrees, which regularly defeats lesser bikes. But with the AGO-T, I actually had to turn the gears down because it felt too easy and weightless with the assist up to the max. Even after I’d tweaked things, I think this is the first time I’ve ridden up that hill and not broken even the merest hint of a sweat.

This does, however, come at the cost of the range, and the estimates quickly started dropping once I’d started tackling hills. That said, you can easily get 30 miles out of this on a charge, which is more than enough for most days, right?

Tenways also claims the AGO-T can tackle rough terrain on this bike, so I took it over a few dirt tracks. The adjustable front forks and suspension seat meant that the bike evened out some pretty bumpy areas. Obviously, I wouldn’t want to take this off-roading but I was surprised at how well it coped with gravel tracks and dirt pathways riddled with tree branches.

As a city cruiser that can eat hills like they’re cotton candy, the Tenways’ AGO-T is a bit of a fantasy bike. I could easily see myself using this as my primary bike, especially given the variable terrain of my home city. Whether you should buy one becomes less a question of its qualities that your needs in the given moment. Are you in need of a bike that can handle all types of terrain at any gradient that’ll also give you cargo space? Are you strong enough to wrestle with its considerable weight? And, of course, do you have enough cash in the bank to buy it and then make sure there’s safe places to park it? If the answer to all of those is yes, then this is pretty much a slam dunk."

Dyson Spheres are probably way beyond what our technology is capable of.

A few months ago, a paper by a team of astronomers caused a stir because it was hinted by some that their findings — several sudden large dips in a star’s brightness – could be explained by aliens building a gigantic spherical megastructure to harness its energy.

Whether such a structure could even be physically possible is debatable, so Business Insider took a closer look at the research and theories that are out there.



The mysterious dips of KIC 8462852

Caltech astronomers Ben Montet and Joshua Simon looked at a series of research about a star called KIC 8462852 (also called Tabby’s Star), and published their findings on arXiv, an online archive where researchers can submit scientific papers without being peer reviewed.

Tabby’s Star was observed by NASA’s Kepler mission, and one paper noted that there were several large dips in its brightness over the 20th century, and over that time it got 3% fainter.

Montet told Business Insider that this would be unusual as stars don’t tend to do that when they’re middle-aged, as Tabby’s Star is. This meant something must be blocking some of the light, but exactly what could be doing that was unclear. The dimmings were too large to be caused by a planet and too sporadic to be the result of something in orbit.

“If it’s a solid body it would have to be really big, about twice the size of Jupiter, and that’s problematic because planets don’t get to be that big,” Montet said. “Something that’s two Jupiter masses really can only be a star, and stars are bright. If there was a star, we would be able to detect it’s light, and we don’t see that.”

Among many theories such as a huge belt of debris or passing asteroids, was the Dyson Sphere hypothesis; a massive hypothetical structure that in some way encompasses a star to soak up all of its solar energy.

The Dyson Sphere idea came from a scientist who was inspired by a science fiction novel.

Dyson spheres are named after Princeton physicist Freeman Dyson, who proposed the idea in a 1960 paper called Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation. He took inspiration from a novel which mentioned the technology called Star Maker, which was written by Olaf Stapledon in 1937.

The idea was that intelligent species would turn to the sun for huge amounts of energy if resources were dwindling on their planet.

Story continues

“One should expect that, within a few thousand years of its entering the stage of industrial development, any intelligent species should be found occupying an artificial biosphere which completely surrounds its parent star,” Dyson wrote in the paper.

But would it be possible to build one?

With engineering as we know it, a Dyson Sphere probably isn’t feasible. It would require building a massive hollow sphere that wouldn’t be torn apart by immense forces, so it would have to be made of materials way stronger than anything that already exists on Earth.

Although being spherical would in theory make the structure stable, any knock from a passing meteoroid or debris could de-stabilize the entire thing and destroy it.

A Dyson Swarm could look something like this.

A more promising concept is a Dyson Swarm, which is a similar idea, except it would consist of several solar panels orbiting the star, essentially like a network of satellites. From a distance, it would look like a dense cloud, rather than a spherical case.

According to Dr Stuart Armstrong, a researcher at Oxford University’s Future of Humanity Institute who has studied megastructure concepts, building such a device could take as little time as a few decades, and it would mostly be achieved using robots.

The first step though would be to mine Mercury for iron and oxygen to make hematite, which is used to make mirrors. In fact, the whole planet might have to be taken apart, and after 40 years all of its resources would be drained.

If humans were to build a Dyson Swarm around our sun, Armstrong estimates that we might have to dismantle most of our solar system, including Mercury, Venus, Mars and Earth.

In a hypothetical future, anything might be possible.

However, if we were to reach this stage then such a project probably wouldn’t be quite as daunting as it sounds, because given the extra energy and robotics from stripping Mercury, mining Venus may only take one year, Armstrong said.

Of course, when you’re looking this far into the future and considering incredibly advanced technology, there is no telling where humanity will be. There’s one argument that if we had the technology to build a Dyson Swarm then it’s likely that we probably wouldn’t need to, as our renewable energy technology would be so efficient already.

As for whether Dyson Spheres or Swarms actually exist in the universe, it cannot be ruled out, but it probably shouldn’t be considered fact either.

“There have been several times where we’ve looked at things in space before and claimed aliens, and then they’ve ended up being perfectly physical scenarios: canals on Mars a hundred years ago, the discovery of pulsars 50 years ago,” Montet said. “For that reason I think it’s an interesting hypothesis to think about, but we need to really rule out all of the physical explanations before we can really start considering it.”

"Tenways AGO-T is a well-equipped, but heavy e-bike.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/potential-en-bloc-properties-singapore-000021173.html,"Potential En Bloc Condos in Singapore: Does Yours Stand A Chance in 2023?

Just as everyone thought the en bloc phenomenon was dying, there was a revival in en bloc sales in the second half of 2021. Alas, the government stepped in with their new raft of property cooling measures in December 2021, which was akin to pouring cold water on prospecting developers’ heads, dampening the en bloc market once again.

So, what does the en bloc market have in store for us in 2023? And could your property be one of the top condos with en bloc potential in 2023? Let’s find out.

En Bloc in Singapore: What Is It?

But first, what exactly is “en bloc”, and why can it be so lucrative for those lucky enough to be involved?

The term en bloc (also known as a collective sale) is French in origin and means “in a lump, or block”, “as a whole”, or “all together”. En bloc sales differ from regular property transactions in terms of scale. In a regular transaction, you only sell one property to another individual at market value. In an en bloc in Singapore, the entire private development is sold when a large majority of the owners agree to the sale, selling their homes simultaneously to a particular buyer.

Usually, this buyer is a property developer buying a private development, which is the collective sale type that this article will cover.

Many homeowners in Singapore hope and pray that their property will have en bloc potential and be selected for a collective sale, and for good reason. En bloc sale prices are usually well above market rate as developers tend to be willing to pay top dollar for a choice site. So, unsurprisingly, a successful en bloc sale can be like winning the property lottery.

Why Do En Bloc Sales in Singapore Command so Much Money?

Since developers believe they can earn a tidy profit from redeveloping an en bloc site, they are not averse to paying astronomical sums of money. As older developments typically do not use space as effectively as newer ones, the Gross Floor Area (GFA) and plot ratio of older developments can be maximised by developers to extract maximum value from an en bloc site.

For example, if you’re living in an old gated property with low-rise blocks spaced far apart, developers can buy up the land, demolish all those blocks and build 30-storey towers in their place. They can then sell each unit in those towers for more money than it would cost them to acquire that land.

Since a collective sale requires most of the residents to agree to sell their homes, the developers have to convince them that it’s worth giving up their property and moving elsewhere. They do this by offering large amounts of money, hoping the residents will take up the offer.

Story continues

En Bloc Sales: How Does It Work?

Who is making the en bloc purchase? Either a property developer or the government Sales process Can take up to two years What is sold in the en bloc? Every unit in the condo + the land How much can you sell for? The en bloc committee will typically set a reserve price that is set at a premium above the current market price. The buyer (i.e. property developer or government) will try to match the reserve price or negotiate with the en bloc committee. When is an en bloc confirmed? When the en bloc committee gets a consensus to sell from the owners.

For condos < 10 years since TOP, you need ≥ 90% of all owners to agree to sell.

For condos ≥ 10 years since TOP, you need ≥ 80% of all owners to agree to sell.

The sale process can also take rather long, often up to two years for the sale to be finalised and for you to receive the sales proceeds.

Developers tend to purchase these properties at a premium, so if you bought your property some time ago when it cost less, you’re likely to walk away with a big profit.

It then hardly becomes surprising that potential en bloc sites are a hot topic among Singaporeans. The question on most peoples’ minds is likely about which properties are next in line and if their property is one of the top condos with en bloc potential in 2023.

2023 Housing Market: Where Is the En Bloc Market Heading towards?

According to Property Guru’s Singapore Property Market Index Q4 2021, the Singapore government has been calibrating the land supply in the past few years. This has made developers focus on en bloc sales to replenish their depleted land banks. And as the cost is high for larger en bloc sites, developers favoured smaller- to medium-sized en bloc launches in 2022 instead.

That is not to say larger condominiums will definitely make it onto the failed en bloc list and not have a chance to be one of the top condos with en bloc potential in 2023. In July 2022, the 446-unit Chuan Park sold for $890 million, and was the biggest en bloc sale since the collective sale of Tulip Garden in January 2019, that is, until it was given a stop order by the Strata Titles Board in December 2022, when six minority owners objected to the transaction.

ABSD Rates for Entities Buying Any Residential Property

8 Dec 2011 to 11 Jan 2013 10% 12 Jan 2013 to 5 Jul 2018 15% 6 Jul 2018 to 15 Dec 2021 25%, plus an additional 5% for housing developers On or after 16 Dec 2021 35%, plus an additional 5% for housing developers

Still, en bloc offers in Singapore have been slowing down ever since the government started implementing property cooling measures like increasing Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty (ABSD) rates, which can amount to a huge sum given that en bloc transactions can go over a billion dollars.

With economic uncertainty and the threat of recession looming over our heads, it’s no surprise that the en bloc market might slow down in 2023.

According to Dr. Tan Tee Khoon, Country Manager – Singapore, PropertyGuru, the relatively higher ABSD rates (caused by the December 2021 property cooling measures), rising interest rates and construction costs, and increased land betterment charge rates are likely to be factors affecting en bloc sales. Mortgage loan rates impacting borrowing and affordability also impact local buying demand.

Still, some developers might be tempted to try sites on the failed en bloc list in 2023. Last year, 24 sites made it onto the failed en bloc list; only 12 en bloc sites were sold out of 36 placed on the market in 2022. In their second and subsequent attempts at collective sales, several failed en bloc sale sites may have their asking prices reduced, making it even more enticing for developers.

So comes the question: does your condo come with en bloc potential? Below we list a few ways to identify condos with en bloc potential.

How to Identify Top Condos with En Bloc Potential 2023

1. Rising Land Value

If your neighbourhood is undergoing lots of development, such as a new MRT station or a major transformation, the land value in the area could be rapidly rising, which is a sign of good investment potential from the developers’ point of view.

2. Inefficient Use of Land

Old blocks or condo estates that don’t fully utilise their land area have higher chances of being one of Singapore’s top condos with en bloc potential, as they can be demolished and turned into denser residential developments. If you’re living in a block of flats with only eight floors where there could be multiple 30-storey condo towers, it’s an attractive investment for a property developer.

3. Old Property

Developers gravitate towards older properties because the value per square metre of land is lower, and residents who live in older properties tend to be a bit more agreeable to collective sales. Furthermore, developers only need to obtain at least 80% of the owners’ agreement for properties 10 years and older versus 90% for properties below 10 years old.

4. Robust Property Market

En bloc sales in Singapore involve a lot of money, so they are more likely to happen if developers think they can profit from buying and redeveloping the land. The performance of the market will play a part in how often developers bid for new sites and how much they’ll offer.

Tip: To spot future property trends and identify top condos with en bloc potential in 2023, refer to the Master Plan 2019 to see the government’s plans for land use development over the next 10 to 15 years.

"Tenways AGO-T is a well-equipped, but heavy e-bike.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/frasers-tower-beyond-grade-office-065151902.html,"Developer Frasers Property Singapore’s first CBD office tower is the missing piece linking the area to the Tanjong Pagar district. There are also community spaces to foster interaction and draw customers to the F&B outlets.

During the peak lunch hours of 12pm to 2pm on weekdays, office workers in the CBD now have more dining options. Likewise, when it comes to meeting friends for dinner or drinks in the evenings. There is Muchachos Mexican restaurant, Cuba Libre Café & Bar, local fusion restaurant Relish as well as new to market offerings, Italian restaurant The Mast and Thai eatery, Ocha Fresh Thai. For those who want fine dining, there is Preludio by Colombian chef-owner Fernando Arevalo, formerly at Artemis in CapitaGreen.

These F&B outlets are located in a three-storey retail podium called The Oasis, featuring a cascading design with greenery and water elements as well as a landscaped roof terrace. The Oasis is integrated with the 38-storey Grade-A office tower, Tower. Located on the corner of Cecil Street and Telok Ayer Street, the building was completed in mid-2018.

Fronting the tower is a park with a fountain, designed such that a stage can be put over it for live performances in the future. There are also pavilions with seats and restaurants designed as kiosks within the park to draw people in, says Low Chee Wah, Frasers Property Singapore’s senior executive vice president and head of retail and commercial.

“When we built this tower, it was zoned for an office development,” explains Low. “But we wanted to build a community: We created four community zones so that people can use this place not just as an office but as a gathering point too.”

The development was designed by DP Architects, with Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co as the contractor, having been awarded the $287 million construction contract in 2015. In August 2013, Frasers Property Singapore paid $924 million or $1,112 psf per plot ratio for the 99-year leasehold, 82,841 sq ft, commercial site. It was where the former Telok Ayer Performing Arts Centre once stood.



Frasers Tower comprises a 38-storey Premium Grade A office tower with community zones

According to Low, the developer undertook a “sun study” to find the best orientation of the building that will provide shading. Landscaping was also integrated within the building.

Community spaces

While the building was under construction, there was a shift in office trends: Large tech companies like Google began incorporating breakout areas, recreational spaces with foosball tables within their office space.

Story continues

Recognising the need to create such spaces for tenants, Frasers Tower created the four community zones within the building: other than The Oasis, there are The Sky, The Terrace and The Park. All the community areas have natural ventilation and are designed with spaces for tenants to relax, to hang out or collaborate.

The Terrace located on the fourth floor is designed as an event space – it can be used for townhall sessions, recreational activities and special events for up to 200 people. There is also Wifi connection so people could work there if they want, and foosball tables, pool tables, table tennis tables as well as resting pods.

Typically, the rooftops of commercial builds are where mechanical and engineering (M&E) equipment is placed, says Low. Frasers Property Singapore has converted the tower’s rooftop into a garden called The Sky where tenants can enjoy panoramic views of the city and rent the space for events.

“A lot of buildings in the CBD have spaces like this but they end up becoming smoking areas because they’re not fitted-out for use,” notes Low.



The Terrace has been designed as a space for tenant events, town hall sessions and recreation activities

High specifications

The building also comes with end-of-trip facilities in the basement, from the 117 secured bicycle parking system, to lockers, shower facilities with towels provided and changing rooms. “People will not cycle to work if you don’t provide such facilities,” he notes. The carpark, and a lobby with a pick-up and drop off point are also located in the basement.

Frasers Tower marks Frasers Property Singapore’s first Grade-A office development in the CBD, and is in fact, its first office development in nearly three decades – since Alexandra Point, a 24-storey office tower on Alexandra Road, was completed in 1992. Other commercial projects developed by Frasers Property Singapore in the past include Alexandra Technopark and 51 Cuppage Road.

“This being our first office development in a long time, we put a lot of thought into the process,” he says. “We didn’t want to build a typical office building. We wanted to differentiate the product from what is available in the market. We also recognised that the workplace has changed. People don’t just work at their workstations in the office all day.”

Frasers Tower has a total net lettable area (NLA) of 663,000 sq ft with floor plates of 20,000 to 22,000 sq ft. The building has a BCA Green Mark Platinum rating, which is the highest accolade in sustainability. Besides low-e, double-glazed glass, the developer has also invested in the latest destination control system for the lifts. The project also uses rainwater harvesting used in irrigation of plants and NEWater to serve the cooling towers.

Diverse tenant mix

To date, the office tower has achieved 94% occupancy, with asking rents now in the range of $11 to $13 psf per month. Anchor tenants include tech giant Microsoft Singapore and French oil and gas company Total Oil, which are taking up a combined floor area of 232,200 sq ft or 35% of the total NLA.

Other tenants in the tower are a diverse mix, and include Japanese trading house Sumitomo Corporation; global design, architecture and engineering firm Arup; New Zealand dairy co-operative Fonterra; American insurance company Pacific Life; and serviced office provider The Executive Centre.

“We have observed that a small but growing number of corporates have been exploring enterprise solutions offered by co-working and agile space providers,” says Moray Armstrong, CBRE managing director of Singapore. “It’s still early days and we do not see a significant threat to traditional office demand at this point.”

Recent M&A activity in the media and banking sectors could also weigh on future office demand, notes Armstrong. “The prospects for the Singapore office market may be increasingly reliant on the stellar growth levels in technology and agile space operators being maintained.”



Low: We wanted to build something beyond an office. We wanted to build a community

Benefitting from tight supply in the CBD

Many occupiers are still keen to have a CBD presence, points out Chris Archibold, JLL Singapore head of leasing. “However, the limited availability of good-quality space for lease, based on most Grade-A office developments in the CBD enjoying near-full occupancies, is driving rentals steadily upwards.”

JLL’s preliminary research showed that the average vacancy rate of Grade-A office space in the CBD has tightened from 7.2% in 4Q2018 to just 6% in 1Q2019. By the end of 4Q2019 when more occupiers which have committed to space in recent completions such as Frasers Tower and 18 Robinson move in, JLL forecasts that the average vacancy rate of Grade-A office space in the CBD could plunge below the frictional level of 5%. “The squeeze for space had led to 1Q2019 rent growth accelerating to 3.7% q-o-q from the 3.3% q-o-q in 4Q2018,” says Archibold.

No relief is seen for supply any time soon, says JLL. This is because the next office completion in the CBD will likely be 79 Robinson Road and Afro Asia i-Mark which are expected to provide some 0.7 million sq ft of office NLA in total only from 2020. The refurbished Chevron House could also return to the market in 2020. Thereafter, CapitaSpring and Hub Synergy Point are expected to come on stream in 2021, followed by IOI Properties’ Central Boulevard project and Guoco Midtown.

“Landlords remain fairly optimistic on the outlook and rent expectations,” says Archibold. “This will be supported by the tapering new office supply over the next 12 months. The outlook for the office market is still positive over the immediate to mid-term.”

According to CBRE, Grade-A Core CBD office rents in 1Q2019 grew 3.2% q-o-q to $11.15 psf. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of rent growth, bringing rents to 24.6% higher than the last trough back in 2017.

Connectivity, Greater Southern Waterfront

In recent years, Tanjong Pagar has been rejuvenated since the completion of the $3.2 billion Tanjong Pagar Centre integrated development in November 2016. It is linked directly to the Tanjong Pagar MRT station in the basement.

Frasers Tower likewise has an underpass that leads directly to Tanjong Pagar MRT station. The developer has also made provision for an overhead link from the second level to the neighbouring Bangkok Bank Building on Cecil Street if the latter is redeveloped.

Frasers Property Singapore’s Low sees the Telok Ayer and Tanjong Pagar area benefitting from the development of the Greater Southern Waterfront. According to the URA Draft Master Plan 2019, the Greater Southern Waterfront will span the southern coastline from Pasir Panjang to Marina East. In the future, after the City Terminals and Pasir Panjang Terminal relocate to Tuas, about 1,000 ha of land will be freed up for development.

Together with other areas like Keppel Club and Sentosa, the Greater Southern Waterfront will double in size to 2,000 ha.

In addition, Frasers Tower could benefit from the rejuvenation of the areas around Anson Road, Cecil Street, Shenton Way, Robinson Road and Tanjong Pagar under the CBD Incentive Scheme announced on March 27.

The CBD Incentive Scheme offers an increase in gross plot ratio to encourage conversion of existing office developments to hotel and residential uses. “This could be beneficial for many office developments which face challenges when it comes to land use zoning,” says Christine Li, Cushman & Wakefield senior director of research.

There could also be wider implications for the office sector, says Li. Given that there could be a wave of redevelopments into the residential and hotel segments to tap the CBD Incentive Scheme, office supply in the medium term could be tighter, she notes. “This could potentially cause Grade-A CBD office rents to rise further as supply is taken off the market,” she adds. “Nonetheless, there could be positive outcomes as some companies would shift out of the CBD, which is in line with the government’s decentralisation strategy of commercial activities.”

In the meantime, word on the street is that there is already an interested party doing due diligence for the acquisition of Frasers Tower. According to sources, the indicative price is likely to be “just below $3,000 psf”. However, Frasers Property Singapore’s Low declined to comment. It looks like investor interest in Grade-A office towers in the CBD is likely to remain high.

""AMD mostly annihilates its competition in single-core performance, as the Ryzen 7 9700X shoots to the top of the pile with some of the best scores we've seen to date, save only for a CPU-Z result against Intel's 14th Gen i7-14700K. Given the lower physical core count of 8 on the 9700X compared to 20 on the 14700K, it's logical that each core can receive a higher share of wattage and offer stronger performance.""

Wilson also shared these insights regarding multi-core performance from the Ryzen 7 9700X:

""AMD's efforts to achieve this multi-core performance at half the power of Intel's competing chips shouldn't be understated. A 40W base TDP drop from the previous-gen 105W Ryzen 7 7700X hasn't stopped the Ryzen 7 9700X from delivering a decent generational performance uplift, though it's certainly far from the significant leap AMD made from the 65W 5700X. Still, it's an impressive metric as AMD moves from Zen 4's 5nm manufacturing process to TSMC's 4nm and is part of an overall showcase in performance-per-watt improvements for the Ryzen 9000 Series.""

Here's a closer look at how the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X performance compares to the competition from Intel and AMD itself.

As for the Ryzen 5 9600X, it's not quite as impressive as its Ryzen 7 sibling but was good enough to receive a Windows Central Recommended Award. In his Ryzen 5 9600X review, Wilson said:

""The entry-level chip of any processor generation is never expected to blow the previous range out of the water. However, AMD still delivers incredible single-core performance with the Ryzen 5 9600X. It pulls ahead of, or at least matches, every comparable Intel Core i5 and Core i7 processor and does it all with a lower TDP and more affordable MSRP. Still, it's not going to tempt those who already adopted the Ryzen 7000 Series or Intel's 12th, 13th, or 14th Gen Core desktop chips.""

Are the new AMD Ryzen 9000 CPUs for you?

The Ryzen 5 9600X is great for budget desktop PC builds. (Image credit: Ben Wilson | Windows Central)

Whether or not the AMD Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X appeal to you really depends on what you currently have in your PC and how you plan on using your PC.

The Ryzen 7 9700X has boosted single-core performance significantly, and any games or creative apps that can benefit will see an improvement. Even if you're just focused on gaming, the new Ryzen 7 chip should be one of the best choices on the market for a stellar mid-range experience.

On the other hand, enthusiasts who want the best performance from a Ryzen 7 should wait for AMD's -X3D variants that we're expecting to launch in the future. And for those who already have an AMD Ryzen 7700X chip, the performance gains probably aren't enough to warrant spending about $359 again so soon.

In the case of the Ryzen 5 9600X, enthusiast gamers will no doubt want to either check out the last-gen Ryzen 7 7800X3D or wait for the expected released of Ryzen 9000X3D variants. These chips are built specifically for gaming purposes.

On the other hand, AMD makes an argument for those who can benefit from single-core performance gains. The Ryzen 5 9600X also makes sense if you're upgrading from AM4 and want to keep things within a tighter budget."
AMD’s new Ryzen 9000 CPUs are cheaper than its previous-gen chips.,https://9to5toys.com/2024/08/08/amd-ryzen-9000-series-desktop-cpus-battlestation-now-available/,"Update: AMD’s new Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X are now live on Amazon as well, starting at $279.

AMD has officially launched its hotly anticipated Ryzen 9000 series desktop processors, and they’ve started to hit the shelves today. The timing here, I’d say, is great considering how many of Intel’s 13th and 14th gen processors are struggling with stability issues right now. The new Ryzen 9000 series includes four new desktop processors — the 16-core Ryzen 9 9950X, the 12-core Ryzen 9 9900X, the 8-core Ryzen 7 9700X, and lastly the 6-core Ryzen 5 9600X. Out of the four, only the octa-core Ryzen 7 9700X and the hexa-core Ryzen 5 9600X are hitting the shelves today, with the other two scheduled to arrive next week on August 15. Head below for more details on the pricing, availability, and compatibility details.

AMD Ryzen 9000 Series processors are now available

These new chips are based on the Zen 5 architecture, and AMD is promising around a 16% instructions per cycle (IPC) gain over the previous-gen Ryzen CPUs. Despite the promised gains in both productivity and gaming tasks, the new 9000 series chips are slightly lower than the Ryzen 7000 launch prices. The Ryzen 5 9600X marks the cheapest entry to the series at $279, whereas the slightly more powerful Ryzen 7 9700X will cost you $359. The Ryzen 9 9900X and 9950X will be available next week for $499 and $649, respectively.

Here’s what the entire lineup looks like so far:

AMD Ryzen 5 9600X $279

AMD Ryzen 7 9700X $359

AMD Ryzen 9 9900X $499 (from Aug 15)

AMD Ryzen 9 9950X $649 (from Aug 15)

These new processors headlined by the flagship Ryzen 9 9950X are all compatible with existing AM5 motherboards, meaning you don’t necessarily have to fork over for a brand new one just for the latest CPUs. You should be able to install these on your existing AM5 boards and they’ll run just fine after a quick BIOS update. Folks who are in the market for new motherboards, however, will have some new options that use AMD’s newly released X870 and X870E chipsets. These new motherboards will continue to roll out over time from various OEMs and they’ll get you all the essentials like USB 4.0 support, enhanced EXPO memory overclocking, and more.

AMD’s new Ryzen 9000 CPUs are cheaper than its previous-gen chips.,https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/processors/amds-new-ryzen-9000-cpus-are-officially-up-to-dollar50-cheaper-than-the-old-7000-series-were-at-launch/,"It's official. AMD has priced up its new Zen 5-based Ryzen 9000 CPUs. And would you believe it, they're actually cheaper than the outgoing Ryzen 7000-series family.

To be more precise, they're cheaper than the launch prices for Ryzen 7000 from two years ago. Most Ryzen 7000 models are now available for quite a bit less than those 2022 launch prices.

In other words, model for model, you're going to pay more for a given new Ryzen 9000 CPU than what it's Ryzen 7000 predecessor is available for today. But in a world where GPU prices seem to go up exponentially for each new generation, this has got to be good news.

Swipe to scroll horizontally AMD Ryzen 9000-series prices (confirmed) Header Cell - Column 0 Ryzen 7000 Cores and threads Launch price Ryzen 9000 Cores and threads Launch price Row 0 - Cell 0 Ryzen 9 7950X 16 cores, 32 threads $699 Ryzen 9 9950X 16 cores, 32 threads $649 Row 1 - Cell 0 Ryzen 9 7900X 12 cores, 24 threads $549 Ryzen 9 9900X 12 cores, 24 threads $499 Row 2 - Cell 0 Ryzen 7 7700X 8 cores, 16 threads $399 Ryzen 7 9700X 8 cores, 16 threads $359 Row 3 - Cell 0 Ryzen 5 7600X 6 cores, 12 threads $299 Ryzen 5 9600X 6 cores, 12 threads $279

That means the new chips are launching at pricing between $20 and $50 lower than the original prices for the Ryzen 7000 series. Inevitably, it's the higher end chips that get the bigger discounts.

Of course, as we mentioned, current pricing for various Ryzen 7000 models has fallen since launch. Right now, you're looking at about $200 for a Ryzen 5 7600X, $295 for a Ryzen 7 7700X, $360 for a Ryzen 9 7900X and $525 for a Ryzen 9 7950X.

So, the new chips are quite a bit pricier than current pricing for the 7000 series. But Ryzen 9000 pricing will likely fall over time and so the trend line is in the right direction.

Still, we shouldn't have to wait long to find out just what you'll be getting for your money from AMD's latest CPU designs. Look out for our full reviews of the new chips very soon.

Highlights include the aforementioned Zen 5 architecture with a 16% average uplift in IPC or instructions processed per clock cycle. Core counts remain the same, but clock speeds are very slightly up for some models.

We're not expecting a performance revolution with these new chips, but they should be tangibly faster. AMD is claiming performance gains up to 23% by some metrics. But we'll be the judge of that in our upcoming reviews. Watch this space."

Surprisingly, these prices represent a decrease relative to the prior generation.

An official X/Twitter post says that the Ryzen 7 9700X will be priced at $359 (down $40 from its previous Ryzen 7 7700X) and the Ryzen 5 9600X will be priced at $279 (down $20 from its previous Ryzen 5 7600X). They’re hitting the streets August 8.

Following a week later on August 15th will be the Ryzen 9 9950X, $649, and the Ryzen 7 9900X, $499. Those are cheaper than their 7000-series models by $50 each. While not as low as the initial Best Buy leak, the discount should be much appreciated by system builders.

AMD originally announced the Ryzen 9000 series earlier this year in June at Computex, promising to deliver by end of July. The launch was then delayed to ensure quality and address issues.

In July, AMD disclosed that its new Ryzen 9000 series demonstrates substantial performance gains over the previous Ryzen 7000 series. We now know these latest chips are cheaper, too.

Zen 5 release date, availability, and price

AMD originally confirmed that the Ryzen 9000 desktop processors will launch on July 31, 2024, two weeks after the launch date of the Ryzen AI 300. The initial lineup includes the Ryzen 9 9950X, the Ryzen 9 9900X, the Ryzen 7 9700X, and the Ryzen 5 9600X. However, AMD delayed the CPUs at the last minute, with the Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 showing up on August 8, and the Ryzen 9s showing up on August 15.

This was a surprise early release and seems likely to be an effort to get ahead of Intel, which is slated to debut its Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake CPUs much later in the year. It also gives AMD a chance to get its CPUs into the new breed of “AI” laptops that many major manufacturers are pushing.

Additional non-X and X3D variants are expected in the months that follow, with Club386 teasing that we might see the X3D chips as soon as September. That’d be sooner than expected, given that in the previous generation, the gap between the initial release and the X3D variants was longer.

For pricing, AMD reduced the list price across the Zen 5 desktop lineup compared to the previous generation. All of the new chips are cheaper, though to varying degrees. The two Ryzen 9s are $50 cheaper, for example, while the Ryzen 5 is only $20 cheaper. You can see how the pricing breaks down below.

AMD Ryzen 9000 Series processors are ready to deliver world class gaming and creator performance. Available Aug 8:

• Ryzen 7 9700X

• Ryzen 5 9600X Available Aug 15:

• Ryzen 9 9950X

• Ryzen 9 9900X pic.twitter.com/L9YOAyKmHg — AMD Ryzen (@AMDRyzen) August 6, 2024

As usual, the actual price you’ll pay comes down to individual retailers. Given the rapidly declining prices of last-gen Zen 4 CPUs, AMD’s new Zen 5 lineup should fall below list price in short order.

Zen 5 specs and architecture

AMD detailed the specifications of the four new Ryzen 9000 processors at Computex 2024, showcasing comparable core counts and clock speeds to the previous generation, while claiming inter-process communication (IPC) uplifts from the new architectural design.

Cores/Threads Base clock Boost clock L2 + L3 Cache TDP Ryzen 9 9950X 16/32 4.3GHz 5.7GHz 80MB 170W Ryzen 9 9900X 12/24 4.4GHz 5.6GHz 76MB 120W Ryzen 7 9700X 8/16 3.8GHz 5.5GHz 40MB 65W Ryzen 5 9600X 6/12 3.9GHz 5.4GHz 36MB 65W

These specs are very comparable to their Ryzen 7000 equivalents, with the same cache quantities, thread counts, and clock speeds. What is different this time around is power draw. While the top-tier 9950X still has the same 170-watt thermal design power (TDP) of its 7950X predecessor, the other CPUs require far less.

The 7900X was a 170W TDP component, but the new 9900X pulls a mere 120W, and both the 9700X and 9600X are just 65W chips. While the power draw figures may be a little higher in real-world use, this is a notable improvement over their last-generation counterparts, and shows a big uplift in efficiency for the new Zen 5 design.

Despite previous rumors that AMD may want to tweak the TDP on the Ryzen 7 9700X in order to make it more competitive, AMD is sticking to the TDP that it initially announced — and it appears to be quite proud of its efficiency gains. During the Zen 5 Tech Day, AMD shared some initial slides regarding gen-on-gen improvements between Zen 4 and Zen 5.

Three out of the four new AMD processors saw a significant decrease in their power consumption. This could mean bad news for performance, but AMD claims otherwise. For instance, the Ryzen 5 9600X is said to be up to 17% faster while consuming far less power. On the other hand, the Ryzen 9 9950X may not feature a drop in TDP, but AMD claims that it’ll be up to 22% faster than its predecessor.

We’ve heard about IPC improvements for a while now, but until recently, it was unclear where those improvements are coming from. After all, the CPUs have the exact same core counts. However, AMD gave us a peek at the CPUs during the preview event, and we now know what’s new in Zen 5. The architectural changes that AMD outlined include:

Zen 5 CPUs now support eight dispatch/retire units; up from six in Zen 4

The number of arithmetic logic units (ALUs) in the core was increased from four to six

Zen 5 now features a single 512-bit data path for AVX instructions instead of two 256-bit paths

Unlike Intel’s upcoming Arrow Lake CPUs, AMD has maintained simultaneous multithreading with Zen 5, and has made major improvements in branch prediction accuracy and latency to help improve overall multi-threading performance. As a result, AMD promises to deliver a 16% boost in IPC.

AMD has confirmed that its Zen 5 processors feature the RDNA 3.5 graphics architecture, which should mean even more capable onboard graphics than we saw with Ryzen 7000 CPUs. It’s not likely to be a huge upgrade, but considering we had perfectly passable performance for casual gaming on Zen 4, any upgrade is welcome. Ryzen 8000 APUs are already trying to hammer in the last nails of the entry-level graphics coffin. RDNA 3.5 on Zen 5 will only continue that trend.

AM5 socket

One of the greatest strengths of AMD’s Ryzen processors since their first generation has been in their upgradability. While Intel has typically offered fans two and occasionally three generations of support for any socket design, AMD’s Ryzen platform has been far more expansive. Anyone who bought a high-end motherboard from the Ryzen 1000 generation was able to simply plug in an AMD Ryzen 3000 or even 5000 CPU with a few BIOS updates and continue with the same memory, power, and everything else.

AMD is looking to replicate this with its AM5 socket, which debuted with Ryzen 7000 CPUs in the fall of 2022. Zen 5 uses the same AM5 socket as Zen 4, meaning not only will coolers be compatible, but CPUs will be too. Anyone with an existing X670E, X670, or B650 motherboard should be able to drop in a Zen 5 CPU and receive most of the benefits of the new generation as soon as they are available — though a BIOS update may be necessary.

AMD announced the first two new motherboard chipsets for Ryzen 9000 at Computex 2024, detailing the new x870 and x870E chipsets. Both bring USB4 support as standard, as well as PCI Express 5.0 for both graphics and storage slots. Higher memory frequencies are supported, too, potentially unlocking even greater performance for the next-gen CPUs.

Zen 5 performance

We’ve finally had a chance to test Zen 5, both in desktop and mobile applications, and AMD’s performance gains are real. First, single-core performance. As you can read in our Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X review, AMD made a massive leap with its single-core performance with its new architecture. The results from Cinebench R23 below show that in action, with the new chips shooting ahead of basically every other option.

Multi-core performance is a different story, and an area where AMD is starting to lose some of its edge. Although the generational improvement is there, Intel’s lead in core counts continues to dominate heavily-threaded workloads. Given that core counts are identical with Zen 5 desktop CPUs, AMD is struggling to move the needle in heavily-threaded workloads.

Still, in real applications, the performance improvements are present. You can see that in action in Handbrake, which absolutely slams the CPU for video transcoding. The gains here aren’t high enough to justify an upgrade if you have a Ryzen 7000 CPU already, but they’re a welcome addition for newcomers to the Zen 5 platform.

Gaming is a different story, where AMD is its own worst enemy at the moment. You can see in Far Cry 6 above that Zen 5 brings some improvements over the previous generation. The Ryzen 7 7800X3D remains the best gaming CPU you can buy, however, and it’s not exactly close.

There are some niche improvements for gaming with Zen 5, however. Most notably, AMD added a 512-bit data path for AVX-512 instructions, which is huge for some AI workloads and tasks like PS3 emulation. The chess engine Leela Chess Zero shows just how big of a difference a native AVX-512 implementation makes in performance.

AMD has also launched its Zen 5 architecture in laptops with Ryzen AI 300 CPUs. As you can see from the results gathered during our Zenbook S 16 review, AMD provides competitive performance with the recent crop of Snapdragon X Elite chips, though it falls short of Intel’s more performant Meteor Lake offerings.

The real boon for AMD with Ryzen AI 300 is battery life. Outside of the new Snapdragon chips, AMD is providing some of the best battery life we’ve seen out of a Windows laptop. That will change as we see more powerful Zen 5 mobile options, but it’s clear that AMD’s efficiency claims are more than hot air.

3D V-Cache in Zen 5

AMD’s 3D V-Cache processors have been ruling the gaming charts ever since the release of the Ryzen 7 5800X3D. Seeing as the Ryzen 7 7800X3D was also a massive success, it’s only right that gamers are hoping for a follow-up in the form of the Ryzen 7 9800X3D. Good news: It’s coming. Bad news? We just don’t know when.

In a recent interview, AMD’s Donny Woligroski said that AMD is “not just resting on laurels” as he referred to AMD’s plans for the X3D versions of Zen 5 processors. AMD is actively working on making the chip better than its predecessor, which is more than can be said about the non-3D parts — there, AMD admitted that Zen 4 X3D chips will still outpace their non-3D successors in gaming.

Unfortunately, AMD hasn’t revealed how it hopes to improve the 3D V-Cache chips, or when we might see them. It’s possible that AMD will update its chiplet approach to prevent situations where only one die comes with extra cache, which is the case right now. Similarly, we might see higher clock speeds, more overclocking capabilities, or — hopefully — even more cache.

As a sign that AMD is working on the 3D chips even if they’re not set to launch in July, the company recently pushed a Ryzen chipset driver that added a new 3D V-Cache Optimizer.

Here comes AM5

AMD’s Zen 5 is shaping up to be a major launch for Team Red, and it’s gotten out ahead of the competition by a number of months. With Intel not slated to launch its Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake processors until much later this year, we may have several months of AMD absolutely dominating before Intel can swing back. It no doubt will, but can it do so hard enough?

AMD has shown with Zen 5 that it has the potential to be the performance and efficiency leader in productivity and gaming. We still don’t have a full picture of the lineup, though, and AMD’s 3D V-Cache update is sure to shake things up when it arrives."

AMD’s new Ryzen 9000 CPUs are cheaper than its previous-gen chips.,https://www.pcgamesn.com/amd/ryzen-9000-price,"The lid has just been lifted on all the AMD Ryzen 9000 prices, with the CPU maker officially confirming how much you’ll have to pay for each one of its new Zen 5 CPUs. All of them are lower than the Ryzen 7000 prices for the equivalent chips when they first launched, but they’re also a fair bit higher than the cost of these Zen 4 chips now.

Indeed, with Intel CPU instability issues still raging on, arguably the main competition for these new Ryzen 9000 chips will come from the last-gen AMD Zen 4 lineup. That’s particularly the case when it comes to the battle for the best gaming CPU title, as none of the first Zen 5 CPUs out the door will be X3D chips with AMD’s 3D V-cache. Some of the prices are exactly the same as the ones we saw in the Best Buy AMD price leak, but a couple of them are a bit higher.

Let’s start at the bottom, with AMD’s six-core offering. The AMD Ryzen 5 9600X price is $279, which is $20 cheaper than the price of the Ryzen 5 7600X when it first came out, and is identical to the price seen in the Best Buy leak. However, the 7600X was seriously overpriced at launch, and it has since dropped to just $197 on Amazon. That’s a difference of over $80, which is significant at this price level, and it’s going to make life tough for the new 9600X unless it’s seriously fast.

Next up is the eight-core chip. The AMD Ryzen 7 9700X price is $359, which is a good $40 cheaper than the Ryzen 7 7700X when it first came out, and is the same as the price listed in the Best Buy leak. Right now, the 7700X goes for $290 on Amazon, meaning you’ll pay a $69 premium for the new chip. That’s not a bad price for the 9700X, which AMD says will outperform its Ryzen 7 5800X3D, but it’s unlikely to outpace the Ryzen 7 7800X3D in games.

The top two chips are both a bit more expensive than the Best Buy leak suggested. The AMD Ryzen 9 9900X price is $499, which is $50 more than the price listed in the Best Buy leak, but still a good $50 cheaper than the equivalent 12-core Ryzen 9 7900X when it first came out. The 7900X currently goes for just $359, though, meaning you have to pay an extra $140 for the new chip. That’s going to be hard to justify unless the 9900X is massively quicker.

Finally, the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X price is $649, which is again $50 more than the Best Buy leak price, but $50 cheaper than the Ryzen 9 7950X MSRP at launch. The 7950X now costs just $523, however, so you’ll need to hand over an extra $126 for the Zen 5 chip. If your top priority is getting the fastest multi-threaded performance possible, that may well end up being a price worth paying, however, as long as the CPU is significantly quicker.

Out of all the new prices, the Ryzen 7 9700X looks like it could be a solid option for $279, but otherwise, it looks as though AMD could have a struggle to shift these chips, with the biggest threat coming from its last-gen offerings. That’s not necessarily a bad situation for AMD, though. It means the company can shift its older inventory while charging a premium for its new CPUs, and then hopefully drop the prices of the new Zen 5 CPUs at a later date.

The AMD Ryzen 9000 release date is nearly upon us, and we’ll see the first proper performance results when the review embargo lifts. In the meantime, check out our full AMD Zen 5 guide to find out everything we know about the new processors."

AMD Has Officially Confirmed The Prices of Its Ryzen 9000 ""Zen 5"" CPU Family, Slightly Lower Than Ryzen 7000 ""Zen 4"" At Each Segment

Today, AMD is confirming the prices of its entire Ryzen 9000 ""Zen 5"" CPU family which starts at $279 US and goes as high as $649 US. While previous prices came from retailers, this time, AMD itself is confirming the prices which are pretty much the same as disclosed earlier besides the top SKUs.

The Ryzen 9000 ""Zen 5"" CPUs were originally planned to launch on 31st July but AMD had to push back the launch of these chips to August citing testing and quality issues encountered on the first batches. The new dates are the 8th of August for the Ryzen 7 9700X & Ryzen 5 9600X CPUs while the high-end chips, the Ryzen 9 9950X & the Ryzen 9 9900X, will hit retail shelves on the 15th of August.

Following are the prices disclosed for the next-gen Ryzen CPUs:

Ryzen 9 9950X - $649 US (7950X $699 US MSRP)

(7950X $699 US MSRP) Ryzen 9 9900X - $499 US (7900X $549 US MSRP)

(7900X $549 US MSRP) Ryzen 7 9700X - $359 US (7700X $399 US MSRP)

(7700X $399 US MSRP) Ryzen 5 9600X - $279 US (7600X $299 US MSRP)

At $649, the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X will be aiming for the high-end Intel Core i9-14900K and Core i9-14900KS chips which end up around a similar price range. The 14900K can be found for around a $550-$560 US price point so it's around $100 cheaper but AMD has promised some superb multi-threading performance with the 9950X and the gaming performance should also be very strong if official benchmarks are to go by.

The AMD Ryzen 9 9900X will be priced at $499 US which is once again $100 US more than the Intel Core i7-14700K but once again, AMD did highlight faster multi-threaded and gaming performance at a much lower TDP of just 120W. AMD positions the Ryzen 9 9900X chip as a 14900K CPU competitor which is $50 US more expensive. Following are the TDP comparisons between the four chips of this generation with the prior one:

Ryzen 9 7950X (170W) -> Ryzen 9 9950X (170W)

Ryzen 9 7900X (170W) -> Ryzen 9 9900X (120W)

Ryzen 7 7700X (105W) -> Ryzen 7 9700X (65W)

Ryzen 5 7600X (105W) -> Ryzen 5 9600X (65W)

The Ryzen 7 9700X at $359 US seems to be a good deal since it was recently revealed that the chip would end up slightly faster than the Ryzen 7 7800X3D, the best gaming chip at the moment while running at just 65W.

2 of 9

Lastly, the AMD Ryzen 5 9600X at $279 US makes it look much better than the previously expected $299 US pricing. The 6-core chip will be a decent mainstream solution for the AM5 segment while offering better value than the official prices of the last-gen parts.

Overall, it looks like AMD is going to attract many new PC builders to its AM5 platform with these price points, and with all the troubles that Intel is currently facing with its Desktop lineup, AMD might just take away a big chunk of that desktop market share.

Across the lineup, which is sure to earn some spots among the best processors, AMD reduced prices compared to the previous generation. That’s great. But it’s not exactly an accurate picture of pricing right now.

First, the prices. You can see in the picture below the prices for the main four Zen 5 CPUs. Both Ryzen 9 models are $50 cheaper compared to their last-gen counterparts, the Ryzen 7 9700X is $40 cheaper, and the Ryzen 5 9600X is $20 cheaper. That’s only true if you compare the list prices that AMD set. Ultimately, it’s up to retailers to dictate the final price, which is something we saw in full effect with AMD’s last-gen CPUs.

If you recall, AMD’s last-gen CPUs weren’t super popular out of the gate. Despite being great performers, Intel’s Core i9-14900K arrived more than $100 cheaper than the Ryzen 9 7950X while offering similar performance. Lower down the stack, Intel provided better multi-core performance while arriving at the same price. This battle of CPU giants quickly led to a race down to lower prices, which AMD’s last-gen lineup has maintained for months at this point.

To give some perspective, here’s what you’ll spend on AMD’s Zen 4 lineup if you pick up a processor today:

($300 at launch)

($300 at launch) ($400 at launch)

($400 at launch) ($550 at launch)

($550 at launch) ($700 at launch)

It’s not surprising to see prices go down on last-gen components over time, but AMD’s last-gen CPUs almost immediately dropped below list price after releasing and have only gone down in price since then. The cut on list price for new Zen 5 CPUs is, more than anything, a more accurate reflection of what these CPUs are likely to sell for out of the gate.

It’s also important to take stock of last-gen pricing given the performance of the new Zen 5 chips. As you can read in our Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X review, AMD delivered some solid performance gains in certain applications. However, in heavily-threaded workloads — tasks that make use of all of the cores — Zen 4 and Zen 5 are very close. Then there’s gaming, where AMD’s last-gen Ryzen 7 7800X3D still mops the floor with and is available for around the same price as the new Ryzen 7 9700X.

The Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X go on sale on Thursday, while the Ryzen 9 9900X and Ryzen 9 9950X will be available on August 15. AMD lowered the recommended prices this generation, but we’ll ultimately need to wait to see where the prices land at retailers once the processors are available for sale."

AMD's Ryzen 5 5600X was one of my all-time favorite processors, thanks to an astronomically perfect balance of performance and price, even if I did spring a little extra cash for the 5800X in my desktop.

Nevertheless, any successor has a mountain to climb to receive the same praise as its 5000 Series precursor. Ryzen chips have always been a go-to pick for custom builders on a budget, and the -X range targets enthusiast gamers, with the AMD Ryzen 5 9600X opening as the entry-level chip in the new Ryzen 9000 Series.

Can it stand as the new hot pick for budding PC gamers looking to enter the modern age of AM5 motherboards with everything AMD's Zen 5 architecture can offer, or is it outshined by its slightly beefier Ryzen 7 9700X sibling and even AMD's previous-gen chips? Here's what I found in my testing.

AMD will offer the Ryzen 5 9600X through major third-party storefronts, like Newegg and Best Buy, for a $279 MSRP from Thursday, August 8, 2024 — $20 cheaper than the previous-gen Ryzen 5 7600X and the 5600X before it.

The entry-level 9600X also sees AMD returning to a 65W base TDP, just like the Ryzen 5 5600X, after which it temporarily climbed to 105W for the 7600X. The base clock is 3.9GHz, higher than its mid-range sibling, the Ryzen 7 9700X, while the max turbo clock raises slightly this generation to 5.4GHz.

Core/thread count and L3 cache count remain the same at 6c/12t, meaning AMD has another chance to showcase performance-per-watt improvements with its 4nm manufacturing process and Zen 5 architecture within the new Ryzen 9000 Series.

Much like the mid-range Ryzen 7 9700X, benchmarking the Ryzen 5 9600X delivers contrasting results, depending on whether you focus on multi-core or single-core performance. For burst processing tests in Geekbench 6, the 9600X pulls slightly ahead of a previous-generation Intel rival, the 13th Gen Core i5-13600K, and creeps reasonably close to the modern 14th Gen Core i5-14600K. Again, this is a 65W 8-core, 16-thread chip edging past a 125W 14c/20t Intel offering, which speaks volumes to AMD's leaps in power efficiency with Zen 5.

Generational multi-core improvements are minimal, as the 105W 7600X still beats the 65W 9600X in specific tests.

However, in sustained stress tests, the Ryzen 5 9600X falls further away from Intel and below AMD's last-gen chip, the Ryzen 7 7700X. It's not too unusual, given the higher 105W TDP on the Zen 4 7700X, but you can grab a 7700X for as low as $288 at Amazon, so it's tough to argue in favor of the 9600X with results like this. Generational multi-core improvements also range from slim numbers to negatives, with 7-Zip's simulated compression benchmark performing better on the 7000 Series chip.

The performance change from Ryzen 7000 to 9000 isn't as much of a multi-core leap as the previous 5000 to 7000 Series. (Image credit: Windows Central | CPU Monkey)

Still, it's mostly good news for Zen 5, as the 9600X exhibits improvements in multi-core burst performance over the previous-gen 7600X, albeit much less than the jump from the Ryzen 5 5600X to the 7600X. The focus is entirely on power efficiency for the Ryzen 9000 Series chips, and the 65W 9600X is primarily a decent successor to the Ryzen 7000 Series entry-level offering, the power-hungry 105W Ryzen 5 7600X.

With results like these, it's clear to those who have already adopted AMD's Ryzen 7000 Series processors that the Ryzen 5 9600X isn't worth the hassle of an upgrade. However, if you're still rocking a Ryzen 5 3600X, 5600X, or an equivalent Intel 11th or 12th Gen Core i5, then you'd be overhauling your system with an AM5 socket motherboard anyway, and the affordable Ryzen 5 9600X makes more sense.

Is the AMD Ryzen 5 9600X good for gaming?

Yes, if you're on a strict budget. It even scores hot on the heels of my previous top gaming CPU recommendation: the Ryzen 7 7800X3D. While it doesn't sport the same gamer-centric 3D V-Cache as AMD's -X3D Series chips, and I expect a Ryzen 9000X3D Series will be released later this year, there's no denying that the entry-level 9600X is capable enough to handle modern PC gaming. If you want to build an affordable but modern gaming rig, the Ryzen 5 9600X is a cheaper entry-level CPU with excellent power efficiency.

Ryzen 5 9600X: Single core performance

(Image credit: Windows Central | CPU Monkey) Intel still edges ahead in specific tests, like CPU-Z's single core benchmark. (Image credit: Windows Central | CPU Monkey)

AMD comes out on top with single-core testing, with the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X scoring among the highest benchmark results I've ever seen for 65W chips. In every test, the 9600X beats its intended rival, Intel's 14th Gen Core i5-14600K, bested only by the Core i7-14700K in CPU-Z's benchmark. Again, these Ryzen 9000 Series processors are going up against 125W Core i5 and i7 chips with much higher physical core counts, theoretically dividing a higher even wattage to a per-core amount than Intel.

AMD's 65W Ryzen 9600X beats Intel's 125W Core i5-14600K single-core performance in every benchmark.

The real-world benefits of single-core performance are tricky to quantify for the average PC user, but many modern game engines still thrive on single-thread processing. Since the 9600X is so close to the 7800X3D in multi-core performance and actually better in single-core tests, it becomes a tempting new option as an entry-level Zen 5 gaming CPU. While I start to sound like a broken record, this is another testament to AMD's triumphs in higher performance at a much lower wattage than the competition and sets a new standard for single-core scores.

Ryzen 5 9600X: The competition

Even Intel's 13th Gen Core i5 chips will crush the Ryzen 5 7600X in multi-core performance (if they're stable enough.) (Image credit: Daniel Rubino)

It's practically impossible to ignore Intel's instability crisis with its 13th and 14th Gen Core desktop chips, triggered by a microcode (firmware) bug that is permanently degrading affected processors. While the 13th Gen Core i5-13600K sells for around $234, it's currently impossible for me to recommend to anyone who isn't extremely comfortable with applying manual BIOS tweaks and firmware updates to prevent issues.

If you're unlucky enough to buy a 13th Gen Intel Core variant manufactured in early 2023, you might experience degradation caused by an oxidization problem discovered around this time. Intel is at least offering extended warranties and RMA assistance to those affected, but it hardly seems worth the risk to the majority of (presumably novice) PC builders looking at entry-level chips.

It's currently impossible for me to recommend Intel's 13th (or 14th) Gen to anyone who isn't extremely comfortable with manual BIOS tweaks and firmware updates to prevent issues.

Instead, the call for competitors comes from inside AMD's house. If you're a creator looking to maximize multi-core performance on an AM5 system, the Ryzen 7 7700X is only $288 at the time of writing, barely a few dollars more than the 9600X's MSRP. Otherwise, gaming enthusiasts might want to wait for the inevitable -X3D variants of AMD's Ryzen 9000 Series to take advantage of an updated version of 3D V-Cache.

Overall, if you're currently running an AMD 7000 Series chip or an Intel 13th Gen equivalent, then the Ryzen 5 9600X either won't provide enough of a performance bump or will be a negative trade-off. However, if you're still on Ryzen 3000 to 5000 or Intel 12th Gen and earlier, the 9600X is a great entry point to AMD's Zen 5 platform since you'll need an all-new AM5 socket motherboard anyway.

Ryzen 5 9600X: Should you buy?

You should buy this if ...

✅ You're upgrading from much older hardware

The generational multi-core performance leaps are so minor if you're already running a Ryzen 7000 Series chip. Still, those on older processors with AM4 sockets will appreciate this affordable and versatile entry-level AM5 option.

✅ You'll benefit from single-core performance gains

AMD offers incredible single-core instructions-per-cycle (IPC) improvements for those reliant on software and games that better utilize single cores or generally lack multi-core optimizations.

You should avoid this if ...

❌ You're an all-out hardcore PC gamer

While it's tempting and more affordable than the previous-gen Ryzen 7 7800X3D, a 9000X3D variant will undoubtedly be released later this year, which will better suit high-end gaming (if you can afford the extra cost.)

❌ You're already on the AM5 socket

It's unlikely that you'll see any significant performance benefits from the 9600X if you're already running a Ryzen 7000 Series (or even 8000G Series) processor — this is mostly a minor entry-level bump, not a major step-up.

The entry-level chip of any processor generation is never expected to blow the previous range out of the water. However, AMD still delivers incredible single-core performance with the Ryzen 5 9600X. It pulls ahead of, or at least matches, every comparable Intel Core i5 and Core i7 processor and does it all with a lower TDP and more affordable MSRP. Still, it's not going to tempt those who already adopted the Ryzen 7000 Series or Intel's 12th, 13th, or 14th Gen Core desktop chips.

Instead, the 9600X stands as the perfect entry point into AM5 socket motherboards and AMD's Zen 5 architecture, with prospects to upgrade to either a top-end Ryzen 9 9950X for creators or wait for the inevitable 9000X3D gaming chips. If you're running older AM4 or LGA1200 hardware, the 9600X offers some of the best performance-per-watt value on a budget, especially if your favorite software suite and games are better optimized for single-core processing."
AMD’s new Ryzen 9000 CPUs are cheaper than its previous-gen chips.,https://www.inkl.com/news/amd-ryzen-7-9700x-review-while-intel-suffers-setbacks-team-red-takes-the-mid-range-gaming-cpu-crown,"I've recommended AMD's Ryzen 5 5600X and, after an eventual price drop, the Ryzen 7 5800X for years since their release, with the latter installed in my gaming rig.

AMD always has the edge on affordability with desktop processors, but it often lags behind Intel on some performance metrics. Whether that matters to you would vary depending on a few value-centric factors.

However, despite dropping the power draw and price tag, the all-new AMD Ryzen 7 9700X has made some incredible performance breakthroughs in single-core benchmarks and even beats out my previous recommendation of the best gaming CPU on the market. Here's how it performed in my testing and where it ranks against its top rivals.

Ryzen 7 9700X: Price, availability, and specs

Ryzen 7 9700X specs Price: $359 at Newegg

Release: August 8, 2024

Cores/threads: 8c 16t

Base clock: 3.8GHz

Max boost: 5.5GHz

L3 cache: 32MB

TDP: 65W

AMD will sell the Ryzen 7 9700X through mainstream third-party storefronts, like Best Buy and Newegg, for a $359 MSRP from Thursday, August 8, 2024. It's an impressive increase in performance-per-dollar value, with about a 10% discount from the previous-gen Ryzen 7 7700X price tag.

The 9700X's base TDP has also significantly dropped to 65W, down from 105W on the 7700X and returning to match its older equivalents. The max turbo clock continues to creep up with each new Ryzen -700X chip, but the core/thread count remains steady alongside the L3 cache. Improvements delivered through AMD's Zen 5 architecture will be the key to how much performance has improved this year.

Unlike the Ryzen 8000G Series, the Ryzen 9000 chips don't include AMD's XDNA 2 NPU (Neural Processing Unit) for any dedicated AI processing. However, the CPU chiplet still processes AI workloads with an 'enhanced' Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (AVX-512) datapath. AMD recently launched the Ryzen AI 300 Series mobile chips, focusing on generative AI with laptops instead.

A dual-core integrated Radeon graphics chiplet is included in the Ryzen 7 9700X, clocked at 2.2GHz, supporting video output for those without a dedicated graphics card. Expansion depends on your motherboard choice, though PCIe 5.0 support for modern GPUs and mandatory DDR5 RAM are standard.

Recommended hardware

AMD recommends a traditional air cooler for the Ryzen 7 9700X and the upcoming 800 Series of AM5 motherboards, including X870 and X870E chipsets. While 870 Series motherboards will be able to push overclocked DDR5 memory speeds to 8000MT/s and beyond, AMD previously provided a sample of G.SKILL Trident Z5 Neo RGB DDR5-6400 RAM and still encourages an AUTO:1:1 DDR5-6000 EXPO profile where possible to stay in the performance ""sweet spot.""

Depending on how you arrange the performance benchmark results, ranking AMD's octa-core Ryzen 7 9700X splits into two directions. For multi-core performance, this 65W processor is either outshone by four of Intel's 125W offerings over two modern generations in extended stress tests with Cinebench 2024: the 13th Gen Core i5-13600K and Core i7-13700K, plus the 14th Gen Core i5-14600K and Core i7-14700K, or it creeps slightly ahead with burst CPU performance tests in Geekbench 6.

While not as significant as the jump from the 5700X to 7700X, the Ryzen 7 9700X still delivers a generational multi-core performance bump despite dropping its base TDP by 40W.

The previous-generation Ryzen 7 7700X pulls ahead in one multi-core benchmark, compressing and decompressing synthetic 7-Zip archives. It also came close in the CPU-Z benchmark test but never outperformed the Ryzen 7 9700X in single-core performance. Intel's 14th Gen i7-14700K multi-core results are leagues ahead with twice the wattage and the explicit increase to 20 cores and 28 threads over the 8c/16t count on the Ryzen 7 9700X, as well as a $50 increase on its MSRP.

The mild multi-core bump from the Ryzen 7 7700X to the 9700X is more evident when compared with the older 5700X. (Image credit: Windows Central | CPU Monkey)

AMD's efforts to achieve this multi-core performance at half the power of Intel's competing chips shouldn't be understated. A 40W base TDP drop from the previous-gen 105W Ryzen 7 7700X hasn't stopped the Ryzen 7 9700X from delivering a decent generational performance uplift, though it's certainly far from the significant leap AMD made from the 65W 5700X. Still, it's an impressive metric as AMD moves from Zen 4's 5nm manufacturing process to TSMC's 4nm and is part of an overall showcase in performance-per-watt improvements for the Ryzen 9000 Series.

These benchmarks reflect the Ryzen 7 9700X's 3.8GHz base frequency, another drop from the 105W Ryzen 7 7700X, which starts at 4.5GHz. Overclocking enthusiasts shouldn't worry, though, as the 9700X still boosts as high as 5.5GHz, slightly faster than the 7700X's 5.4GHz, despite the lower base power and maximum socket limits. Essentially, AMD can offer at least a minor bump to multi-core performance with the same 65W power draw that it used to, as it sticks with the AM5 socket until 2027 for potential upgrades to the top-end Ryzen 9 9950X following price drops.

Is the AMD Ryzen 7 9700X good for gaming?

Even in sustained stress tests, the 9700X edges past the 7800X3D. (Image credit: Ben Wilson | Windows Central)

Yes, absolutely. While it doesn't include AMD's 3D V-Cache aimed at gamers, the Ryzen 7 9700X still matches the previous-gen Ryzen 7 7800X3D, a powerhouse processor that has been all too easy to recommend as the best gaming CPU since its release. However, that shouldn't signal to gaming enthusiasts who adopted the Zen 4 -X3D chip that it's already time to upgrade. The performance improvements are marginal, so this serves as more of a temptation to those looking to upgrade from a Ryzen 5000 Series chip.

I still recommend the Ryzen 5 5600X to anyone building a budget gaming PC, and I run the Ryzen 7 5800X in my gaming desktop since it eventually dropped from its high MSRP. However, while it would mean a total motherboard upgrade from my AM4 range to a new AM5 equivalent compatible with the Ryzen 7 9700X, I can heartily recommend it as a perfect modern in-between for anyone in a similar situation as mine.

AMD mostly annihilates its competition in single-core performance, as the Ryzen 7 9700X shoots to the top of the pile with some of the best scores we've seen to date, save only for a CPU-Z result against Intel's 14th Gen i7-14700K. Given the lower physical core count of 8 on the 9700X compared to 20 on the 14700K, it's logical that each core can receive a higher share of wattage and offer stronger performance.

AMD wrestles the single-core crown away from Intel as the Ryzen 7 9700X challenges the 14th Gen i7-14700K in most CPU benchmarks.

If all cores were theoretically handling separate tasks equally, AMD would have the edge with a few more watts per core. It's another metric that will appeal to gamers, as single-core performance is usually a priority for many titles, though modern game engines can scale to multi-threaded options more effectively. Still, this bump to single-core performance is phenomenal, especially considering the Ryzen 7 9700X's mid-range position in the 9000 Series. If your suite of apps and games perform better with single-core optimizations, you'll love the 9700X.

Ryzen 7 9700X: The competition

If you're prepared to face potential issues, Intel has Core i5 and i7 alternatives in its 13th and 14th Gen. (Image credit: Future)

AMD is launching the Ryzen 7 9700X and its entry-level sibling, the Ryzen 5 9600X, at the exact moment that Intel is experiencing an instability crisis with its 13th and 14th Gen Core desktop chips. While a microcode (firmware) patch is rolling out to compatible motherboards, there is still a risk that chips like the i7-13700K could be affected by an oxidization issue if manufactured in early 2023 before Intel had addressed it.

Ryzen 9000 chips weren't immune to launch problems, as AMD delayed the 9600X and 9700X to fix a production issue, which seemed to be little more than a model typo on the chips. Still, enthusiast PC builders who are comfortable updating their motherboard BIOS shouldn't be too wary of comparing the 9700X against its primary rivals, especially as Intel offers extended warranties and RMA assistance.

Even if the recent microcode bug controversy hadn't happened and Intel was on a level playing field with AMD, there is still the matter of performance-per-watt and the surrounding costs of adopting each processor. Internally, AMD pits the Ryzen 7 9700X against Intel's 14th Gen Core i7-14700K — that's a $359 65W AMD chip with 8 cores and 16 threads against a $409 125W Intel variant with 20 cores and 28 threads.

I can't comfortably recommend Intel's 13th or 14th Gen chips to anyone who isn't extremely comfortable with system tweaks and regular BIOS updates to avoid issues.

Based on performance benchmarking results, the Ryzen 7 9700X is more comparable to a mid-range Intel 13th Gen Core i5-13600K, which launched at $329 but can be found for as low as $249.99 at Best Buy. However, even with a saving of around $100, I can't comfortably recommend Intel's 13th or 14th Gen chips to anyone who isn't extremely comfortable with system tweaks and regular BIOS updates to avoid issues.

Hardcore gamers should wait for the inevitable -X3D variants of the Ryzen 9000 Series unless you're updating from a much older machine. Anyone with an AM5 socket board likely wouldn't see significant boosts in the 9700X from their Ryzen 7000 or even 8000G chips, but those on older AM4 socket boards can target the 9700X for a mid-range upgrade. Intel users on equivalent 12th Gen chips and earlier would need to upgrade their motherboards no matter what, but they should be happy with the 9700X.

Ryzen 7 9700X: Should you buy?

AMD still uses the ugly heat spreader pattern with the 9700X, but I'll give them a pass based on its performance. (Image credit: Ben Wilson | Windows Central)

You should buy this if ...

✅ Your apps need strong single-core performance

The Ryzen 7 9700X exhibits some of the best performance in single-core testing that I've ever seen, so it's great for many games and creative apps.

✅ You're building a mid-range gaming PC

Alongside a generous price drop from last gen, the 9700X offers better performance-per-watt over the Ryzen 7000 Series and is a new hot pick over the 5600X.

You should avoid this if ...

❌ You're a hardcore gamer targeting the best specs

AMD will, presumably and inevitably, release -X3D variants of the Ryzen 9000 Series chips, which would make more sense than the 9700X for a high-end gaming rig utilizing AMD's 3D V-Cache.

❌ You already have an equivalent Ryzen 7000 Series chip

While the 9700X has made a generational improvement on multi-core performance (and especially single-core), there isn't enough of a leap over the previous-gen Ryzen 7 7700X.

AMD delivers phenomenal single-core performance in what is otherwise a mid-range processor in its latest Ryzen 9000 Series of desktop chips, with a 'good enough' generational multi-core improvement. Still, a generous price drop from the previous Ryzen 7000 -X chips alongside a return to a 65W base TDP make this an extremely hot pick for mid-tier custom desktop builders looking for the best performance-per-watt, taking over from the Ryzen 5 5600X/7 5800X as my ultimate value-for-money picks.

Intel might be having a rough time with its 13th and 14th Gen chips exhibiting microcode issues, but that doesn't entirely put them out of the race. On the contrary, most comparable Intel Core desktop processors are unaffected or remedied with a simple BIOS update. However, these power-hungry 125W chips are finally knocked off their top spot for single-core scores and can't beat AMD's pricing for this gen. It's an outstanding display from Team Red and scores one of the easiest recommendations I've ever made."

CPUs are in a weird spot, and it’s hard to ignore that fact. AMD pulled an unprecedented move by delaying the launch of these new Zen 5 chips, and Intel’s widely reported instability issue still doesn’t have a solution. AMD’s new Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X are among the best processors you can buy right now, but they’re also entering the market at a time when good-faith comparisons are tough to make.

It doesn’t help that the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X aren’t exactly easy CPUs to evaluate. They’re not built for gamers, with AMD’s 3D V-Cache CPUs dominating the list of the best gaming processors, and the performance improvements range anywhere from mind-blowing to middling. AMD’s latest chips are fast, there’s no doubt about that, and they easily earn a recommendation. Given how strange the CPU landscape between AMD and Intel is right now, however, it might be worth taking stock of where everything lands in a few weeks before picking up a new chip.

AMD Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X specs

Architecture is the name of the game for the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X, and that’s immediately apparent when looking at the specs. Very little has changed compared to the last-gen Ryzen 7000 chips, with these parts boasting the same core counts, similar clock speeds, and identical cache. The improvements are all under the hood with the new Zen 5 architecture.

There are a lot of nerdy architectural details here for Zen 5 compared to Zen 4 — there’s an 8-wide dispatch unit now, up from 6-wide in Zen 4, as well as six Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs), up from four previously. It’s the high-level objectives of the architecture that make a difference, though. AMD had a clear focus on single-threaded performance, and it built a true 512-bit data path for AVX-512 instructions. This, according to AMD, is a new foundation for CPUs going forward.

Ryzen 7 9700X Ryzen 7 7700X Ryzen 5 9600X Ryzen 5 7600X Cores/Threads 8/16 8/16 6/12 6/12 L3/L2 Cache 32MB / 8MB 32MB / 8MB 32MB / 6MB 32MB / 6MB Max turbo frequency 5.5GHz 5.4GHz 5.4GHz 5.3GHz TDP 65W 105W 65W 65W Recommended price $360 $400 $280 $300

As I dig into my performance results, you’ll see that AMD achieved its design goals. This is a new foundation, however, and not the final form of where AMD will end up in a couple of generations. Performance overall feels lopsided, with some workloads showing middling performance and others showing earth-shattering gains.

Outside of architecture, there’s one important spec change particularly for the Ryzen 7 9700X. The last-gen Ryzen 7 7700X had a power draw of 105 watts, but AMD shrunk that to 65W this time around. That power is a little optimistic, with the chip commonly registering over 65W, but it’s still nice to see AMD push toward the efficient end of the spectrum for Zen 5. We saw how big of a difference that could make with the Ryzen 5 7600 (non-X) in the previous generation.

Test configurations

As with all of our CPU reviews, I put together two test configurations that were as close as possible. I used a high-end motherboard for both AMD and Intel tests, as well as a 360mm all-in-one (AIO) liquid cooler, 32GB of DDR5-6000 memory, a 1200W PSU, and an RTX 4080 Founder’s Edition graphics card. All BIOS settings were returned to their default settings, though I ensured XMP/EXPO and Resizable BAR were enabled for both platforms.

AMD Intel GPU Nvidia RTX 4080 Founders Edition Nvidia RTX 4080 Founders Edition RAM 32GB Gigabyte Aorus DDR5-6000 32GB Corsair Vengeance DDR5-6000 Motherboard Gigabyte X670E Aorus Master MSI MPG Z790 MAG Tomahawk CPU cooler Corsair H150i Elite Capellix Corsair H150i Elite Capellix Power supply Gigabyte Aorus P1200W MSI MPG A850GF Storage Corsair MP400 1TB MSI M450 1TB

There’s a lot of talk about BIOS settings right now, with Intel’s CPUs featuring a major wave of instability due to improper BIOS adjustments. At the time of this review, those issues are still a work-in-progress. Performance may change once Intel’s CPUs are brought into a more stable spot. The goal with the performance here is to show what you should expect to see out of the box with any of the CPUs we feature.

Productivity performance

There’s no better place to start a CPU review than Cinebench R23, which immediately shows AMD’s improvements in action. Short of the Core i9-13900K and Core i9-14900K, AMD’s new chips are topping the single-core charts, and not by an insignificant margin. It’s a massive jump, and one that’s all the more impressive considering these are the weakest two of AMD’s current Zen 5 lineup. Keep in mind that the Core i9-14900K is rated to boost to 6GHz — the Ryzen 7 9700X is getting most of the way there at 5.5GHz.

Multi-core performance is, unsurprisingly, not as impressive. Intel’s mix of cores allows it to achieve much higher core counts, which show up more aggressively in a test like Cinebench. Still, we can clearly see some improvements. The Ryzen 5 9600X, for example, is able to match the Core i5-12600K with four fewer cores. That’s a sign of what the architecture is doing within the cores.

Putting that multi-core performance into context, take a look at Handbrake. The Ryzen 5 9600X with six cores can now match the 16-core Ryzen 9 5950X from two generations back, and the Ryzen 7 9700X is at the heels of the Core i5-14600K despite its massive core deficit.

Performance in Photoshop is even more impressive. AMD already performed well in Photoshop, but it’s managing to outpace itself here. The Ryzen 7 9700X matches the Ryzen 9 7950X from last generation, and the Ryzen 5 9600X isn’t far behind. Photoshop isn’t the most demanding workload, but it’s still a clear showcase that the performance improvements are here.

These CPUs are doing exactly what they should, but there are also some lopsided numbers — for better and worse. You can see the worse in action in Blender and 7-Zip. The Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X are barely moving the needle in these tests, and in the case of 7-Zip, the Ryzen 5 9600X was actually a bit slower than the last-gen Ryzen 5 7600X (though not by enough for it to make a difference).

The better half is a lot better — so much so that I really didn’t believe the numbers at first. In the browser benchmark JetStream 2, the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X provided the best results I’ve ever recorded. And in Y-Cruncher, calculating 500 million digits of pi, the single-core performance of these two chips absolutely destroys everything else on the market — and that includes the latest flagships. These are both fairly specific tests, but they show AMD’s Zen 5 improvements in the best light.

In tasks like photo editing in Photoshop or transcoding in Handbrake, these two CPUs are fantastic. Depending on what you’re doing, however, you may not see all of the performance gains. It’s clear that Zen 5 is a new foundation for AMD, and I suspect it will balance the scales of performance in some of the more specific workloads as time goes on.

Gaming performance

It’s difficult to talk about gaming performance with the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X. The performance is decent to disappointing, but it doesn’t matter much anyway. AMD has already proven time and again that its 3D V-Cache tech is the key to the highest frame rates, and these chips don’t come with the extra cache. If you’re concerned with gaming, you shouldn’t buy the Ryzen 5 9600X or Ryzen 7 9700X — you should wait until 3D V-Cache versions of these chips come out.

If you take a 10,000-foot view of these chips, AMD is providing better performance in games. You can see that in the CPU score of 3DMark Time Spy. The Ryzen 7 9700X manages to outpace the Ryzen 7 7800X3D, while the Ryzen 5 9600X provides a disappointing but understandable uplift of 5% over the previous generation. As usual, real games tell a slightly different story.

Take Hitman 3 as an example. AMD was able to outpace the Ryzen 7 5800X3D with the Ryzen 7 9700X, but both of these chips are a far cry from what the Ryzen 7 7800X3D can offer right now. Frankly, it’s not even in the same conversation.

Similarly, in Far Cry 6, AMD is not only offer a solid generational uplift, the Ryzen 5 9600X even managed to beat last-gen’s 16-core Ryzen 9 7950X. That’s impressive, at least until you realize how much faster the Ryzen 7 7800X3D is once again.

If you ignore the 3D V-Cache parts, AMD’s new Zen 5 chips are great. The problem is that PC gamers really can’t afford to ignore 3D V-Cache. I wouldn’t want to be caught with a Ryzen 7 9700X knowing that a Ryzen 7 9700X3D could launch in a matter of months. AMD has already confirmed they’re coming, and even the Ryzen 7 7800X3D continues to dominate gaming charts.

Some of the lopsided performance I saw with productivity benchmarks showed up here, too. Take Red Dead Redemption 2 as a prime example. This game is in my CPU test suite to ground some of the conversation around gaming CPUs. It’s a graphically-intensive game, taking some of the focus off the processor. Oddly, AMD was able to break through this wall of performance that every other CPU I’ve tested has run up against, including the Ryzen 7 7800X3D. From my view, that says more about what we could see with 3D V-Cache versions of these CPUs and less about these two particular chips, however.

Finally, there’s LeelaChessZero, and the chart really speaks for itself here. If there was any doubt that a dedicated 512-bit data path for AVX-512 instructions didn’t matter, this chart puts that to rest. It’s a massive improvement, and I can’t wait to see how the more powerful Ryzen 9 9900X and Ryzen 9 9950X fair in this benchmark.

Should you buy the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X?

Coming in at $280 for the Ryzen 5 9600X and $360 for the Ryzen 7 9700X, these are two compelling CPUs. AMD is offering a generational uplift, and it’s coming in at a lower price. That pricing cut wasn’t made out of goodwill, though. There are still some oddities with these chips and the strange results they can produce, leading to unbelievable performance increases in some workloads and barely any improvement in others.

If you already have a Zen 4 CPU, there isn’t enough meat on the bone to justify an upgrade here. That may change once we see the flagships in action, but lower down the stack, the changes aren’t as drastic. The only exception are workloads like AVX-512, where the new Zen 5 architecture absolutely crushes everything else.

Gamers don’t need to worry, either — the Ryzen 7 5800X3D is still putting up impressive results years after its release, and the Ryzen 7 7800X3D remains the undisputed champ of gaming performance. Zen 5 brings gaming improvements, there’s no doubt about that. But the 3D V-Cache versions of these chips will let those improvements sing.

The Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X are great if you haven’t upgraded to the AM5 platform yet, however. They’re faster and cheaper than Ryzen 7000 options, and even moreso now considering the drop in DDR5 memory prices. If you’ve already taken the plunge to AM5, however, you can probably take this generation off — AMD says we’ll be getting more generations on this socket, after all."
AMD’s new Ryzen 9000 CPUs are cheaper than its previous-gen chips.,https://www.club386.com/amd-ryzen-7-9700x-and-ryzen-5-9600x-review/,"Announced at Computex this year, AMD’s Ryzen 9000 Series CPUs have led a charmed life. Originally due July 31, the chip giant took a decision to delay the launch for quality control reasons. Now, the release is staggered, with the Ryzen 7 9700X and Ryzen 5 9600X on shelf August 8, followed by Ryzen 9 9950X and Ryzen 9 9900X a week later.

The most notable feature of these chips is the brand-new Zen 5 CPU architecture. Built as a foundational design on which the next few generations of Zen will expand upon, Zen 5 doubles down on processing width, makes manifest changes to the floating-point unit, and features faster caches. You can read all about it in our Zen 5 primer.

One area conspicuous by its absence, however, is a lack of a specific NPU to handle emerging AI tasks efficiently. The desktop version of Zen 5, codenamed Granite Ridge, has come too soon for the 50 TOPS integration present on the mobile variant known as Strix Point. I guess the rationale is you’ll run said tasks on a discrete GPU for optimal performance.

AMD’s commitment to long-term platform support is evident with Zen 5 as it shares the same AM5 socket as its direct predecessor. This means Zen 5 CPUs will work in present AMD 600-series motherboards – you know, X670(E), B650(E) – though a BIOS update may be in order for getting the most out of the processors. AMD will introduce a minor chipset update in the fall. X870(E) boards will have USB 4.0 as standard, but that’s about all. It’s baffling that these boards, first shown off at Computex, arrive at a different time.

As before, AMD also plans on cache-enriched X3D versions at a later date, keeping the same release philosophy as Ryzen 5000 and 7000 Series.

Analysis

Here I list the four Ryzen 9000 Series chips along with high-level attributes. For your reference, I’ve also included the relevant processors from Zen 4, Zen 3, and Zen 2. Mapping the new processors over older Ryzens is easy because AMD keeps the same core-and-thread topology as three previous generations going back five years. That’s a potential stumbling block with respect to all-out performance.

Nevertheless, Ryzen 9000 Series cores enjoy a refined manufacturing process from foundry partner TSMC. Known as N4X, it’s better than recent Ryzen 7000 Series’ N5 in terms of efficiency. This is why you see comparatively lower TDPs for all but the range-topping 9950X. The IOD remains on the same N6 process as the previous generation, which is one of the benefits of using a modular approach.

On the face of it, I’m intrigued AMD’s reduced 9700X and 9600X TDPs down from 105W to 65W, consistent with Ryzen 5000 and 3000 Series, making them better suited for quieter and cooler PCs. This turn of events makes it difficult to introduce non-X parts further down the line. My thinking is, if AMD indeed does so, they will simply be clocked lower. Of course, with this new pair, there’s nothing stopping you from upping the voltage and performance; all chips remain unlocked from an overclocking perspective.

Peering closer and comparing like for like, Zen 5 CPUs have a noticeably lower base clock than the Zen 4 cohort. This clock defines the minimum speed the processor runs at in applications, and I’m a little concerned about the real-world implications.

In conjunction with better silicon for the cores and AMD’s 16% geomean gain over Zen 4 emanating from smarter architecture, there’s every reason to believe Ryzen 9000 Series are better processors. The question I’m answering in this editorial is by how much.

The Chips

Anyone who’s laid their mitts on a Zen 4-based processor appreciates that packaging hasn’t changed much between generations. There’s no reason to do so, either, as both families use physically identical chips.

There is no cooler in either box. This approach is consistent with the Ryzen 7 7700X and Ryzen 5 7600X, though the also-65W 7600 (non-X) does have a Wraith Stealth. Go figure.

Looking at the codes contained atop of the Ryzen 7 9700X CPU, I can tell you that it was packaged in week 29 this year. That’s very recent, all things considered, and hints at AMD taking the chips hot off the press and packaging them up quickly.

This could be any AMD AM5 processor, really. The familiar heatspreader design is a magnet for getting thermal paste caught around the edges, so investing in a shim helps keep it clean.

The Ryzen 5 9600X shares its bigger brother’s 65W TDP and 88W PPT. Housing the same single CCD underneath, albeit with fewer cores active, swapping out to this chip from a present Ryzen 7000 Series is easy as pie.

On many enthusiasts’ lips is whether AMD’s progress with architecture lends itself to an upgrade. This is what I’ll answer now.

Testing

To do this, I have benchmarked, from absolute scratch, seven relevant processors from the AMD Ryzen 9000, 7000, and Intel Core 14th Gen series. AMD chips are tested on an MSI X670E Ace, while Intel run on an ASRock Phantom Gaming Z790 Nova WiFi. Both are updated to the latest BIOS and run processors at their manufacturer-recommended TDPs.

By the way, I’m still perplexed as to why AMD’s platform takes so long to boot. Memory training is still very much in evidence with Ryzen 9000 Series, and after testing a glut of chips in consecutive fashion, the boot times between AMD and Intel platforms is readily apparent.

Common components include 64GB (2x32GB) Kingston Fury Beast memory at DDR5-6000 CL36, 2TB WD_Black SN850X SSD, Zotac GeForce RTX 4090 graphics (560.70 drivers), be quiet Dark Power Pro 13 1,300W PSU, and Arctic Liquid Freezer III 420 AIO cooling.

Prefacing the productivity results and providing necessary context, it makes sense to list each tested chip’s all-core speed when running Cinebench 2024’s nT test for 10 minutes. Understanding the frequency lays appropriate foundation for what you are about to see.

Chip All-core frequency Manufacturer’s TDP AMD Ryzen 7 9700X 4.634GHz 65W AMD Ryzen 7 7700X 5.285GHz 105W AMD Ryzen 5 9600X 5.090GHz 65W AMD Ryzen 5 7600X 5.358GHz 105W AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D 4.835GHz 120W Intel Core i7-14700K 4.523GHz 253W Intel Core i5-14600K 4.453GHz 181W

App Performance

Here we go. A good first question to ask is why Ryzen 7 9700X is ever so slightly behind the Ryzen 7 7700X? Surely a newer chip bearing the same familial name ought to be better in every way. I’ll expand upon this later, but the reason is the 65W TDP hamstrings the 9700X’s potential, leading to lower frequency, as detailed in the table above.

Furthermore, it is miles behind the Intel Core i7-14700K. Granted, that chip is around 10% more expensive – $409 vs. $359 – and certainly a lot thirstier on wattage, yet the difference is stark.

AMD does better in math-intensive Y-cruncher. Ryzen 5 9600X is not only a lot quicker than last-generation Ryzen 5 7600X, it also consumes less power in the process. A win-win situation that brings the best out of the new microarchitecture.

One of AMD’s key takeaways with Zen 5 revolves around a foundationally muscular design that’s particularly adept in single-thread throughput. Difficult to argue with that logic here.

Small generation hikes are expected when dialling down the TDP from last generation 105W to 65W this time around.

Here’s an interesting one. The twin Ryzen 9000 Series processors blitz the Geekbench 6 machine-learning test that relies on the heavy lifting of float32, float16, and int8 data types. Zen 5 is built with this technology in mind.

Content Creation

Better than what’s come before, though AMD’s fewer cores and threads are plain to see when I look over to what Intel offers. It feels wrong that a Core i5-14600K beats the Ryzen 7 9700X in this throughput test.

More evidence that Zen 5 is impressive when running light-load applications.

Hamstrung by meagre TDPs, the new generation of Ryzens are not much faster than their 7000 Series namesakes. They’re absolutely taken to task with broadly equivalent Intel chips touting far more cores and threads.

Let me drill down for you and find out what’s going on. Here’s where the Ryzen 7 9700X’s 65W TDP actually works against it from a performance perspective. You see the limiting factor is package power tracking (PPT) that’s set to 88W. The chip hits this wall very quickly and then modulates frequency and voltage to remain up against it.

The upshot is an all-core frequency of 4.634GHz, considered low for a modern processor. The Ryzen 7 7700X, meanwhile, runs a 105W TDP and uses this extra headroom when scaling all the way up to 5.285GHz on the same platform.

All of this means temperature remains wonderfully low under load, barely hitting 60C, and this means you can run the chip with very quiet air cooling in both small and large chassis.

Nevertheless, what Ryzen 7 9700X gives up in frequency it makes up for by smarter architecture and larger caches. I can’t help but feel AMD ought to have launched it at 105W because the foundational power of Zen 5 is clear to see.

Overall, though, I can still make the case that Ryzen 9000 Series CPUs are more performant than the previous generation. Of course, you would certainly expect so, and AMD’s sacrificed potential performance at the altar of efficiency.

Memory

AMD’s memory topology doesn’t change between generations. With all chips run at DDR5-6000 CL36, Intel leads the way in pure bandwidth.

Gaming

Whoa, Nelly, practically a dead heat when an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 is doing the heavy lifting.

In the first real-world game, the new Ryzen duo does a good job at pushing out framerate. That said, you can’t visually tell the difference between any processor’s performance.

Here’s a title that loves lots of CPU oomph. Running better on AMD hardware, there’s a very small lead for Ryzen 9000 Series CPUs over their brethren.

Cyberpunk enjoys cores and the Zen 5 architecture. Even though the 9700X part runs a comparatively low gaming frequency, there’s enough under the hood to elevate FHD performance to below the cache-enriched Ryzen 7 7800X3D.

More evidence that the Zen 5 architecture plays nicely with gaming. But let me be clear, neither the Ryzen 7 9700X nor the Ryzen 5 9600X are better gaming chips than the Ryzen 7 7800X3D, and this is precisely why AMD didn’t compare to it in briefing documents.

Should you game with a high-end GPU, I’d recommend the Ryzen 7 9700X; the other review chip’s fewer cores are exposed by the rampaging RTX 4090.

Efficiency and Value

Evaluated as a system and taking Cinebench 2024’s multi-core test into account, AMD’s efficiency focus is clear.

And this translates to cool and quiet running. AMD’s 9000 Series’ focus on optimised silicon floor planning and removing potential hot spots comes to fruition. Temperatures are best in class.

This graph divides the same Cinebench 2024 multi-core score by the noted power consumption. Here’s where the new Ryzens are fundamentally better than 7000 Series CPUs.

The graph divides, you guessed it, the Cinebench 2024 nT score by launch MSRP for each respective processor. Intel’s more-core approach pays handsome dividends here.

But it’s not actually as simple as that. In-market processors tend to drop in price over time, pushing their value metric up, and it’s now possible to buy the Ryzen 7 7700X for $295 ($399 RRP) and Ryzen 5 7600X for $229 ($299 RRP). Plugging those numbers in pushes their respective scores to 3.96 and 3.76, respectively.

Conclusion

Zen 5 is a foundational microarchitecture that defines AMD’s thinking for the next few generations. Fundamentally a wider core engine, I can’t help but feel it’s been designed for the datacentre first and foremost. That is absolutely the right approach as the bulk of AMD’s revenues emanate from that segment.

Unlike rival Intel, AMD keeps to the established core-and-thread hierarchy as three previous generations spanning five years, translating to a 6C12T Ryzen 5 9600X and 8C16T Ryzen 7 9700X. Furthermore, AMD ringfences potential by mandating a 65W TDP for both processors. The upshot is productivity performance that’s not much better than Ryzen 7000 Series.

Implementing Zen 5 on the desktop in this way presents challenges. Core i7-14700K is miles faster than Ryzen 7 9700X for many productivity and rendering tasks, while Core i5-14600K oftentimes paints a similar picture against Ryzen 5 9600X.

An easy fix for AMD is to realign pricing with performance. Every product can shine if the cost is keen enough. The current $359 (£340) and $279 (£270) asking fees for the new mid-range chips is therefore too steep. I’d suggest a maximum of $299 and $249, respectively, thus increasing their immediate attractiveness substantially.

Nevertheless, there are bright spots. Zen 5 is adept at gaming, even if neither chip can muster enough fps to overhaul Ryzen 7 7800X3D. Power consumption and temperature are both excellent, too, and some applications take a shine to the new architecture’s focus on floating-point prowess. I can’t also ignore how easy it is to swap out from a Ryzen 7000 Series to a 9000 Series CPU, too.

Having tested a plethora of chips over the last two weeks, I find it difficult to outright recommend the new Ryzen chips in the current climate. AMD’s incremental generational performance gains hark back to a bygone era where Intel did much the same thing for many years, stifling true advancement by playing it abundantly safe."

The flagship 16-core Ryzen 9 9950X will be priced at $649, which is $50 less than the $699 Ryzen 9 7950X that launched nearly two years ago. The rest of the lineup is $20 to $50 less than the equivalent Ryzen 7000 processors.

After delaying the launch of the Ryzen 9000 CPUs “out of an abundance of caution,” the Ryzen 7 9700X ($359) and Ryzen 5 9600X ($279) will launch on August 8, followed by the Ryzen 9 9950X ($649) and Ryzen 9 9900X ($499) on August 15.

AMD Ryzen 9000 Series Pricing. Image: AMD

AMD is promising a roughly 16 percent increase in performance per instruction cycle (IPC) compared to previous-generation Ryzen processors, with big promises of performance gains in both productivity and gaming tasks.

AMD also launched the new X870 and X870E motherboards. Chipsets for the new Ryzen 9000 series processors, but those motherboards won’t be available at launch. Fortunately, these new Ryzen 9000 processors will work in any existing AM5 motherboard, a socket that AMD has committed to supporting until at least 2027.

AMD’s new CPUs arrive as its main competitor Intel struggles with crashes and stability issues with its 13th and 14th Gen desktop CPUs. Intel has discovered the root cause of the problems and plans to release a microprocessor fix in the coming weeks, but existing CPUs that have already been damaged by the extremely high voltages will need to be replaced.

As promised at launch, the Fitbit Ace LTE now supports Tap to Pay via the Greenlight or GoHenry debit cards. These third-parties help “parents teach responsible spending with transaction alerts, spending limits and allowance for chores.” Kids will be able to “see details of their recent transactions,” with parents also getting that information and live purchase notifications in the companion app.

It works anywhere Google Pay NFC transactions are supported, while a screen lock has to be set on the Fitbit Ace LTE. To pay, double press the top Home button on the side and hold near the reader. Alternatively, tap the Home button once for a new Wallet icon next to health stats and Clock.

Parents are able to lock or temporarily halt payment capabilities from their app, and remove the card at any time.

If you’re new to Greenlight or GoHenry, sign up via the Fitbit Ace app for special discount offers.

The School time that silences notifications/calls and disables games is adding a “Lunch break” option “so kids can use their watch during recess, but stay focused during class time.”

The Fitbit Ace companion app will soon let you “add siblings — whether they’re an older sibling with a phone or a younger sibling with an Ace LTE — as your child’s contact.” This is coming later this year.

Google is adding new Daily Quest tasks and challenges that feature “evidence-based health content” from the Alliance for a Healthier Generation.

Finally, there are two new games:

“With Sproutlings, kids can bring their virtual pets everywhere they go and nurture their pets to keep them happy, grow fruit, and even walk to new gardens to feed their pets exotic bugs.”

“Once playtime is over, Spirit Garden helps your child recenter themselves with guided mindful practices that unlock land spirits and rebuild ancient shrines in faraway lands.”

The Fitbit Ace LTE now has tap-to-pay functionality with select financial services – this feature was previously “coming soon.”

For those who missed news of the Fitbit Ace LTE, it was announced as a kid-focused watch by Google back in May. It runs a custom skin on top of Wear OS, so that functionality is pretty limited for kids. It’s similar to those Gizmo Watches that Verizon sells, with LTE connectivity, location tracking, and calls/texting to select contacts for kids. It has a handful of games, encourages movement, and was initially launched with the potential for NFC payments.

Starting today, the payment functionality on the Fitbit Ace LTE will start to rollout. Google is partnering with Greenlight and GoHenry to launch the feature, both of which are family-friendly debit card services. You can setup either payment service to allow your child to tap-to-pay with their wrist. You do so from your Fitbit Ace LTE companion app.

My kid has been testing this watch for the past couple of months on and off, so we’ll try to get you some form of a review before the new school year starts. So far, it has been super useful as he spends the summer between camps and out of the house. While he loves to text me to pick him up early on the daily, there’s a peace of mind about knowing exactly where your 10-year old is at all times when they aren’t at school.

In addition to payments, Google is also adding a new lunch break option (so kids can use their watches during breaks) and two new games (Sproutlings and Spirit Garden). They plan to allow families to add siblings as contacts to watches too.

Tap to Pay was mentioned as “coming soon” when the Ace LTE launched back in May. The idea was to give kids the freedom to buy things on their own, while also allowing parents oversight. To do that, Google — which owns Fitbit — is partnering with Greenlight and GoHenry, which offer debit cards for children and teens. If you have accounts with those services, you’ll be able to add them to the Ace LTE, and kids will be able to use their smartwatch to buy things wherever Google Pay is accepted. If not, Google says you’ll be able to sign up via the Fitbit Ace app for a discount.

The Ace LTE is unique among kids trackers in that it isn’t just a GPS tracker for parents. It also includes several wrist-based video games. With this update, Fitbit’s adding two more to its catalog: Sproutlings and Spirit Garden. The former is a Tamagotchi-like game with virtual pets that you feed and walk around with. The latter has a more meditative concept with guided mindfulness and an element of unlocking land spirits and rebuilding shrines. Like the Apple Watch, the Ace LTE also includes a school time mode to reduce distractions — though parents can program a break for recess."
"Fitbit Ace LTE adds Tap to Pay, Lunch break, and new games.",https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/googles-kid-friendly-fitbit-ace-lte-just-got-a-new-feature-that-parents-may-not-love,"Google is rolling out an update to its kid-friendly Fitbit Ace LTE smartwatch with the goal to “foster independence and motivate movement” in young users. Chief among them is the implementation of Tap to Pay.

Children will be able to use the feature to pay for things wherever “Google Pay is accepted. In fact, it operates just like it does on the Pixel Watch 2, but with a distinct difference.

Tap to Pay on the Fitbit Ace LTE doesn’t work with just any debit or credit card. The device must be connected to a debit card from either Greenlight or GoHenry, two financial tech companies that strive to teach children about money.

Through this integration, the wearable can also send transaction alerts, implement spending limits, and give out an allowance whenever chores are done. It's designed to help children develop autonomy while giving parents a way to monitor their finances so they don’t overspend.

New games

The second major release is the introduction of two new games on the FitBit Arcade app: Sproutlings and Spirit Garden. Details are sparse, but from what we can see, they encourage kids to exercise like the other already-available titles.

Spirit Garden is an immersive title where players are tasked to summon virtual spirits and rebuild shrines. Progression appears tied to exercising as extra game time is unlocked ""the more kids move."" It’s an interactive experience as the title utilizes haptic feedback, audio, and the built-in accelerometer in its gameplay. There is also a meditation aspect to it, as the announcement mentions “guided mindful practices”.

Sproutlings are similar to Tamagotchi, with children receiving a little plant critter they’re tasked with raising. As with the previous game, progression is connected to exercise since the Sproutling grows as young users play.

The School Time tool is receiving an extra function by allowing parents to set up a lunch break. That way, “kids can use their watch during recess” or lunch, but when classes start, it’s automatically disabled.

There are other changes, too, although we don't know a lot about them. Google states it is partnering with the Alliance for a Healthier Generation to consistently release “new Daily Quests” moving forward. Exactly what these exercises are is unknown.

Later in the year, kids will be able to add their older or younger siblings as contacts inside the wearable Fitbit Ace app. This is supposed to facilitate communication between the two sides. There is no word on exactly when the feature will roll out, although we did reach out to Google for more information and we'll update this piece if and when we hear back.

Google DeepMind develops a ‘solidly amateur’ table tennis robot.,https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/08/google-deepmind-develops-a-solidly-amateur-table-tennis-robot/,"Sports have long served as an important test for robots. The best-known example of the phenomenon may be the annual RoboCup soccer competition, which dates back to the mid-1990s. Table tennis has played a key role in benchmarking robot arms since a decade prior. The sport requires speed, responsiveness and strategy, among other things.

In a newly published paper titled “Achieving Human Level Competitive Robot Table Tennis,” Google’s DeepMind Robotics team is showcasing its own work on the game. The researchers have effectively developed a “solidly amateur human-level player” when pitted against a human component.

During testing, the table tennis bot was able to beat all of the beginner-level players it faced. With intermediate players, the robot won 55% of matches. It’s not ready to take on pros, however. The robot lost every time it faced an advanced player. All told, the system won 45% of the 29 games it played.

Robotic table tennis has served as a benchmark for this type of research since the 1980s.

“This is the first robot agent capable of playing a sport with humans at human level and represents a milestone in robot learning and control,” the paper claims. “However, it is also only a small step towards a long-standing goal in robotics of achieving human level performance on many useful real world skills. A lot of work remains in order to consistently achieve human-level performance on single tasks, and then beyond, in building generalist robots that are capable of performing many useful tasks, skillfully and safely interacting with humans in the real world.”

The system’s biggest shortcoming is its ability to react to fast balls. DeepMind suggests the key reasons for this are system latency, mandatory resets between shots and a lack of useful data.

“To address the latency constraints that hinder the robot’s reaction time to fast balls, we propose investigating advanced control algorithms and hardware optimizations,” the researchers note. “These could include exploring predictive models to anticipate ball trajectories or implementing faster communication protocols between the robot’s sensors and actuators.”

Other exploitable issues with the system are high and low balls, backhand and the ability to read the spin on an incoming ball.

As far as how such research could affect robotics beyond the very limited usefulness of table tennis, DeepMind cites policy architecture, its use of simulation to operate in real games, and its ability to adapt its strategy in real time."
Google DeepMind develops a ‘solidly amateur’ table tennis robot.,https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/man-vs-machine-deepminds-new-robot-serves-up-a-table-tennis-triumph/,"On Wednesday, researchers at Google DeepMind revealed the first AI-powered robotic table tennis player capable of competing at an amateur human level. The system combines an industrial robot arm called the ABB IRB 1100 and custom AI software from DeepMind. While an expert human player can still defeat the bot, the system demonstrates the potential for machines to master complex physical tasks that require split-second decision-making and adaptability.

""This is the first robot agent capable of playing a sport with humans at human level,"" the researchers wrote in a preprint paper listed on arXiv. ""It represents a milestone in robot learning and control.""

The unnamed robot agent (we suggest ""AlphaPong""), developed by a team that includes David B. D'Ambrosio, Saminda Abeyruwan, and Laura Graesser, showed notable performance in a series of matches against human players of varying skill levels. In a study involving 29 participants, the AI-powered robot won 45 percent of its matches, demonstrating solid amateur-level play. Most notably, it achieved a 100 percent win rate against beginners and a 55 percent win rate against intermediate players, though it struggled against advanced opponents.

A Google DeepMind video of the AI agent rallying with a human table tennis player.

The physical setup consists of the aforementioned IRB 1100, a 6-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, mounted on two linear tracks, allowing it to move freely in a 2D plane. High-speed cameras track the ball's position, while a motion-capture system monitors the human opponent's paddle movements.

AI at the core

To create the brains that power the robotic arm, DeepMind researchers developed a two-level approach that allows the robot to execute specific table tennis techniques while adapting its strategy in real time to each opponent's playing style. In other words, it's adaptable enough to play any amateur human at table tennis without requiring specific per-player training.

The system's architecture combines low-level skill controllers (neural network policies trained to execute specific table tennis techniques like forehand shots, backhand returns, or serve responses) with a high-level strategic decision-maker (a more complex AI system that analyzes the game state, adapts to the opponent's style, and selects which low-level skill policy to activate for each incoming ball).

The researchers state that one of the key innovations of this project was the method used to train the AI models. The researchers chose a hybrid approach that used reinforcement learning in a simulated physics environment, while grounding the training data in real-world examples. This technique allowed the robot to learn from around 17,500 real-world ball trajectories—a fairly small dataset for a complex task.

A Google DeepMind video showing an illustration of how the AI agent analyzes human players.

The researchers used an iterative process to refine the robot's skills. They started with a small dataset of human-vs-human gameplay, then let the AI loose against real opponents. Each match generated new data on ball trajectories and human strategies, which the team fed back into the simulation for further training. This process, repeated over seven cycles, allowed the robot to continuously adapt to increasingly skilled opponents and diverse play styles. By the final round, the AI had learned from over 14,000 rally balls and 3,000 serves, creating a body of table tennis knowledge that helped it bridge the gap between simulation and reality.

Interestingly, Nvidia has also been experimenting with similar simulated physics systems, such as Eureka, that allow an AI model to rapidly learn to control a robotic arm in simulated space instead of the real world (since the physics can be accelerated inside the simulation, and thousands of simultaneous trials can take place). This method is likely to dramatically reduce the time and resources needed to train robots for complex interactions in the future.

Humans enjoyed playing against it

Beyond its technical achievements, the study also explored the human experience of playing against an AI opponent. Surprisingly, even players who lost to the robot reported enjoying the experience. ""Across all skill groups and win rates, players agreed that playing with the robot was 'fun' and 'engaging,'"" the researchers noted. This positive reception suggests potential applications for AI in sports training and entertainment.

However, the system is not without limitations. It struggles with extremely fast or high balls, has difficulty reading intense spin, and shows weaker performance in backhand plays. Google DeepMind shared an example video of the AI agent losing a point to an advanced player due to what appears to be difficulty reacting to a speedy hit, as you can see below.

A Google DeepMind video of the AI agent playing against an advanced human player.

The implications of this robotic ping-pong prodigy extend beyond the world of table tennis, according to the researchers. The techniques developed for this project could be applied to a wide range of robotic tasks that require quick reactions and adaptation to unpredictable human behavior. From manufacturing to health care (or just spanking someone with a paddle repeatedly), the potential applications seem large indeed.

The research team at Google DeepMind emphasizes that with further refinement, they believe the system could potentially compete with advanced table tennis players in the future. DeepMind is no stranger to creating AI models that can defeat human game players, including AlphaZero and AlphaGo. With this latest robot agent, it's looking like the research company is moving beyond board games and into physical sports. Chess and Jeopardy have already fallen to AI-powered victors—perhaps table tennis is next."
Google DeepMind develops a ‘solidly amateur’ table tennis robot.,https://www.popsci.com/technology/google-table-tennis-robot/,"Humans have firmly retained their lead over robots at table tennis for over 40 years, but recent advancements at Google DeepMind suggest our days of dominance may be numbered. As detailed in a preprint paper released on August 7, researchers have designed the first-ever robotic system capable of amateur human-level performance in ping pong—and there are videos to prove it.

Researchers often opt for classic games like chess and Go to test the strategic capabilities of artificial intelligence—but when it comes to combining strategy and real-time physicality, a longtime robotics’ industry standard is table tennis. Engineers have pitted machines against humans in countless rounds of ping pong for more than four decades due to the sport’s intense computational and physical requirements involving rapid adaptation to dynamic variables, complex motions, and visual coordination.

“The robot has to be good at low level skills, such as returning the ball, as well as high level skills, like strategizing and long-term planning to achieve a goal,” Google DeepMind explained in an announcement thread posted to X.

To develop their highly advanced bot, engineers first compiled a large dataset of “initial table tennis ball states” including information on positionality, spin, and speed. They then tasked their AI system to practice using this dataset in physically accurate virtual simulations to learn skills like returning serves, backhand aiming, and forehand topspin methods. From there, they paired the AI with a robotic arm capable of complex, quick movements and set it against human players. This data, including visual information of the ping pong balls captured by cameras onboard the bot, was then analyzed in simulations again to create a “continuous feedback loop” of learning.

[Related: This AI program could teach you to be better at chess.]

Then came the tournament. Google DeepMind enlisted 29 human players ranked across four skill levels—beginner, intermediate, advanced, and “advanced+”—and had them play against their track-mounted robotic arm. Of those, the machine won a total of 13 matches, or 45-percent of its challenges, to demonstrate a “solidly amateur human-level performance,” according to researchers.

Table tennis enthusiasts worried about losing their edge to robots can breathe a (possibly temporary) sigh of relief. While the machine system beat every beginner-level player, it only won 55-percent of its matches against intermediate competitors, and failed to win any against the two advanced-tier humans. Meanwhile, study participants described the overall experience as “fun” and “engaging,” regardless of whether or not they won their game. They also reportedly expressed an overwhelming interest in rematches with the robot."
Google DeepMind develops a ‘solidly amateur’ table tennis robot.,https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-news-updates/google-deepminds-table-tennis-robot-competes-at-human-level/,"Researchers from Google DeepMind have developed a robot capable of playing table tennis at an amateur human level. This robotic system, featuring a 6 DoF ABB 1100 arm mounted on linear gantries, has been tested against human players of varying skill levels, winning 45% of the matches overall.

The robot’s design utilises a hierarchical and modular policy architecture, which includes low-level controllers for specific skills and a high-level controller for decision-making based on match statistics.

The robot employs advanced techniques to bridge the simulation-to-real-world gap, enabling it to adapt to unseen opponents and improve its decision-making process. It uses a combination of reinforcement learning and imitation learning to train its skills in simulation before deploying them in real-world matches. The system’s adaptability and strategic capabilities are enhanced by real-time tracking of match statistics and opponent performance.

In a user study involving 29 participants, the robot demonstrated solid amateur-level performance, winning all matches against beginners and 55% against intermediate players. However, it struggled against advanced players. Participants found the experience engaging and enjoyable, with 26 out of 29 expressing interest in playing with the robot again.

Despite its success, the robot faces challenges in handling fast and low balls, as well as accurately detecting spin. Future research aims to address these limitations by improving control algorithms and hardware optimisations, enhancing collision detection, and refining the robot’s strategic capabilities. This development marks a significant step towards achieving human-level performance in robotics, with potential applications beyond table tennis in various real-world tasks.

Google Deepmind’s robotics wing has constantly been advancing its research, as a few months back, they introduced ALOHA 2, a robotics technology with more dexterity to tasks with low-cost robots and AI. This development is likely an extension of the same research using ALOHA 2."

As developer Poncle promised , Vampire Survivors is making its way to PlayStation this summer and now there's a firm release date. Many people's pick for the best game of 2022 is coming to PS4 and PS5 on August 29 . All of the paid expansions will be available on launch day as well.

PlayStation was the last remaining major platform for the all-conquering, vampire-less game to land on. After coming out of early access on PC and Mac in October 2022, it hit Xbox the following month and then mobile that December (an ad-free version arrived on Apple Arcade earlier this month). The Switch port dropped a year ago . The only place that's really left to go now is VR.

For the uninitiated, each character in Vampire Survivors has a unique starting perk and weapon, which fires automatically. All you essentially have to do is control your character's movement and make careful choices about weapon and perk additions and upgrades when you level up as you fend off literally thousands of monsters. Runs typically last for up to 30 minutes, if you can survive that long. It's terrifically chaotic and, best of all, the game costs just five bucks."

It’s out on August 29th, with a new trailer that touts various features, ranging from at least 13.5 hours of gameplay to retailing for the price of a peri-peri chicken wrap. Check it out below.

The reverse bullet hell title has seen significant updates and free content since launching in December 2021. There have also been various paid DLC, including Legacy of the Moonspell, Tides of the Foscari, Emergency Meeting (a collaboration with Among Us) and Operation Guns (another collaboration with Konami’s Contra). Each has added new characters, maps, secrets, and more.

Fortunately, PlayStation players won’t have to wait to play them, as all DLC will be available day and date of the game’s release. Vampire Survivors is also available for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC, iOS and Android. Stay tuned for more details on the PS4 and PS5 versions alongside further updates in the coming weeks."

What’s the best way to describe Vampire Survivors to someone who hasn’t experienced it? It’s a game where you glide around big maps while stuff falls out of your pockets and hopefully onto hordes of enemies. You don’t actually do anything to empty your pockets. It just happens automatically, so your job is to avoid touching bad people while also jamming more stuff into your pants. You can play it with one hand.

If you want a more in-depth explanation, I reviewed it when it came out on Switch, then also gave tender critiques to the Emergency Meeting and Operation Guns expansions.

But while this paradigm-shifting game has been available on practically every other platform aside from ones belonging to Sony. Poncle has been working on a port for some time, but it has been held up by Sony’s submission process.

One important thing to note is that the new PlayStation trailer notes that the base Vampire Survivors is the same price as a peri-peri wrap. I’m not sure where they’re getting a peri-peri wrap for $4.99. I call hogwash. Not for quite some time have I witnessed a chicken dispensary offering such a beloved dish for such a low price.

Anyway, Vampire Survivors is available on practically every platform except PS4 and PS5. It will be released for PS4 and PS5 on August 29.

Why did it take this long? Poncle, a tiny indie team, has been taking its time with ports, working on one console a year. While Microsoft was on the ball with an Xbox version shortly after the 2022 PC release, Vampire Survivors didn’t come to Nintendo Switch until a year later, with a fantastic free mobile version taking precedence early on. Poncle blamed the more recent holdup on Sony’s submission process, noting that the team had never put a game on the PlayStation store before.

In the meantime, Vampire Survivors has spawned dozens of worthy clones, copycats, and clever adaptations. A Deep Rock Galactic take on the formula called Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor became a mini-sensation on Steam in its own right earlier this year. Like Slay the Spire before it, Vampire Survivors seems to hit on something archetypal that elevates its mashup of mechanics into its own subgenre.

It’s nice that PlayStation owners will finally be able to see what all the fuss is about. And also, I can’t wait to burn another hundred hours chasing that Platinum trophy.

"
Vampire Survivors hits PS4 and PS5 on August 29.,https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-minimalist-survival-action-hits-ps4-and-ps5-later-this-month,"Vampire Survivors - the acclaimed (and still doggedly vampire-free) minimalist survival RPG from developer Poncle - is finally launching for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on 29th August.

Vampire Survivors launched into PC early access back in 2021, where it immediately set tongues wagging - partly because it cost an absurdly generous £3.99, but mostly because its mix of wave-based monster dodging and auto-bludgeoning is very blimmin' good indeed.

""Once this wave is done, once this boss is done, once I've unlocked a new character or item, I should really turn off the computer and go for a run. Maybe,"" wrote Christian Donlan in Eurogamer's Recommended review. ""Or maybe one more go, one more choice, one more chance to confuse speed with damage with experience.""

Since its early access debut, Vampire Survivors has received a 1.0 release, a heap of free and paid DLC (including collaborations with Among Us and Contra), and it's spread its leathery wings to Xbox, Switch, Android, iOS, and Mac. Oh, and it won a BAFTA. So while PlayStation is definitely a little late to the party, it remains, at least, a party worth attending.

Vampire Survivors' PlayStation release will include all free content released so far - adding up to over 40 playable characters and 80 weapons – and all four of its paid DLCs (Legacy of Moonspell, Tides of the Foscari, Emergency Meetings, and Operation Guns) will be available for purchase on PS5 and PS4 at launch.

Expect Vampire Survivors to cost £3.99/€4.99/$4.99 when it comes to PS4 and PS5 on 29th August, with its paid DLC priced at £1.59/€1.99/$1.99."
Vampire Survivors hits PS4 and PS5 on August 29.,https://www.cgmagonline.com/news/vampire-survivors-for-playstation/,"The hit title developed and published by poncle, Vampire Survivors, is finally making its way to the PlayStation family of consoles this month.

The BAFTA ‘Best Game’ award winner, Vampire Survivors has seen a release on many platforms including smartphones, and today the developers at poncle have announced it is PlayStation’s turn. Vampire Survivors and all of its post-launch updated content is coming to the PlayStation family of consoles on August 29. On the Steam platform alone, poncle’s breakout title still sees thousands of daily players (according to SteamChartz) and has garnered over 200,000 positive Steam reviews.

The Roguelike title puts players behind the capable pixels of one of the many cast of characters tasked with pushing back the hordes of the night. It’s worth mentioning all of the previously released DLC (including the Among Us Emergency Meeting! mashup) will be launching at the exact same time, so fans can get a full fix of poncle’s offerings. CGMagazine’s review of poncle’s breakout title says “It never feels like you’re playing the same game twice. Whether you’re trying to hit the 30-minute mark, completing missions to unlock new characters or items, or upping the difficulty to really challenge yourself, there is always something exciting to do.”

"YouTube is testing a new Twitter-style community notes feature, which is good because You can use it to make notes.",https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/youtube-is-testing-a-new-twitter-style-community-notes-feature-which-is-good-because-youtubers-sure-do-love-to-lie/,"You know when you fire up a YouTube video and within the first two minutes the guy from the thumbnail has already said something obviously untrue? Instead of the sole recourse being pumping your fist while writing a corrective comment nobody will ever see, Google will soon let some users submit a Twitter-style ""note"" under those videos to provide valuable context or corrections.

Just like Twitter Community Notes, YouTube's experimental notes will be written by users, with one notable difference: During this pilot program, Google is using ""third-party evaluators"" to rate the helpfulness of notes and ultimately determine if they appear under a video. Contributors will eventually be able to rate notes if the feature is expanded. The company announced the feature on the YouTube blog in June, but is only now getting around to inviting people to try it out.

(Image credit: Google)

As you can see in the mockup above, approved notes will be prominently displayed under the title of videos in a blue box and can be expanded like a comment to read the whole thing. In an email sent to testers, Google invites them to submit notes on ""videos you find inaccurate or unclear,"" but adds that ""notes should always be in your own words, not copied text directly from sources, and they should add clarity or useful context to videos."" (*cough* ChatGPT *cough*)

Sounds like a decent idea. Community Notes has proved one of the few positive changes to Twitter over the last few years, and while those notes are sometimes abused by overzealous watch dogs stretching the definition of a ""fact check,"" they're generally successful at calling out when a widely-shared post is blatantly wrong.

I'd love to see the same thing happen for YouTube: the misinformation capital of the internet where algorithms regularly promote creators who platform conspiracy theorists and climate deniers, or brazenly mislead viewers with fictional thumbnails and titles that don't represent the content within. Of course, Google could also change its algorithm to not elevate charlatans, but that's not really part of its business plan. Better to put the burden on users and come out looking like it's fighting the misinformation it promoted.

If you're a prospective notes writer eager to make YouTube less annoying, check your inbox; you might have an invite to join the waitlist."
"YouTube is testing a new Twitter-style community notes feature, which is good because You can use it to make notes.",https://www.tubefilter.com/2024/08/08/youtube-wants-you-to-fact-check-its-videos/,"Just in time for the election and not long after Poynter called out YouTube as a major source of misinformation online, the platform is rolling out its own version of Twitter‘s Community Notes, asking users to give creators’ content the ol’ sniff test and see if it smells factual.

The platform first introduced this feature back in June, but per PC Gamer, is just now starting to invite a select number of people to submit fact-checking and context-providing notes on uploads. These contributors are part of the first wave, and YouTube says it’ll use their notes to “test the feature and improve our systems before we consider expanding.”

For now, all notes will be available on mobile in the U.S., and will only cover English-language content. Similar to Twitter’s system, YouTube will post contributors’ notes alongside videos and ask some viewers if those notes are helpful and/or factual, with information conveyed “clearly and neutrally.” It’ll use those ratings to determine whether the note is displayed to all viewers.

YouTube has several use cases it envisions will work for this feature. “For example, this could include notes that clarify when a song is meant to be a parody, point out when a new version of a product being reviewed is available, or let viewers know when older footage is mistakenly portrayed as a current event,” it said in a company blog post.

We suspect the platform will also want people to provide notes around more serious things like the election, providing context and fact-checking for content uploaded by or about candidates and the voting process. A lot of YouTube’s past fact-checking focus has been on elections, and we’re keeping an eye on what it’s planning for this year, since it fumbled during the 2020 presidential.

YouTube’s being realistic about this debut; it says it anticipates there will be issues, like “notes that aren’t a great match for the video, or potentially incorrect information,” and that its primary goal is to “learn from the experiment.”

A couple things to think about: First, this won’t change how YouTube takes action on videos that violate Community Guidelines. Violative videos won’t suddenly be permitted just because they have a clarifying note. And second, it’s not clear yet if videos having notes will impact them in any way. Will YouTube’s algorithm ever lessen the reach of a video because it has a clarifying note? Will it flag the video as less informative than others about similar topics? We expect we might hear more about these potential effects (or lack thereof) as this feature becomes more commonplace.

As we mentioned above, this rollout comes not long after Poynter–a nonprofit journalism school and research org that, among other things, provides fact-checking training to newsrooms–identified YouTube as “a major conduit of online disinformation.” Past data has shown that when misinformation is controlled on YouTube, it significantly lessens the amount of misinformation on other digital platforms, so if this new mobilization of YouTube users as fact-checkers works out, it could impact how much truth is out there across the web."

"YouTube is testing a new Twitter-style community notes feature, which is good because You can use it to make notes.",https://www.techspot.com/news/104176-youtube-tests-twitter-style-community-notes-fight-platform.html,"Why it matters: Arguably one of the best additions to X/Twitter in recent years has been the community notes feature, which allows contributors to add context such as pointing out incorrect facts beneath posts. YouTube, another platform rife with misinformation, is testing a new feature that works the same way.

YouTube says that the experimental feature will allow users of the platform to add notes to provide relevant, timely, and easy-to-understand context on videos. It gives examples such as when a song is meant to be a parody, which some people apparently need pointing out, when a new version of a product being reviewed is available, or letting viewers know when older footage is mistakenly (or intentionally) portrayed as a current event.

YouTube is currently inviting a limited number of eligible contributors who are channel owners to write the notes. The initial pilot will involve third-party evaluators, not users, rating the helpfulness of these notes, which will help train the systems. Contributors themselves will rate notes as well as the pilot program advances. Eventually, assuming the feature rolls out fully, everyone will be able to write and rate notes.

As explained by YouTube: ""When you find a video that might be confusing or inaccurate, you can submit a note clarifying it. Your contributions will be reviewed by others with a wide range of views to ensure their quality and helpfulness before being added to the information panel below the video.""

If they're found to be broadly helpful, the notes will be displayed beneath videos in a blue box and can be expanded by clicking on them, much like comments. People will be asked whether they think a note is ""helpful,"" ""somewhat helpful,"" or ""unhelpful"" and why. YouTube will then use a bridging-based algorithm to consider the ratings and determine what notes are published.

YouTube says testers should submit notes on videos they find inaccurate or unclear, emphasizing that they should be written in their own words and not use text copied directly from sources. The notes should also add clarity or useful context to videos.

The pilot program will only be available on mobile, in the US, and in English to start. Viewers, participants, and creators are invited to give YouTube feedback on the quality of notes.

YouTube is the world's second-most-popular website behind Google.com, with over 30 billion visits per month. It also has a misinformation problem that Google has been battling for years. Community notes have helped address this issue somewhat on X, and they could do the same on Google's video platform."
"YouTube is testing a new Twitter-style community notes feature, which is good because You can use it to make notes.",https://www.techtimes.com/articles/307093/20240808/youtube-community-notes-now-under-testing-similar-x-s-renowned.htm,"Invited users are now revealing the latest feature under testing on YouTube, and it is its version of ""Community Notes"" that would help keep users guided and prevent the spreading of misinformation about the platform. However, it would not be called that, but it is similar as to what the social media giant, previously known as Twitter, introduced to its users on the platform.

This new focus of YouTube is looking to bring this fact-checking feature that will help users avoid misleading information, but also offer additional information about subjects or topics.

YouTube 'Community Notes' Feature Now Under Testing

Social media users on X have shared the latest invite from Google and YouTube to be part of the testing of its version of the 'Community Notes,' best known for being introduced by Twitter. It was revealed that users would play a massive role in adding helpful information, context, and other types of notes that would allow a well-informed community on YouTube.

In the screenshot, it was shown that YouTube's new feature would appear below the title card of the video, also under its view counter and date of posting.

This is under testing for now, and there is yet no name for this new feature from YouTube, or if it will arrive in the future after this trial rollout.

Is It Similar to X's 'Community Notes'?

There are similarities to YouTube's new feature under testing to X's Community Notes, especially with its format ofYouTube users able to add context or information that would help clarify several things on its content. Based on the screenshot, YouTube would also publish the note if it is ""rated as helpful,"" possibly by other users.

Moreover, users may also include timestamps that would direct others to specific parts of the video, offering better context and help.

X's Community Notes and YouTube

Back when Twitter was still called its original name, the management under its new owner, Elon Musk, introduced a fact-checking feature that helps keep people informed properly on the app. This was called the Community Notes which also helps in providing additional information or context regarding a subject matter, with this being a collaborative effort for X and its community.

Over the past years, and similar to many social networking platforms, YouTube has seen its fair share of complaints from users, analysts, and fact-checkers for the rise of misinformation on the platform.

Since then, Google's video streaming platform has introduced a number of Community Guidelines updates that would help mitigate the spread of fake news, as well as deceptive generative AI-made content.

X's Community Notes has helped in verifying information for users, as well as getting context regarding a topic that they may have limited knowledge about, keeping the public in the loop and well-informed. Now, the same experience is possibly coming to YouTube with the latest test of its version of Community Notes, soon to help those who prefer more of Google's streaming platform.

"YouTube is testing a new Twitter-style community notes feature, which is good because You can use it to make notes.",https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-inviting-more-users-notes-feature-3469099/,"A couple of months ago, Google started experimenting with YouTube notes . Similar to Twitter’s Community Notes, the fact-checking feature is designed to call out misinformation in videos posted on the platform. To amplify the tool’s effectiveness, YouTube is now inviting more users to leave notes on videos they watch.

According to multiple Tweets ( 1 , 2 , 3 ), YouTube has been inviting more viewers to leave notes on its platform. When an eligible user submits one, YouTube forwards it to a third-party evaluator. If approved, the note will then appear under the relevant video — whether it’s a well-produced YouTube documentary or five minutes of nonsense.

Just like Twitter’s Community Notes feature, viewers can also rate visible notes on YouTube following the evaluator’s approval. They get to mark them as helpful, somewhat helpful, or unhelpful and leave a comment justifying their choice.

Once you’re eligible to submit notes, the company should notify you via email. Some of the eligibility criteria include having an active channel that follows YouTube’s guidelines, being a US-based mobile user, and having the language set to English. The invite reads:

We’re inviting you to pilot a new YouTube feature that allows you to add helpful notes to videos. These notes will provide additional information and create a better-informed YouTube community. How this works: When you find a video that might be confusing or inaccurate, you can submit a note clarifying it. Your contributions will be reviewed by others with a wide range of views to ensure their quality and helpfulness before being added to the information panel below the video. Together, we can make YouTube even more helpful for everyone.

Given the widespread misinformation in this era, YouTube notes are certainly a welcome addition to the platform. While the feature may not completely eliminate videos highlighting fake news, it at least calls them out and informs the viewers. After all, many folks blindly believe anything they read or watch on the internet, and these notes should at least offer them some guidance."
"YouTube is testing a new Twitter-style community notes feature, which is good because You can use it to make notes.",https://9to5google.com/2024/08/07/youtube-community-notes-test-pilot-program/,"The internet is full of misinformation and, to help combat that, YouTube is testing out a new feature that lets users play a part in setting the record straight, and it works just like Community Notes on Twitter/X.

Before it was “X,” Twitter introduced a feature called Community Notes which allowed a portion of users to provide information under a misleading or confusing tweet/post to clarify it, usually also providing links to offer additional context. It’s a very valuable, if still not perfect, feature for helping to mitigate the spread of misinformation.

Now, YouTube is getting something similar.

While it doesn’t have a name just yet, YouTube is sending invitations to a pilot program for a new feature that seems to work a lot like Community Notes.

Users who find a video that is “confusing or inaccurate” can submit a note to clarify the video, with others in the program able to review those contributions and, as a group, decide on if a note is shown on a video. If a note is approved, it appears directly underneath the video and can include timestamps for the video itself.

Google first announced this feature back in June, and started testing it with a “limited number of eligible contributors,” but appears to be rolling it out more widely as of this week.

YouTube explains in the full email as viewed by 9to5Google:

How this works: When you find a video that might be confusing or inaccurate, you can submit a note clarifying it. Your contributions will be reviewed by others with a wide range of views to ensure their quality and helpfulness before being added to the information panel below the video.

It’s further explained in the email that this feature only works on mobile for now.

On a support page, YouTube provides more detail on the feature. For users in the program, an “Add note” button will appear under videos where a note can be written and then submitted. The name of the person/channel that submitted the note is left out if it is published.

As for best practices, it’s suggested that notes cite sources (but is written in a user’s own words), are easy to understand, are neutral (avoiding personal opinions), offer context that isn’t already readily available, and directly address a claim that is made in a video or its title.

For those in the program, YouTube will send a notification if a submitted note is published on a video. A note is only published if it is rated as “helpful” by a “wide range of people.”

A note will only show up under a video if a wide range of people rate it as helpful. Our systems consider rating history and identify notes where raters who’ve historically had different perspectives on notes now agree. If people who have rated notes differently in the past now agree that a note is helpful, then our system is more likely to publish the note.

It’s unclear how widely this new pilot program will be available, or when this feature will roll out more widely to the general public.

YouTube first announced its community notes feature in June. The new feature allows viewers to submit short blurbs that provide additional context or correct information to certain video content. The community notes feature comes ahead of the US presidential election.

There is no official start date for the new feature, but YouTube has added a section to its “Help” database with instructions on writing and submitting notes. We’ve also reached out to Google for a comment on the new feature.

The pilot program is currently only available in English for mobile devices in the US, according to the support page. The company previously said it would invite participants through email or their Creator Studios account. The select group of test subjects will provide feedback to YouTube to help the platform determine which notes are “helpful,” “somewhat helpful” or “unhelpful,” before rolling out its community notes feature to the public, according to the official YouTube blog."

Instead of the sole recourse being pumping your fist while writing a corrective comment nobody will ever see, Google will soon let some users submit a Twitter-style ""note"" under those videos to provide valuable context or corrections.

Just like Twitter Community Notes, YouTube's experimental notes will be written by users, with one notable difference: During this pilot program, Google is using ""third-party evaluators"" to rate the helpfulness of notes and ultimately determine if they appear under a video. Contributors will eventually be able to rate notes if the feature is expanded. The company announced the feature on the YouTube blog in June, but is only now getting around to inviting people to try it out."

The video streaming application is working to integrate Gemini into its app to help users brainstorm video ideas. In the latest video, posted on its Channel Insider, the Google-owned company announced the launch of the new Brainstorm with Gemini feature. This feature offers prompts, concepts, trend notes, and thumbnail suggestions based on Google Search activity. Some YouTube creators can access the new feature within YouTube Studio, aimed at improving content performance, according to TechCrunch.

The Brainstorm with Gemini feature aims to give an upper hand over its competition in the market. By integrating its AI technology into YouTube, Google aims to incentivise creators to leverage its tools over rival platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT, fostering a loyal user base and maintaining a competitive edge in the AI-powered content creation space.

Here, Gemini's additional prompts offer creators insights to refine the content and stay attuned to audience interests. This will help creators optimise their content approach. By integrating these prompts into the Research tab, creators can gain a plethora of ideas and intelligence to increase content's resonance and impact.

YouTube is presently experimenting with new AI-powered features, soliciting input from creators during this trial period to inform future development. This move exemplifies YouTube's commitment to harness artificial intelligence and enhance its platform. This feature has the potential to ultimately transform the way its extensive creator community produces and shares content.

YouTube gets Twitter-like Community notes feature

Prior to rebranding as ""X"", Twitter launched Community Notes, a feature enabling select users to add clarifying context and links to misleading tweets, helping combat misinformation. Similarly, YouTube is now introducing a comparable feature, aimed at reducing the spread of false information by allowing users to provide supplementary context and accuracy checks on potentially confusing or misleading content.

While this feature is yet to be named, the company is sending invitations to a pilot program. Viewers who come across a video containing misleading or inaccurate information can suggest a clarifying note, which is then reviewed and vetted by a community of users. If the note is deemed accurate and helpful, it will be displayed below the video, often with specific timestamps linking to relevant parts of the content, providing context and correcting potential misinformation, as reported by 9to5Google.

Google announced this feature in June, and started testing it out. According to the report, only a limited number of eligible contributors are is the beta phase who can test this feature. It is also unclear when this feature will be rolled out to the public and how widely the pilot program will be available.

For the unfamiliar, it’s a feature added to essentially crowdsource fact-checking on the platform. It had existed during the Jack Dorsey era of the bird site, called Birdwatch, but it only ever existed as part of a US-exclusive pilot. These days, it’s available worldwide, and is more than just necessary now that the platform is encouraging rage-baiting. It looks like YouTube is doing the same, with an as-of-yet unnamed feature.

The way it works on YouTube is for the most part the same as it did on X. Users can submit a note to clarify what’s shown in a video if they find it confusing on inaccurate. Selected users will see the option to “add note” under eligible videos. To quote an email that 9to5Google claims to have seen “your contributions will be reviewed by others with a wide range of views to ensure their quality and helpfulness before being added to the information panel below the video”.

Also like the former bird platform, YouTube’s take on the feature will make it so that a note will only be published if it gets rated as helpful by a “wide range of people”. One criteria to this is to have “raters who’ve historically had different perspectives on notes now agree”, though this seems liable to dilute the pool of people who would have “different perspectives” down the line.

To be fair, the video hosting platform that Google now owns announced the initiative all the way back in June. But as the aforementioned report notes, more people are sharing getting an invitation to participate. All that being said, it remains to be seen if this will remain a pilot program for much longer, or if a general rollout is incoming.

This will allow users to remove any video that seems “misleading or false.” It will be possible to prevent that, and they can also submit a note to clarify the video. Once this feature is available, a note will be shown on the video to clarify how much truth is in it.

Notes for the video can also include timestamps. Google first announced the feature in June and began testing it with a “limited number of eligible contributors,” but this week it is rolling out more broadly. It is expected to be seen on Pixel devices soon.

Your contributions will be reviewed by others with a wide range of views to ensure their quality and helpfulness before being added to the information panel below the video.”

It further states that this feature currently works only on mobile. For participating users, an “Add Note” button will appear below the video, where the note can be written and then submitted. When the note is published, the name of the person submitting it and the channel are omitted. This will also give the user clarity on all the information.

YouTube will send a notification to those participating in the program if the submitted note is published on a video. Finally, the note is published only when it is rated as ‘helpful’ by a lot of people. It is not clear when this feature will be widely available.

YouTube began testing the Notes feature back in June with creators while the first batch of invites were sent out to general users just yesterday. The pilot will be available on mobile in the U.S. and in English to start. If you’re eligible to write notes, you’ll need to sign up on the YouTube mobile App to get started. YouTube iterates that Notes should always be in your own words, not copied text directly from sources, and they should add clarity or useful context to videos.

Aside from the language and region criteria, there are other prerequisites required for users to access Notes in YouTube, such as:

The account created six or more months ago.

The account hasn’t had a Community Guidelines strike in the past 12 months.

Your account Isn’t a supervised account.

The account shouldn’t have multiple owners.

Isn’t owned by an account that can be owned and managed by multiple users, like a Brand Account or school account.

The Notes feature will allow people to add notes to provide relevant, timely, and easy-to-understand context on YouTube videos. “To help others stay informed, you can sign up to submit notes on videos that you find inaccurate or unclear. After submission, your note is reviewed and rated by others. If your note is rated as helpful by many people with a broad set of perspectives, it may be published and appear below the video,” said YouTube in a Google support page.

How Will Note Rating Work?

Notes will appear publicly under a video if they’re found to be broadly helpful. People will be asked whether they think a note is “helpful,” “somewhat helpful,” or “unhelpful” and why – for example, whether it cites high-quality sources or is written clearly and neutrally. From there, YouTube will use a bridging-based algorithm to consider these ratings and determine what notes are published.

A bridging-based algorithm helps identify notes that are helpful to a broad audience across perspectives. If many people who have rated notes differently in the past now rate the same note as helpful, then our system is more likely to show that note under a video. These systems will continuously improve as more notes are written and rated across a broad range of topics, as per YouTube.

This series is also considered the successor of the Xiaomi 14 series, which has gained a lot of success. Apart from this, a new news is coming that the device can have AI features Google Pixels.



However, a slight lack of AI features was also seen in the previous Xiaomi 14 series, which can now be fixed with the new upcoming device. Smartphone manufacturers are also developing their own solutions for the last several months. Xiaomi has chosen Google Gemini as an artificial intelligence-based service for its device.

According to Lei Jun, “he is excited to collaborate with Google on the international versions of Xiaomi’s future flagship models, which will be able to offer users a smarter and more intuitive experience thanks to services like Google Cloud and Gemini.”

"YouTube is testing a new Twitter-style community notes feature, which is good because You can use it to make notes.",https://passionategeekz.com/youtube-testing-write-notes-on-videos-to-improve-video-information/,"YouTube is testing a feature similar to X’s (formerly Twitter) Community Notes to fight misinformation, reports 9to5Google.

This new feature allows users to add notes that clarify confusing or inaccurate videos, which are reviewed and approved by other users before appearing beneath the video.

Google announced this feature in June and is now expanding its testing. Invitations for a pilot program are being sent to a select group of users, inviting them to “add helpful notes to videos” to provide additional information and create a better-informed YouTube community.

Write Notes on Videos – How It Works

YouTube explains that users can sign up to submit notes on inaccurate or unclear videos. After submission, notes are reviewed and rated by others.

A note is published only if it is rated as helpful by a broad set of users. YouTube will notify users when their note is published. Currently, this feature is available only on mobile devices.

Users in the program will see an “Add note” button under videos. Submitted notes should cite sources, be easy to understand, neutral, and directly address claims made in the video or its title.

Writing Notes

The support page details how to write a note and what happens after submission. Tips for writing notes include:

Cite sources supporting the note’s claims.

Use easy-to-understand language.

Maintain neutrality and avoid personal opinions.

Provide important context not available in the video, description, or title.

Directly address claims made in the video or title.

Getting Started

To write a note:

Tap “Add note” under the video.

Write your note in the text box.

Tap “Send.”

Published notes will be anonymous, and the channel name will not be displayed.

Availability

The program is invite-only, so if you don’t see the option to add a note, you might not be eligible. This feature is also unavailable for videos with minors, Made for Kids content, or private videos.

It is unknown how widely this pilot program will be available or when it will roll out to the general public.

"YouTube is testing a new Twitter-style community notes feature, which is good because You can use it to make notes.",https://www.phoneworld.com.pk/youtube-rolls-out-community-notes-pilot-program-to-select-users/,"It looks like YouTube has begun introducing its community notes feature to a select group of users. Recently, screenshots of the invitation of YouTube to join the pilot program for this new community notes feature have started appearing across social media platforms.

YouTube first announced its community notes feature in June. This innovative addition allows users to submit brief notes that provide additional context or correct information on specific video content. The rollout of the community notes feature comes at a critical time, just ahead of the US presidential election.

While there is no official start date for the new feature, YouTube has already added a section to its Help database, offering instructions on how to write and submit notes. This shows the company’s commitment to ensuring users understand how to effectively use the new tool.

YouTube Rolls Out Community Notes Pilot Program to Select Users

The pilot program is currently available only in English and only on mobile devices within the United States. According to the support page, YouTube had previously mentioned that it has sent the invitations via email or through users’ Creator Studios accounts. This select group of users will provide valuable feedback to YouTube, helping the platform determine which notes are considered “helpful,” “somewhat helpful,” or “unhelpful.” This feedback process is crucial for refining the feature before it becomes available to the broader public, as noted in YouTube’s official blog.

The community notes feature will enhance the accuracy of information on the platform by allowing users to correct or add context to videos. This is particularly important in the current digital age, where misinformation can spread rapidly. By enabling users to participate in this correction process, YouTube also aims to create a more informed and reliable space for video content.

Participants in the pilot program play a significant role in shaping the future of this feature. Their feedback will help YouTube fine-tune the system, ensuring that it effectively identifies and highlights the most useful notes. This collaborative approach underscores YouTube’s dedication to community involvement and its proactive stance in combating misinformation.

"OnePlus Open is up to $400 off for all models, free mechanical keyboard too.",https://9to5google.com/2024/08/08/oneplus-open-apex-edition-launch-discount/,"Alongside the launch of its new “Apex Edition,” the OnePlus Open is getting a handful of discounts that include a starting price of $1,299.

Available today, the OnePlus Open “Apex Edition” is an upgraded version of one of the best foldables on the market. Taking the foundation laid in 2023, “Apex Edition” has twice the storage, a new “VIP Mode” that shuts down the mic and camera using the Alert Slider, and has a truly gorgeous deep red colorway. The device acts as a reminder of how far ahead of its competition, at least in North America, OnePlus was in 2023, even as Samsung and Google launch new options this year.

That upgraded device comes with a $200 premium, costing $1,899. Notably, that’s the same price Samsung charges for the Galaxy Z Fold 6, but in its 256GB variant. The limited edition 1TB device is also available with a steep launch discount.

At OnePlus.com, you can get the OnePlus Open “Apex Edition” for $1,599 using the coupon code “1TBFORLIFE” at checkout. From there, you can also do a trade-in which offers a bare minimum of $100 for any device in any condition.

If you don’t want this new top-end option, the regular OnePlus Open is also available at a discount to celebrate.

Through August 30, the OnePlus Open’s black and green variants with 512GB of storage will be available for $1,399, down from the usual $1,699 price. You can also get another $100 off, at least, with any device trade-in, regardless of condition or model, taking the starting price down to $1,299.

Any OnePlus Open purchase made through the end of the month will also come with a free pair of OnePlus Buds Pro 2 which usually sell for $179. Alternatively, you can also get the OnePlus Keyboard 81 Pro, a big and fancy mechanical keyboard, for free with the purchase.

These offers are only available through OnePlus.com.

This all comes as OnePlus is rumored to not have an Open sequel in the works for release in 2024, with the device instead set to arrive sometime next year.

What do you think of the “Apex Edition” of the OnePlus Open?
