The report comes amid rumors about a trade to the Pittsburgh Steelers, though NFL insider Jordan Schultz reported Monday that there was no deal in place.The San Francisco 49ers and wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk don't appear to be remotely close to reaching an agreement on a long-term contract.

"Daniel Jones explains involvement in the Lions-Giants joint-practice scuffle: 'You know, you know, you know.'","The New York Giants and Detroit Lions had a fight-filled day at a joint practice Monday. Quarterback Daniel Jones shoved Lions defensive lineman Alim McNeill in the back to spark a scrum. Jones was pulled out of the skirmish for which he supplied the lighter fluid by a team employee. Giants and Lions have gotten into multiple fights, most of which have been caught on camera by members of the media or fans attending the open practice. It might be time to separate these two teams and put every individual player in timeout. Neither team can afford for any player to miss time from something as dumb as a training camp fight.The New York Giants and the Detroit Lions had several scuffles during their joint practice on Monday. A multitude of separate instances where large groups of players were seen shoving one another and punches were even thrown between both teams. Giants starting quarterback Daniel Jones was involved in one of the skirmishes, a sight that organizations and fans alike especially never want to see at practice. The two teams will be able to square off for all to see in a preseason matchup on Thursday at MetLife Stadium. The Giants won the 7-on-7 period against Detroit’s first-team defense. Will focus more on the offense on Tuesday.","['https://www.nfl.com/news/daniel-jones-explains-involvement-in-lions-giants-joint-practice-scuffle-you-try-to-stand-up-for-guys', 'https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/40739056/daniel-jones-incites-scuffle-chippy-giants-lions-practice', 'https://www.mlive.com/sports/2024/08/camp-observations-lions-dont-take-no-expletive-in-fight-filled-practice.html', 'https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/multiple-fights-break-out-at-giants-lions-joint-training-camp-qb-daniel-jones-pulled-out-of-fray-video-170353786.html', 'https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/multiple-fights-break-out-at-giants-lions-joint-training-camp-qb-daniel-jones-pulled-out-of-fray-170353428.html', 'https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5682391/2024/08/05/lions-giants-joint-practice-gets-chippy-plus-a-day-following-the-defense/', 'https://www.on3.com/pro/news/quarterback-daniel-jones-general-manager-joe-schoen-involved-new-york-giants-detroit-lions-training-camp-fight/']"

"Imane Khelif, Olympic boxer at center of gender dispute, calls for a gender equality debate.","Algerian boxer Imane Khelif has secured herself an Olympic medal in the women's 66kg category at the Paris Olympics. She is the first woman from her country to achieve this milestone and secured Algeria's first boxing medal since 2000. Her victory has been overshadowed by a gender eligibility debate that has sparked controversy and online abuse. She and Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-Ting have found themselves at the center of aGender eligibility debate due to differing eligibility criteria set by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Both athletes were disqualified from last year's World Championships by the IBA following unspecified eligibility tests for women's competition. The testing was deemed flawed and unacceptable by the IOC. The IOC spokesman Mark Adams vehemently defended the athletes, emphasizing that acting on mere suspicions without concrete evidence sets a dangerous precedent. Their resolve displays a larger trend of athletes stepping forward amid adversity to defend their rights but to ensure equality in sports.","['https://time.com/7008028/iba-boxing-gender-controversy-paris-olympics/', 'https://www.crosswalk.com/slideshows/5-key-questions-and-answers-about-the-olympic-boxing-gender-controversy.html', 'https://www.nationalreview.com/news/we-need-to-protect-womens-sports-international-boxing-association-defends-sex-disqualifications/', 'https://nz.news.yahoo.com/boston-globe-apologizes-headline-error-153134361.html', 'https://www.thehindu.com/podcast/imane-khelif-and-the-gender-controversy/article68488066.ece', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/08/03/olympics-boxing-imane-khelif-woman/', 'https://www.telegraph.co.uk/olympics/2024/08/05/imane-khelif-iba-explain-olympics-gender-row-boxer-live/', 'https://www.themirror.com/sport/boxing/imane-khelif-boxing-olympics-gender-629403', 'https://www.inkl.com/news/watch-live-international-boxing-association-holds-press-conference-amidst-paris-olympics-gender-debate', 'https://sports.yahoo.com/olympic-boxer-imane-khelif-calls-234741056.html', 'https://www.irishmirror.ie/sport/other-sport/boxing/who-imane-khelif-you-need-33398715', 'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/paris-olympics-boxer-imane-khelif-wants-an-end-to-bullying-backlash-over-gender-misconceptions/articleshow/112276020.cms', 'https://www.ibtimes.co.in/algerian-boxer-khelif-makes-historic-win-amid-gender-eligibility-debate-870838', 'https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-imane-khelif-lin-yuting-boxing-13e9529195585404c7b03c96f97dd634', 'https://evrimagaci.org/tpg/olympics-spotlight-on-gender-identity-sparks-debate-5250', 'https://www.thehindu.com/sport/olympics/paris-olympics-boxing-taiwans-lin-yu-ting-beats-svetlana-staneva-to-ensure-medal-amid-gender-debate/article68484810.ece', 'https://www.inkl.com/news/olympics-organizers-denounce-flawed-testing-of-boxers', 'https://www.outsports.com/2024/8/5/24099541/imane-khelif-bullying-paris-olympics-boxing-ap-medal/', 'https://nz.news.yahoo.com/boxer-beat-imane-khelif-2022-111510585.html', 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com/iba-controversial-boxing-authority-locked-113911693.html', 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com/paris-2024-olympics-second-boxer-122900973.html', 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com/imane-khelif-failed-gender-eligibility-140255915.html', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/other/olympic-boxer-imane-khelif-says-she-s-victim-in-gender-scandal-as-she-issues-warning/ar-AA1oeIZO', 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com/dsd-condition-heart-imane-khelif-124528709.html', 'https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1147483/olympic-boxer-imane-khelif-calls-for-end']"
