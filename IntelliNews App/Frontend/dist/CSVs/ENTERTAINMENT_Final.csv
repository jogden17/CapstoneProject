Ben Affleck is holding back on filing for divorce to ‘protect her’.,"The couple have stopped talking altogether - making it even more difficult for the pair to reach an agreement. Lopez and Affleck rekindled their relationship in July 2021, following Lopez’s split from her former fiancé, Alex Rodriguez, in April 2021. The pair eloped in Las Vegas in July 2022, and had another wedding celebration at Affleck's home in Riceboro, Georgia, the next month. The couple finalized the divorce papers with her a month ago, but are waiting for the right time to drop them. A body language expert previously revealed that Ben and Jennifer appeared to be 'unhappy' and no longer have a 'look of love' in their eyes.
