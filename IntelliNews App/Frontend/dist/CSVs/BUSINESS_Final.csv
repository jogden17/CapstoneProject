"Google's antitrust loss could put billions at risk for Apple, Yahoo Finance says.","District of Columbia's Judge Amit Mehta ruled in favor of the Department of Justice in its antitrust suit against the tech giant. The ruling could force Google to make dramatic changes to its largest business, but it could also force the company to cancel a long-term revenue-sharing agreement with Apple. The deal, called an Information Services Agreement, has been in place since 2002 and has been adjusted over the years as new technologies, such as the iPhone, have been introduced. Apple doesn't reveal exactly how much it makes from the deal, but court documents pegged the number at an estimated $20 billion in 2022.Shares in several major technology companies plunged Monday morning amid a wider sell-off in the market. Tesla opened 10 9 percent down, while Apple slid 9 6 percent, and Amazon fell 8 2 percent at the start of trading. Microsoft saw the least volatility out of the major tech stocks, falling 4 8 percent at market open Monday. The tech stocks’ steep slide Monday morning came as the wider market took a downturn amid growing concerns about a recession.

X is closing San Francisco HQ and relocating staffers to San Jose and 'shared space'.,"X CEO Linda Yaccarino said the office closure will occur ‘over the next few weeks’ She described the decision as ‘the right one for our company in the long term’ X’s departure from San Francisco represents a symbolic blow to the city, which has seen an exodus of tech firms from its once busy downtown area.

CrowdStrike says it isn't to blame for Delta's flight cancellations after July.,"CrowdStrike shares have lost more than 36% of their value since the outages affected millions of computers. Delta canceled more than 5,000 flights between the July 19 outage, caused by a botched software update, through July 25. CrowdStrike claims it offered Delta assistance several times only to be rebuffed. The cybersecurity firm says Delta's lawsuit is 'meritless' and would prefer to work cooperatively with Delta to find a solution. Delta CEO Ed Bastian said last week the company had ""no choice"" but to seek damages for the losses incurred. Delta is now under investigation by the U S Department of Transportation's Office of Aviation Consumer Protection. The airline canceled more flights last month than they did in 2018 and 2019. Ryanair said it flew 20 2 million passengers in July, an 8% jump on the 18 7 million people on its flights the same time last year.","['https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/05/crowdstrike-says-it-isnt-to-blame-for-deltas-flight-cancellations-after-outage.html', 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/crowdstrike-calls-out-delta-air-lines-for-misleading-narrative-on-outage/', 'https://www.aol.com/news/crowdstrike-says-isnt-blame-deltas-170312739.html', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/crowdstrike-says-delta-only-has-itself-to-blame/ar-AA1ohy0y?ocid', 'https://www.engadget.com/transportation/crowdstrike-says-deltas-woes-arent-its-fault-after-massive-it-outage-181803828.html', 'https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/crowdstrike-lashes-out-at-delta', 'https://viewfromthewing.com/deltas-lawsuit-against-crowdstrike-could-backfire-revealing-it-failures-and-damaging-premium-image/', 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com/ryanair-cancels-650-flights-boss-094415040.html', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/crowdstrike-is-denying-deltas-claims-it-was-to-blame-for-thousands-of-flight-disruptions/ar-AA1ofIXp', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/travel/news/crowdstrike-rejects-delta-s-claim-it-acted-inappropriately-after-it-outage/ar-AA1ofk2U?ocid', 'https://nonstop-news.com/world/crowdstrike-denies-responsibility-for-deltas-july-flight-cancellations/']"
