Fossil discovery in Greenland ice sheet reveals increased risk of sea level rise.,"Greenland has melted before, and as the climate warms, it will melt again, scientists say. Greenland ice melt will raise sea levels by nearly a foot, study says. The findings were shared in a new paper published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The researchers examined sediment from the bottom of an ice core extracted from two miles below the surface at the center of the ice sheet nearly 30 years ago. They found an insect eye, an Arctic poppy seed, parts of an Arctic willow, and bits of soil fungus and spike moss. Greenland's melting ice mass is now the No  1 driver of sea level rise, according to Bierman. Hundreds of millions of people could lose their homes and businesses if the entire Greenland mass melts. The findings supports what's called the ""fragile Greenland"" hypothesis: that nature, outside of human influence, has caused the ice sheet to melt at least once since it formed. The consequences would be dire: Places we hold near and dear to our hearts would be lost, Bier man said.""As I like to say when people ask me, why does it matter? I say think about your favorite beach""","['https://www.cbsnews.com/news/greenland-ice-sheet-fossils-sea-level-rise/', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/weather/topstories/fossil-found-in-greenland-ice-sheet-reveals-increased-risk-of-sea-level-rise/ar-AA1ohCiN', 'https://www.mcduffieprogress.com/news/national/greenland-fossils-reveal-greater-sea-level-threat-from-climate-change/article_d1b3b5ae-5323-5e0a-a26f-2f88749a438e.html', 'https://www.khq.com/national/greenland-fossils-reveal-greater-sea-level-threat-from-climate-change/article_1ab1cc21-0279-5548-a66d-47dd56297461.html', 'https://www.eurekalert.org/multimedia/1036621']"
Perseid meteor shower 2024 peaks this weekend.,"Perseid meteor shower should reach its peak during the overnight hours of late Sunday night into early Monday morning (Aug  11-12) There is almost no moon, making the late-night sky nice and dark for shooting star spectators and counters. meteors should flash across all parts of the sky at a rate of about one every minute or two (as seen by a single observer) The Perseids are the ionization trails made by little bits of debris from comet 109/P Swift-Tuttle, streaking into Earth's upper atmosphere at 37 miles (60 km) per second.The annual Perseid meteor shower has started to put on its annual show and will soon be peaking. The best time to watch for Perseids will be starting around midnight (when the moon will be setting) until dawn. During the peak, observers can typically see 50 to 75 meteors every hour, or roughly one meteor per minute. The Perseids run from July 14 to Sept 1, with its peak hitting on the weekend of Aug  11-12. The next meteor shower will be the Orionids, which are a medium- strength shower set to peak Oct  20. Watch for Orionid meteors on the mornings of Oct 20 and 21, right after midnight and before dawn.","['https://www.space.com/perseid-meteor-shower-2024-peak', 'https://www.livescience.com/space/meteoroids/the-perseid-meteor-shower-is-about-to-peak-heres-when-to-see-the-most-shooting-stars', 'https://www.lonestarlive.com/news/2024/08/perseid-meteor-shower-2024-peak-when-is-it-and-how-to-get-the-best-view.html', 'https://www.space.com/venus-earthshine-perseid-meteor-shower-peak-night-sky-this-week', 'https://www.independent.co.uk/space/meteor-shower-uk-2024-perseid-full-moon-b2591147.html', 'https://1440wrok.com/illinois-sees-the-perseid-meteor-showers-this-weekend/', 'https://kawarthanow.com/2024/08/05/this-years-perseid-meteor-shower-peaks-on-august-11-and-12/', 'https://avltoday.6amcity.com/culture/perseid-meteor-shower-peak-2024', 'https://www.mlive.com/life/2024/08/join-fellow-stargazers-for-meteors-and-smores-at-free-beachside-astronomy-event.html', 'https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/aug/05/starwatch-perseids-to-peak-in-dazzling-shower-mid-month', 'https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/us/meteor-shower-know-when-and-how-to-see-the-perseids-at-their-best/articleshow/112296598.cms', 'https://www.lehighvalleylive.com/outdoors/2024/08/perseid-meteor-shower-of-2024-to-light-up-the-night-sky-when-to-see-it.html?outputType', 'https://denvergazette.com/outtherecolorado/news/up-to-100-meteors-an-hour-to-fly-above-colorado-as-best-show-of-year/article_7d949dac-5346-11ef-bcab-6b84b9ddb98f.html', 'https://www.inkl.com/news/want-to-watch-the-perseids-meteor-shower-this-week-these-are-the-most-spectacular-dark-sky-places-to-view-it-from', 'https://www.sanmarcosrecord.com/features/annual-perseid-meteor-shower-takes-skies-august-10-12', 'https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/other/meteor-shower-know-when-and-how-to-see-the-perseids-at-their-best/ar-AA1ogXEX?ocid']"
Scientists want to safeguard Earth’s species by cryogenically preserving them on the planet.,"Scientists at the Smithsonian have devised a plan to safeguard Earth’s species in a cryogenic biorepository on the moon. The plan makes use of craters that are permanently in shadow and therefore cold enough to allow cryogenic preservation of biological material without using electricity or liquid nitrogen. The idea is inspired by the Global Seed Vault in Svalbard, Norway, which stores more than a million seed varieties. The vault was threatened by a flood of meltwater from thawing permafrost in 2017, highlighting the dangers posed by climate change.""We aren’t saying what if the Earth fails,” Hagedorn said in the statement. “This biorepository provides another, parallel approach to conserving Earth’s precious biodiversity,’ she said. ‘How many forests, coral reefs and freshwater lakes could be better conserved right now, for the cost of launching a rocket to the moon?’ ‘I am hard-pressed to see its use in the urgent fight to minimise rapid biodiversity loss,' said Sally Keith, senior lecturer in Marine Biology at Lancaster University.","['https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/05/science/cryogenic-repository-moon-scli-intl/index.html', 'https://fremonttribune.com/news/nation-world/science/these-scientists-want-to-safeguard-earth-s-species-by-cryogenically-preserving-them-on-the-moon/image_4eef3a0f-4c35-562d-8118-2fc7690c26ec.html', 'https://mtstandard.com/these-scientists-want-to-safeguard-earth-s-species-by-cryogenically-preserving-them-on-the-moon/image_b74abc97-a906-5d50-82e9-9b2278842f18.html', 'https://wcfcourier.com/these-scientists-want-to-safeguard-earth-s-species-by-cryogenically-preserving-them-on-the-moon/image_e69bd5bf-cdd9-59b8-ae04-cea60e522cad.html', 'https://herald-review.com/news/nation-world/science/these-scientists-want-to-safeguard-earth-s-species-by-cryogenically-preserving-them-on-the-moon/image_7758e398-6e66-5fb1-ad6c-7d43167e412b.html', 'https://mtstandard.com/these-scientists-want-to-safeguard-earth-s-species-by-cryogenically-preserving-them-on-the-moon/image_70f7f55e-6c7b-52c2-916d-25321ce01157.html', 'https://herald-review.com/news/nation-world/science/these-scientists-want-to-safeguard-earth-s-species-by-cryogenically-preserving-them-on-the-moon/image_1d9e964e-8407-5e21-8696-248d19b1de28.html']"
NASA made a World-Shaking Discovery: Compelling Evidence of Past Life on Mars.,"NASA's Perseverance rover has uncovered potential signs of ancient life on Mars. Discovery prompts renewed interest and concerns over climate change and technology's impact on society. The rover's exploration could help reveal critical clues about past life forms and the planet's climatic conditions over millennia. Scientists are now racing to analyze these samples back on Earth, which could help corroborate the findings of ancient microbial activity. The detection of organic compounds is particularly exciting, as these are the building blocks of life as we know it. The geological chemistry of Cheyava Falls is possibly our best clue yet that Mars once hosted life.Perseid meteor shower expected to peak on night of 11 August. Up to 100 'shooting stars' will appear each hour until dawn. Best time to see them will be the pre-dawn hours before sunrise. The biggest meteor shower of the year is set to peak this month, just days before the first supermoon of 2024. The actor rose to fame in 2006 for playing teen Troy Bolton in the High School Musical trilogy. He has also appeared in comedy film 17 Again, The Greatest Showman and played Ted Bundy in Netflix's crime drama Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile.","['https://www.yahoo.com/news/nasa-made-world-shaking-discovery-120000819.html', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/elon-musk-s-platform-x-halts-white-dudes-for-harris-fundraising-account-after-it-raises-4-million/ss-AA1ofGeA', 'https://evrimagaci.org/tpg/nasa-discovers-potential-signs-of-life-on-mars-6296', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nfl/ranking-the-top-10-wide-receivers-for-the-2024-nfl-season/ss-AA1ogS8E', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/movies/other/oscar-winning-drama-with-near-perfect-rotten-tomatoes-score-joins-netflix/ss-AA1ofMjJ', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/see-inside-the-first-private-jet-version-of-the-boeing-737-max-the-extravagant-plane-is-worth-over-100-million-and-has-a-bar-two-bedrooms-and-huge-showers/ss-AA1ocUbY', 'https://www.aol.com/efron-happy-healthy-swimming-incident-084442699.html', 'https://ca.news.yahoo.com/leopard-spotted-rock-may-sign-201138455.html', 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com/greenland-fossils-reveal-greater-sea-192719005.html', 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com/biggest-meteor-shower-2024-peak-133745484.html', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/scientists-discover-huge-crystal-filled-dinosaur-eggs-belonging-to-a-new-species/ss-AA1oehZn', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/future-of-work-remote-hybrid-or-back-to-the-office/ss-AA1ofWhV?ocid', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/realestate/the-best-small-town-for-retirees-in-your-state-plus-see-the-top-pick-for-all-50-states/ss-AA1ocQSt', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/news/20-real-reasons-why-millions-of-americans-still-refuse-to-buy-electric-cars/ss-AA1ocS4W']"
