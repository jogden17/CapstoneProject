Brandon Aiyuk is more likely to be traded than sign an extension with the 49ers.,"The San Francisco 49ers and wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk are reportedly far from reaching a long-term contract agreement. As a result, Aiyuk is more likely to be traded than signed to a new deal. Multiple teams, including the Cleveland Browns, New England Patriots, and Pittsburgh Steelers, are said to be in play for the 26-year-old wideout. The 49ers had previously exercised Aiyuk's fifth-year option, which will pay him $14.1 million in 2024, but this is below the market value for top receivers.

The Steelers, who have a logjam at the receiver position, are one of the teams reportedly interested in Aiyuk. However, they currently do not have a clear No. 2 option next to George Pickens. The 49ers had prepared for the possibility of trading Aiyuk by drafting Ricky Pearsall in the first round of the 2024 NFL draft. While no deal is in place yet, it is expected that a decision will be made soon. Aiyuk's market value is estimated to be around $26.2 million per year, according to Spotrac.","['https://www.nfl.com/news/brandon-aiyuk-more-likely-to-be-traded-than-sign-extension-with-49ers-no-trade-in-place', 'https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/brandon-aiyuk-trade-demand-49ers-wr-more-likely-to-be-dealt-than-get-extension-from-san-francisco-per-report/', 'https://www.si.com/nfl/49ers/news/49ers-would-be-foolish-to-trade-brandon-aiyuk-01j4jdt0p0y8', 'https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10130881-nfl-rumors-brandon-aiyuk-trade-not-in-place-between-steelers-49ers-despite-buzz', 'https://www.49erswebzone.com/articles/182407-report-49ers-multiple-permission-brandon/', 'https://www.on3.com/pro/news/49ers-more-likely-to-trade-brandon-aiyuk-than-sign-wide-receiver-to-extension/', 'https://clutchpoints.com/nfl-rumors-brandon-aiyuk-more-likely-to-be-traded-than-sign-extension-with-49ers', 'https://www.ninersnation.com/2024/8/5/24214130/49ers-brandon-aiyuk-trade-extension-steelers-training-camp-trent-williams', 'https://www.thescore.com/news/3049333', 'https://www.pennlive.com/steelers/2024/08/what-is-the-latest-on-the-steelers-brandon-aiyuk-trade-rumors.html', 'https://nfltraderumors.co/latest-on-brandon-aiyuk-trade-rumors/', 'https://www.audacy.com/957thegame/sports/san-francisco-49-ers/brandon-aiyuk-more-likely-to-be-traded-than-extended', 'https://www.si.com/nfl/49ers/news/is-it-time-to-panic-on-brandon-aiyuk-remaining-with-the-49ers-01j4jcp757db', 'https://www.49erswebzone.com/articles/182404-nfl-insider-brandon-currently-steelers/', 'https://clutchpoints.com/nfl-rumors-expert-floats-brandon-aiyuk-davante-admas-trade-49ers-raiders', 'https://www.steelernation.com/2024/08/04/steelers-strike-likely-49ers-brandon-aiyuk', 'https://fansided.com/posts/latest-brandon-aiyuk-rumors-could-be-blessing-and-curse-for-steelers']"

Biles' silver medal in the floor exercise was her second silver of the games, adding to her seven Olympic gold medals. She has not ruled out competing in the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, despite joking that she's ""getting really old.""

Harbaugh 'was not aware' of any U-M violations.,"University of Michigan football coach Jim Harbaugh has been accused of committing a Level 1 violation, the most serious category in the NCAA's enforcement process. This charge stems from allegations of ""unethical or dishonest conduct and a failure to cooperate"" with investigators. As a result, Harbaugh could face a ""show-cause"" restriction if he ever returns to college sports. 

The allegations are connected to a sign-stealing scandal involving former staffer Connor Stalions, who reportedly led interns and at least one other full-time team employee to believe that the scheme was not against the rules. The NCAA alleges that Stalions purchased tickets to multiple games involving future Michigan opponents from 2021-2023. Current Michigan staff member Sherryrone Moore is also accused of deleting numerous text messages with Stalions. The school faces a Level 1 violation charge for a ""pattern of noncompliance within the football program"" and institutional efforts to hinder the NCAA's investigation.","['https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/40738044/jim-harbaugh-denies-wrongdoing-amid-michigan-allegations', 'https://www.ocregister.com/2024/08/05/chargers-coach-jim-harbaugh-unaware-of-violations-at-michigan/', 'https://www.detroitnews.com/story/sports/college/university-michigan/2024/08/05/i-do-not-apologize-harbaugh-denies-knowing-about-um-sign-stealing-scheme/74681493007/', 'https://www.si.com/fannation/college/cfb-hq/news/jim-harbaugh-reacts-michigan-football-violations-report', 'https://www.mlive.com/wolverines/2024/08/jim-harbaugh-responds-to-alleged-michigan-violations-i-do-not-apologize.html', 'https://www.detroitnews.com/story/sports/college/university-michigan/2024/08/04/michigan-wolverines-coach-sherrone-moore-face-punishment-ncaa-sign-stealing-investigation/74665636007/', 'https://thebharatexpressnews.com/jim-harbaugh-again-denies-knowledge-of-michigan-sign-theft-scheme-i-make-no-apologies/']"

Harrison Butker of the Kansas City Chiefs is reportedly becoming the highest paid NFL kicker.,"Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker has agreed to a four-year contract extension worth $25.6 million, with $17.75 million guaranteed. Butker, 29, announced the deal on social media but did not provide further details. According to reports, he represented himself in negotiations. Butker has made 89% of his field goal attempts in his seven-year career, the second-best percentage in NFL history. His longest kick was a 62-yarder in the 2022 season.

"Daniel Jones explains involvement in the Lions-Giants joint-practice scuffle: 'You know, you know, you know.'","A joint practice between the New York Giants and Detroit Lions on Monday was marked by several fights and scuffles between players. The tensions began early, with Giants quarterback Daniel Jones shoving Lions defensive lineman Alim McNeill in the back, sparking a skirmish. Jones was quickly pulled out of the fray by a team employee. The Giants' defense also got into a melee with Lions receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown, which involved punches being thrown.

The fights were not limited to these two incidents, with multiple groups of players shoving each other throughout the practice. Despite the tensions, the Giants' offense had some bright spots, winning the 7-on-7 period against the Lions' first-team defense. Giants backup quarterback Drew Lock was sacked by Lions player Morice Norris, who is having a strong camp. The teams will face each other again in a preseason matchup on Thursday at MetLife Stadium.","['https://www.nfl.com/news/daniel-jones-explains-involvement-in-lions-giants-joint-practice-scuffle-you-try-to-stand-up-for-guys', 'https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/40739056/daniel-jones-incites-scuffle-chippy-giants-lions-practice', 'https://www.mlive.com/sports/2024/08/camp-observations-lions-dont-take-no-expletive-in-fight-filled-practice.html', 'https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/multiple-fights-break-out-at-giants-lions-joint-training-camp-qb-daniel-jones-pulled-out-of-fray-video-170353786.html', 'https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/multiple-fights-break-out-at-giants-lions-joint-training-camp-qb-daniel-jones-pulled-out-of-fray-170353428.html', 'https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5682391/2024/08/05/lions-giants-joint-practice-gets-chippy-plus-a-day-following-the-defense/', 'https://www.on3.com/pro/news/quarterback-daniel-jones-general-manager-joe-schoen-involved-new-york-giants-detroit-lions-training-camp-fight/']"

"Imane Khelif, Olympic boxer at center of gender dispute, calls for a gender equality debate.","

The International Boxing Association (IBA) has been at the center of controversy at the Paris Olympics, with its claims about the eligibility of two female boxers sparking outrage. Imane Khelif of Algeria and Lin Yu-Ting of Chinese Taipei have been the subject of unsubstantiated claims about their gender, which have led to online abuse. Despite this, both women have secured Olympic medals in the women's boxing category.

The IBA had claimed that the pair had failed eligibility tests, but the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has defended the athletes, saying that the testing was flawed and unacceptable. IOC spokesman Mark Adams emphasized that acting on mere suspicions without concrete evidence sets a dangerous precedent. Khelif, 25, has become the first woman from Algeria to win an Olympic medal in boxing, and her victory has been overshadowed by the controversy. The IOC withdrew recognition of the IBA in 2023 over concerns, and the organization's claims have been widely criticized.","['https://time.com/7008028/iba-boxing-gender-controversy-paris-olympics/', 'https://www.crosswalk.com/slideshows/5-key-questions-and-answers-about-the-olympic-boxing-gender-controversy.html', 'https://www.nationalreview.com/news/we-need-to-protect-womens-sports-international-boxing-association-defends-sex-disqualifications/', 'https://nz.news.yahoo.com/boston-globe-apologizes-headline-error-153134361.html', 'https://www.thehindu.com/podcast/imane-khelif-and-the-gender-controversy/article68488066.ece', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/08/03/olympics-boxing-imane-khelif-woman/', 'https://www.telegraph.co.uk/olympics/2024/08/05/imane-khelif-iba-explain-olympics-gender-row-boxer-live/', 'https://www.themirror.com/sport/boxing/imane-khelif-boxing-olympics-gender-629403', 'https://www.inkl.com/news/watch-live-international-boxing-association-holds-press-conference-amidst-paris-olympics-gender-debate', 'https://sports.yahoo.com/olympic-boxer-imane-khelif-calls-234741056.html', 'https://www.irishmirror.ie/sport/other-sport/boxing/who-imane-khelif-you-need-33398715', 'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/paris-olympics-boxer-imane-khelif-wants-an-end-to-bullying-backlash-over-gender-misconceptions/articleshow/112276020.cms', 'https://www.ibtimes.co.in/algerian-boxer-khelif-makes-historic-win-amid-gender-eligibility-debate-870838', 'https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-imane-khelif-lin-yuting-boxing-13e9529195585404c7b03c96f97dd634', 'https://evrimagaci.org/tpg/olympics-spotlight-on-gender-identity-sparks-debate-5250', 'https://www.thehindu.com/sport/olympics/paris-olympics-boxing-taiwans-lin-yu-ting-beats-svetlana-staneva-to-ensure-medal-amid-gender-debate/article68484810.ece', 'https://www.inkl.com/news/olympics-organizers-denounce-flawed-testing-of-boxers', 'https://www.outsports.com/2024/8/5/24099541/imane-khelif-bullying-paris-olympics-boxing-ap-medal/', 'https://nz.news.yahoo.com/boxer-beat-imane-khelif-2022-111510585.html', 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com/iba-controversial-boxing-authority-locked-113911693.html', 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com/paris-2024-olympics-second-boxer-122900973.html', 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com/imane-khelif-failed-gender-eligibility-140255915.html', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/other/olympic-boxer-imane-khelif-says-she-s-victim-in-gender-scandal-as-she-issues-warning/ar-AA1oeIZO', 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com/dsd-condition-heart-imane-khelif-124528709.html', 'https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1147483/olympic-boxer-imane-khelif-calls-for-end']"
