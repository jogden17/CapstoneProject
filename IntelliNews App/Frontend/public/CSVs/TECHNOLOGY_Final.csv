OpenAI has built a text watermarking method to detect ChatGPT-written text.,"OpenAI, the creators of ChatGPT, has developed a tool that can detect text generated by the chatbot, but is hesitant to release it due to concerns about its potential impact. The tool works by subtly modifying word selection during the writing process, creating a hidden signature that can be detected later. According to the company, the method is 99.9% effective and resistant to tampering. However, if the text is reworded using another model, it becomes easy to circumvent the detection.

A survey conducted by OpenAI found that about a third of ChatGPT users would stop using the chatbot if the anti-cheating measures were implemented, while almost 30% said they would use it less often. The company is also concerned that the tool could stigmatize the use of AI as a writing tool for non-native English speakers. OpenAI has previously shut down an AI classifier tool due to its low accuracy rate. The issue of AI-generated text has become increasingly relevant, with a recent report finding that approximately 17% of students at St. Mary's are using AI to complete their homework.","['https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/openai-has-built-a-text-watermarking-method-to-detect-chatgpt-written-content-company-has-mulled-its-release-over-the-past-year', 'https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/04/openai-says-its-taking-a-deliberate-approach-to-releasing-tools-that-can-detect-writing-from-chatgpt/', 'https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/4/24213268/openai-chatgpt-text-watermark-cheat-detection-tool', 'https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/why-openais-ai-detection-tool-may-stay-under-wraps/article68487262.ece', 'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/openai-has-created-a-tool-to-detect-and-mark-ai-generated-writing-but-may-not-release-it-anytime-soon/articleshow/112281510.cms', 'https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/other/openai-has-created-a-tool-to-detect-and-mark-ai-generated-writing-but-may-not-release-it-anytime-soon/ar-AA1oeWN7', 'https://bgr.com/tech/openai-has-a-tool-that-can-tell-if-you-use-chatgpt-to-cheat-but-it-wont-release-it/', 'https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-built-system-identify-text-154628635.html', 'https://www.techspot.com/news/104120-openai-confirms-has-reliable-tool-detecting-chatgpt-generated.html', 'https://gigazine.net/gsc_news/en/20240805-openai-develop-detect-writing-chatgpt-tool/']"

The lineup is set to include the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, and iPhone 16 Pro models.

In addition to the iPhone 16 series, Apple is also expected to release new Apple Watch models, including the Apple Watch Series 10, which is rumored to be thinner than its predecessors and feature a larger 2-inch display.

As with previous beta versions, testers can expect performance and stability issues when running the iOS 18 beta on primary devices.","['https://9to5mac.com/2024/08/05/ios-18-photos-app-changes/', 'https://9to5mac.com/2024/08/05/ios-18-beta-5-new-features/', 'https://9to5mac.com/2024/08/05/ios-18-beta-5-now-available/', 'https://www.engadget.com/apples-latest-ios-18-beta-walks-back-some-changes-to-the-redesigned-photos-app-180145232.html', 'https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/08/05/photos-gets-off-the-carousel-in-fifth-ios-18-developer-beta', 'https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/ios-18-beta-5-photos-app/']"
Google pulls its pro-AI “Dear Sydney” ad after backlash.,"Google has removed its ""Dear Sydney"" ad from circulation following a public backlash. The ad featured a father using Google's AI assistant to help his daughter write a letter to Olympic athlete Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, rather than crafting a personalized message. Many viewers felt this approach undermined the authenticity and emotional connection that should come with such personal communications.

The controversy surrounding the ad reflects broader debates about the role of AI in creative processes and its potential impact on human expression. Critics argue that ads like this one risk presenting a future where creativity is limited by algorithms, rather than enhanced by technology. This is not the first time a tech company has faced backlash over an ad's message. In May, Apple pulled its ""Crush"" ad after viewers interpreted its message as destructive to human creativity.","['https://www.redsharknews.com/another-tech-giant-has-to-pull-a-pro-ai-ad-after-public-backlash', 'https://www.prdaily.com/google-pulls-ai-ad-after-backlash-from-olympics-audiences/', 'https://www.yahoo.com/tech/google-pulls-gemini-dear-sydney-184134327.html', 'https://technology.inquirer.net/136140/google-pulls-out-olympics-ai-ad-following-backlash', 'https://www.business-standard.com/technology/tech-news/ai-in-olympics-ad-sparks-creative-debate-google-hits-the-delete-button-124080500456_1.html', 'https://www.digit.in/news/general/gemini-paris-olympics-ad-faces-backlash-google-pulls-it-down-heres-what-happened.html', 'https://evrimagaci.org/tpg/google-withdraws-controversial-ai-ad-amid-public-outcry-5561', 'https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/wells-fargo-fires-mouse-jigglers-170651161.html', 'https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/sphera-wins-two-business-intelligence-131500393.html', 'https://digitalmarketreports.com/news/23122/google-pulls-olympics-ad-ai-fan-letter/']"
The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is full of references to other Zelda games.,"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is set to release on Nintendo Switch on September 26. This latest installment in the Zelda series marks a departure from tradition, as Princess Zelda takes center stage as the primary playable protagonist. The game's world is filled with familiar locations, albeit with new names, such as Eldin Volcano, which replaces the classic Death Mountain. Players will also encounter two different types of Zora, a feature not seen since Oracle of Ages.

In Echoes of Wisdom, Zelda is equipped with a new ability called Bind, which can be used in a variety of ways. The game's main quest revolves around saving Link, but players will also have the opportunity to complete side quests in each area they explore, earning rewards and uncovering new storylines. The game's world is designed in a diorama style, similar to the remake of Link's Awakening, and features a mix of classic gameplay and new creative elements. With the help of a mysterious fairy named Tri and her scepter, Zelda can create ""echoes"" of objects to solve puzzles and defeat enemies.","['https://www.polygon.com/zelda/24213626/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-references-other-zelda-games', 'https://gizmodo.com/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-new-gameplay-trailer-details-2000483201', 'https://wccftech.com/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-receives-new-trailer/', 'https://www.sortiraparis.com/en/what-to-do-in-paris/gaming/articles/315122-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-the-new-opus-in-the-saga-is-revealed-in-a-trailer', 'https://wccftech.com/nintendo-q1-2025-report-reveals-sales-down-by-46-5/', 'https://www.ruetir.com/2024/08/05/the-new-classic-hyrule-of-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-only-needs-these-five-minutes-to-make-you-fall-in-love-or-less/']"
MacOS Sequoia beta 5 adds a new wallpaper – and you can download it.,"The latest beta releases for Apple's operating systems have brought a range of new features and updates. macOS Sequoia beta 5 introduces text effects, emoji and sticker Tapbacks, and the ability to schedule messages to be sent later.
