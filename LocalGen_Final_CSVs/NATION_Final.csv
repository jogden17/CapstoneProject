"Jenna Ellis, former Trump lawyer, will cooperate in Arizona election fraud case.","Jenna Ellis reached a cooperation agreement with Arizona prosecutors on Monday. The agreement will result in dropping the charges against her in the so-called 'fake electors' case. Prosecutors are dropping the nine felony counts that Ellis had faced in exchange for her cooperation. Ellis must testify ""completely and truthfully"" whenever requested by the Attorney General's Office and be available for interviews. Ellis pleaded guilty in October to illegally conspiring to overturn Trump’s 2020 election loss in Georgia and has been cooperating with prosecutors in Arizona. Ellis was at the right hand of former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, helping spread false claims of election fraud in Arizona and six other states. She is barred from practicing law in Colorado for three years after her guilty plea in Georgia. Ellis is one of 18 defendants in the Arizona ‘fake voters’ case stemming from the 2020 election.","['https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/us/jenna-ellis-trump-arizona-election-fraud.html', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/05/jenna-ellis-arizona/', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/former-trump-lawyer-jenna-ellis-cooperate-prosecutors-arizona-fake-ele-rcna165122', 'https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/fake-electors-case-jenna-ellis-signs-cooperation-agreement-ag', 'https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/08/05/Jenna-Ellis-cooperate-prosecution-arizona-elector-case/9031722896097/', 'https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/05/former-trump-campaign-lawyer-jenna-ellis-cooperating-with-prosecutors-in-arizona-fake-electors-case.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/05/politics/jenna-ellis-arizona-election-subversion-trump/index.html', 'https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/politics/ex-trump-attorney-jenna-ellis-to-cooperate-in-arizona-fake-electors-case-charges-to-be-dropped/3612889/', 'https://nypost.com/2024/08/05/us-news/ex-trump-lawyer-jenna-ellis-will-cooperate-with-prosecutors-in-arizona-fake-electors-case/', 'https://www.12news.com/article/news/local/arizona/trump-lawyer-jenna-ellis-will-cooperate-arizona-investigation-of-fake-electors-ag-kris-mayes/75-0bed57fb-1dd5-4d0e-b2ae-527f38e6ab4e', 'https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/05/trump-lawyer-jenna-ellis-arizona-fake-electors-deal', 'https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-attorney-jenna-ellis-arizona-fake-electors-b2591631.html', 'https://ca.news.yahoo.com/ex-trump-attorney-jenna-ellis-200558991.html', 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/state/3111473/jenna-ellis-agrees-cooperate-arizona-elector-case/', 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/former-trump-lawyer-breaks-ranks-204020351.html', 'https://newrepublic.com/post/184586/former-trump-lawyer-jenna-ellis-deal-fake-electors-case-arizona', 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13711891/Trumps-former-attorney-Jenna-Ellis-pleads-GUILTY-Arizona-fake-electors.html', 'https://san.com/media-miss/former-trump-lawyer-jenna-ellis-to-cooperate-with-prosecutors-in-arizona-fake-electors-case/', 'https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/her-insights-are-invaluable-jenna-ellis-cooperation-in-trump-fake-electors-case-could-spell-bad-news-for-rudy-giuliani/', 'https://www.aol.com/jenna-ellis-flips-help-arizona-201616794.html', 'https://www.mediaite.com/crime/just-in-former-trump-attorney-agrees-to-cooperate-with-prosecution-in-fake-electors-case/', 'https://www.newsmax.com/politics/arizona-electors-attorney/2024/08/05/id/1175354/', 'https://dailycaller.com/2024/08/05/jenna-ellis-flips-agrees-cooperate-arizona-fake-electors-case/', 'https://hillreporter.com/jenna-ellis-makes-deal-to-cooperate-in-az-fake-electors-case-commentary', 'https://thebharatexpressnews.com/in-arizonas-fake-voter-case-jenna-ellis-agrees-to-cooperate/']"
"Tropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia.","A 19-year-old man died Monday afternoon when a large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie, Georgia. The driver of a tractor trailer that broke off and dropped into a canal in Tampa, Florida, was found 40 feet below the surface. Nearly 200,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000 earlier in the day. A rare high risk, level 4 of 4, of flooding rainfall is in place Monday from northern Florida to far southern South Carolina.Tropical Storm Debby made landfall early on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over the gulf coast of Florida. The storm is expected to bring torrential rains as it continues to move north into Georgia overnight, according to the National Hurricane Center. Up to 30 inches of rainfall was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina, and into North Carolina. The cities of Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina could both be drenched with a month’s worth of rain in a single day. If the rains from Debby are as intense and widespread as implied in the strong agreement among forecast models, Debby is likely to cause damage in excess of $10 billion.","['https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-debby-flooding-storm-surge-high-winds-eb9fc50d578826784824f35ba943a6da', 'https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-08-05/hurricane-debby-makes-landfall-in-florida-and-threatens-catastrophic-flooding', 'https://www.newscentermaine.com/video/weather/severe-weather/tropical-storm-debby-hits-florida-with-floods-threat-of-record-rain-in-georgia/97-c74574a8-2e3d-4e1f-bfd0-03a5fd60fd6b', 'https://www.wataugademocrat.com/ap/national/tropical-storm-debby-hits-florida-with-floods-threat-of-record-rain-in-georgia-and-the/article_7a0ad6a8-c127-538f-9751-f49ae4b37d22.html', 'https://www.times-news.com/news/tropical-storm-debby-hits-florida-with-floods-threat-of-record-rain-in-georgia-and-the/article_8f54eccb-b700-5fee-91d6-125003ee5170.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/hurricane-debby-storm-08-05-24/index.html', 'https://fredericksburg.com/news/nation-world/tropical-storm-debby-hits-florida-with-floods-threat-of-record-rain-in-georgia-and-the/article_5d65c795-c510-57a3-ac46-ed25e0746214.html', 'https://www.bgdailynews.com/news/national/tropical-storm-debby-hits-florida-with-floods-threat-of-record-rain-in-georgia-and-the/article_17b5a408-fbc2-5f0a-8cdb-2b393dd133d8.html', 'https://journalnow.com/news/state/tropical-storm-debby-hits-florida-with-floods-threat-of-record-rain-in-georgia-and-the/article_98f6e29c-863d-565e-9d2f-4f87c64b6ce2.html', 'https://www.mynbc5.com/article/tracking-debby-august-5/61789701', 'https://www.mankatofreepress.com/news/state_national_news/the-latest-debby-blamed-for-at-least-4-deaths-in-florida-as-it-bears-down/article_e6b66103-d9b7-50f7-824c-415594db46c2.html', 'https://www.wmur.com/article/tropical-storm-debby-moves-through-gulf-toward-florida-hurricane-warnings/61784807', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/08/05/hurricane-debby-florida-storms-flooding-rain/', 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/florida-storm-live-state-put-182357696.html', 'https://www.mankatofreepress.com/news/state_national_news/the-latest-debby-blamed-for-4-deaths-in-florida-as-it-bears-down-on-georgia/article_e6b66103-d9b7-50f7-824c-415594db46c2.html', 'https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/5/hurricane-debby-hits-florida-coast-evacuations-ordered', 'https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/hurricane-debby-hits-florida-as-category-1-storm-catastrophic-flooding-possible', 'https://thetandd.com/ap/national/tropical-storm-debby-could-prove-just-as-dangerous-as-a-major-hurricane/article_e4dde067-a70a-5f29-bad8-e2caad1724ca.html', 'https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/08/hurricane-debby-hits-florida-and-thats-just-the-beginning/', 'https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/08/05/heavy-rainfall-flooding-among-potential-hurricane-debby-impacts-in-hampton-roads/', 'https://www.wokv.com/weather/tracking-debby-storm-downgrades-tropical-storm-status/6SEFO277ZJGPNNBRCJKS5UEQXY/', 'https://www.irishexaminer.com/world/arid-41450881.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/04/weather/florida-tropical-storm-debby-hurricane-sunday/index.html', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/08/04/debby-hurricane-florida-southeast-flood-forecast/', 'https://nz.news.yahoo.com/florida-storm-live-state-put-182357599.html']"
Pro-Israel interests pour millions into defeating a second ‘Squad’ member.,"Rep. Cori Bush has missed 187 votes between January 2023 and June 2024, making her fifth among lawmakers with the most missed votes. Of the four members who missed more votes, two were being treated for cancer, one had a spouse who died suddenly and one was running for president. Bush was the first member of Congress to call for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, nine days after Hamas’s Oct  7, 2023 attack on Israel. While Bush says her constituents resent having their tax money funding the bombing of civilians, Bell told Abbie in an interview that his opponent is “wrong” in her stance. Bell is backed by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a powerful pro-Israel group which has poured millions into the race. AIPAC has spent around $1 5 million on behalf of Bush in the primary cycle.","['https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/05/israel-house-election-cori-bush-aipac/', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/08/05/2024-election-campaign-updates-harris-trump/', 'https://ca.news.yahoo.com/rep-jamaal-bowman-faces-tough-043936010.html', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/us/politics/missouri-cori-bush-bell-aipac-israel-democrats.html', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/05/donalds-trump-harris-race/', 'https://ca.news.yahoo.com/pro-israel-super-pac-helped-172601663.html', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/08/05/harris-vice-president-visit-map/', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/05/republican-trump-get-out-the-vote-turning-point/', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/05/trump-ye-rapper-adin-ross-interview/', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/05/harris-democratic-presidential-nomination/f4734df8-5349-11ef-9a60-5b6e8b4da7c0_story.html', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/05/presidential-race-shifts-modestly-so-far-toward-harris/', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/05/why-st-louis-voters-might-ditch-cori-bush/', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/04/harris-trump-electoral-map-votes/', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/03/trump-putin-prisoner-swap-gershkovich/']"

RFK Jr. says he left a dead bear in Central Park as a joke.,Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr posted a three-minute-long video Sunday night revealing he had left the dead bear in the park. Kennedy described the 2014 incident in a video that was posted to social media Sunday. He said it would be included in a New Yorker article that he expected to be damaging. Democrats have repeatedly accused Kennedy of running as a spoiler candidate in the election and on Monday jumped on the story to criticize him for his behavior. The article was published Monday and included a photo of Kennedy with his fingers in the bear's bloodied mouth. The image echoes a photo published by Vanity Fair last month of Kennedy pretending to eat a cooked animal carcass. The state agency that investigated the bizarre incident said the statute of limitations for the decade-old offense has long since expired. RFK Jr says he landed on the idea of leaving the bear cub’s carcass in Central Park next to an old bicycle he had in his vehicle as part of a ploy to make the cub's death look like an accident.,"['https://apnews.com/article/robert-kennedy-rfk-bear-cub-central-park-f7e6cba9aa19dc2066a8d9c543974a97', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/08/05/rfk-jr-dead-bear-central-park-new-yorker/', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/04/us/politics/robert-f-kennedy-jr-bear-central-park.html', 'https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/05/rfk-jr-kennedy-bear-story-central-park-new-york', 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2j3353vvdvo', 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-admits-dead-bear-cub-old-bicycle-central-park-10-years-ago/', 'https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/05/politics/rfk-jr-new-yorker-bear-cub/index.html', 'https://www.npr.org/2024/08/05/nx-s1-5063939/rfk-jr-central-park-bear-bicycle', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/robert-f-kennedy-jr-posts-video-saying-put-young-dead-bear-central-par-rcna165095', 'https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/rfk-jr-dead-bear-cub-central-park-b2591254.html', 'https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/08/05/robert-f-kennedy-jr-says-he-left-a-dead-bear-in-central-park-as-a-prank/', 'https://www.scrippsnews.com/us-news/rfk-jr-says-he-dumped-a-dead-bear-in-new-yorks-central-park-a-decade-ago', 'https://www.aol.com/rfk-jr-could-faced-fine-233427930.html', 'https://www.lohud.com/story/news/2024/08/05/rfk-jr-dead-bear-central-park-ny/74671311007/', 'https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/robert-kennedy-jr-left-dead-bear-central-park-112566475', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/rfk-jr-says-he-dumped-dead-bear-in-central-park/2024/08/05/ba801f7f-327c-4ccf-b0c5-0aedeb91a8b6_video.html', 'https://deadline.com/2024/08/robert-kennedy-jr-bear-central-park-1236031258/', 'https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/rfk-jr-admits-planting-dead-bear-in-central-park.html', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/nyregion/rfk-jr-bear-dumping-ny-ballot.html', 'https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/robert-kennedy-rfk-dead-bear-roseanne-barr-b2591695.html', 'https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr-dead-bear-central-park-video-roseanne-barr-1235965936/', 'https://www.unionleader.com/news/back_page/rfk-jr-says-he-once-dumped-a-dead-bear-in-central-park/article_64cdf6a6-5355-11ef-bdec-47bfb8a251ff.html', 'https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/rfk-jr-says-he-staged-bear-cub-murder-scene-in-central-park', 'https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/04/politics/rfk-jr-bear-central-park/index.html', 'https://forward.com/culture/640764/rfk-jr-bear-central-park-larry-david/']"
13-year-old boy killed when a tree falls on home during Hurricane Debby.,"A 13-year-old boy was killed Monday morning when a tree fell on his family’s mobile home in Levy County, Florida. The boy was the first known casualty of Hurricane Debby, though three other people have died in car accidents. The storm made landfall as a Category 1 storm near Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida of less than 1,000 residents. Nearly 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has declared a state of emergency in 61 counties.

Louisiana governor tells parents against the Ten Commandments in classrooms: 'Tell your child not to do so.'',"Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry has a suggestion for parents who don't believe the Ten Commandments should be displayed in public school classrooms. ""Tell your child not to look at them,"" he told reporters Monday. A coalition of parents — Jewish, Christian, Unitarian Universalist and nonreligious — are suing the state. They argue that the legislation ""substantially interferes with and burdens"" their First Amendment right to raise their children with whatever religious doctrine they want. The U S  Supreme Court last weighed in on the issue of the Ten commandments in public schools in 1980, when the justices ruled 5-4 to strike down Kentucky's law.Louisiana is the only state to require that the Ten Commandments be displayed in the classrooms of all public schools and state-funded universities. A group of Louisiana parents and civil rights organizations have sued to stop the law. They argue a state requiring a religious text in all classrooms violates the establishment clause of the US Constitution. Louisiana's attorney general says the state will file a brief Monday, moving to dismiss the case on the grounds no one has been harmed because the law is not yet in effect. The deadline to comply, Jan  1, 2025, remains in place for schools across the state.","['https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/louisiana-governor-tells-parents-ten-commandments-classrooms-tell-chil-rcna165147', 'https://www.wwltv.com/article/news/local/dont-look-at-them-gov-jeff-landry-on-people-who-are-against-10-commandments-in-classrooms/289-679dfb9c-7711-4064-84b2-88ecb1076aa5', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/louisiana-governor-tells-parents-against-ten-commandments-in-classrooms-tell-your-child-not-to-look/ar-AA1oh33J', 'https://ca.news.yahoo.com/ten-commandments-wont-louisiana-classrooms-184458612.html', 'https://www.tampafp.com/louisiana-gov-jeff-landry-defends-new-law-hanging-ten-commandments-in-classroom/', 'https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/louisiana-ag-asks-court-dismiss-lawsuit-new-ten-112589299', 'https://www.wwno.org/education/2024-08-05/louisiana-ag-requests-dismissal-of-lawsuit-challenging-ten-commandments-in-schools', 'https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/05/us/louisiana-ten-commandments-schools/index.html', 'https://www.aol.com/louisiana-ag-asks-court-dismiss-191650150.html']"
Special prosecutors plan to file criminal charges against the police chief who led the Marion raid.,"Prosecutors plan to charge former Marion Police Chief Gideon Cody with a low-level felony. Cody led a raid last year on the Marion County Record and the homes of the newspaper publisher and councilwoman. Police didn’t commit any crimes by investigating baseless suspicion of identity theft or carrying out the raid, prosecutors say. The report also clears Marion County record reporter Phyllis Zorn and editor Eric Meyer of wrongdoing.“He was just a rabid squirrel in a cage and just off doing his own thing,” KBI agent in charge says of Cody.Expected charge for former Chief Gideon Cody stem from the raid of the Marion County Record in August of 2023. The anticipated charge appears centered on text mails, which appear to have been sent before the raid. A felony obstruction charge could be punished by up to nine months in prison for a first-time offender, though the typical sentence would be 18 months or less on probation. A misdemeanor charge c could be punishable by 18 months on probation or less, and a felony charge c is possible. The prosecutors have not yet filed the criminal case, as they are collaborating with the Colorado Bureau of Investigation.","['https://kansasreflector.com/2024/08/05/special-prosecutors-plan-to-file-criminal-charge-against-police-chief-who-led-marion-raid/', 'https://www.voanews.com/a/police-chief-who-led-raid-on-kansas-newspaper-to-be-charged-prosecutors-say/7731035.html', 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/prosecutors-plan-charge-former-kansas-163229577.html', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2024/08/05/kansas-newspaper-raid-criminal-charge/65bcb92e-5348-11ef-9a60-5b6e8b4da7c0_story.html?isMobile', 'https://www.caledonianrecord.com/news/national/prosecutors-plan-to-charge-former-kansas-police-chief-over-his-conduct-following-newspaper-raid/article_b488a8c9-c2a1-53f3-b6bd-84a4dbeacb00.html', 'https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bc-us-kansas-newspaper-raid_n_66b0fed5e4b0781f9246ecde', 'https://www.kmbc.com/article/obstruction-of-justice-marion-kansas-police-chief/61794182', 'https://www.aol.com/police-chief-led-raid-marion-151208238.html', 'https://www.inkl.com/news/former-kansas-police-chief-faces-obstruction-of-justice-charge']"
