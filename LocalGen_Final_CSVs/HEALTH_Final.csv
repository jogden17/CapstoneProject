Nearly half of dementia cases could be avoided or delayed by tackling 14 risk factors.,"The 2024 Lancet Commission report identifies vision loss and high cholesterol as new risk factors for dementia, adding to 12 others previously known. Global health and social costs related to dementia are estimated to triple by 2050, rising from 57 million in 2019 to 153 million in 2050. In some high-income countries, including the USA and UK, the proportion of older people with dementia has fallen. The report’s authors say that this decline in people developing dementia is probably in part due to building cognitive and physical resilience over the life course and less vascular damage as a result of improvements in healthcare.Nearly half of dementias could theoretically be prevented by eliminating 14 risk factors, study says. These include high blood pressure, smoking, obesity, depression, physical inactivity, diabetes, excessive drinking, traumatic brain injury, air pollution and social isolation. Two Alzheimer's treatments have been approved in the United States since the start of last year. EU's medicine watchdog last week refused to approve lecanemab, and it is still considering donanemab for use in the U.S. British nationals advised to sign up to Register Your Presence to receive the latest information.","['https://www.everydayhealth.com/dementia/vision-loss-high-cholesterol-join-list-of-preventable-dementia-risk-factors/', 'https://www.wxow.com/news/health/nearly-half-of-dementia-cases-could-be-avoided-or-delayed-by-tackling-14-risk-factors/article_ac527c7e-6e9d-5bd2-a3cc-1b2ed3d645f7.html', 'https://www.msn.com/en-ie/health/other/the-14-factors-that-may-delay-or-prevent-nearly-half-of-dementia-cases/ar-BB1qYMwL?ocid', 'https://scitechdaily.com/new-strategies-to-combat-dementia-14-risk-factors-you-can-control/', 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com/many-dementia-cases-could-prevented-021812192.html', 'https://finchannel.com/uk-bolsters-support-to-british-nationals-in-lebanon-as-foreign-secretary-says-leave-now/122067/world-2/2024/08/', 'https://www.gilmorehealth.com/study-reveals-how-both-lack-of-sleep-and-oversleeping-can-increase-your-risk-of-cardiovascular-diseases/']"
F.D.A. Approves Blood Test for Colon Cancer Detection.,"On July 29, 2024, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a blood test that can help with primary colorectal cancer screening. The test is Guardant Health’s Shield blood test, and the approval is a critical step towards making it available to the general population. Currently, the test is not covered by Medicare, but this could change in the future, as well as potential coverage from private health insurance groups. It is as accurate as the most commonly used stool-based test, FIT, but less accurate than colonoscopy or Cologuard. Doctors say this blood test can reduce the number of colonoscopies and increase screening rates.Aspirin lowers colon cancer risk for adults with unhealthy lifestyles. Study followed participants for more than three decades. The greatest benefits occurred for heavy smokers and people with a BMI of 25 or greater. In the United States, an estimated 152,810 people will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 2024, with more than 53,000 deaths this year due to this cancer. The incidence of cancer among people under age 50 around the world is projected to increase by 31% by 2030. There is ""considerable evidence"" pointing to environmental causes of early-onset cancers, a doctor says.","['https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/new-colorectal-cancer-blood-test-approved-by-fda-what-to-know', 'https://fcfreepresspa.com/fda-approves-first-blood-test-for-colon-cancer-screening/', 'https://www.news9.com/story/66aaf85c19d3db6628b61dd7/fda-approves-first-blood-test-for-colon-cancer-detection', 'https://www.progress.org.uk/fda-approves-cell-free-dna-test-for-colon-cancer/', 'https://www.telegraphherald.com/news/features/article_68985406-e3a8-5d1b-9dbf-58b67d4fae70.html', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/other/fda-approves-first-blood-test-screening-for-colon-cancer/ar-BB1qZpHF?ocid', 'https://www.progress.org.uk/natural-insemination-sperm-donor-named-parent-on-birth-certificate/', 'https://www.wglt.org/local-news/2024-08-05/bloomington-doctor-colon-cancer-blood-test-will-be-a-paradigm-shift', 'https://www.healthline.com/health-news/aspirin-use-may-lower-colon-cancer-risk', 'https://www.foxnews.com/health/17-cancer-types-more-common-gen-x-millennials-study-finds-alarming-trend', 'http://www.msn.com/en-us/health/other/new-blood-test-available-for-colon-cancer-screening/ar-BB1qYVTs?ocid', 'https://www.enidlive.com/health/red-cross-declares-emergency-blood-shortage-after-national-inventory-falls-by-25-in-july']"
World Health Organization reveals 30 pathogens most likely to trigger next pandemic.,"The list was compiled by 200 scientists from more than 50 countries. It included H5N1 bird flu, which is spreading in the US, and Hantavirus, a virus that spreads among rodents. Scientists also added smallpox even though it is currently eradicated, fearing it could be accidentally released in a lab accident and then spread quickly. The diseases most dangerous were also those that had no vaccines or treatments available for patients. The list was updated because of climate change, deforestation and the growth in international travel. Most of the diseases are carried by ticks, bats, mosquitoes, rodents or by people — often spread via respiratory droplets. But researchers have now expanded the list amid more opportunities for diseases to spread from animals to humans and between areas of the world. Urbanization and deforestation has boosted contact between wildlife and humans, while more international travel generates new opportunities for a disease to find its way to new areas of world.","['https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-13710267/who-updates-pandemic-causing-viruses-bacteria-pathogens-list.html', 'https://www.msn.com/en-au/health/other/world-health-organization-updates-its-pandemic-risk-list/ar-AA1ogZqo', 'https://newsinamerica.com/en/sport/2024/djokovic-beats-alcaraz-paris-olympics-2024-tennis-final-as-it-happened/', 'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/who-updates-list-of-pathogens-that-could-start-another-pandemic/articleshow/112278210.cms', 'https://newsinamerica.com/en/sport/2024/guatemala-wins-first-olympic-gold-in-trap-shooting/', 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13710117/kamala-harris-running-mate-vp-pick-cryptic-message.html']"
