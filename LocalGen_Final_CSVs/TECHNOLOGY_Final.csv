Pixel Watch August 2024 update rolling out 9to5Google.,"Google is rolling out the latest Pixel Watch and Pixel Watch 2 update with the August 2024 security patch today. Users will receive a notification on their watch once the SW OTA update becomes available for their device. The update brings a higher daily file size cap, upping it from 5GB to 10GB. This will double the amount of data a user can send in a day, which will be helpful for those of us who send a lot of data to and from devices. A new update to Quick Share looks to have appeared on some Galaxy devices. The big update we’re waiting for will add a “Home runtime ”, thus allowing the Chromecast to act as a hub for Matter devices. According to leaks, Google is equipping the entire Pixel 9 series with more RAM this year. The base Pixel 9 will allegedly ship with 12GB of RAM, while the Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL will get 16GB by default.","['https://9to5google.com/2024/08/05/pixel-watch-august-2024-update/', 'https://9to5google.com/2024/08/05/quick-share-update-galaxy/', 'https://9to5google.com/2024/08/04/chromecast-google-tv-update-june-2024/', 'https://9to5google.com/2024/08/05/galaxy-watch-7-ultra-first-update/?extended-comments', 'https://9to5google.com/2024/08/05/galaxy-watch-7-ultra-first-update/', 'https://9to5google.com/2024/08/04/google-pixel-9-price-more-expensive-discussion/', 'https://9to5google.com/2024/08/05/doj-rules-against-google-search-suit/?extended-comments']"
OpenAI has built a text watermarking method to detect ChatGPT-written text.,"ChatGPT creators OpenAI has debated whether to release a tool that could catch students who cheat by asking ChatGPT to write their assignments. The tool would watermark the text in a way that humans would not be able to discern. This method involves subtle modifications to word selection during the writing process, creating a hidden signature that can be detected later. The company has called the AI detection methods 99 9% effective and resistant to tampering. But if the text was then reworded with another model, it would make it “trivial to circumvention by bad actors ”OpenAI has developed a system that can spot ChatGPT-generated text. The tool leaves the text equivalent of a watermark in the words that are generated. That pattern would not be recognisable to any person who generated or read the text. But it can be easily spotted by a companion AI system that could be used by teachers to see if their students are cheating, for instance. The company is worried that being able to identify the text with such certainty could cause problems of its own. It could ‘stigmatise use of AI as a useful writing tool for non-native English speakers’","['https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/openai-has-built-a-text-watermarking-method-to-detect-chatgpt-written-content-company-has-mulled-its-release-over-the-past-year', 'https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/04/openai-says-its-taking-a-deliberate-approach-to-releasing-tools-that-can-detect-writing-from-chatgpt/', 'https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/4/24213268/openai-chatgpt-text-watermark-cheat-detection-tool', 'https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/why-openais-ai-detection-tool-may-stay-under-wraps/article68487262.ece', 'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/openai-has-created-a-tool-to-detect-and-mark-ai-generated-writing-but-may-not-release-it-anytime-soon/articleshow/112281510.cms', 'https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/other/openai-has-created-a-tool-to-detect-and-mark-ai-generated-writing-but-may-not-release-it-anytime-soon/ar-AA1oeWN7', 'https://bgr.com/tech/openai-has-a-tool-that-can-tell-if-you-use-chatgpt-to-cheat-but-it-wont-release-it/', 'https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-built-system-identify-text-154628635.html', 'https://www.techspot.com/news/104120-openai-confirms-has-reliable-tool-detecting-chatgpt-generated.html', 'https://gigazine.net/gsc_news/en/20240805-openai-develop-detect-writing-chatgpt-tool/']"

Apple removes the Carousel in Photos as part of changes based on iOS 18 beta feedback.,"Apple released iOS 18 beta 5 for developers today. The update is headlined by a new Safari feature and updates to the Photos app. In response to user feedback, Apple has removed the new Carousel view and tweaked the location of albums. Apple is rolling out the update to developer beta testers today, with a public beta later this month and a general release next month. Apple’s new software version will be complete in the fall, at which point it will be released to the public.. Apple also added Recently Saved content to the Recent Days collection. The All Photos view has also been given an update, so that more of the photos grid can be displayed to the user. The Recent Days row, which contains photos and videos from the previous few days, is now showing recently saved content as well. The Photos app continues to be fully customizable, and users can rearrange sections and categories as they see fit.","['https://9to5mac.com/2024/08/05/ios-18-photos-app-changes/', 'https://9to5mac.com/2024/08/05/ios-18-beta-5-new-features/', 'https://9to5mac.com/2024/08/05/ios-18-beta-5-now-available/', 'https://www.engadget.com/apples-latest-ios-18-beta-walks-back-some-changes-to-the-redesigned-photos-app-180145232.html', 'https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/08/05/photos-gets-off-the-carousel-in-fifth-ios-18-developer-beta', 'https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/ios-18-beta-5-photos-app/']"
Google pulls its pro-AI “Dear Sydney” ad after backlash.,"Google has pulled its Dear Sydney ad after a very public backlash. The ad is about a young girl's quest to write a letter to her hero. Apple had to pull its woeful Crush ad in May after the public decided that its underlying message was one of destruction of human creativity rather than the enabling of it. Now Google has made a similar mistake. Investors and Wall St might love AI (and Tim Cook spent a lot of last week’s most recent Apple earnings call earnestly enthusing about it), but there's a definite disconnect between the view of Artificial Intelligence at boardroom level and that in the real world.The ad showed a father assisting his daughter in writing a heartfelt fan letter to Olympic star Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone. Instead of crafting a personalized message, he resorts to Google's AI assistant for help, prompting it with phrases like, ""Gemini, help my daughter write a letter telling Sydney how inspiring she is"" This approach quickly drew ire, as many felt it undermined the authenticity and emotional connection that should arise from such personal communications. Apple faced a similar backlash after releasing an ad where a hydraulic press crushed musical instruments to unveil the new iPad Pro.","['https://www.redsharknews.com/another-tech-giant-has-to-pull-a-pro-ai-ad-after-public-backlash', 'https://www.prdaily.com/google-pulls-ai-ad-after-backlash-from-olympics-audiences/', 'https://www.yahoo.com/tech/google-pulls-gemini-dear-sydney-184134327.html', 'https://technology.inquirer.net/136140/google-pulls-out-olympics-ai-ad-following-backlash', 'https://www.business-standard.com/technology/tech-news/ai-in-olympics-ad-sparks-creative-debate-google-hits-the-delete-button-124080500456_1.html', 'https://www.digit.in/news/general/gemini-paris-olympics-ad-faces-backlash-google-pulls-it-down-heres-what-happened.html', 'https://evrimagaci.org/tpg/google-withdraws-controversial-ai-ad-amid-public-outcry-5561', 'https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/wells-fargo-fires-mouse-jigglers-170651161.html', 'https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/sphera-wins-two-business-intelligence-131500393.html', 'https://digitalmarketreports.com/news/23122/google-pulls-olympics-ad-ai-fan-letter/']"
The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is full of references to other Zelda games.,"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom hits Nintendo Switch next month, on September 26. It’s the first Zelda game in generations to feature the titular Princess as the primary playable protagonist. The game uses Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom's naming conventions for several of its locations, like using Eldin Volcano over Death Mountain from previous games. It uses two different types of Zora together, something that hasn’t been seen in a Zelda game since Oracle of Ages, and the Bind ability is basically Ultrahand.The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom will put you in Zelda's shoes to save Hyrule. Available September 26, 2024 on Nintendo Switch, with a special edition of Switch Lite. Zelda must join forces with Tri, a mysterious fairy, and use the power of Tri's scepter to create reproductions, or echoes, of various objects. These echoes are essential for solving puzzles and fighting enemies. Players can use echoes of water cubes to reach new heights, build bridges out of old beds, or hurl boulders at opponents. They can even create monster echoes to fight alongside them.","['https://www.polygon.com/zelda/24213626/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-references-other-zelda-games', 'https://gizmodo.com/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-new-gameplay-trailer-details-2000483201', 'https://wccftech.com/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-receives-new-trailer/', 'https://www.sortiraparis.com/en/what-to-do-in-paris/gaming/articles/315122-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-the-new-opus-in-the-saga-is-revealed-in-a-trailer', 'https://wccftech.com/nintendo-q1-2025-report-reveals-sales-down-by-46-5/', 'https://www.ruetir.com/2024/08/05/the-new-classic-hyrule-of-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-only-needs-these-five-minutes-to-make-you-fall-in-love-or-less/']"
MacOS Sequoia beta 5 adds a new wallpaper – and you can download it.,"macOS Sequoia beta 5 also adds all-new text effects, emoji and sticker Tapbacks, and the ability to schedule messages to be sent later. iPhone Mirroring allows users to fully control their iPhones via their Mac. Apple does not plan to add the Apple Intelligence features coming to iOS 18 until later in the beta testing process. tvOS 18 beta 5 brings one of its best features yet: 21:9 support for playing movies and shows. Apple adds Live Captions for English in the US and Canada, so users can read what others are saying on a FaceTime call from the TV.iPadOS 18 beta 5 brings a new Calculator app and Math Notes feature.
