Several U.S. personnel were injured in a suspected rocket attack at Al Asad air base.,"Several U S personnel were injured in a suspected rocket attack at a military base in Iraq. No critical injuries, such as a loss of limbs, have been reported at this time, and no service members were killed. The attack comes amid extremely high tensions in the Middle East. The US has been bracing for Iranian retaliation against Israel over the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week. Both groups are backed by Iran, and Iranian-backed Iraqi militias have resumed launching attacks on bases housing U S forces in Iraq and Syria. The strike occurs amidst escalating tensions throughout the Mideast, following the recent assassinations of a high-ranking Hezbollah commander in Lebanon and the top political leader of Hamas in Iran. US President Joe Biden spoke with Jordan’s King Abdullah on Monday in a bid to head off the expected Iranian attack.","['https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/05/politics/personnel-injured-iraq-al-asad-airbase/index.html', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/08/05/us-troops-attacked-asad-iraq/', 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5dd33egeqo', 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-personnel-injured-al-asad-air-base-suspected-rocket-attack-iraq/', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/americans-injured-attack-us-base-iraq-rcna165281', 'https://www.foxnews.com/world/several-u-s-personnel-injured-suspected-rocket-attack-al-asad-air-base-officials', 'https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/al-asad-air-base-attack-us-injuries', 'https://www.stripes.com/theaters/middle_east/2024-08-05/rocket-attack-iraq-troops-injured-14754644.html', 'https://www.airandspaceforces.com/us-troops-injured-attack-iraq/', 'https://www.kcci.com/article/rocket-attack-iraqi-military-base-injures-us-personnel/61796131', 'https://www.airforcetimes.com/breaking-news/2024/08/05/several-us-troops-injured-in-rocket-attack-in-iraq-officials-say/', 'https://www.nationalreview.com/news/u-s-personnel-injured-by-suspected-rocket-attack-on-iraq-air-base/', 'https://nypost.com/2024/08/05/world-news/us-personnel-injured-in-rocket-attack-against-iraqi-airbase-report/', 'https://washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/08/05/us-troops-attacked-asad-iraq/?tid', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/05/iraq-mideast-us-forces-attack/14d6527e-5373-11ef-9a60-5b6e8b4da7c0_story.html?isMobile', 'https://taskandpurpose.com/news/us-military-iraq-rocket-attack/', 'https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/several-us-personnel-injured-rocket-attack-iraq-base', 'https://www.wxyz.com/world/middle-east/a-rocket-attack-at-an-iraqi-military-base-injures-us-personnel-officials-say', 'https://kvia.com/news/us-world/2024/08/05/several-us-personnel-injured-in-rocket-attack-on-iraq-base-2/', 'https://www.cbs.com/shows/video/vVL9jJjIT5LZzM7RH63ApmI7mW7qDElf/', 'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/several-us-personnel-injured-in-rocket-attack-at-iraqi-military-base-officials/articleshow/112299472.cms', 'https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/exclusive-us-personnel-wounded-in-attack-against-base-in-iraq%2C-officials-say/86145979', 'https://www.nbc-2.com/article/rocket-attack-iraqi-military-base-injures-us-personnel/61796131', 'https://www.kaaltv.com/news/us-world-news/a-rocket-attack-at-an-iraqi-military-base-injures-us-personnel-officials-tell-ap/', 'https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/08/05/personnel-reported-injured-iraqi-base/3021722899479/']"
Nine UNRWA staff will be fired for potential role in the 7 October attacks on Israel.,"UN Office of Oversight Services (OIOS) launched investigation earlier this year. OIOS was not able to independently authenticate information used by Israel to support the allegations. Israel has long accused UNR WA of collaborating with Hamas and turning a blind eye to the militant group's activities during the 10-month old Gaza war. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages in the unprecedented assault last autumn. UN did not provide details on what actions the employees may have carried out, but noted that they would be fired from their roles. The investigation’s conclusion appeared to bring to a close, for now at least, a controversy that began after Israel leveled the alarming accusations in January. The allegations led dozens of donor nations to suspend hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for the agency.","['https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/08/1152841', 'https://apnews.com/article/un-unrwa-staffers-fired-oct-7-cc33d0ab25dc4bacc0af1db10705e0d6', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/08/05/unrwa-october-7-israel-hamas-gaza/', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/world/middleeast/unrwa-oct-7-attack.html', 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/un-fires-9-unrwa-staffers-gaza-investigation-october-7-attacks/', 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnvyyz8461yo', 'https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/unrwa-staffers-fired-oct-7-1.7285735', 'https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-08-05/ty-article/.premium/israel-at-war-day-304-nine-unrwa-workers-fired-for-possible-involvement-in-october-7/00000191-234a-dcd6-abf7-774f440f0001', 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com/nine-unrwa-staff-members-may-200038268.html', 'https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-08-05/ty-article/un-fires-9-staffers-after-probe-finds-possible-involvement-in-oct-7-attack-on-israel/00000191-23c1-dcd6-abf7-77c727160000', 'https://www.inkl.com/news/un-agency-fires-nine-staff-members-over-possible-links-to-october-7-attack', 'https://www.1news.co.nz/2024/08/06/un-fires-more-staff-over-possible-october-7-attack-involvement/', 'https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.7285735', 'https://dailycaller.com/2024/08/05/un-agency-staffers-likely-participated-oct7-terrorist-attacks-against-israel/']"

UK prime minister talks of a ‘standing army’ of police to deal with riots.,"UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer says justice system will be ramped up to handle hundreds of arrests. Starmer blames lawlessness on ‘far-right thuggery’ driven in part by misinformation on social media. More than 375 people have been arrested in the mayhem so far and more are expected, police say. Dozens of police officers have been hospitalized for injuries in the past six days after being struck with bricks, bottles and large wooden posts.Violence is the worst England has seen since 2011, when widespread rioting followed the police killing of a mixed-race man.Names and addresses of solicitors’ firms and advice agencies shared in list of locations to be targeted by demonstrators. Police patrols are being stepped up in Teesside over the coming days amid fears the area could be hit with more violent disorder. Charity that helps refugees has been forced to close its headquarters in Liverpool after receiving threats of far-right violence. Five countries have issued travel alerts following almost a week of rioting. Prime Minister has faced calls from Nigel Farage, among others, to recall Parliament to discuss the response to the disorder. Police have made 378 arrests since violence broke out last week.","['https://apnews.com/article/britain-riots-asylum-seekers-violence-a391b4513c41fe4de3806b28ee0c1740', 'https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/5/british-pm-says-standing-army-of-police-ready-to-deal-with-rioters', 'https://www.loudountimes.com/0local-or-not/4world/uk-prime-minister-talks-of-standing-army-of-police-to-deal-with-rioting-across-britain/article_e1557810-2540-54e6-96b4-b7bbe7f951be.html', 'https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/08/05/uk-pm-starmer-vows-specialist-police-standing-army-to-battle-far-right-unrest-gripping-bri', 'https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cw5yyynpwnzt', 'https://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/3273307/uks-starmer-talks-standing-army-police-vows-swift-criminal-sanctions-rioters', 'https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2024/08/05/wfmq-a05.html', 'https://www.cbc.ca/news/britain-standing-army-police-riot-1.7285610', 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/southport-stabbing-latest-multiple-casualties-125827013.html', 'https://www.foxnews.com/world/uk-riots-plunge-country-into-worst-unrest-in-years-prime-minister-vows-to-apply-full-force-of-law', 'https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/starmer-standing-army-specialist-police-riots-b2591415.html', 'https://news.sky.com/story/what-is-sir-keir-starmers-standing-army-and-will-it-work-13191485', 'https://www.wral.com/story/uk-police-warn-far-right-fueled-street-violence-affects-resources-needed-to-investigate-other-crimes/21559338/', 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com/starmer-says-standing-army-police-123325892.html', 'https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/us/uk-prime-minister-talks-of-standing-army-of-police-to-deal-with-rioting-across-britain/ar-AA1ofzOs', 'https://news.sky.com/story/keir-starmer-pmqs-conservative-leadership-contest-latest-live-12593360', 'https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/08/05/southport-attack-latest-news-rioters-not-patriots/', 'https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/uk-riots-today-protest-rotherham-tamworth-liverpool-bolton-news-b2591141.html?page', 'https://www.sinardaily.my/article/220195/focus/world/uk-pm-promises-quotstanding-armyquot-of-officers-to-tackle-riots', 'https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/aug/05/cobra-emergency-meeting-keir-starmer-far-right-riots-uk-politics-live-latest', 'https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/keir-starmers-new-standing-army-of-specialist-police-to-tackle-riots/', 'https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/riots-cobra-meeting-keir-starmer-rotherham-tamworth-southport-far-right-b1174721.html', 'https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/world/uk-prime-minister-convenes-emergency-panel-to-end-days-of-far-right-violence-across-britain/ar-AA1ofyf8', 'https://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2024/Aug/05/as-far-right-thuggery-escalates-on-uk-streets-pm-starmer-proposes-standing-army-of-police-to-quell-riots', 'https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/video-news/a-standing-army-of-specialist-police-to-be-set-up-deal-with-riots-says-starmer/a168452893.html']"
Venezuela’s top prosecutor announces a criminal probe of opposition leaders.,"The opposition claims to have collected records from more than 80% of the 30,000 polling booths nationwide showing it won. Maduro announced Saturday that the government has arrested 2,000 opponents and pledged to detain more people. Pressure is also building internationally for the Venezuelan government to publish the full breakdown of the electoral results. But so far, Maduro has instead asked the country’s supreme court — which like all institutions in Venezuela is packed with loyalists — to review any claims of irregularities. The armed forces are traditionally the arbiter of political disputes in Venezuela and have shown no signs of ditching Maduro.Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Chile's Gabriel Boric cast doubt on Maduro's victory claim. Authorities have declared Maduro the victor in last week's election but have yet to produce voting tallies to prove he won.

Ukraine’s Zelenskyy displays newly arrived F-16 fighter jets.,"Ukraine destroyed a Russian Su-34 fighter-bomber aircraft and ammunition depot at an airfield some 165 miles from the frontline of the war. The attack on the Morozovsk airfield in Russia’s Rostov region on Saturday is also likely to have damaged two other Su- 34 warplanes. It came as Volodymyr Zelensky unveiled the first Western-supplied F-16 warplanes to arrive in Ukraine, and asked for Nato allies to help protect them. Putin has warned that Moscow could consider launching strikes at facilities in Nato countries if they host the warplanes used in Ukraine. Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway have committed to providing Ukraine with more than 60 of them.Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway have pledged to deliver more than 60 F- 16s to bolster Ukraine's air defences.

It marks a strategic defeat for the U S at a moment when the Islamist extremist threat in the region is growing.. Hundreds of angry people took to the streets in Pakistan-administered Kashmir Monday to mark the fifth anniversary of India's decision to strip the disputed region of its semi-autonomy.
