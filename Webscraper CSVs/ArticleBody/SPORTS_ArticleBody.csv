Referees 'wanted the US to lose' Olympic 3x3 tournament.,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/referees-wanted-u-s-lose-olympic-3x3-tournament-star-player-hailey-van-lith-says,"The United States failed to go back-to-back in the women's 3x3 basketball tournament, and one of the star players is blaming the referees.

The Americans dropped their semifinal matchup against Spain, who eventually lost to Germany in the gold medal game; the USA earned bronze by defeating Canada.

But gold for America in basketball is almost a given: In normal basketball, the men have won 16 golds in 20 appearances, while the women are 9-for-12 (one silver, one bronze).

That was not the case here. While the women earned gold when the 3x3 tournament debuted in Tokyo in 2021, they fell short this year.

TCU's Hailey Van Lith, who transferred to the Horned Frogs after starring for LSU this past season, took her shot after dropping eight points in the semifinal.

""This was 1,000% BS. Those refs wanted the U.S. to lose,"" she said after the game. ""They were flopping left and right. They are not that good. Great job, ladies, we know who should have won.""

Her teammate, Cierra Burdick, went a different route.

""Not the medal we wanted, obviously, but I don't want to take away from the moment,"" Burdick said after the bronze medal match. ""A lot of gratitude, a lot of blood, sweat and tears were invested into this. That's so cliché, but it's so true.""

Van Lith's comments, though, echoed what ESPN's Brian Windhorst recently said.

""FIBA doesn’t really want the USA to do good at three-on-three basketball. They really want that to be for countries that can’t field five-on-five teams,"" Windhorst said.

""So, they do all these things, like they have all these different layers and layers of things you have to do to qualify. … The only way you can play is if you play in, like, 15 qualifying events.""

The USA 3x3 female basketball team suffered a shock defeat in Paris in the semi-finals on Monday, losing narrowly to Spain by a scoreline of 18-16.

USA captain Hailey Van Lith bagged eight points during the match, but she couldn't quite lead her team to the final, with the USA now left to battle it out for a bronze medal instead.

But Van Lith did not go quietly, and after the game, she took aim at the referees and suggested that the officials actually wanted to see the US lose.

She said after the game: ""This was 1000% bs. Those refs wanted the US to lose. They were flopping left and right. They are not that good. Great job ladies we know who should have won.""

The US team will now be left to take on Canada for a bronze medal, while Spain will progress to the final to battle it out for gold with Germany, who beat Canada by one point.

Both of those games take place on Monday night.

Van Lith's explains difficulties of 3x3 basketball

Van Lith has previously spoken about the US' struggle for success in the 3x3 variation of the sport, given the clear dominance of the full-sided game.

She told ESPN over the weekend: ""I think the public doesn't quite get the sport yet. It's just a tough game. It's really gritty. It's for the tough people. You can't be soft and play.

""We only play 10 minutes. So if you look at the first quarter of 5-on-5 games, they're very, very close. And sometimes even the USA is down. So it's a game of who's hot. If our shooters aren't hitting shots and the other team is, no matter how much better we are, we're probably going to lose."""

Today marks the last day of artistic gymnastics competition from the Bercy Arena and the women’s balance beam and floor exercise finals are the main events. That's partly because Simone Biles will be looking to continue her imperious form and add more gold medals to her tally in both events after taking three in her first three events at these Games. She’ll be joined on the beam by Suni Lee, herself on a comeback journey, and by Jordan Chiles on the floor.

That follows the men's pole vault final, at 1:00 p.m. ET and 7:00 p.m. local time, where Sam Kendricks will be hoping to take home a medal. He'll have to outjump Sweden's record-breaker Mondo Duplantis, though. On the track, the women's 5,000m final is at 3:15 p.m. ET and 9:15 p.m. local time; and the women's 800m medal event is at 3:47 p.m. ET and 9:47 p.m. local time.

Team USA is going for the top spot in the women's 3x3 basketball tournament: their semifinal game against Spain is at 11:30 a.m. ET and 5:30 p.m. local time, with the gold medal game at 3:00 p.m. ET and 9:00 p.m. local time.

Hailey Van Lith insisted the officials were to blame for Team USA’s exit from the basketball 3x3 at the Paris Olympics.

On Monday, Van Lith scored eight points and left it all out on the court but it wasn’t enough as Team USA fell to Spain in the semi-finals. Spain clinched the 18-16 overtime victory, with Sandra Ygueravide leading the way with nine points - including the game-sealing free throws.

Team USA were then forced to face Canada for bronze after their North American rivals lost to Germany in the other semi-final. Van Lith helped her nation win bronze, securing the 16-13 victory.

However, the TCU star was frustrated. Following the loss to Spain, Van Lith took issue with the referees and insisted the game was “rigged”.

“This was 1,000 percent BS,” she said. “Those refs wanted the U.S. to lose. They were flopping left and right. They are not that good. Great job ladies. We know who should have won.”

During the “Pat McAfee Show”, NBA insider Brian Windhorst suggested Van Lith’s theory was somewhat substantiated. He believes the global basketball governing body FIBA hopes other countries excel in 3x3.

“FIBA doesn’t really want the USA to do good at three-on-three basketball,” Windhorst said. “They really want that to be for countries that can’t field 5-on-5 teams.

“So they do all these things, like they have all these different layers and layers of things you have to do to qualify. I don’t just mean the team. I’m talking about no, like, Kyrie [Irving] can’t just show up and play. The only way you can play is if you play in like 15 qualifying events. It’s not 15, I’m just coming up with that number.”

He added: “They don’t want guys from America.”

Windhorst then added that 3x3 was a discipline WNBA rising star and women's basketball phenom Caitlin Clark could have contributed since the Indiana Fever rookie was not named to the women’s USA Basketball team to go to Paris. However, he then played it down, as FIBA have other goals.

“FIBA doesn’t care about ratings, they just care about, like, growing the game elsewhere outside the U.S. so it’s not their priority,” the ESPN analyst concluded.

In 3x3 basketball, chemistry and fluidity are paramount. Van Lith and co. struggled to find rhythm amid the difficult conditions presented to them by the officials - but they still clinched bronze over France."

VILLENEUVE-D'ASCQ, France -- South Sudan's coach and basketball federation president said referees were biased against their team after a 96-85 loss to Serbia on Saturday that ended an exciting run for the lone African team in the men's basketball tournament at the Paris Games.

Bogdan Bogdanovic scored 28 points to help Serbia move into next week's quarterfinals.

South Sudan coach Royal Ivey pointed to a wide foul discrepancy as evidence of bias by game officials, and federation president Luol Deng said African referees should be part of major international tournaments.

""They shot 31 free throws; we shot six free throws?"" Ivey said after the game. ""Let's tell the story. Let's tell the real story, because that's a travesty. How do they shoot 31 free throws and we shoot six free throws? How?""

Nikola Jokic added 22 points and 13 rebounds for Serbia, which finished second in Group C behind the United States.

South Sudan's loss means Greece gets the final wild card for the knockout round because it had a better point differential than South Sudan over three group stage games.

""I was scared of South Sudan before the game. They had a great tournament,"" Bogdanovic said. ""Respect to them. We've known them since the World Cup. They really got better.""

Marial Shayok and Carlik Jones led South Sudan with 17 points each.

Ivey said referees complained about his players standing in the bench area and threatened him with ejection for being out of the coach's box, all while tolerating similar behavior by Serbia's coach.

""My guys were out there giving their all -- blood, sweat and tears -- and you tell me how we shot six free throws? We shot one free throw in the second half,"" Ivey said.

Deng, who starred at Duke and played 16 seasons in the NBA, said he thought the discrepancy was ""deliberate.""

""I know Serbia is known for basketball; they've been great for many years,"" Deng said. ""The way, the style the guards play, it's almost like the ref knows them. It's OK if the refs know certain players to let them play their style. As soon as our guys play their style, they're getting fouls every time.""

He questioned why there seems to be a narrative that African players are aggressive.

""I don't know why there's no African referees in the Olympics. It's 2024,"" Deng said. ""If we're representing the continent, then we've got to be represented fully. That's something that we've got to keep working on. But if these referees aren't familiar with our game, with our style, then I don't know what the world championship or the Olympics is. Is it just a European basketball style and we're not allowed to be aggressive?""

South Sudan played like a team whose tournament was on the line. Players dove on the floor for loose balls and crowded around Jokic every time he got the ball deep.

There also were all-out effort plays, including Wenyen Gabriel sprinting for a chase-down block of Aleksa Avramovic during a fast-paced first quarter.

Serbia -- ranked fourth in the world by FIBA -- led 33rd-ranked South Sudan 47-44 at halftime.

Serbia held a five-point advantage entering the fourth quarter. And South Sudan kept coming. A steal by Peter Jok and an alley-oop to Gabriel got a roar from the crowd and shrank its deficit to a basket.

But Serbia just kept making shots, using a 19-3 spurt to take a 91-74 lead with less than three minutes remaining in the contest.

South Sudan has prepared for the Olympic spotlight since September, when it finished the World Cup as Africa's highest-ranked team, earning an automatic spot for these Summer Games.

But despite entering the Olympics with the lowest world ranking, it was clear just making it to France was never the goal for this team. It wanted to prove it belonged on the world stage alongside LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Jokic and the greatest players in the sport.

South Sudan got the Americans' attention prior to the Games when it led the U.S. late during an Olympic exhibition matchup in London before ultimately falling by a point.

South Sudan then announced its arrival in its Olympic opener with a 90-79 victory over Puerto Rico. It turned a debut that began with organizers playing the wrong national anthem for South Sudan before the game into validation that it was ready to compete in one of the most talent-rich Olympic tournaments in history.

The U.S. imposed its will in its rematch with South Sudan, rolling to a 17-point win. Yet it was close enough to keep the first-timers in the hunt for a wild card.

It didn't materialize, and South Sudan's inspired inaugural run at the Olympics is over."

According to NFL Media, contract talks between the San Francisco 49ers and their star wideout have been stalled for quite some time, and it's now more likely that Aiyuk is traded than work out an extension with the 49ers.

Mike Garafolo reports that no deal is in place right now, despite the rampant speculation found on social media. But it feels like we are close to a decision being made, as multiple teams are reportedly in play for him. The Athletic reported the Cleveland Browns, New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers have all been interested teams.

There are two parts to a potential Aiyuk trade: The contract, and the trade compensation. Any team that trades for Aiyuk will sign him to a new contract immediately. How much is Aiyuk worth? The wide receiver market has, of course, been very active this offseason, and there are now four pass-catchers who have secured contracts that include averages of at least $30 million per year.

As for what San Francisco would accept for its All-Pro wideout, reports indicate that before the 2024 NFL Draft, the 49ers were in search of a first-round pick. They did not find a trade partner. In fact, Pro Football Talk reported that before the draft, Aiyuk's agent was actually given permission to see if other teams would pay the wide receiver what he was after. At the time, that price was $28 million per year. Aiyuk's agent reportedly found five different teams willing to give that contract to Aiyuk, but those five teams could not meet the 49ers' desired trade compensation.

The former No. 25 overall pick out of Arizona State had his best NFL season yet in 2023, as Aiyuk caught 75 passes for a career-high 1,342 yards and seven touchdowns. His 17.9 yards per reception ranked second in the NFL among qualified players behind George Pickens, while his 3.1 yards per route run ranked third behind Tyreek Hill and Nico Collins.

San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk is reportedly more likely to be traded than signed to a new contract, per NFL Network's Mike Garafolo and Tom Pelissero (h/t NFL.com's Nick Shook).

Garafolo provided the latest on NFL Network:

The report comes amid rumors about a trade to the Pittsburgh Steelers, though NFL insider Jordan Schultz reported Monday that there was no deal in place between the two teams.

""I'm told the [49ers] have had discussions in recent days regarding a potential Aiyuk trade with several teams, but as of this post -- nothing is finalized,"" Schultz wrote on X.

Aiyuk officially requested a trade from the 49ers in July amid ongoing contract disputes. The first-round draft pick in 2020 is set to earn $14.124 million this season as he plays the final year of his rookie deal, but he's hoping to get a new contract before then.

His play has certainly made him worthy of a big contract extension, as he's coming off a season in which he recorded 1,342 receiving yards and seven touchdowns while helping lead San Francisco to a Super Bowl appearance.

Amid his trade request and search for an extension, Aiyuk is attending team activities but is not participating as part of a ""hold-in."" Amid the hold-in, ESPN's Jeremy Fowler reported last week that talks between the two sides haven't made much progress recently.

""The situation has gotten really sticky,"" Fowler wrote Saturday. ""The receiver market ballooning into the $30 million neighborhood has complicated talks. The 49ers have not shown a willingness to pay Aiyuk what he thinks he's worth, and negotiations hadn't intensified lately, last I had checked.""

According to Shook, several teams have been permitted to talk with Aiyuk's agent with the goal of working out a contract extension should he be traded."

Unsatisfied with the lack of progress in the contract extension negotiation process, Aiyuk requested a trade before reporting to training camp. He has not participated in practices, essentially ""holding in"" while avoiding the fines that would have been incurred had he not reported.



While Aiyuk has expressed a desire to play for Washington, Garafolo notes that the Commanders have not yet been in play for the receiver.



Aiyuk is scheduled to earn $14.124 million in 2024 on a team-exercised fifth-year option but seeks a deal that would make him one of the NFL's highest-paid receivers, a contract that might cost a team around $30 million annually.

Brandon Aiyuk is more likely to be traded than sign an extension with the 49ers.,https://www.on3.com/pro/news/49ers-more-likely-to-trade-brandon-aiyuk-than-sign-wide-receiver-to-extension/,"The San Francisco 49ers and star wideout Brandon Aiyuk have been at a standstill in contract negotiations, but it appears there’s a resolution on the way.

Contract extension talks remain stalled and according to Mike Garafolo and Tom Pelissero of NFL Network, it is now more likely that the 49ers will trade Aiyuk to another team rather than sign him to an extension. While multiple teams have interest in the 26-year-old, a deal is not currently in place, per Garafolo and Pelissero.

“As fluid a situation as I can recall recently,” Garafolo wrote Monday on X. “Feels like we’re getting closer to a resolution with Brandon Aiyuk and the #49ers but not there yet.”

Aiyuk, the 2020 first round pick (25th overall) out of Arizona State, hauled in 75 receptions for a career-high 1,342 yards and seven touchdowns this past season. He earned a second-team All-Pro nomination. For his career, he has tallied 269 receptions for 3,931 yards and 25 scores. The 49ers picked up Aiyuk’s fifth-year option last offseason, guaranteeing him $14.12 million in 2024. He will be an unrestricted free agent in 2025.

Brandon Aiyuk, Pittsburgh Steelers a perfect match?

Multiple unspecified teams have been permitted to reach out to Aiyuk’s agent in regard to agreeing to a contract extension should a trade come about. One team which has been linked to Aiyuk throughout the offseason is the Pittsburgh Steelers.

The Steelers currently have a logjam at the receiver position, but no clear No. 2 option next to George Pickens. Pittsburgh notably traded Diontae Johnson to the Carolina Panthers and released Allen Robinson earlier this offseason. In addition to Pickens, Pittsburgh has Roman Wilson, Van Jefferson, Quez Watkins, Scotty Miller and Calvin Austin III all in the mix.

None of those players have the track record and talent of Aiyuk, who would further help transform Pittsburgh’s offense under new offensive coordinator Arthur Smith. Steelers general manager Omar Khan, asked specifically about Aiyuk ahead of training camp, said he hasn’t had any conversations with the 49ers.

“I can tell you amongst the 32 GMs we all talk, we all have conversations,” Khan said. “But believe it or not, it’s still early in the process here.”"
Brandon Aiyuk is more likely to be traded than sign an extension with the 49ers.,https://clutchpoints.com/nfl-rumors-brandon-aiyuk-more-likely-to-be-traded-than-sign-extension-with-49ers,"As the silent civil war between the San Francisco 49ers and Brandon Aiyuk extends deeper into the summer, a recent report from NFL.com hints that an eventual reunion between the two sides may be in the cards before the start of the regular season, with a trade now appearing more likely than an extension.

“Contract talks remain stalled, and it seems more likely that Aiyuk will be traded than work out an extension with San Francisco, NFL Network Insiders Mike Garafolo and Tom Pelissero reported Monday,” Nick Shook wrote for NFL.com. “Multiple teams are in play for the ascending receiver, but a deal is not in place at this time, per Garafolo and Pelissero.”

Initially drafted in the first round of the 2020 NFL draft, Aiyuk has developed into one of the true bright spots of one of the best offenses in the league. Even if a trade could net San Francisco some significant assets, his absence would be hard to ignore.

The 49ers drafted Ricky Pearsall as Brandon Aiyuk insurance

While the 49ers likely wanted to keep Aiyuk around long-term as a reliable pass-catcher for Brock Purdy and potential replacement for Deebo Samuel as WR1, they did secure a contingency plan in the first round of the 2024 NFL draft just in case things went south in the form of Ricky Pearsall at pick 31.

A two-year starter at Florida after beginning his college career at Arizona State, Pearsall is the kind of player the 49ers love; he's got great size at 6-foot-1, 189 pounds with a speedy 4.41 40 time, inside-out versatility, intriguing athleticism as a screen threat, and the sort of shimmy that is seemingly designed in a lab to pick up YAC in Kyle Shannahan's offense.

Though he probably won't match Aiyuk's 2024 production as a rookie – as even Aiyuk didn't do that – if he has to step into a WR2 role this fall, it's safe to assume he will do it justice, even if WR3 next to his fellow former Sun Devil would be ideal."

There hasn’t been much on the Brandon Aiyuk contract situation. We recently heard that the 49ers are at the point where they have an option to trade the wide receiver but were not actively shopping their wideout. That might be changing.

NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo reports that nothing has happened, but a resolution is nearing. The 49ers are leaning towards a trade with Aiyuk and a team. There’s no team named, and the 49ers aren’t actively shopping, but this is where negotiations have led us.

Speaking on NFL Network, had this to say about the ordeal:

Those contract talks have stalled for a while. Which is why as we sit here, it seems more likely that Brandon Aiyuk gets traded than he remains a San Francisco 49er. Now, where does he get traded to? There are mulitple options, there are multiple teams in play that the 49ers have had communication with; we sit here right now, and Tom [Pelissero] is going to echo me in just a couple of seconds: there is no deal done. Brandon Aiyuk is still a 49er, there is no trade agreement with any team in place as we sit here right now. We do feel like we’re getting closer here, though. We do feel like at some point, something is going to happen to send/seal Brandon Aiyuk’s fate potentially with a new team. We are not there right now. The biggest part of this is the trade compensation between the 49ers and any potential team. And then, Aiyuk has to agree to a contract extension with the team. What seems certain, Tom, is that he is going to wind up making more money if he gets traded than what the 49ers have previously offered. And that is why we are here; he was unhappy with those offers up until this point. They had communication a couple weeks before training camp hoping to reset the table and have some further negotiations. They never had that. They have never gotten to that point. So it’s back to the table. So it seems likely at some point that he gets traded.

Garafolo shortly elaborated a bit more on the whole situation via X:

As fluid a situation as I can recall recently. Feels like we’re getting closer to a resolution with Brandon Aiyuk and the #49ers but not there yet. https://t.co/ZnFcprtirm — Mike Garafolo (@MikeGarafolo) August 5, 2024

Earlier, Adam Schefter pointed out that Brandon Aiyuk had a no trade clause. The same applies here—not only does a team have to give up assets, they also have to have a long-term deal Aiyuk will agree to in order to make the whole thing work.

There’s still plenty of time for this to swing the other direction, and it’s important to note the 49ers haven’t pressed the nuclear button. As long as things stay this way, a trade isn’t just an option, it might become the only option at this point."
Brandon Aiyuk is more likely to be traded than sign an extension with the 49ers.,https://www.thescore.com/news/3049333,"The San Francisco 49ers and disgruntled receiver Brandon Aiyuk don't appear to be remotely close to reaching an agreement on a long-term contract.

In fact, it seems more likely that Aiyuk will be traded than sign an extension with the 49ers, NFL Network's Mike Garafolo and Tom Pelissero reported Monday, according to NFL.com's Nick Shook. Multiple teams are reportedly in play for the second-team All-Pro wideout, but a trade isn't in place yet.

Aiyuk - who's entering the last year of his rookie contract - requested a trade from San Francisco on July 16. Teams contacted the 49ers last month, but Niners general manager John Lynch repeatedly said the team didn't intend to move the two-time 1,000-yard receiver. San Francisco, however, had discussions in recent days regarding a potential Aiyuk trade, sources told NFL reporter Jordan Schultz.

Aiyuk reported to the 49ers' training camp in July but hasn't been practicing amid stalled contract talks with the team. San Francisco reportedly shopped Aiyuk and Deebo Samuel in April but ultimately decided to keep the star playmakers.

The Pittsburgh Steelers, Washington Commanders, and New England Patriots have been linked as potential destinations for Aiyuk. In June, the 26-year-old mentioned Pittsburgh and Washington as the teams he could potentially see himself playing for if he left San Francisco. New England is reportedly one of the known clubs that inquired about Aiyuk earlier this year. In addition to the Patriots, the Cleveland Browns were considered a top suitor for Aiyuk over the weekend, a source told Matt Barrows of The Athletic, who adds that the Steelers have also resurfaced as a possible destination.

Aiyuk caught 75 passes for a career-high 1,342 yards and seven touchdowns in 16 games last season. The 2020 first-round pick's 17.9 yards per reception ranked second in the NFL among eligible receivers in 2023.

The former Arizona State star, who is set to earn $14.1 million in 2024, has a market value of $26.2 million per year, according to Spotrac."

On Monday, rumors swirled around the Internet that Pittsburgh could be in talks to acquire Aiyuk, with some reports even stating that the deal is done.

However, nothing has happened just yet, and that makes sense. NFL Network stated that while there is no deal between the seems, he will likely be moved rather than sign an extension."
Brandon Aiyuk is more likely to be traded than sign an extension with the 49ers.,https://nfltraderumors.co/latest-on-brandon-aiyuk-trade-rumors/,"Update:

Mike Garafolo and Tom Pelissero are reporting that contract talks between the 49ers and WR Brandon Aiyuk remain stalled and it now appears to be more likely that he will be traded than sign an extension with San Francisco.

According to the report, multiple teams are in play for an Aiyuk trade at this time.

Multiple teams have been granted permission to speak with Aiyuk about an extension that could pave the way for a potential trade.

NFL Network says that there is no trade in place with the Steelers or any other team at this point in time.

Longtime 49ers beat reporter Matt Maiocco says he now believes there’s a real possibility the 49ers agree to trade WR Brandon Aiyuk instead of signing him to a new deal.

Maiocco previously thought there was no way San Francisco would give up Aiyuk in a prime year of their Super Bowl window.

However, he cites growing trade buzz around Aiyuk involving the Browns and Patriots, who would each give Aiyuk the contract he wants and be able to give the 49ers a proven receiver in return to help minimize the loss of Aiyuk.

Mary Kay Cabot of Cleveland.com writes the Browns would likely have to include WR Amari Cooper as part of a trade package for Aiyuk, though it’s worth pointing out the Browns just restructured Cooper’s contract before training camp.

As for New England, Maiocco says they could include WR Kendrick Bourne who played in San Francisco before signing with New England as a free agent. But in that case, it’s worth noting Bourne is coming off a torn ACL and is still getting back to full speed. The Patriots also inquired about Aiyuk in July and were rebuffed.

Maiocco notes the 49ers are believed to have an offer out to Aiyuk a couple of million shy of the $30 million annually the receiver has been seeking. He adds it’s possible the ball might be in Aiyuk’s court now with options to go to other teams willing to meet his contract demands or staying in San Francisco.

Both ESPN’s Adam Schefter and Jeremy Fowler said this past week it felt like little progress was made on contract talks between Aiyuk and the 49ers, with both sides dug in on their stances.

Several reports have said that while San Francisco does want to keep Aiyuk on a long-term deal, so far the 49ers haven’t been willing to meet the market. Aiyuk sees himself as a top-ten receiver and wants to be paid accordingly.

While Aiyuk reported to training camp, he has not been practicing and officially requested a trade in July.

Aiyuk, 26, was a one-year starter at Arizona State and earned first-team All-Pac 12 in his final season. The 49ers traded up with the Vikings to select him with the No. 25 overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft.

He signed a four-year, $12,531,342 rookie contract that included a $6,673,703 signing bonus. The 49ers picked up his fifth-year option last year that will cost them $14,124,000 fully guaranteed for the 2024 season.

Aiyuk is set to be an unrestricted free agent in 2025.

In 2023, Aiyuk appeared in 16 games for the 49ers and caught 75 passes for 1,342 yards receiving and seven touchdowns.

We will have more news on Aiyuk as it becomes available."
Brandon Aiyuk is more likely to be traded than sign an extension with the 49ers.,https://www.audacy.com/957thegame/sports/san-francisco-49-ers/brandon-aiyuk-more-likely-to-be-traded-than-extended,"Brandon Aiyuk is closer and closer to the exit door. Multiple online rumblings have prematurely suggested Aiyuk is already out that door. But a report from NFL Network's Tom Pelissero and Mike Garafolo has Aiyuk still in the building, but likely to leave.

Both jointly report that Aiyuk is still a 49er, and that there is no trade agreement in place. However, he is more likely to be traded than to sign an extension.

It would be a monumental move for Brock Purdy's top target coming off his first All-Pro season, in which he recorded 75 receptions for 1,342 yards and 7 touchdowns. His 17.9-yards-per-catch average was behind only George Pickens.

This is a strange one for San Francisco, which typically rewards its star talent with long-term deals. But with Trent Williams holding out and Brock Purdy due a monumental extension next season, and the costs of star receivers reaching the nearly (and in some cases, exactly) $30 million-per-year mark, the 49ers may make the decision to move on from Aiyuk, who made his desire to be paid clear from the outset. Other teams, per NBC Sports' Matt Maiocco, are more willing to meet his asking price.

Where does the 49ers' offense go from here if Aiyuk departs? It goes to Deebo Samuel, Jauan Jennings, George Kittle, Christian McCaffrey and... Ricky Pearsall. That rookie is the key. He is the one outside receiver who is potentially capable of separating against man coverage in a way Samuel cannot.

This story will be updated should anything change."

Browns star receiver would welcome Brandon Aiyuk in trade with 49ers

By David Bonilla 10 hrs

The Cleveland Browns trading for San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk may be wishful thinking for the AFC organization and those who cover it. However, one star Browns wideout would welcome the addition of Aiyuk. ""It's just making the receiver corps a lot better,""..."
Brandon Aiyuk is more likely to be traded than sign an extension with the 49ers.,https://clutchpoints.com/nfl-rumors-expert-floats-brandon-aiyuk-davante-admas-trade-49ers-raiders,"The San Francisco 49ers are preparing to enter the 2024 NFL season with one of the most talented rosters in the league. However, the 49ers continue to have a contract dispute with one of their top contributors. Rumors suggest that star wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk is more likely to be traded from San Francisco amid stalling extension talks. Thus, one expert floated a deal that the 49ers could engage the Las Vegas Raiders in involving Davante Adams.

Ted Nguyen of the Atheltic shined the light on a potential trade with eye-opening insight.

“A Davante Adams for Brandon Aiyuk trade would make sense if they could rework the final two years of Adams' deal. Adams could help the 49ers in their SB window and Aiyuk can help the Raiders now and in the future (younger),” Nguyen wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

Nguyen's development comes around the same time other insiders reported that Aiyuk's discourse with 49ers management was not gaining progress.

“Contract talks remain stalled, and it seems more likely that Aiyuk will be traded than work out an extension with San Francisco, NFL Network Insiders Mike Garafolo and Tom Pelissero reported Monday,” Nick Shook wrote for NFL.com. “Multiple teams are in play for the ascending receiver, but a deal is not in place at this time, per Garafolo and Pelissero.”

It would be tough to see Aiyuk go, given the important role he has had in San Francisco's success. At the same time, it seems the two sides cannot agree on a number.

Aiyuk comes off a 2023-24 season where he totaled a career-high 1,342 yards, which ranked him seventh in the NFL. His offensive production would immediately help the Raiders, who failed to make the postseason.

Would Las Vegas be willing to engage the 49ers in trade talks and part ways with Davante Adams? Only time will tell."

Just brutal. Following group play and the ensuing draw for the quarterfinals, the two teams will play each other immediately in the knockout stage. The loser will exit the Olympics incredibly disappointed.

The top two teams from the three groups plus the next two best third-place teams based on point-differential advanced.

The quarterfinal matchups on Tuesday are:

Germany-Greece, 5 a.m. ET

Serbia-Australia, 8:30 a.m. ET

The U.S. caught a break, too. The USA-Brazil winner plays the Serbia-Australia winner, meaning the U.S. wouldn’t have to face Germany, Canada or France until the gold-medal game.

It’s a formidable eight filled with NBA All-Stars and MVPs, and it went down to the final game of group play between Serbia and South Sudan to determine the quarterfinalists.

Playing in its first Olympics in men’s basketball, South Sudan just missed a spot in the quarterfinals, losing to Serbia 96-85. Had South Sudan lost by just a point, it would have made the round of eight.

A closer look at the matchups:

USA-Brazil

The U.S. was the top overall finisher at 3-0 at a plus-64 point-differential in Group C. Though Greece was the second-best third-place team, FIBA rules state that two teams from the same group cannot play in the quarterfinals, so that prevented a Germany-Brazil matchup because both were in Group B.

The U.S. did its job in group play, wasn’t really challenged and had several players contribute offensively. They were sloppy with turnovers and gave up offensive rebounds, and those are areas coach Steve Kerr wants to clean up. Anthony Edwards (16.3 points per game) and Kevin Durant (16 ppg) are the top scorers. LeBron James averaged 14.3 points, 7.3 assists and 6.7 rebounds in group play.

Brazil beat Japan and lost to Germany and France in Group B. Vitor Benite, Raul Neto, Marcelinho Huertas and Bruno Caboclo are Brazil’s top players.

Germany-Greece

Giannis Antetokounmpo made it to the knockout stage, and he’s thrilled about the opportunity. But Germany is playing as well as any team in this event. Germany, the 2023 FIBA World Cup champion, clobbered France for the top spot in Group B and has experience and continuity with Franz Wagner (21.7 ppg), Mo Wagner, Dennis Schröder (19.7 ppg, 9.0 assists per game), Daniel Theis and Isaac Bonga. Greece had just one victory (vs. Australia) in Group A but that was enough. Antetokounmpo averaged 27 points on 68.9% shooting in three games.

Canada-France

So much is at stake in this game as both teams came to the Olympics with medal expectations. Canada has been fantastic – 3-0 in Group A – led by RJ Barrett (21.0 ppg), Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (19.0 ppg) and Dillon Brooks (14.3 ppg). Can France’s guards handle Canada’s guards? France finished 2-1, but it was an up-and-down effort. It almost lost to Japan (94-90), handled Brazil and was routed by Germany. Yes, France has experience (Nic Batum, Rudy Gobert, Evan Fournier) and the young star (Victor Wembanyama and his 17.0 points, 10.7 rebounds, 2.7 steals and 2.0 blocks per game), but it hasn’t put together a complete performance.

Serbia-Australia

Australia finished second in Group A with just one victory – against Spain – but it lost to Canada 93-83 and Greece 77-71. It is competitive with several NBA players, including Josh Giddey (15.0 ppg), Patty Mills, Jock Landale (17.7 ppg), Dante Exum and Dyson Daniels. Serbia is led by Nikola Jokic (18.7 ppg, 11.0 rebounds, 7.0 assists per game), Bogdan Bogdanovic (19 ppg) and a cast of high-level players who star in Europe. Serbia earned silver at the 2023 World Cup, and it is capable of medaling in Paris. Both teams are well-coached.

With that win, Team USA improved to 3-0 after the group stage, boasted a point differential of plus-64 and secured the No. 1 seed.

While Team USA claimed the top spot in the tournament, two other undefeated teams -- Germany (plus-47) and Canada (plus-20) -- secured the No. 2 and No. 3 seeds, respectively. The first tiebreaker for knockout stage seeding was the head-to-head record, and the second was point differential. The final seeding for the quarterfinals was not determined until the last game in group play, Serbia vs. South Sudan, was decided on Saturday afternoon.

Eight teams will be in action for the knockout stage on Tuesday, Aug. 6 (All times U.S./Eastern):

• Germany vs. Greece, 5 a.m. (E Channel, Peacock, NBCOlympics.com)

• Serbia vs. Australia, 8:30 a.m. (USA, Peacock, NBCOlympics.com)

• Canada vs. France, noon (Peacock, NBCOlympics.com)

• USA vs. Brazil, 3:30 p.m. (USA, Peacock, NBCOlympics.com)

For a full breakdown of the men's basketball standings and schedule, click here.

Team USA will not face Germany, France or Canada until a possible gold medal matchup on Aug. 10, as they are on the other side of the bracket. The Americans will face Brazil in the quarterfinals, while Canada will meet France. The other two quarterfinals on Tuesday will be Germany vs. Greece and Serbia vs. Australia. The semifinals are slated for Thursday, Aug. 8.

Technically, Greece should be a lower seed than Brazil, as it had a worse point differential. However, Brazil cannot be the No. 7 seed because Germany is No. 2, and teams from the same group are not allowed to play in the quarterfinals. Greece, led by Giannis Antetokounmpo, only advanced because South Sudan lost to Serbia in the final group play match on Saturday.

Serbia, which got standout performances from Bogdan Bogdanovic and Nikola Jookic against South Sudan, won both of their group games after dropping its opener to Team USA. Group C was the only group that advanced just two teams.

The host nation of France, winners of silver in the past two Olympics, is led by veteran Rudy Gobert and first-timer Victor Wembanyama. Canada has the star guard duo of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jamal Murray. Germany, paced by Dennis Schroder, is the reigning World Cup winner.

So with three games down, Team USA still has three to go if it wants to collect a fifth straight gold medal. It will be heavily favored against Brazil on Tuesday, but the two games after that figure to be Team USA's two greatest tests in the tournament. They are still the heavy favorite to win gold overall, but things are about to get harder for the star-studded American roster."

The United States men's basketball team begins knockout play Tuesday at the 2024 Paris Games, while the U.S. women's national soccer team has a chance to advance to the gold medal match.

Team USA will face Brazil in the men's basketball quarterfinal, continuing its quest for a fifth straight gold medal. The Americans went undefeated in their group, earning the top seed of the medal rounds. Brazil needed a tiebreaker to advance to the quarterfinals but shot 45% from deep during pool play.

After defeating Japan on Saturday with a late strike from Trinity Rodman, the American women will face Germany for a spot in the gold medal soccer match. This will be the seventh Olympic semifinal match in eight appearances for the Americans. The U.S. defeated Germany 4-1 in the group stage.

It will be a busy day for Team USA on the track. Three Americans -- Gabby Thomas, McKenzie Long and Brittany Brown -- have a chance at medaling in the women's 200-meter final, while another three -- Cole Hocker, Yared Nuguse and Hobbs Kessler -- will compete in the men's 1500-meter final. Michael Norman (men's 400-meter race) and Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone (women's 400-meter hurdles) both will have a semifinal race after strong heats on Monday.

Sara Hughes and Kelly Cheng -- the last of the American women's or men's duos remaining in beach volleyball -- will face Switzerland's duo in the quarterfinal. Meanwhile, the U.S. women will have an indoor volleyball quarterfinal matchup against fourth-ranked Poland.

Team USA will face Brazil in the Olympic men's basketball quarterfinals.,https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/olympics/live-blog/olympic-games-2024-live-updates-rcna162870,"Good morning! It’s day 10 of the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Today marks the last day of artistic gymnastics competition from the Bercy Arena and the women’s balance beam and floor exercise finals are the main events. That's partly because Simone Biles will be looking to continue her imperious form and add more gold medals to her tally in both events after taking three in her first three events at these Games. She’ll be joined on the beam by Suni Lee, herself on a comeback journey, and by Jordan Chiles on the floor. The beam event is at 6:38 a.m. ET and 12:38 p.m. local time, while the floor exercise is at 8:24 a.m. ET and 2:24 p.m. local time.

Elsewhere, with track and field events well underway, Team USA's Valerie Allman will be hoping to spin up a storm in the women's discus event at 2:30 p.m. ET and 8:30 p.m. local time. That follows the men's pole vault final, at 1:00 p.m. ET and 7:00 p.m. local time, where Sam Kendricks will be hoping to take home a medal. He'll have to outjump Sweden's record-breaker Mondo Duplantis, though. On the track, the women's 5,000m final is at 3:15 p.m. ET and 9:15 p.m. local time; and the women's 800m medal event is at 3:47 p.m. ET and 9:47 p.m. local time.

Team USA is going for the top spot in the women's 3x3 basketball tournament: their semifinal game against Spain is at 11:30 a.m. ET and 5:30 p.m. local time, with the gold medal game at 3:00 p.m. ET and 9:00 p.m. local time. The men's final also happens today a half hour later than the women's final.

In non-medal events, Chase Budinger and Miles Evans are among the American beach volleyball pairs to play today. They face Norway's defending champions at 8:00 a.m. ET and 2:00 p.m. local time. And it's also the first day of Olympic wrestling, with 20-year-old Californian and two-time world champion (in the 72kg category) Amit Elor making her Olympic debut in the women’s freestyle (68kg/149 lbs).

• Men’s 5×5 quarterfinals schedule

• 2024 Olympics: Complete coverage

The biggest threat to the USA in the men’s Olympic basketball knockout round appears to be … the USA.

That’s a commentary on how powerful the Americans have shown to be in this tournament — and also on the overall perceived threat of the remaining seven teams in the Olympics.

There’s no Argentina with Manu Ginobili, or Spain with the Gasol Brothers, or obviously the former Soviet Union from long ago which at least gave the USA (then without professional players) something to think about.

Also, in the past, most of the great basketball countries outside the US brought mature and cohesive teams to the Olympics, with players who were very familiar with one another, who were national team ‘mates since they were teenagers. That’s not necessarily the case with this collection of countries.

The other seven remaining teams do have certain assets and strengths, yet they’re also flawed enough to make this week very clear — the gold medal is Team USA’s to lose.

Here’s a look at the seven teams that’ll join the USA in the quarterfinals and how they measure up in what looks like a race to grab silver and bronze:

Canada

The folks from Up North are digging in their sneakers and poised to make a stand. The Canadiens believe they have a solid shot at a medal, and who is anyone to argue when such team is led by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander?

Quite honestly, if they don’t medal, it would be disappointing. This 2024 team is the direct result of the growth of basketball in Canada over the last few decades, fueled by the NBA’s Toronto Raptors franchise. Either their current players — Shai, RJ Barrett (who’s averaging 21.7 points in this tournament) and Jamal Murray — grew up watching Vince Carter and Tracy McGrady or their fathers did. Credit also goes to the Steve Nash effect.

There are 10 NBA players on the roster, more than anyone except the USA. And here they are, looking to upgrade the bronze medal they won last year in the World Cup.

Canada has taken care of business for the most part, sweeping its way through group play with big efforts from Barrett and Gilgeous-Alexander. They’re in a tough bracket this week, with France on tap next. Murray hasn’t looked like Playoff Jamal Murray yet. Still, this team has a medal mindset. And please, for drama’s sake, give us Dillon Brooks vs. LeBron James in the gold medal game.

Germany

What country is the world’s reigning title holder? If you guessed the US, take another swing at the plate. It’s Germany, winner of last summer’s World Cup, and a country that still hasn’t lost a game since the start of that tournament. Unbeaten then, unbeaten now.

The Germans are getting used to winning, and that’s a good thing to carry into the knockout phase. Better to believe you’re the favorite even if you’re not.

Speaking of swagger, this team has all the drip. It starts with Dennis Schroder (19.7 points per game), whose tricky dribble and change-of-pace game poses a problem for opposing guards. There’s also Franz Wagner (21.7); maybe you saw his hand-switching dunk over Victor Wembanyama in group play?

Germany was never taken very seriously in international play, even during the Dirk Nowitzki years. That has changed abruptly. Schroder, the Wagner Brothers and even Daniel Theis are aiming to introduce a new conversation and rewrite Germany’s chilly Olympic medal history.

France

Sacre bleu, there’s a sense of angst permeating through the land because France … might … could … miss out on a medal! Let’s just say it’s iffy right now for the home team, if only because the French already lost a game (to Germany), appeared vulnerable at other times (needing overtime to beat Japan) in group play and are locked in the tough side of the bracket with Canada and Germany.

Just the same, France could put it all together this week and spare itself the potential embarrassment. With Wembanyama on board and the boisterous French fans supplying an emotional boost, sure, France does have some advantages.

But France needs to find a rhythm, or else. Of all the decent medal favorites, the French seem the shakiest. The Wemby-Rudy Gobert combo has yet to send a chill through the opposition, and guard play seems inconsistent.

Serbia

This team has yet to assemble a performance against a quality team that would give anyone the belief that it can cause trouble. Nikola Jokic is a very convincing argument by himself, but that’s the problem — he seems by himself.

The Serbs are bringing decent players, but none that are keeping opposing coaches sleepless. Even their narrow win over South Sudan was aided (according to South Sudan) by some generous officiating.

Anyway, Serbia has a potentially tough quarterfinal against Australia, then what would be a third game this summer against the USA, in the semifinals, where Joe Embiid, Anthony Davis and Bam Adebayo would be waiting for Jokic.

Australia

The Boomers are fortunate to make it this far after losing two out of three in group play. They then had to sweat out Canada’s win over Spain that allowed the Aussies to qualify on point differential.

That’s a long-winded way of saying this team, despite a rich international basketball history, has its work cut out for it — although it did draw Serbia in the quarters, a team just as so-so.

At least Josh Giddey is following the footsteps of Patty Mills, Shane Heal and Andrew Gaze by giving the Boomers solid all-around play. For someone who was tossed overboard by Oklahoma City this summer, this experience could be a wakeup for Giddey, who’s averaging 15 points, 8.7 rebounds and 6.7 assists.

Greece

The most dominant player in these Olympics? That would be Giannis Antetokounmpo, the leading total points scorer in this tournament. The Greek superstar terrorized everyone who stood before him in group play — and mostly that was two and three players in his face.

But impactful? No disrespect, but Giannis has only been able to do so much for a team hurting for talent. Poor Giannis is carrying the Greeks on his shoulders, and even a former MVP has his limits in these knee-buckling situations.

Greece labored last month just to qualify Greece for the Olympics, and the chore has only gotten tougher. But Greece and Giannis did make it through group play. So that’s a victory, and a big one all things considered.

Brazil

Not only is Brazil thrilled just to make it this far, but the Brazilians’ reward is a date with Team USA in the quarterfinals. Their stay could be short.

Brazil has spunk, though, and is hardly short on effort. What the Brazilians lack in NBA talent, they compensate with energy. Also, if Vitor Benite gets hot, the Americans will be forced to adjust. He’s shooting 59% from the floor and 56% from deep.

Team USA will face Brazil in the Olympic men's basketball quarterfinals.,https://www.on3.com/pro/news/united-states-to-face-brazil-in-olympic-mens-basketball-tournament-quarterfinal-matchups-revealed/,"The bracket is set for the quarterfinals of the Olympic men’s basketball tournament. And that means the United States — the top seed out of pool play — knows its next opponent.

Team USA will be facing off against Brazil at 3:30 p.m. EST on Tuesday, Aug. 6. It will be the nightcap and fourth of four quarterfinals to be played that day.

The full quarterfinal schedule is as follows:

QF1: Germany vs. Greece, 5 a.m. EST

QF2: Serbia vs. Australia, 8:30 a.m. EST

QF3: Canada vs. France, noon EST

QF4: United States vs. Brazil, 3:30 p.m. EST

From there, the winners of quarterfinals one and two will face off in a semifinal, and the winners of the other two face off — meaning the United States, with a win over Brazil, will face the winner of the Canada-France matchup.

The semifinals are scheduled for Thursday, Aug. 8, and the finals two days later on Saturday, Aug. 10.

One Team USA star is closing in on a record

Team USA defeated Puerto Rico 104-83 in the final round of pool play on Saturday, improving to 3-0 during their stay at the Paris 2024 Olympics.

Kevin Durant scored 11 points in 19 minutes off the bench, further adding to his strong start following his return from injury. He was the second-leading scorer in the game — and leaves Saturday’s win just five points shy (483) of breaking the all-time Team USA scoring record, which is currently held by WNBA legend Lisa Leslie at 488.

“It feels good to accomplish stuff like that with this group of guys,” Durant said on the court postgame. “It’s a fun group of guys and I like being in our locker room with them. It’s cool to do that type of stuff but we’re just trying to get that gold. … We always play together, we play off of each other. We’ve got two different units that play different ways — but we’re all still on the same page. It’s been a fun first three games and we’re looking forward to the medal rounds now.”

While it’s unclear who Team USA will battle in the medal rounds as of this report, Durant is almost certainly going to eclipse Leslie’s total within the next game or two barring any unforeseen setbacks. He’s also 17 points away from being the first Team USA member to eclipse 500 points in Olympic history.

Durant is a three-time Olympic Gold Medalist, appearing on every Team USA roster since the 2016 Olympics in Rio. He’s the reigning Olympic MVP for his efforts during the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and came into Paris as Team USA’s all-time leader in scoring average, field goals made, made 3-point field goals and free throws."
Team USA will face Brazil in the Olympic men's basketball quarterfinals.,https://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/2024-paris-olympics-mens-basketball-power-rankings-team-usa-still-no-1-as-canada-germany-looking-for-upset/,"We are through the group stage portion of the men's basketball tournament at the 2024 Paris Olympics, which means it's time for the knockout stage to begin. Eight teams are through to the quarterfinals after surviving an exciting slate of group games. South Sudan made history with its first Olympic win while we saw some impressive performances from teams like Japan and Brazil, the latter of which made it through to the quarterfinals. While Japan didn't walk away with any wins, it did put an overtime scare into France, which suddenly doesn't look as invincible as many thought the host country would be heading into the tournament.

With the quarterfinal field set, we now have a clearer picture of who will be in the running for that gold medal. Each team has played three games -- three teams are a perfect 3-0 -- so we have a better sense of which teams pose the biggest threat to Team USA in its quest for a fifth straight gold medal. While France hasn't quite looked the part, Canada and Germany have proven to be dangerous adversaries and, based on the way the brackets are set, could meet USA in a possible gold medal match.

Before the quarterfinals start on Tuesday, here's how the remaining eight teams competing in the men's basketball tournament rank.

8. Brazil

Brazil advances to the quarterfinals of the Olympic competition for the first time since 2012, and while that's a great accomplishment to celebrate, it will run into Team USA, which has looked like a well-oiled machine through the group stage. Brazil got through to the knockout stage in its final game of group play, beating Japan 102-84 behind 33 points and 17 rebounds from 2014 first-round draft pick Bruno Caboclo. He has had himself quite the tournament so far, averaging 13 points and 7.3 rebounds on 55% from the field. Caboclo, who has played for four different NBA teams, put Brazil on his back against Japan, and he's precisely the reason why the Brazilians have advanced in this tournament. But Team USA isn't Japan. The Americans have the size to contain the 6-foot-9 Caboclo, and it will be up to the rest of Brazil to step up when that happens.

7. Greece

Giannis Antetokounmpo has willed Greece through to the quarterfinals, surviving a group that contained both Canada and Australia. After losing their first two matches against Canada and Spain, it looked unlikely the Greeks would get through to the knockout stage. But a 20-point, seven-rebound, six-assist performance from Antetokounmpo, as well as 18 points from Thomas Walkup, lifted Greece past Australia and helped it secure one of the quarterfinal spots. Greece was always going to go as far as Antetokounmpo could take them, and that still remains true. Now it faces Germany, which has looked unstoppable throughout this tournament. But if Greece wants to get past Germany, it will need to shoot better than 28% from 3-point territory like it did against Australia.

6. Australia

Australia is the weakest second-place team from the group stage entering the quarterfinals after going just 1-2 to open the tournament. That's not a dig at Australia, but rather just shows how much talent was in its group, which was dubbed the ""Group of Death"" in this tournament. That aside, the Boomers are right where they should be in this competition, in contention for another medal after walking away with a bronze-medal finish at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. They're being surprisingly led by Jock Landale, who is averaging 17.7 points, 9.7 rebounds and 3.3 assists through the Boomers' first three games. They'll have a tough matchup against Serbia in the quarterfinals, and while Australia possesses more NBA-level talent, it has no answer for Serbian big man Nikola Jokic. But, if Australia can replicate the performance it had against Spain, where five players scored in double figures, then it wouldn't be surprising at all to see the Boomers in the semifinals playing for another medal.

5. France

The French have been rather disappointing in this competition: almost losing to Japan, being in a close contest with Brazil and then falling behind by 24 points against Germany en route to a loss. France was supposed to be the biggest threat to Team USA in this competition, and it's also why Team USA recruited Joel Embiid to play for the Stars and Stripes. The Americans needed more depth down low to defend the French twin towers of Rudy Gobert and Victor Wembanyama. But so far, Les Bleus have looked anything but dominant. Wemby has looked great in his first Olympic competition, averaging 17 points, 10.7 rebounds and three assists, all of which lead France so far in this tournament. But he can't do it all, and if France can't get more out of its backcourt, the host country will have an incredibly difficult time against Canada in the quarterfinals.

4. Serbia

Serbia got blown out by Team USA in the group stage, but it looked dominant in the other two games, thanks to strong play from Nikola Jokic, Bogdan Bogdanovic and Vasilije Micic. Bogdanovic has led Serbia in the first three games with 19 points, while shooting 54% from the field and 53% from 3-point range. The only issue Serbia has here is its play falling off when Jokic is on the bench. The Serbs got pummeled by USA when Jokic wasn't on the floor, and while that wasn't as much of an issue against Puerto Rico and South Sudan, the rest of the teams in the tournament are better equipped to attack that weakness. But when Serbia is shooting the ball well, it's difficult to stop. Couple that with Jokic controlling everything on offense and Bogdanovic knocking shots down, and this team could find itself in a medal game if it gets past the quarterfinals.

3. Germany

Germany has done a great job showing why it's the defending FIBA World Cup champions. Entering the 2024 Olympics, I was unsure if the Germans would be able to replicate that success, given the weaker talent pool that competed during last summer's World Cup. But they've answered every call so far. Germany blew out France, something no one expected to happen, and finished the rest of the group stage undefeated. Franz Wagner has elevated his game to another level and is third in the competition in scoring, averaging 21.7 points per game. Dennis Schroder is not far behind at 19.7 points a game. This German team has been a well-oiled machine so far in the tournament, and by performing so well, it enters the knockout stage on the opposite side of the bracket of Team USA. It faces Greece in the quarterfinals, and while Antetokounmpo will be a tough test, Germany has proven it can defend against size.

2. Canada

Canada's on-paper talent has lived up to expectations so far. RJ Barrett has looked phenomenal, averaging 21 points a game, which ranks fourth in the competition. It got through the group unscathed, making quick work of Greece and Australia. Then it survived a scare against Spain on the strength of the roster and behind excellent guard play led by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Canada's going to be a tough draw for anyone in this competition, and while it might not have the size to contend with the United States on that front, the Canucks have the defense and scoring to put up a fight if those two teams meet in the gold-medal match. They're on opposite sides of the bracket, a blessing for Canada, but it won't be an easy road ahead as it has to face a France team that is out to prove the doubters wrong.

1. United States

The Americans had some inconsistent performances in exhibition games leading up to the 2024 Olympics, but when the games started to matter, the stars showed up. Kevin Durant returned from injury and looked efficient as always. LeBron James proved that even at age 39, he can still be the best player on an Olympic roster. And Anthony Edwards is quickly rising to become an Olympic star just as he did last season in the NBA. Edwards is leading USA in scoring with 16.7 points per game, and to be doing that on a roster that features James, Durant and Stephen Curry is truly insane. The Americans can match up with anyone in this competition, and they have beaten their first three opponents by an average of 21.3 points. If Team USA continues to dominate, it will remain in the top spot on the power rankings."

Kyle Irving writes: ""Brazil hasn't produced enough offense to challenge Team USA, though. Its 80.3 points per game is the third-fewest in the tournament. The United States has posted 105.7 points per game — over 25 more than its opponent. As good as Brazil has been defensively — holding all three of its Group Stage opponents under 90 points — it will be overmatched trying to keep up with Team USA's scoring.""

Andy Bailey writes: ""Brazil deserves some love for getting to the knockout round. It was far from a given to make it here, but its run will almost certainly be over after playing Team USA. The Brazilians' best player is Bruno Caboclo, who last played in the NBA in 2020-21 and had a career average of 4.2 points there. Team USA, meanwhile, boasts multiple future Hall of Famers, including LeBron James, Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant. It went 3-0 in group play, which included a dominant win over (Nikola) Jokić's Serbian side. It led group play in point differential. It has the deepest collection of scoring talent, playmaking talent and defense. The only real question about this game is whether the Americans will win by more than that gaudy (point spread).""

Head coach Steve Kerr knows Santos is a threat better than anyone, considering he coaches the Warriors, and the Brazilians play a physical brand of basketball that could pose as a problem for Team USA. Still, we think the United States will win this game handily.""

With so many stars to choose from, they’ve got no shortage of firepower going forward. Their star-studded roster means there’s little drop-off from their first unit to their second, so Brazil need to be at their best for 48 minutes. Keeping the US at bay has proven difficult, as they finished group play with a +64 points differential. The only thing that really held them back in their second and third games was the lack of a real rally from South Sudan and Puerto Rico down the stretch. Serbia kept coming at them, pushing the US to 110 points.""

Simone Biles added yet another medal to her collection on the final day of gymnastics at the 2024 Paris Olympics. Biles earned a silver in the floor exercise final, and American teammate Jordan Chiles took bronze to join her on the podium. USA TODAY Sports broke down all the happenings of the event.

Team USA earned another gold medal at the track when Valarie Allmann made it back-to-back golds in women's discus. The Tokyo gold medalist became just the fourth woman ever to win two Olympic gold medals in discus.

And after thrilling races in the 100 meters, attention turned to the 200. Noah Lyles cruised in his first-round heat as seeks to win Olympic gold in both the 100 and 200. On the women’s side, gold medal favorite Gabby Thomas led a trio of Americans into the 200-meter final.

Team USA also captured medals in triathlon, shooting, pole vault and 3x3 basketball on a busy Monday in Paris, and Caroline Marks won gold in women's surfing .

USA's Caroline Marks wins gold in women's surfing

American Caroline Marks edged Brazil’s Tatiana Weston-Webb for gold in the women’s shortboard surfing competition Monday.

With the surf in Teahupo’o slumbering, Marks still caught a barrel ride for 7.50 points that proved to be the difference. But Webb found a serviceable wave in the final two minutes of the heat and the wait on the judges began.

It ended in celebration for Marks, who posted a two-wave score of 10.50 while Webb finished with a combined score of 10.33.

It’s the second consecutive surfing gold for the American women, with U.S. surfer Carissa Moore having won at the Tokyo Games in 2021 during the sport’s Olympic debut.

Kenya’s Faith Kipyegon wins appeal, gets silver in 5,000 meters

SAINT-DENIS, France — Kipyegon will be the 5,000 silver medalist after all.

Kipyegon originally placed second in the women’s 5,000 behind fellow countrywoman Beatrice Chebet. But officials disqualified the two-time gold medalist for obstruction for making contact with Ethiopia's Gudaf Tsegay with a little more than 800 meters left in the race.

After an appeal by the Kenyan Federation, Kipyegon was re-instated with her silver medal.

The result continued what has been a nice rebound Games for a U.S. team that bowed out in the preliminary round in Tokyo. — Gentry Estes

Team USA women's beach volleyball squad eliminated

PARIS — Being perfect in pool play only took Taryn Kloth and Kristen Nuss, one of the USA’s two women’s beach volleyball teams with legitimate medal aspirations, so far.

Nuss and Kloth fell to Canada’s Brandie Wilkerson and Melissa Humana-Paredes in two hard-fought sets 19-21 and 18-21 in the Round of 16, ending their Olympic dreams.

The tandem won all three of its pool play matches but that didn’t matter once the knockout round began.

Against Canada, the first set featured runs from both teams, each side finding momentum only to lose it. Canada jumped out to the lead first. Then the USA made its play. A big block from Kloth gave the U.S. a 11-9 advantage as part of an 8-1 run. The Canadians battled back to tie the set at 14 and Wilkerson’s block put the Canadians back in front.

Trailing 19-17, the USA found a way to tie it at 19. But Kloth’s swing into the net gave Canada the first set victory.

The Americans found themselves trailing again early in the second. Kloth, who finished with all eight of the team’s attack errors, struggled on serve receive for the second straight match and the U.S. was in a 7-3 hole. The U.S. hung in there but an ace from Canada to make it 15-11 felt like a death knell – until it wasn’t. Nuss and Kloth scraped themselves back into the set. Kloth’s block tied it at 18. Canada scored the final three points of the match to walk away victors. – Chris Bumbaca

Team USA 3x3 women's hoops loses in OT to Spain

PARIS — Foul trouble came back to bite Team USA in the women’s 3x3 basketball semifinals Monday in a 18-16 sudden death loss to Spain that relegates them to the bronze medal game, where they will play Canada for the medal.

The Americans led most of the way, but piled up 10 fouls in regulation, putting them in the perilous position in a format where the opponent gets two shots and the ball from that point on.

After Spain scored the first point of sudden death on a driving layup by Sandra Ygueravide, Rhyne Howard shot a 2-pointer that would have given the Americans the win but missed everything.

On the next possession, Dearica Hamby was called for holding Ygueravide while trying to escape to the basket.

In the first, they jumped out to a 13-8 lead and relied on the early margin to carry them to a Set 1 victory.

It’s been an interesting Games for the duo. They parted ways with their coach for unclear reasons over the weekend and have yet to be transparent on the matter.

Delaney Schnell misses medal opportunity in Olympic diving

SAINT-DENIS, France — Two-time Olympic diver Delany Schnell advanced to the women’s 10-meter platform semifinals Monday but failed to move on to Tuesday’s top-12 final. She finished 15th with a score of 271.95.

Schnell pulled off an impressive recovery in prelims after a couple low-scoring dives to make the top 18, and she opened semifinals with strong first- and second-round performances.

But a rough third-round dive — a back 3 1/2 somersaults in the tuck position with a 3.3 degree of difficulty that earned her just 31.35 points — dropped the 25-year-old from Michigan to 14th. And she was unable to return to the top 12 with her two remaining dives.

At the Paris Olympics, Schnell previously finished sixth in the women’s synchronized 10-meter platform — an event she won a silver medal in at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. Three years ago, she finished fifth in the women’s 10-meter platform.

China’s defending Olympic gold and silver medalists, Quan Hongchan and Chen Yuxi, led the way both in prelims and semifinals. Quan and Chen enter Tuesday’s final ranked first and second with scores of 421.05 and 403.05, respectively.

Golf Channel analyst burns Jon Rahm's Olympic collapse

Scottie Scheffler's thrilling comeback victory at the Paris Olympics, rallying from four shots back during the final round at the Paris Olympics, was one for the ages.

Of course, it came at the expense of Jon Rahm, the 54-hole leader, who let that lead slip away by shooting a 39 on the back nine. That led to the chatter on social media – and on the Golf Channel, where analysts did not hold back on Rahm's performance.

""I’m gonna put that down as one of the biggest collapses – chokes of the year,"" Brandel Chamblee said. ""Probably right up there with Rory McIlroy coming down the stretch at the U.S. Open."" — Scooby Axson

Budinger-Evans eliminated in men's beach volleyball

PARIS — Chase Budinger’s Olympic dream has ended.

Budinger and his partner Miles Evans fell in the Round of 16 of the men’s beach volleyball tournament Monday to Norway’s Anders Mol and Christian Sorum, the defending Olympic gold medalists. Norway took out the USA in straight sets, 21-16, 21-14.

In Tokyo three years ago, Mol and Sorum became the youngest duo to win the Olympic gold at 23 and 24 years old, respectively. The Americans gave them their best shot but the Norwegians were simply better.

Budinger and Evans played solid defense early to stay in the first set. The former NBA player’s presence at the net was a factor, as he had two blocks and forced an attack error within the first 10 points. Norway went on a 3-0 run to force a USA timeout at 14-11 and it controlled the rest of the set, with Mol dialing up his own block (six block points), to keep the U.S. off balance.

The Americans enjoyed a 3-1 lead to start the second set, but they quickly saw that evaporate to a 8-4 deficit. An ace from Mol made it 12-7 and created a mountain too tall for the U.S. to climb. By the end of the match, sand stuck to the entire right side of Evans' body. He recorded nine digs and had 12 attack points. Budinger finished with four block points and eight points on attack. Both Norwegians finished with 11 attack points apiece.

Evans and Budinger advanced to the knockout round by winning their ""lucky losers"" match two days earlier, as they won one of their three group play matches (the first). — Chris Bumbaca

Simone Biles, Suni Lee fall on balance beam

In a balance beam final that has seen multiple gymnasts fall, Simone Biles came off on her aerial series and scored a 13.100. This will be the first time, other than on uneven bars, that she has made a final and not won a medal.

The 21-year-old appeared frustrated as she re-mounted the beam and finished her routine after the fall, and as she walked away afterwards. But then she started to gradually lighten after talking with her coach, Jess Graba, and Biles. Within moments, Lee was smiling and laughing again, perhaps remembering the breadth of what she's already achieved in Paris. After returning from a pair of kidney ailments, Lee won a second consecutive all-around Olympic medal – this time a bronze – to go with team gold and another bronze on uneven bars Sunday. — Nancy Armour, Tom Schad

Women's pole vault sending 20 to finals

It'll be a crowded field Wednesday night when women's pole vaulting finalists gather for the medal competition at the Paris Games. That's because 20 of them qualified Monday morning, eight more than the format called for, due to a massive gridlock of a tie for the last available spot.

Katie Moon was the lone qualifier for Team USA with a vault of 4.55, but the tie came at 4.40. Nine athletes tied for the 12th and final qualifying spot. Although other non-qualifiers also vaulted 4.40, the nine tied for the fewest attempts advanced.

The standard for automatic qualification to the medal rounds was 4.70, which no vaulter achieved. — Chase Goodbread

USA's Delany Schnell sneaks into 10m platform diving semis

It was close, but Team USA diver Delany Schnell snuck into the 10-meter platform diving semifinals after finishing 17th in Monday’s prelims. The top-18 divers out of 29 total at Olympic Aquatics Centre in Saint-Denis, France moved on to keep their medal hopes alive.

Schnell – who finished sixth in the women’s synchronized 10-meter platform at the Paris Olympics ‒ almost didn’t advance out of the five-round prelims after poor second and third dives, which left her ranked 25th.

But the 25-year-old two-time Olympian from Michigan recovered well on her final dive with an inward 3 1/2 somersaults in the tuck position and a 3.2 degree of difficulty to finish with a score of 278.15.

First-time Olympian Daryn Wright ended prelims ranked 19th with a score of 272.25, just missing out on advancing. Wright – a 20-year-old diver for the Purdue Boilermakers – had a strong first round off a forward 3 1/2 somersaults in the pike position with a 3.0 degree of difficulty and was tied for eighth place. But she dropped to 22nd after the fourth round before finishing outside of the top 18 in her only Olympic event.

China’s defending Olympic gold and silver medalists, Quan Hongchan and Chen Yuxi, finished prelims ranked first and second, respectively. Quan’s top score was 421.25, while Chen in second posted a score of 382.15.

Semifinals for the women’s 10-meter platform are set for 9 a.m. ET Monday, and finals are Tuesday also at 9 a.m. ET. — Michelle Martinelli

PARIS – Stop the bullying, says Algerian boxer Imane Khelif.

Khelif, who was dragged into controversy over gender eligibility criteria at the Paris Olympics, has spoken out for the first time since the Games began. She and Taiwan’s Lin Yu-Ting have been subjected to abuse on social media and inaccurate online speculation about their sexes even though the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has said they both have met all criteria and that there’s no question they are women.

""I send a message to all the people of the world to uphold the Olympic principles and the Olympic Charter, to refrain from bullying all athletes, because this has effects, massive effects,"" Khelif said in an interview with SNTV, according to The Associated Press. ""It can destroy people, it can kill people’s thoughts, spirit and mind. It can divide people. And because of that, I ask them to refrain from bullying.""

Khelif and Yu-Ting have advanced to the semifinals at the Olympics, ensuring they’ll win at least bronze medals. — Josh Peter

Rai Benjamin qualifies for semis in 400m hurdles

Team USA hurdler Rai Benjamin qualified for the men's 400m hurdles semifinals at the Paris Olympics on Monday, clocking a time of 48.82 seconds for a first-place finish in the opening heat.

In Olympic preliminary heats, the top three finishers in each of five races automatically qualify for the semifinals, as well as the next three fastest times, for a total of 18 semifinal qualifiers.

Benjamin, 27, won silver in the event at the Tokyo Games in 2021, along with a gold in the men's 4x400 relay. He's not competing in the 4x400 relay in Paris, however, so the 400 hurdles is his lone chance at a medal.

Also qualifying for the semifinals for Team USA was CJ Allen, who ran 48.64 to finish second in Heat 3.

The semifinals for the 400m hurdles will be held Wednesday night, and medal races are scheduled for Friday. — Chase Goodbread

PARIS — The United States team of Seth Rider, Taylor Spivey, Morgan Pearson and Taylor Knibb took silver in the mixed triathlon relay Monday at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

The U.S. finished in a time of 1:25.40, 1/100th of a second behind gold-winning Germany and just ahead of bronze medal-winning Great Britain in a photo finish.

Great Britain, which won gold in 2020, led most of the race with Germany in second, but Knibb closed the gap for the U.S. with strong legs in swimming and biking in the final rotation before Germany's Laura Lindemann pulled ahead in the final moments of the run for the win. — Dave Birkett

Team USA will face Brazil in the Olympic men's basketball quarterfinals.,https://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/usa-basketball-vs-brazil-what-to-know-as-americans-set-to-meet-brazilian-kevin-durant-in-2024-olympics/,"The United States' quest for a fifth consecutive gold medal in men's basketball will continue on Tuesday with a quarterfinal matchup against Brazil at the 2024 Paris Olympics. Team USA went 3-0 in the group stage with a plus-64 point differential that earned it the top seed heading into the knockout rounds.

To little surprise, the Americans are heavy favorites against a Brazilian side that went 1-2 in the group stage and snuck into the quarterfinals via a point differential tiebreaker. Ahead of Tuesday's contest, here's everything you need to know:

Who starts for the Americans?

Team USA coach Steve Kerr has not been afraid to shake up his lineups or sit established NBA stars so far in this tournament. Perhaps most notably, Jayson Tatum received a DNP against Serbia and then started against South Sudan, while the exact opposite was true for Joel Embiid.

So what will Kerr do for the first knockout stage game, which affords no room for error?

LeBron James and Steph Curry are the only two players who have started every game, so we can lock them in. Embiid, too, feels like a certainty, given Brazil's physicality and offensive rebounding prowess. After that, it's less certain. Tatum is a great matchup for Brazil's most potent offensive threat, Bruno Caboclo, so he has a strong case, while the other guard spot will likely go to Jrue Holiday or Devin Booker.

Rebounding and defense key for Team USA

""We know what wins a FIBA game,"" Kerr said before the quarterfinal matchup. ""We are just completely focused on our defense.

""They're very physical. I think they're the No. 1 offensive rebounding team in the tournament. They've got a lot of really good shooters, and they just play hard. They compete play after play, so we'll have to be ready for their physicality and their shooting, and we need to be on edge and ready for them because they're not going to back down.""

For all the talk about the Americans' incredible offensive talent, they've also been dominant on the defensive end. In the group stage, they held opponents to 40% shooting overall, including 29% on 3-pointers, and recorded the most steals (32), defensive rebounds (95) and the second-most blocks (16).

Team USA will need to be alert on the boards Tuesday. Brazil has grabbed 39 offensive rebounds in three games so far, and second-chance points will be one of the few paths to an upset. Another will be from behind the arc, where Brazil is shooting a tournament-best 45.3%. If the Americans can control the glass and shut down the 3-point line, it's hard to see how Brazil scores enough to win.

Durant and Edwards leading the way off the bench

Even as the rest of the world has shrunk the talent gap with Team USA, no country can come anywhere close to matching the Americans' depth. Kevin Durant, Anthony Edwards and Anthony Davis all made the All-NBA Second Team last season, but none of them have started a game in this tournament.

It's no surprise, then, that Team USA has been crushing opposing bench units.

Edwards and Durant, in particular, have been unstoppable. The Timberwolves star is the leading scorer for Team USA at 16.7 points per game, while the former MVP is close behind at 16. Even more impressive, they're both shooting over 60% from the field in the tournament. If those two are on their game coming off the bench, it's going to be very hard for Brazil, or anyone else, to end Team USA's reign.

The Brazilian Kevin Durant

Once upon a time, Bruno Caboclo was one of the most intriguing prospects in the world. The No. 20 overall pick in the 2014 NBA Draft to the Toronto Raptors, he was dubbed the ""Brazilian Kevin Durant,"" while Fran Fraschilla described him as ""two years away from being two years away.""

His NBA career never got off the ground, as he appeared in just 105 games with four different franchises between 2014 and 2021. Since then, he has played professionally around the globe and most recently suited up for Partizan Belgrade in Serbia. He has also been a key figure for the Brazilian national team and is coming off a stunning 33-point, 17-rebound in the team's final group-stage win against Japan.

Caboclo can be inconsistent -- he didn't score in Brazil's first group-stage game versus France -- but the talent is there. Team USA will have to shut him down early because if he starts to feel it, he can be very difficult to stop.

First Olympic meeting since 1996

While Team USA is a staple at the Olympics, this is just the third time Brazil has been involved since the turn of the century, and that included their automatic inclusion as the hosts in 2016. Thus, it has been nearly three decades since the two countries have faced each other on this stage.

Coincidentally, that matchup also came in the quarterfinals. Team USA, led by Shaquille O'Neal, Scottie Pippen and Penny Hardaway, cruised to a 23-point win in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. A similar outcome is expected in Paris, as Team USA once again boasts a major talent advantage."
Team USA will face Brazil in the Olympic men's basketball quarterfinals.,https://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/usa-basketball-canada-germany-among-biggest-threats-to-americans-in-2024-olympics-mens-basketball/,"Heading into the knockout round(s) of the men's basketball tournament at the 2024 Paris Olympics, the United States is better than a 1-5 favorite (-550 at FanDuel) to go home with the gold medal, which would be the fifth straight for the Americans.

Eight teams are set to compete in the quarterfinals on Tuesday. The Americans will face Brazil at 3:30 p.m. ET.

It's going to take a significant upset to knock off Team USA. Not many teams on the list below are even guaranteed to get a shot at the U.S. based on the bracket, but if they do, which is the best bet to pull a stunner? You can make a case for five teams. Here they are in order of the biggest threat they would pose to the United States in a one-game scenario, which is all this tournament comes down to.

1. Canada

Gold medal odds: +750

The Canadians got through the ""Group of Death"" unscathed, finishing 3-0 with a +20 point differential, and with the deepest roster of NBA talent outside the U.S. they are the next-best bet to win gold. Betting odds don't always reflect true hierarchies, in this case, it is Canada that should most worry the Americans in a one-game scenario.

Germany is arguably the more stable team in terms of cohesion and having the most well-rounded attack, as the Canadians would likely struggle with the size of the Americans. But the bottom line is Canada has the deepest roster of NBA players outside the Americans, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander can be the best player on the floor no matter who's on the other side. R.J. Barrett, who actually leads Canada in scoring during these Olympics, has been fantastic.

Defensively, the Canadians can legitimately match up with and potentially even frustrate the Americans on the perimeter with the likes of Lu Dort, Dillon Brooks, Nickiel Alexander-Walker, Andrew Nembhard and Barrett. Jamal Murray has not looked good, but in a one-game scenario, we've seen him take over a game. If he has the right game at the right time, Canada definitely has the firepower on both ends to knock off the Americans.

2. Germany

Gold medal odds: +850

You can make a strong case the Germans should be ranked above Canada on this list and at the sports books. The depth of Canada's talent gives it the edge, and the fact that it has an easier quarterfinal vs. Greece (Germany has to play France in its opener, while Canada gets Greece), but we potentially won't have to speculate long as these two are on a semifinal collision course.

Germany won the 2023 World Cup and has been getting superstar performances out of Dennis Schroder and Franz Wagner so far at the Olympics. Together, they're averaging over 40 PPG, and both are getting into the lane with ease. Schroder is Germany's version of Gilgeous-Alexander with his ability to control the entire game, even against a defense as stout as the Americans. He put up 20 points and nine assists through three group-play games.

Germany has an edge over Canada on the interior, where Daniel Theis, Moe Wagner and Johannes Voigtmann provide legit size and depth with the ability to stretch the floor, giving Schroder and Wagner their room to work.

3. Serbia

Gold medal odds: +3400

The Americans walloped Serbia by 26 points in both teams' group-play opener. That was the same margin of victory for the U.S. in its exhibition matchup with Serbia leading up to the Olympics. So why would the Serbians have any chance against the U.S. in a potential semifinal matchup? Because they have Nikola Jokic.

Jokic is the best player in the world. Serbia doesn't use him the same way the Nuggets do, but he can still dictate an entire game. No single American player can defend him, and if Bogdan Bogdanovic, who led the Serbians in scoring through the group stage, were to get hot from 3 at the right time, yes, Servia would put a legit scare into the Americans.

The problem will be in the non-Jokic minutes, which Denver fans can relate to. Everyone saw the stat from the group-stage matchup, when Serbia matched the Americans 81-81 when Jokic was on the court. The problem was losing 29-3 in the minutes he spent on the bench. If -- and this is a major IF -- they could remedy maybe half of that while Jokic gets them to a, say, plus-10 in his court time, now we're talking upset.

4. Australia

Gold medal odds: +7500

Australia doesn't have the star power that France does in Victor Wembanyama, but based on what I've seen out of this tournament, I would give the Boomers a better shot at pulling an upset over the Americans. The Australians, who won Bronze at the last Olympics and are led by Josh Giddey, who has been superb, and Patty Mills, have way more perimeter punch than the French.

Dyson Daniels, Josh Green and Dante Exum can all create two-way havoc, Jock Landale can be a monster on the offensive glass, and don't forget about Jack McVeigh, a bonafide gunner who splashed seven of his 14 3-pointers in the group stage. Australia is going to have to get through Serbia even to have a shot at the Americans, but there's a world in which the Boomer could give the U.S. trouble on the right night.

5. France

Gold medal odds: +4600

Coming into the tournament, I thought France would play the U.S. for gold. Instead, they barely squeaked past Japan on a bogus end-of-game four-point play and then got trounced by Germany to land squarely in Canada's quarterfinal sights.

In that game, France will likely hurt the Canadians pretty badly with its size, but the perimeter matchup should be a bloodbath of equal, if not greater, proportions. Independent of this quarterfinal matchup, it's much harder to see France giving the Americans a real game in a potential matchup down the line, even should it get through Canada and all the way to the gold-medal game.

The guard play just isn't there. I thought Evan Fournier could bring more to this environment. Nando De Colo isn't scaring anyone anymore. The one blueprint the French would have for upsetting the U.S. is if Victor Wembanyama and Rudy Gobert are so defensively dominant inside that the U.S. is forced to lean heavily on jump shots, and then they go cold. All of them. At the same time. It's not likely to happen."

Anderson scored 20 points, Holt scored 13 and Russell scored 11 as Team USA beat Brazil 3-1 (26-24, 28-30, 25-19, 25-19) and advanced to the semifinals.

Brazil grabbed an early 5-2 Set 1 lead as Team USA wasn’t able to respond to Brazil’s fast-moving attacks, keeping its lead later into the set at 10-6. At this point, out of the three Nittany Lions, only Anderson was on the scoresheet with one kill.

Back-to-back points by Russell and Holt cut Brazil’s lead to 11-8, but the U.S. was still not able to match the speed of Brazil’s attacks.

Coming out of a timeout with the score 13-8, the U.S. scored three in a row, including a kill by Holt, to make the score 13-11, forcing Brazil to take a timeout.

Anderson’s third kill of the match tied the score at 16-16 as both teams raced to 25 points. Neither team gained a significant advantage from that point, as the set remained tied 21-21 after blocks by Anderson and Holt.

Russell and Holt combined for two kills in the final moments of the set, giving Team USA a 26-24 Set 1 win.

Into Set 2, Anderson, Russell and Holt all scored as the U.S. held an early 7-3 lead. The American squad kept their foot on the gas, leading 12-7 after more kills by Holt and Anderson.

The U.S. kept its five point advantage at 17-12 with Anderson dominating at the net. However, Brazil started mounting a comeback and cut the lead 18-15, forcing Team USA to take a timeout.

Anderson remained a major factor in the match, as his seventh kill gave the U.S. a 22-19 lead nearing the end of Set 2. Despite his efforts, Brazil stormed back and tied the set 25-25. Neither team could reach the two-point lead required to win the set as the scoreboard showed 28-28.

Back-to-back errors by Russell lost the set for Team USA 28-30, as Brazil evened the match score to 1-1.

Set 3 featured an even start with both teams tied 4-4. However, a 3-0 run by the U.S. featuring a kill by Russell put Team USA out in front 7-4. Another block by Anderson kept the U.S.’s point advantage at 9-5.

The three Nittany Lions all scored to extend Team USA’s lead to 15-9. Brazil then narrowed the lead, but the U.S. stayed in front 19-15 heading into the final volleys of Set 3.

Needing to close out the set, Anderson’s 12th kill of the match extended the U.S. lead 22-17. Team USA would go on to win Set 3 with a 25-19 score, taking a 2-1 match lead.

Looking to end the match in four sets, Team USA was once again tied 4-4 at the start of Set 4. Neither team could grab a lead larger than one point as the score remained tied at 10 apiece.

Anderson broke the tie with two kills, giving Team USA a 12-10 lead. However, Brazil immediately answered, tying it up at 12 a piece. Both teams traded points afterwards, keeping the set tied 14-14.

A 4-2 run allowed the U.S. to start pulling away 18-16 after multiple errors by Brazil. Taylor Averill’s fourth kill of the match allowed Team USA’s lead to increase to 19-16 and forced Brazil to call a timeout.

An ace by Holt helped the U.S. to go up 21-17, but back-to-back errors by Anderson cut the lead to 21-19. Coming out of a timeout, Anderson’s 17th kill of the match gave Team USA a 23-19 advantage.

With a 24-19 match point for the U.S., the final point scored by Averill won Set 4 for Team USA 25-19, sealing the U.S.’s match victory 3-1 and clinching the American squad’s spot in the semifinals.

2024 Paris Olympic men's basketball power rankings

8. Brazil

Quarterfinals opponent: United States

Brazil finished third in Group B with a 1-2 record. It lost its first two games to France and Germany by an average of 12.5 points but rebounded with a 102-84 win over Japan.

Brazil is led by former NBA player Bruno Caboclo, a 6-9 forward who's averaging 13 points and 7.3 rebounds. It also has a 3-point specialist in Vitor Benite, who's averaging 14.3 points on 56.3% shooting from deep.

Brazil's defense allowed it to hang around with France and Germany, but it lacks the firepower on offense to be a true competitor. It's only averaging 80.3 points per game, which is the second-lowest average of the remaining teams.

7. Greece

Quarterfinals opponent: Germany

Greece finished third in Group A with a 1-2 record. It lost its first two games to Canada and Spain by an average of seven points but stayed alive with a 77-71 win over Australia.

Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo leads all Olympic players in points per game (27) to go along with 7.7 rebounds. He's joined by Vasilis Toliopoulos, a 6-2 guard who's averaging 12 points.

Greece's game plan is to play good defense and get the ball to Antetokounmpo. Still, it ranks last among the remaining teams in points per game (77.7), shooting percentage (42.9%) and 3-point percentage (30.3%).

6. Australia

Quarterfinals opponent: Serbia

Australia finished second in Group A with a 1-2 record. It began with a 92-80 win over Spain but lost its final two games against Canada and Greece by an average of eight points.

Australia is a talented team with NBA guards such as Chicago's Josh Giddey and Miami's Patty Mills. Its frontcourt is also anchored by Houston's Jock Landale, who's averaging 17.7 points and 9.7 rebounds per game.

Despite losing to Greece in group play, I have more faith in Australia to make a run in the knockout round. The Boomers only shot 33.3% from deep in their two losses, but they have the weapons to improve that percentage.

5. France

Quarterfinals opponent: Canada

France finished second in Group B with a 2-1 record. It won its first two games against Brazil and Japan by an average of three points but suffered an 85-71 loss to Germany.

France has a rising star in San Antonio's Victor Wembanyama, a 7-4 forward who's averaging 17 points and 10.7 rebounds in the Olympics on 43.8% shooting from deep. He forms an elite frontcourt duo with Minnesota's Rudy Gobert.

France didn't look very impressive in group play as it barely defeated Brazil and Japan. But the team has enough talent to make a run in the knockout round, and it'll have a home crowd on its side.

4. Serbia

Quarterfinals opponent: Australia

Serbia finished second in Group C with a 2-1 record. It suffered a 110-84 loss to the United States before it earned wins over Puerto Rico and South Sudan by an average of 26 points.

Denver's Nikola Jokic is the reigning NBA MVP, and he's averaging 18.7 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists in the Olympics. He's joined by Atlanta guard Bogdan Bogdanovic, who's averaging 19 points on a blistering 52.9% shooting from deep.

It's hard to contain Serbia's offense, which ranks second among the remaining teams in points per game (95.7). It specializes in getting high-quality looks at the rim and frequent trips to the free-throw line.

3. Canada

Quarterfinals opponent: France

Canada finished first in Group A with a 3-0 record. It beat Australia, Greece and Spain by an average of 6.7 points.

Canada has two red-hot scorers in OKC's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and New York's RJ Barrett, who are averaging 19 and 21 points, respectively. It also has two of the tournament's best perimeter defenders in OKC's Lu Dort and Houston's Dillon Brooks.

Canada's biggest weakness is that it's undersized, which will make its quarterfinals matchup against France a tough one. Still, this a well-balanced team that established itself as a contender by going undefeated in the toughest group.

2. Germany

Quarterfinals opponent: Greece

Germany finished first in Group B with a 3-0 record. It beat France, Brazil and Japan by an average of 15.7 points.

Germany's leader is Brooklyn guard Dennis Schroder, who's averaging 19.7 points and nine assists. Then there's Orlando forward Franz Wagner, who's averaging 21.7 points despite only being 22 years old.

Germany boasts one of the best scoring duos in the tournament, and it has a pair of solid rim protectors in New Orleans' Daniel Theis and Orlando's Moritz Wagner. This team has all the pieces to win its first Olympic medal.

Quarterfinals opponent: Brazil

The United States finished first in Group C with a 3-0 record. It beat Serbia, South Sudan and Puerto Rico by an average of 21.3 points.

Team USA is so deep that its leading scorers, Phoenix's Kevin Durant (19.2 points per game) and Minnesota's Anthony Edwards (18 points per game) are coming off the bench. It also boasts other NBA superstars such as the Los Angeles Lakers' LeBron James and Golden State's Stephen Curry.

Team USA leads all teams in points per game (105.7), and it has an overwhelming advantage when it comes to talent. Even though it'll face some tough competition along the way, this team is the clear favorite to win gold."
Team USA will face Brazil in the Olympic men's basketball quarterfinals.,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5679493/2024/08/04/team-usa-olympics-bracket/,"PARIS – The focus for Team USA may be on Brazil, a team they haven’t seen this summer, but awaiting the American stars in an Olympic semifinal will be a very familiar face.

The U.S., ranked No. 1 overall through the group stage in men’s basketball with a 3-0 record and point differential of plus-64, plays Brazil in the last quarterfinal of four on Tuesday, at 3:30 p.m. eastern. The Americans are seeking their fifth consecutive gold medal and, yes, have beaten every team they’ve played at the Olympics comfortably, but overlooking the Brazilians could be a grave, unaffordable mistake. Losses end medal hopes now.

But with the goal the U.S. has – gold, of course, and nothing less as the favorite to win the tournament – it’s reasonable to at least take a peek at the rest of the path, which is available now that the Paris Games has released a bracket for the knockout stages.

The other two teams on the Americans’ side of the bracket are Serbia, who they’ve beaten twice in the last few weeks, and Australia, who they beat narrowly on July 15 in Abu Dhabi. The Olympic semifinals are Thursday and the medal games are Saturday.

“Looking at the bracket, it probably played out as it should have,” Kerr said Sunday.

What he meant is all the highest ranked teams are on the other side. Canada (3-0) plays France (2-1) at noon eastern, and Germany (3-0, No. 2 overall) plays Greece (1-2) at 5 a.m. eastern. The Germans are the defending World Cup champions, the Canadians have an NBA-stocked roster, with stars Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jamal Murray, and the French have NBA Rookie of the Year Victor Wembanyama and Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert. Greece will not be favored to beat Germany, but the Greeks nevertheless have two-time NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo.

But if you’re thinking the U.S. caught a break with the bracket (there was a draw, so theoretically it could have been the winner of either of the other two games awaiting the USA-Brazil winner)…slow down.

Serbia has the reigning NBA MVP Nikola Jokić, Atlanta Hawks sharpshooter Bogdan Bogdanovic, and the mix of size and 3-point shooting that can be the formula for beating the U.S. The Australians have numerous NBA players, including Josh Giddey, who gave the U.S. a ton of problems in a 98-92 loss to the Americans last month.

“(The draw) doesn’t mean anything to us because all these teams are really good at this point and it’s one and done, so we got to be ready for everybody,” Kerr said.

The Serbian threat to the U.S. Olympic dynasty has not materialized in two previous games this summer. But what’s the old adage in the National Football League, about having to beat a team three times in one season when two divisional foes meet in the playoffs? A U.S.-Serbia matchup would be like that, and the two blowouts the Americans have over the Serbians so far should not cloud anyone’s judgment as to the difficulty of that potential semifinal match.

GO DEEPER U.S. men's basketball thwarts Puerto Rico to secure No. 1 seed

When the U.S. blasted Serbia 105-79 on July 17 in Abu Dhabi, the Serbians had played Australia the night before and Bogdanovic didn’t play against the Americans. The U.S. made 16 3s and Steph Curry enjoyed what turned out to be easily his best game this summer with 24 points (he’s shooting 43 percent from the field for the summer). That game was tied at 40 midway through the second quarter.

In the second game between the two, which was the Olympic opener for both clubs, the U.S. again won handily, 110-84, behind 23 points from Kevin Durant in his 2024 USA debut. But it was a tense first half marked by the Serbians’ relentless ball pressure, which the Americans struggled to handle. The Americans pulled away with 18 3s in that one

In two games against the U.S., Jokić is averaging 18 points, eight rebounds, and five assists. The Americans have effectively used a trio of bigs – Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis, and Bam Adebayo – to slow Jokić down, but if Bogdanovic were to catch fire (as he did in a win over the U.S. at the 2019 World Cup, in which he scored 28 points with seven 3s) the Serbians become a tougher cover. Bogdanovic, not Jokić, is the Serbs’ all-time leading scorer.

The Australians, meanwhile, were within four of the U.S. with 3.4 seconds left after trailing by as many as 23. The Americans committed 18 turnovers in their friendly with Australia and confessed to falling asleep after building a huge lead early. Jock Landale of the Houston Rockets hurt the U.S. with 20 points. Giddey added 17 points, eight rebounds, and seven assists.

All of which to say, whomever advances from the 8:30 a.m. eastern match between Serbia (2-1) and Australia (1-2) should not be taken lightly.

“There a lot of great teams right now, obviously Canada, Germany, I like the battles Greece has had,” said LeBron James, the Americans’ leading scorer this summer at 14.5 ppg in eight games. “Serbia, we had them in our group play. We know what they’re capable of. Australia. So it’s a lot of great teams and we got to be ready for whoever our matchup is, no matter who it is.”

Brazil is of course not an afterthought. In Olympic pool play last week, the Brazilians lost by 13 to Germany and by 12 to France, before beating Japan with 17 3s.

Gui Santos, who is averaging 7.3 points at the Olympics, appeared in 23 games for Kerr on the Golden State Warriors last season. Joao Cardosa, Bruno Caboclo, Didi Louzado, Cristiano Felicio, Marcelinho Huertas, and Raul Neto all have NBA experience – constituting more than half the roster.

“They’re very physical. I think they’re the number one offensive rebounding team in the tournament,” Kerr said. “They made 17 threes against Japan, so they got a lot of really good shooters and they just play hard. They compete play after play, so we’ll have to be ready for their physicality and they’re shooting and we need to be on edge and ready for them because they’re not going to back down.”

United States vs. Brazil storylines

Any doubts about Team USA's ability to dominate in the Olympics have been proven wrong. The United States played brilliantly in all three of their group phase games. They beat Serbia 110-84 before dismantling South Sudan by a score of 103-86. Most recently, they won decisively over Puerto Rico by a score of 104-83.

The Americans lead all Olympic teams in scoring with 105.7 points per game, which is 10 more points than the next best squad. All of their games have been blowouts, but some think that Brazil has had an easy run thus far. The criticisms will remain true against Brazil, as they are only 1-2 and only have one active NBA player on their roster.

Even so, the game against Brazil won't be a cake walk. The Brazilians play a tough and physical brand of basketball that can wear opponents down. They particularly thrive on the glass collecting rebounds. The team's lone NBA player is Gui Santos. A member of the Golden State Warriors, Santos is scoring 7.3 points per game in the Olympics.

Brazil has scored by committee. They only have two players averaging double-digit scoring figures (Vitor Benite and Bruno Caboclo), but nine of the 12 players on their roster are scoring at least five points per game. Caboclo has been one of the best stories during the Olympics.

The 2014 NBA draftee was dubbed being “two years away from being two years away” on draft night, and he never was able to find his footing in the NBA. A decade later, though, he is thriving in the highest level of competition.

Unfortunately for Brazil, the United States basketball team is on a roll right now. Kevin Durant has yet again had an incredible Olympic run, and the best player in Team USA history is not far away from becoming the United States' all-time scoring leader in international play, including in the women's division. He made his first seven three-point attempts before finally missing in the team's third game.

LeBron James has also played incredibly for the United States. He is third on the team in scoring (14.3), first in assists (7.3), and third in rebounds (6.7). Team USA's most recent player of the game was Anthony Edwards. Before the start of the Olympics, Edwards – who was the best player on the 2023 FIBA World Cup team – claimed that he would be the team's number on option.

While that hasn't necessarily been the case throughout all of the Olympics, Edwards showed he has that type of talent during the game against Puerto Rico. Edwards had a game-high 25 points, as he made eight of his nine shots from inside the arc.

The United States will get a boost against Brazil, too, as Jrue Holiday, who missed the last game with an ankle injury, is set to return to the lineup. Holiday, who is an incredible defensive player, had been a starter for Steve Kerr's squad prior to his injury.

So, will Team USA's hot streak continue, or will the Cinderella team from Brazil create one of the biggest upset victories in sports history?"

Team USA will face Brazil in the Olympic men's basketball quarterfinals.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/08/03/us-mens-basketball-puerto-rico/,"VILLENEUVE-D’ASCQ, France — The U.S. men’s basketball team looked as if it had fallen into a collective slumber when its least acclaimed member finally shook the group awake. With little at stake against an overmatched opponent, the United States stumbled out of the gate against Puerto Rico in its third and final group stage game at the Olympics. Having locked up a spot in the quarterfinals already, the Americans needed only to go through the motions against Puerto Rico, which was already eliminated from the tournament after losing its first two games and had just one current NBA player, New Orleans Pelicans guard Jose Alvarado, on its roster.

But going through the motions proved to be an arduous challenge for Team USA, which trailed Puerto Rico early in the second quarter before pulling away for a 104-83 blowout victory at Stade Pierre-Mauroy on Saturday. The U.S. team’s spark came from backup guard Derrick White, the only member of the 12-man roster who hasn’t been an NBA all-star and whose presence at the Olympics was made possible only by the U.S. team’s decision to part ways with Kawhi Leonard after training camp last month.

The 30-year-old White, fresh off winning a championship with the Boston Celtics in June, intercepted an inbounds pass after a dunk by Anthony Davis. The hustle play led to Kevin Durant hitting an open three-pointer. Shortly thereafter, White found Anthony Edwards in the corner for a three-pointer that re-energized an expectant crowd.

The United States is heavy on star power with Durant, LeBron James and Stephen Curry, but it will need unselfish passing and energetic defensive plays like the ones White delivered as it enters the knockout phase of the tournament. With the win over Puerto Rico, the United States won Group C with a 3-0 record and posted the highest opening-round point differential — plus-64, topping Germany’s plus-47 — to clinch the No. 1 seed in the quarterfinals.

The United States will face Brazil, which went 1-2 in Group B, on Tuesday at Bercy Arena in Paris. If the Americans beat Brazil, they will face the winner of Serbia and Australia in a semifinal Thursday. On the other side of the bracket, Germany will play Greece in one quarterfinal, and Canada will face France in the other.

“Lille was incredible to us,” Durant said of the opening-round host city, which sits near the Belgium border in northern France. “I loved being here. I’ve never been to this city and never thought I would come to a city like this. It was an incredible atmosphere. They showed us so much love.”

U.S. Coach Steve Kerr used his third different starting lineup of the opening round by deploying Curry, James, Jayson Tatum, Devin Booker and Joel Embiid; Jrue Holiday sat out because of a minor ankle injury. The Americans played even with Puerto Rico until midway through the first period, again raising questions about whether Kerr should consider using Durant, Edwards or Davis in his starting five.

Edwards finished with a game-high 26 points, leading six players in double figures. James had 10 points, six rebounds and eight assists, while Durant added 11 points off the bench. Alvarado led Puerto Rico with 18 points.

“We got done what we wanted to accomplish: winning all three games and securing the top seed,” Kerr said. “We know we have to play better. Part of this tournament is that it gets harder as you go.”

Make no mistake, the U.S. men will face tougher tests in the knockout round. Canada (3-0) and Germany (3-0) played very well in their opening-round games to win Group A and Group B, respectively, and their rosters are loaded with NBA talent.

Canada went undefeated in the “Group of Death” with wins over Australia, Greece and Spain. With NBA MVP runner-up Shai Gilgeous-Alexander at the helm, the Canadians showed excellent poise in late-game situations, and their undersized front line held up against Greece’s Giannis Antetokounmpo. While Jamal Murray has struggled to produce in limited minutes, Canada has received quality contributions from RJ Barrett, Dillon Brooks and Andrew Nembhard, among its other NBA players.

The Canadians, who are guided by new Brooklyn Nets coach Jordi Fernandez and play an isolation-heavy style, enjoy an added confidence boost thanks to their win over the United States in the bronze medal game of last year’s FIBA World Cup.

“We don’t want to lose,” Gilgeous-Alexander said Friday, adding that Canada was “absolutely” focused on claiming its first Olympic gold medal.

Meanwhile, Germany authored perhaps the most impressive win of the opening round by claiming an 85-71 blowout win over Victor Wembanyama and France on Friday. Led by Dennis Schröder and Franz Wagner, the Germans boast a complete roster that includes a physical front line, quality wings and quick guards. Germany beat the United States in the semifinals and took gold at last year’s FIBA World Cup, and it handled France, Brazil and Japan in the group stage with ease.

Against France, Wagner outplayed Wembanyama to hush a raucous crowd that began the night jumping up and down in anticipation. The Germans remained tight-lipped about their medal chances following the victory, but France Coach Vincent Collet credited their pressure defense for short-circuiting his team’s offense and flummoxing Wembanyama, who finished with 14 points.

Wembanyama “stopped the ball too much,” Collet said. “Against that kind of aggressiveness, you can’t play that way. You are never one-on-one because they come to double-team, and there’s no space to operate. It’s important to move the ball.”

Collet added that the one-sided loss was cause for concern as France, under heavy pressure from its fans to win another Olympic medal, prepares to face Canada in the quarterfinals. France was the only team to beat the United States during the Tokyo Olympics before losing a rematch in the gold medal game to take silver.

“There’s a lot of great teams right now,” James said. “Obviously, Canada and Germany. I like the battle that Greece has had. … I wasn’t very impressed with [France’s] last game. I didn’t think they were ready for the physicality of Germany, but other than that they’ve been playing some good ball.”

The United States should consider itself very fortunate to have landed on the opposite side of the knockout-round bracket from Germany, Canada and France; it has scored two blowout wins over Serbia this summer and has the size inside and on the wings to punish Australia.

As the Americans put the closing touches on their snoozer vs. Puerto Rico, Edwards brought the crowd to its feet with a picture-perfect windmill dunk in transition.

• 2024 Olympics: Complete coverage

PARIS — They are serenaded by global basketball fans, surrounded by security and stuck with gold medal expectations. Welcome to the Olympic world that American basketball created for itself.

Three games are done. There’s three to go. There haven’t been any hiccups along the way — all drama was confined to the French booing of Joel Embiid and Jayson Tatum sitting out a game — and none are anticipated at Bercy Arena, starting Tuesday against Brazil.

The only shreds of imperfection lie with turnovers, not unusual for a team assembled on the fly. And this roster is too rich with talent to allow that to cause major issues.

“Everything is in order,” said Anthony Davis. “We’re playing for each other. Now it’s all about keeping that pace and minimizing our mistakes.”

Here’s a look at each member, what they’ve done (or haven’t) at this important stage, and what to expect in the unforgiving win-or-else medal round:

LeBron James

He’s pushing 40, yet he’s the face of this team. His coaches and teammates defer to him, the ultimate sign of respect. His play in the warmup games was stellar, and he followed up by being solid in the group play — third on the team in scoring (14.3 ppg) and rebounds (6.7), tops in assists (7.3). He’s the unquestioned leader.

None of those games in Lille were close. If that changes here in the medal round, chances are good LeBron will have the ball in the moment of truth and will decide who’ll be the hero — by passing to a teammate, or taking it himself.

Kevin Durant

He is Mr. USA Basketball and didn’t allow a calf strain to threaten that title through one week of 2024. You can even make the case that, on a per-minute basis, KD (averaging 16 points on 63% shooting in 17 minutes) is once again the most productive scorer on Team USA — just as he was in the last two Olympics.

He hasn’t started a game, not that coming off the bench has diminished his energy, enthusiasm or production. KD is saying all the right things about that — “whatever the coach wants me to do” blah, blah — but deep inside probably feels he deserves to start. He might this week, and even if he doesn’t, he’s the best sixth man USA Basketball ever had.

Anthony Edwards

His playful and semi-serious pre-Olympic prediction that the team would revolve around him has somewhat rung true — Edwards leads the team in scoring at 16.7. For the most part, though, his role is more as a supporting player off the bench. He has been forceful with that responsibility and seems to embrace it — no ego shown here.

Besides, team-wise this experience is going better than his Team USA stint last year at the World Cup, so he’s OK.

Bam Adebayo

He has just been so solid all around — defensively, with his improved shooting range, on the glass. This gives him the edge over Davis as the USA’s most imposing big man, a close battle between the two of them.

So far, this Team USA experience for Bam is a progression from the Tokyo Olympics. At this rate, he’s probably a strong favorite to rep USA four years from now in L.A., although first things first — USA could use more of this in the medal round.

Anthony Davis

He worked well off the bench (partnering with Bam) and he worked well in the starting lineup for one game. His versatility and impact at both ends has helped the USA handle any opposing big man threats.

Derrick White

If this were an NBA season, getting White would be the midseason acquisition of the year. Defense, switches, passing, he has been all that since replacing Kawhi Leonard. He said he wasn’t sure what to expect, and that was also the sentiment of a lot of folks.

His addition was somewhat controversial if only because it came at the expense of his Celtics teammate Jaylen Brown. But White was the guy all along, because of how well he complements stars, which obviously is needed on a stacked Team USA.

Devin Booker

More than any of the big shooters and scorers on this team, Booker has changed his game. He’s under control and minimized mistakes while ranking second to LeBron in assists. His defense is a pleasant … surprise? Because of his shooting, that part of his game was overlooked in the NBA.

Kerr asked him to embrace other roles and functions and he did so without complaint and with energy. That’s why coach Steve Kerr had him start regularly, because Booker helped set a positive pace.

Jayson Tatum

He went from not playing at all — the horrors! — to starting two games. So this has been a weird experience for him. He responded well, played decently once given the chance and despite missing that game is leading the team in rebounding. By all indications, he won’t need to worry about collecting dust going forward. That was a one-time thing.

Jrue Holiday

He fits this team’s emphasis on defense. That’s the best description of his value so far. He’s useful in the starting lineup because he has shown to be a better on-ball defender than anyone else in that lineup.

Steph Curry

Here in his first taste of the Olympics, dare we say Steph has looked at times like … a rookie? That’s not to be disrespectful, only to reflect his shooting struggles (26% from deep). Which of course is something he’s capable of overcoming, based on his history of doing just that.

Joel Embiid

Not sure if this is going well for him, at least so far. He doesn’t appear to be at his peak physically and his performances, dogged by errors, have been sketchy other than against Puerto Rico. That said, he’s still holding down a starting position because the coaching staff believe it’s best.

And keep in mind, situations can change in a flash; as his stamina improves, Embiid is capable of dominating stretches.

Tyrese Haliburton

He’s just the odd man out on a team rich with talent, and this was projected at the outset as his most likely situation. Haliburton has good-soldiered his way through playing just 18 minutes, and if nothing else is positioned to grab a nice medal from it.

Team USA will face Brazil in the Olympic men's basketball quarterfinals.,https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10130714-lebron-james-steve-kerr-praise-brazil-before-usa-vs-brazil-on-2024-olympics-bracket,"SAMEER AL-DOUMY/AFP via Getty Images

After dominating the group stage of the 2024 Paris Olympics, USA Basketball is ready for even bigger challenges in the knockout round.

LeBron James said he has been scouting Brazil ahead of Tuesday's quarterfinal matchup.

""I've watched all the games,"" James said, per ESPN's Brian Windhorst. ""They're very dedicated to their offensive and defensive systems.""

Team USA head coach Steve Kerr also had praise for his team's Brazilian opponents.

""They're very physical. I think they're the No. 1 offensive rebounding team in the tournament,"" Kerr said, per Windhorst. ""They've got a lot of really good shooters and they just play hard.

""They compete play after play, so we'll have to be ready for their physicality and their shooting, and we need to be on edge and ready for them because they're not going to back down.""

Brazil is led by international veteran Vitor Benite and former first-round NBA draft pick Bruno Caboclo.

Benite and Caboclo have led their team to record 13 offensive rebounds per game through three tournament contests, second only to South Sudan for the most in the Olympics. Team USA ranks ninth in the category with 9.3 per game.

The Americans also struggled with turnovers through three group stage games, averaging 14.3 turnovers in each victory. Kerr previously said heading into the knockout round that Team USA needs to ""take better care of the ball"" heading into the knockout round.

The biggest strength for Team USA will be the offensive talent of stars like James, while generating offense will be a challenge for Brazil. The Brazilians are averaging 80.3 points per game to the Americans' 105.7 per contest.

The Brazilians also enter the contest having won just a single match so far against a Japan team missing Rui Hachimura, while marking losses against Germany and France in group play."
Team USA will face Brazil in the Olympic men's basketball quarterfinals.,https://bvmsports.com/2024/08/05/brazil-vs-team-usa-in-2024-olympic-mens-basketball-roster-results-and-matchups-revealed/,"Brazil's men's basketball team is set to face Team USA in the quarterfinals of the 2024 Olympics after advancing with a 1-2 record in pool play. Historically, Brazil has not secured a medal since 1964. The team includes standout player Bruno Caboclo, who recently scored 33 points against Japan. With a mix of seasoned NBA players and international talent, Brazil aims to challenge Team USA, who dominated their pool games.

Brazil finished the pool stage with a 1-2 record, advancing by a narrow point differential over Greece.

Bruno Caboclo recorded 33 points and 18 rebounds in Brazil's last game against Japan.

While Brazil boasts experienced players with NBA backgrounds, their inconsistent performance in pool play raises doubts about their ability to compete against a strong USA team, which has won every Olympic matchup against Brazil.

Brazil has qualified for the Olympic basketball quarterfinals despite finishing 1-2 in Pool B.

Team USA is favored to win, having outscored opponents by an average of 21.3 points in their pool games.

As Brazil prepares for the face-off against Team USA, the team will need to maximize its offensive output and improve defensive strategies to stand a chance in the upcoming match.

Brazil’s journey to reclaiming Olympic basketball glory hinges on being able to harness the talents of its key players while overcoming historical challenges against Team USA. A strong showing against the Americans is critical for momentum in future matches."

Since the Serbia vs South Sudan game is over, which was the last game of the pool games, quarter-final pairings are confirmed. So, the next opponent that Team USA will face is Brazil from Group B. Achieving the historic feat, the Brazilian team has finally made it to the top four spot after 56 years. The last time they won a medal[Bronze] in the Olympics was in Japan in 1964.

Team USA is oozing confidence as they step into the quarter-finals with 3-0, while the Brazilian is coming off 1-2 in group play. So, the chances of Dream Team 2.0 moving past the quarter-final stage do not seem unfavorable. The statement relies on the faceoff history of Brazil and Team USA in basketball at the Olympics. Out of the 9 showdowns that both of the teams have at the Summer Olympics, Team USA is leading over the Brazilian team with the complete sweep.

Coming to the semi-finals and finals, Serbia is expected to be Team USA’s opponent in the Semi-Finals and Germany in the Finals on a speculative basis since it is to be decided. Further breakdowns of other nations’ clashing in the QF are discussed below.

Schedule Ahead for the Basketball Tournament at the Paris Olympics

For the Quarter Finals ahead in teams’ quest for the Olympics, the teams moving forward from Group A are Greece, Canada, and Australia. France, Brazil, and Germany are the ones moving ahead from Group B, while from Group C, Serbia and Team USA will advance ahead.

Coming to the pairings of the tournaments ahead, the following teams will face each other in Paris on August 6, 2024, for the semifinal spot.

Germany Paris (France) Greece Tuesday, August 6, 11:00 AM CET

Serbia Paris (France) Australia Tuesday, August 6, 02:30 PM CET

France Paris (France) Canada Tuesday, August 6, 06:00 PM CET

Brazil Paris (France) USA Tuesday, August 6, 09:30 PM CET

Showdowns between other teams

Apart from Team USA, there will be six other teams who will be engaged in a fierce on-court battle to move into the semis. Let us discuss the expectations of other candidates as well.

Germany vs Greece

When we peep into the past to look at the basketball showdowns between Greece and Germany, Greece is on the top. It has won 12 out of 20 times it has faced a German basketball team. Only one of these on-court battles got to the Summer Olympics in 2008, where Greece secured victory over Germany. However, the latter is in a better position now, being the reigning FIBA World Cup champion. Coming off 3-0 group play, Germany is determined to pave its way past Greece racked 1-2 in pool games with losses against Spain and Canada.

Serbia vs Australia

The Silver medalists of the 2016 Olympics, Serbia, are coming off a 2-1 pool play with their only loss against Team USA. One of the top contenders for the gold medal after the USA, Serbia lost against the Boomers in the exhibition games on July 16 with an 84-73 scoreline. However, when it comes to Olympic clashes, Serbia won over Australia in the 2016 Olympic semi-finals, winning by a margin of 36 points. Serbia has got their elite NBA MVP Nikola Jokic determined to clinch gold from Team USA. On the other end, there are Boomers who hold experience in close encounters, making the top eight in 12 of the last 13 Olympics.

France vs Canada

The host and basketball Les Blues are 3x silver medalists in the Olympics, with their last one coming off in 2021. However, despite NBA DPOY Rudy Gobert and a prodigy like Victor Wembanyama, the French team could not get past the group games with a sweep. They lost to Germany, making their group play stat 2-1. Canada, on the other hand, is quite convinced of moving ahead with their 3-0 pool play. But the past encounters overall do not seem to side with the Canadian team, as they have only won two out of eight games against France on the international stage. The only edge they have is their last victory against France at the FIBA Basketball World Cup 2023 by a 30-point margin. Therefore, the showdown is expected to be a close-cut match, considering the NBA-level talents like Andrew Wiggins and Shai-Gilgeous Alexander on the Canadian side.

With that being concluded, we’ll meet after the Basketball quarter-finals at the Paris Olympics to tell the tale of Team USA basketball’s on-court maneuvers. Till then keep reading the ongoing sparks of the NBA world only on Essentially Sports!

With 61 total medals, Team USA opened up a 20-medal advantage over second-place France. And following a gold medal-less Day 7, the U.S. is now up to 14 golds and sits just two behind China for first.

Simone Biles reclaims vault gold, Jade Carey takes bronze

Simone Biles added another chapter to her comeback story with a gold medal triumph in the women's vault. Biles, who won the event at the 2016 Rio Games, reclaimed the Olympic title with a score of 15.300. The 27-year-old broke out the Yurchenko double pike, also known as the Biles II, to score a 15.700 on her first attempt before posting a 14.900 on her second attempt.

Biles, the most-decorated American gymnast of all time, became just the second woman to win vault gold twice, joining Vera Casalavska of Czechoslovakia. With three gold medals in Paris (vault, individual all-around, team all-around), she now owns seven for her career and 10 Olympic medals overall.

Jade Carey, meanwhile, earned bronze in vault with a score of 14.466, finishing behind silver medalist Rebeca Andrade of Brazil. Carey, who also helped Team USA win all-around gold, has won two medals in Paris and owns three for her career.

Katie Ledecky secures historic 9th gold with four-peat in 800m free

Katie Ledecky closed out her latest Olympics by making even more history. The 27-year-old fended off Australia's reigning silver medalist Ariarne Titmus to win the women's 800m freestyle for a fourth straight time, finishing in 8:11.04.

Ledecky joined Michael Phelps as the only swimmers to ever win Olympic gold four times in the same event. And with nine gold medals, she's now tied with four other athletes for the second-most Olympic titles of all time. Only Phelps, who claimed 23 Olympic golds in his legendary career, owns more.

American Paige Madden (8:13.00) finished behind Titmus (8:12.29) to earn her second medal of the Paris Olympics and third overall. She also won silver in the 4x200m freestyle relay earlier in the Games when she teamed up with Ledecky. In addition to Ledecky's 800m free gold and 4x200m free relay silver, she also claimed a 1500m free gold and 400m free bronze in Paris.

Ryan Crouser, Joe Kovacs finish 1-2 in shot put again

Ryan Crouser and Joe Kovacs continued to own the men's shot put competition. Crouser, the world-record holder, became the first athlete to capture three Olympic shot put titles -- and he won them consecutively. The 31-year-old, who battled elbow and pectoral injuries earlier this year, secured his three-peat with a throw of 22.90 meters.

Kovacs, meanwhile, earned his third straight silver in dramatic fashion. Amid rainy conditions at Stade de France, the 35-year-old jumped from fourth to second on his sixth and final throw of 22.15m. Jamaica's Rajindra Campbell also had a throw of 22.15m, but Kovacs won the tiebreaker with a superior second-best throw (21.71m to 20.00m).

American Payton Otterdahl had been sitting in a medal position before Kovacs' final toss dropped him to fourth.

Vincent Hancock wins skeet gold over student Conner Prince

Vincent Hancock beat out Conner Prince to win his fourth Olympic men's skeet gold medal. Hancock repeated as champion by hitting 58 of 60 targets. That was one more than Prince, who's coached by Hancock and won silver for his first Olympic medal.

It was the first time that the U.S. won gold and silver in the same shooting event since 1976. Hancock, 37, is the only skeet shooter to win gold more than once.

US breaks world record in mixed 4x100m medley final

A star-studded team of Americans combined to set a world record and earn the country's first medal in the mixed 4x100m medley relay, which debuted at the pandemic-delayed 2020 Tokyo Games. Nic Fink, Torri Huske, Ryan Murphy and Gretchen Walsh finished in 3:37.43 to win gold, topping the previous world record of 3:37.58 set by reigning champ Great Britain in Tokyo.

It marked the fifth gold and eighth total Olympic medal for Murphy, the second gold and fifth medal for Huske, the first gold and third medal for Walsh, and the first gold and second medal for Fink.

Sha'Carri Richardson, Melissa Jefferson make 100m dash podium

Sha'Carri Richardson came up just short in her first bid for women's 100m gold, as Saint Lucia's Julien Alfred stormed to gold. Alfred posted the top semifinal time of 10.84 seconds before dashing to the Olympic title in 10.72 seconds.

Richardson crossed the finish line in 10.87 to win silver for her first Olympic medal. Fellow American Melissa Jefferson also made the Olympic podium for the first time, finishing third with a time of 10.92.

Kate Douglass claims 200m IM silver

Kate Douglass added to her Paris medal haul in the women's 200m individual medley. The Pelham, N.Y, native posted a time of 2:06.92 to claim silver, finishing behind 17-year-old Canadian sensation Summer McIntosh (2:06.56). McIntosh earned her third gold and fourth total medal of the Paris Games.

The U.S. appeared to initially have a double-podium finish in the race when Alex Walsh placed third, but she was later disqualified due to an illegal turn. Australia's Kaylee McKeown earned the bronze instead.

Douglass picked up her third medal of these Games after winning the 200m breaststroke and getting silver in the 4x100m freestyle. She's now a four-time Olympic medalist.

Netherlands snatches gold from US in mixed 4x400m thriller

The U.S. looked primed to win the mixed 4x400m relay after breaking the world record in the qualifying round. But the Netherlands had other plans.

On the last lap of the relay race, the Netherlands' Femke Bol stormed from fourth to first place in a thrilling finish. She passed Team USA's Kaylyn Brown in the final meters to secure gold for the Dutch, who finished in 3:07.43. The United States' quartet of Brown, Vernon Norwood, Shamier Little and Bryce Deadmon took silver with a time of 3:07.74 after running a world-record 3:07.41 on Friday.

It was the third Olympic medal for Deadmon and Norwood, while Brown and Little made the podium for the first time.

Jasmine Moore earns Team USA's first-ever women's triple jump medal

The U.S. made the Olympic women's triple jump podium for the first time ever thanks to Jasmine Moore, whose top attempt of 14.67 meters earned her the bronze medal. Moore was only beaten out by Dominica's Thea LaFond (15.02m) and Jamaica's Shanieka Ricketts (14.87m).

Stephen Nedoroscik wins pommel horse bronze

Stephen Nedoroscik won his first Olympic individual medal in the men's pommel horse final. The viral sensation from Worcester, Mass., earned bronze with a score of 15.300, finishing behind Ireland's Rhys McClenaghan (15.533) and Kazakhstan's Nariman Kurbanov (15.433).

Nedoroscik had previously helped the U.S. win men's team all-around bronze, the country's first medal in the event since the 2008 Beijing Games.

US earns silver, bronze in men's tennis doubles

Team USA made up two of the three podium spots in men's tennis doubles. In the gold medal match, the duo of Austin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram lost to Australia's Matthew Ebden and John Peers in a match tiebreaker 6-7, 7-6, 10-8. (The third set in Olympic doubles features a first-to-10, win-by-two format.) Ram, who was also a doubles runner-up at the 2016 Rio Games, earned his second Olympic medal, while Krajicek earned his first.

In the bronze medal match, Americans Tommy Paul and Taylor Fritz defeated the Czech Republic's Tomas Machac and Adam Pavlásek 6-3, 6-4. Fritz and Paul each made the Olympic podium for the first time.

US wins first men's eight rowing medal since 2008

Team USA picked up an Olympic men's eight rowing medal for the first time since 2008. The team of Rielly Milne, Pieter Quinton, Evan Olson, Peter Chatain, Chris Carlson, Clark Dean, Christian Tabash, Nick Rusher and Henry Hollingsworth combined to capture bronze by finishing 2.40 seconds behind gold medalist Great Britain.

Dean is the only member of the U.S. squad who had prior Olympic experience.

Trinity Rodman's heroics send USWNT back to semifinals

The USWNT and Japan were stuck in a scoreless deadlock for 105 minutes-plus minutes in the women's soccer quarterfinals. Then, Trinity Rodman came to the rescue for the reigning bronze medalists.

In the waning moments of the first period of extra time, the 22-year-old Washington Spirit forward unleashed a world-class curler that found the top-left corner of the net. Rodman's third goal of the Games proved to be the game-winner in a nail-biting 1-0 victory.

The USWNT now heads to a second straight Olympic semifinals, where it will face Germany on Tuesday with a spot in the gold medal match on the line.

Xander Schauffele tied for lead entering final round

U.S. reigning Olympic champion Xander Schauffele enters Sunday's final round of the men's golf tournament tied for the lead at 14-under. Schauffele had been tied atop the leaderboard at 11-under with Japan's Hideki Matsuyama and Great Britain's Tommy Fleetwood before posting a 3-under 68 in Round 3.

But Schauffele is now even with Spain's Jon Rahm, who rose up the leaderboard with a third-round score of 5-under. Fleetwood is one shot off the lead at 13-under while Matsuyama and Denmark's Nicolai Højgaard, who shot 9-under in Round 3, are tied for fourth at 11-under.

American Scottie Scheffler is also within striking distance of a medal spot, sitting tied for sixth with Ireland's Rory McIlroy, South Korea's Tom Kim and Germany's Thomas Detry at 10-under.

US men's basketball enters knockout stage as top overall seed

The U.S. men's basketball team, which was already bound for the quarterfinals, locked down the top overall seed in the knockout stage after a perfect 3-0 run through group play.

The Americans overcame a slow start against Puerto Rico and cruised to a 104-83 victory. Anthony Edwards scored a game-high 26 points off the bench for Team USA, shooting 11-for-15 from the field. Joel Embiid (15 points), Kevin Durant (11), LeBron James (10), Jayson Tatum (10) and Anthony Davis (10) also scored in double figures. Tatum posted a team-high 10 rebounds as well.

Though Greece was the second-best third-place team, FIBA rules state that two teams from the same group cannot play in the quarterfinals, so that prevented a Germany-Brazil matchup because both were in Group B.

The U.S. did its job in group play, wasn’t really challenged and had several players contribute offensively. They were sloppy with turnovers and gave up offensive rebounds, and those are areas coach Steve Kerr wants to clean up. Anthony Edwards (16.3 points per game) and Kevin Durant (16 ppg) are the top scorers. LeBron James averaged 14.3 points, 7.3 assists and 6.7 rebounds in group play.

Brazil beat Japan and lost to Germany and France in Group B. Vitor Benite, Raul Neto, Marcelinho Huertas and Bruno Caboclo are Brazil’s top players.

Germany-Greece

Giannis Antetokounmpo made it to the knockout stage, and he’s thrilled about the opportunity. But Germany is playing as well as any team in this event. Germany, the 2023 FIBA World Cup champion, clobbered France for the top spot in Group B and has experience and continuity with Franz Wagner (21.7 ppg), Mo Wagner, Dennis Schröder (19.7 ppg, 9.0 assists per game), Daniel Theis and Isaac Bonga. Greece had just one victory (vs. Australia) in Group A but that was enough. Antetokounmpo averaged 27 points on 68.9% shooting in three games.

Canada-France

Canada and players RJ Barrett and Andrew Nembhard (19) will face France in a quarterfinal game in the 2024 Paris Games.

So much is at stake in this game as both teams came to the Olympics with medal expectations. Canada has been fantastic – 3-0 in Group A – led by RJ Barrett (21.0 ppg), Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (19.0 ppg) and Dillon Brooks (14.3 ppg). Can France’s guards handle Canada’s guards? France finished 2-1, but it was an up-and-down effort. It almost lost to Japan (94-90), handled Brazil and was routed by Germany. Yes, France has experience (Nic Batum, Rudy Gobert, Evan Fournier) and the young star (Victor Wembanyama and his 17.0 points, 10.7 rebounds, 2.7 steals and 2.0 blocks per game), but it hasn’t put together a complete performance.

Serbia-Australia

Australia finished second in Group A with just one victory – against Spain – but it lost to Canada 93-83 and Greece 77-71. It is competitive with several NBA players, including Josh Giddey (15.0 ppg), Patty Mills, Jock Landale (17.7 ppg), Dante Exum and Dyson Daniels. Serbia is led by Nikola Jokic (18.7 ppg, 11.0 rebounds, 7.0 assists per game), Bogdan Bogdanovic (19 ppg) and a cast of high-level players who star in Europe. Serbia earned silver at the 2023 World Cup, and it is capable of medaling in Paris. Both teams are well-coached.

Brazil averages 13 offensive rebounds per game and shoots 45% from three-point range, hitting 11 per game during pool play.

The Canadians are making their first Olympic appearance since Sydney 2000.

The men's basketball semifinals are scheduled for Thursday and medal games will be held next Saturday.

Tip-off for Tuesday's quarterfinal is set for 12 p.m. ET, streaming live on CBC Gem and CBC Sports' Paris 2024 website and app.

It's a tough draw for Canada, getting the home team, and Victor Wembanyama, just to have a chance of advancing. Canada hasn't medalled at the Olympics since taking the silver medal in 1936, the infamous 19-8 loss on an outdoor court in a rainstorm to the U.S.

France coach Vincent Collet said his team can use Canada's higher seeding to its advantage.

Germany (3-0) is the No. 2 seed, finishing behind the U.S. for the top spot because of the point-differential tiebreaker. The Americans outscored their three group-stage opponents by 67 points; Germany outscored its three group-stage opponents by 47 points. Canada (3-0) is the No. 3 seed, getting that spot behind the U.S. and Germany because it had only a plus-20 differential in group play.

Team USA will face Brazil in the Olympic men's basketball quarterfinals.,https://sports.inquirer.net/578221/team-usa-steps-up-quest-for-fifth-straight-olympic-gold,"The unbeaten USA squad led by NBA superstar LeBron James aims to take their pursuit of a fifth straight Olympic basketball gold to the next level when they face Brazil in the quarterfinals on Tuesday.

The Americans rolled through the group stage with a perfect 3-0 record and a tournament-leading plus-64 point differential — but coach Steve Kerr said there are things the United States must improve if they want to emerge with the Paris Olympics gold when men’s basketball concludes on Saturday.

“We know we have to play better,” Kerr said after the United States prepared to shift from Lille to Bercy Arena in Paris for the knockout phase.

“Part of this tournament is it gets harder as you go,” Kerr said. “We have to take better care of the ball.

“We don’t need to make home run plays. We just need to hit singles. Our talent is overwhelming if we make the right play, and I think that’s part of it.”

The winner of USA-Brazil will face either NBA Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokic’s Serbia or Tokyo bronze medallists Australia in the semifinals.

Australia surprised the Serbs in an Olympic tune-up game last month.

In the other side of the draw, host nation France and its fledgling NBA superstar Victor Wembanyama take on Canada while Giannis Antetokounmpo’s Greece faces World Cup champion Germany.

‘Grind out a win’

Kerr is spoiled for choice with a roster that includes James, two-time NBA champion Kevin Durant, Golden State sharp-shooter Stephen Curry and the NBA champion Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum, to name just a few.

But he says his array of superstars must focus on the basics.

“Offensive rebounds,” Kerr said. “Our opponents are getting a lot of offensive boards, so just continuing to harp on box outs and extra possessions and making sure that teams aren’t able to even out the game with all those extra possessions from our doing.”

Brazil’s former NBA first-round draft pick Bruno Caboclo averaged 16 points and 7.3 rebounds as Brazil went 1-2 in group play.

Vitor Benite connected on 56.3 percent of his three-point attempts, but Brazil just don’t look like having the firepower to challenge the United States offensively.

James has been the driver of a US offensive that averaged more than 105 points per game in group play.

Durant erupted for 23 points against Serbia. Anthony Edwards scored 26 points against Puerto Rico.

However, whatever the remaining matchups look like on paper, Curry cautioned that the United States must be prepared for adversity on the way to what would be a 17th Olympic gold.

“Winning a gold medal, whatever year you look in the history books, maybe besides the 1992 team, everyone has had a battle somewhere,” Curry said.

“Whether it’s shots not falling or it’s a team that is playing amazing, you’ve got to grind out a win.”

‘Good energy’

France, silver medallists in Tokyo, lost their group finale to Germany to fall in the seedings.

Now they’ll have to become the first team to beat Canada to keep their dream of gold on home soil alive.

“I think we’ve all got the good will, the good energy,” Wembanyama said.

“But now I think we’ve got to trust the coaching more, just trust our teammates more and do the little things that don’t show up on the stat sheets — setting screens, boxing out, all that.”

France coach Vincent Collet tried to put a positive team on France’s lower seeding.

“They have more to lose than us in this position,” he said of the Canadians, who haven’t won an Olympic medal since 1936.

Germany goes into the quarters as the second seed, but, like Kerr, Germany coach Gordie Herbert said the supposed easier matchup that provides is an illusion.

Team USA will face Brazil in the Olympic men's basketball quarterfinals.,https://sportsaldente.com/the-u-s-will-face-brazil-in-the-olympic-mens-quarterfinals-with-serbia-or-australia-awaiting-in-the-semifinals/,"The U.S. will play against Brazil in the quarterfinals of the Olympic men’s basketball tournament in Paris on Tuesday. If the U.S. wins, they will face either Serbia or Australia in the semifinals.

The earliest the U.S. could play Germany, Canada, or France is in the final.

On Tuesday, other quarterfinal games include: Victor Wembanyama and France versus Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Canada, reigning World Cup champion Germany against Giannis Antetokounmpo and Greece, and defending Olympic bronze medalist Australia facing Nikola Jokic and Serbia.

Teams that lose on Tuesday are out, while the winners will play in the semifinals on Thursday. The U.S.-Brazil winner will play against the Serbia-Australia winner, and the Germany-Greece winner will face the France-Canada winner.

The gold and bronze medal games are set for next Saturday, the second-to-last day of the Paris Games. Puerto Rico, Spain, South Sudan, and Japan were eliminated after the group stage.

The U.S. (3-0) secured the No. 1 overall seed and the easiest possible quarterfinal matchup on Saturday with a 104-83 win over Puerto Rico.

“They’re all excellent teams, well-coached,” U.S. coach Steve Kerr said about the quarterfinalists. “But Brazil is our focus.”

Germany (3-0) is the No. 2 seed, finishing behind the U.S. because of the point-differential tiebreaker. The Americans outscored their three group-stage opponents by 67 points, while Germany outscored theirs by 47 points.

Canada (3-0) is the No. 3 seed, coming in behind the U.S. and Germany due to a plus-20 differential in group play.

“You hope you get a little bit easier team (in the quarterfinals),” Germany coach Gordie Herbert said about finishing with a high seed from group play, “but I think you really don’t because every team here is really good.”

The main game on Tuesday is likely to be France against Canada. France lost its final group game to Germany on Friday night, which put them in a much tougher position than they would have been otherwise.

Now, France needs to beat the unbeaten Canada team to have a chance at winning a medal in Paris, which would be a huge disappointment if they don’t succeed.

“I think we’ve all got the good will, the good energy,” Wembanyama said. “But now I think we’ve got to trust the coaching more, just trust our teammates more and do the little things that don’t show up on the stat sheets — setting screens, boxing out, all that.”

France coach Vincent Collet believes his team can benefit from Canada’s higher seeding. “Now, it’s even. We will be 0-0 on Tuesday,” Collet said. “They have more to lose than us in this position.”

It’s also a tough situation for Canada: They are up against the home team and Wembanyama, with a chance to advance at stake. Canada hasn’t won a medal at the Olympics since they took silver in 1936, losing 19-8 to the U.S. in a rainstorm on an outdoor court.

“We played a lot of really good teams, and we beat them all,” Canada guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander said. “There are some things we can clean up for sure, but we’ll take it.”"
Team USA will face Brazil in the Olympic men's basketball quarterfinals.,https://www.wirenewsfax.com/u-s-mens-basketball-dominates-puerto-rico-to-secure-top-seed-in-olympic-qualifiers,"Team USA’s men’s basketball team dominated Puerto Rico in a decisive 104-83 victory to secure the top seed in the Olympic quarterfinals. The game saw Anthony Edwards shine with 26 points, leading the American team to a perfect 3-0 record in pool play.

Coach Steve Kerr expressed satisfaction with the team’s performance, emphasizing the importance of continuous improvement as the tournament progresses. Despite facing minor challenges, such as transportation disruptions, Team USA managed to secure the top seed with an eye on a fifth consecutive gold medal.

Looking ahead, Team USA will face Brazil in the Olympic quarterfinals, with Kerr acknowledging Brazil as a focused opponent. The team’s star players, including LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Joel Embiid, delivered solid performances, contributing to the team’s success.

Despite a strong showing from Puerto Rico, led by Jose Alvarado, Team USA’s depth and talent ultimately proved too much to handle. The Americans will need to address areas of improvement, such as rebounding and turnovers, as they prepare for the knockout rounds in Paris.

Reflecting on past Olympic experiences, particularly the upset loss to Puerto Rico in 2004, James emphasized the need for a strong start in games. With Durant aiming for a record fourth gold medal and James seeking his third, Team USA remains focused on achieving success in the Tokyo Olympics.

Off the court, Kerr commended James for his leadership and dedication to the game, highlighting the positive influence he brings to the team. As the tournament unfolds, Team USA aims to build on its momentum and showcase the collective talent and camaraderie that define American basketball.

In conclusion, Team USA’s dominant performance against Puerto Rico underscores their status as a formidable contender in the Olympic basketball competition. With a focus on continuous improvement and a strong team dynamic, the Americans are poised to make a strong push for another gold medal in Tokyo."

"Biles wins silver in gymnastics floor, her fourth medal in Paris.",https://www.teamusa.com/news/2024/august/05/biles-chiles-finish-their-paris-2024-run-with-silver-and-bronze,"PARIS — Simone Biles’ silver medal in the floor exercise final on Monday tied her for the second-most decorated female gymnast in Olympic history. Her fourth medal in the Paris 2024 Olympic Games gave her a total of 11, matching Vera Caslavska of Czechoslovakia. For a second time, Biles won medals in team, all-around, vault and floor exercise after doing so at her Olympic debut in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.

After her withdrawal from the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, many questioned if they would ever see Biles return to competion. Biles had already solidified her place as one of the best to ever grace the sport. Before returning to competition in 2023, she had 18 world championship medals and seven Olympic medals. Additionally, she had four original skills named after her. Despite being etched in the history books regardless of if she returned or not, Biles chose to fight her way back to another Olympics.

“It means the world that I could come back out here,” said Biles. “To compete on an international stage again, representing my country. I couldn’t have asked for a better Olympics Games, a better support system, better teammates.”

Biles’ time in Paris has been rich with redemption. She started with leading the U.S. back to the top of the podium in the team competition after winning silver in Tokyo. Biles followed that up by earning two individual gold medals in all-around and vault. Expectations were high for Biles heading into the final day of competition, where she was a gold medal contender in both beam and floor. But in what she classified as an “odd” beam final, Biles recorded a fall, as did five other finalists, including Suni Lee.

Biles and Lee finished fifth and sixth overall with matching scores of 13.100, with Biles ranking a place above Lee as her execution score was higher.

The crowd response in Bercy Arena throughout beam was unlike anything the coaches and athletes had ever experienced. An environment where the gymnasts usually hear cheering or background noise was replaced by an eerie silence, with the only noise being audience members shushing any cheers — including those coming from the gymnasts.

“Beam is always the most stressful,” said Biles. “Honestly, we do better in environments when there's noise going on because it feels most like practice. Today, I heard some of the Android ringtones going off and camera flickers or whatever that was… You’re trying to stay in your zone. Then people start cheering and then the shushing gets louder... it was really weird and awkward. We asked several times if we could have some music, or some background noise, so I'm not really sure what happened… but none of us liked it.”"

Biles, 27, missed out on a medal altogether in a shocking balance beam final that saw Italy’s Alice D’Amato win a surprise gold. Biles fell off the beam when attempting to do a back handspring into two back layouts, costing her the chance to secure a fourth medal in Paris.

But that medal came later in the day when Biles earned silver in the floor exercise finals after a routine that included a couple of costly steps out of bounds.

Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade became the first gymnast to beat Biles in a floor final in a major international competition, overcoming her own disappointment on the balance beam, where she finished fourth.

Biles’ silver means she returns to the United States with four medals from the Paris Games. In total she has won eleven Olympic medals, seven of them gold."

Simone Biles' spectacular 2024 Olympics came to an end Monday, as she won her fourth medal in Paris on the floor exercise. She finished with three golds (team, all-around, vault) and a silver (floor), bringing her total number of Olympic medals to 11: seven gold, two silver and two bronze.

Biles' dominance in modern gymnastics is unmatched. She is now the most decorated American gymnast, male or female, and has the most gold medals of any American gymnast, male or female. Internationally, her Olympic medal count is surpassed only by one woman, Larisa Latynina of the Soviet Union, and is tied with another, Vera Caslavska of Czechoslovakia. But Biles' combined Olympic and world medal count of 41 is the highest of any gymnast ever. Only one other gymnast, Japan's Kohei Uchimura, has won six world all-around titles, as Biles has. Biles has won more American titles—nine—than anyone else.

Latynina has more Olympic medals (18), but she has acknowledged that Biles completes more physically difficult skills that take a greater toll on her mentally than did Latynina's. Biles has completed five unique skills that bear her name in the sport's code of points: two vaults, two elements on floor and a balance beam dismount.

One of those vaults is the vaunted Yurchenko double pike, which Biles completed three times in Paris. It's a skill so difficult and dangerous that 2012 Olympian and vault silver medalist McKayla Maroney was told to stop training it; even in the men's code, it's considered one of the most difficult vaults to perform correctly, largely because a failure to complete the second flip in the air means a gymnast could land on their head.

The FIG, the international gymnastics federation, awarded the Biles II vault a difficulty score of 6.4, eight-tenths of a point higher than one of Biles' other competition vaults here, the Cheng. Biles' eponymous double-twisting double-tuck beam dismount, which she debuted in 2019, was deemed so difficult by the FIG that they undervalued it to prevent other gymnasts from taking a dangerous risk. Biles, indignant, performed it once to have it named after herself and has never repeated it in competition.

While a few recent Olympians have matched or exceeded Biles in event dominance (Katie Ledecky, for example, with four consecutive Olympic gold medals in the 800m freestyle) or in medal count (Michael Phelps, for example, with 28 Olympic medals), what puts her legacy in a class of its own is her ability and willingness to conquer new heights in a sport that has struggled mightily to keep pace with both her athleticism and her activism.

Many Olympians possess extreme amounts of willpower; it's practically required to succeed at the elite level of most sports. And many have used their expanded platforms after they reach the Olympics to promote causes that are close to them. But Biles has become, and remained, an advocate for herself and her fellow gymnasts as an active competitor, and then continued to revolutionize the sport from within.

She has fought to center mental health for athletes in a reconstructed American gymnastics federation in the wake of the Larry Nassar abuse scandal, all while coping with being a survivor herself. Weekly therapy, she has said, has helped her cope while rebuilding as an athlete and working through the twisties. And she has done it all while reaching new heights, literally and figuratively, as an athlete. She could coast on her nearly unbeatable combination of difficulty and clean execution, but she continued well into her 20s to imagine new skills and complete them, entirely for herself.

Paris was, in many ways, a redemption tour for Biles as well as her Tokyo teammates Jade Carey, Jordan Chiles and Suni Lee, who along with Hezly Rivera comprised the team here. When Biles withdrew from the team final in Tokyo, unable to overcome the mental block that caused her to get lost in the air and could have threatened her life if she continued to compete, the reaction was quick and cruel. Biles was called a traitor, un-American, a failure. But instead of retiring, Biles took two years off, starting gymnastics nearly from scratch. She transformed her own skills to work around her mental health struggles and to better accommodate an older body.

Instead of being upset that she did not win a gold medal in the floor exercise Monday, an apparatus that has become a signature for her, Biles was thrilled for Rebeca Andrade of Brazil, who won, even bowing to her on the podium along with Jordan Chiles, who won bronze. It looked like a passing of the torch, and it was another lasting image of her legacy."

NPR is in Paris for the 2024 Summer Olympics. For more of our coverage from the games head to our latest updates.

PARIS — After 90 seconds of backflips and handsprings and twists, Simone Biles walked off the floor exercise mat to greet a crowd of competitors and coaches alike, all offering their celebration for what might have been the last Olympic routine of Biles' sterling career.

Biles' run at the 2024 Summer Olympic Games ended Monday with a silver medal in the floor exercise final. Her four medals (three gold and the silver) in this Olympics have cemented her legacy as the greatest gymnast in U.S. history, and perhaps — as her diamond-encrusted goat necklace suggests — the greatest of all time.

Biles, who is 27, has won seven Olympic gold medals and 11 Olympic medals overall, a total tied for the second most ever won by a gymnast. Coupled with 30 World Championship medals, she is the most decorated gymnast of all time.

And her performance at this Olympics is an emphatic exclamation point on her turnaround from the last Summer Olympics in Tokyo, where she suddenly lost her way in the air in the gymnastics version of the yips called ""the twisties."" Rather than risk injury, Biles withdrew from several events and ultimately took two years off from gymnastics altogether. At times, she thought she would never compete again.

Instead, Biles made her return to competitive gymnastics in 2023. Since then, she has looked dominant. In Paris, she helped propel the U.S. to a blowout win in the team event, then staged a comeback in the individual all-around to earn gold by more than a point. On Saturday, she won the gold medal in the vault final after performing the most difficult vault in women's gymnastics, which is named after her.

On Monday, even after a day in which she missed the podium in one event and settled for silver in another, Biles said she was satisfied with her performance in Paris. ""I've accomplished way more than my wildest dreams, not just at this Olympics but in the sport,"" she said. ""A couple years ago, I didn't think I'd be back here at an Olympic Games. So, competing and then walking away with four medals, I'm not mad about it. I'm pretty proud of myself.""

Biles had been near flawless in this Olympic Games. Before Monday, she had won the gold medal in every event she entered.

But on the last day of artistic gymnastics competition, slips and falls beset competitors throughout the events held at Paris' Bercy Arena. In the women's balance beam final and the men's horizontal bar final, the podiums were populated by the gymnasts who were able to get through their routines without mistake. In the floor exercise, several competitors fell or accidentally stepped out of bounds.

Biles was not immune. In the balance beam final, a flip layout midway through her routine proved too off-kilter, and Biles slipped and fell to the mat. Ultimately, her score of 13.1 was not enough to earn her a medal. Italy's Alice D'Amato took the gold. China's Zhou Yaqin won silver, followed by Italy's Manila Esposito with bronze.

""Balance beam is such an unforgiving, uncertain event. Mistakes happen all the time,"" Zhou said afterward. ""I think the falters, falls, stumbles are because of the high pressure and the nature of balance beam."" The U.S. gymnast Suni Lee also participated in Monday's beam final, but a bad fall during her routine doomed her chances too at a medal.

The sizable crowd was quiet, and at times spectators shushed the gymnasts as they tried to cheer on their competitors. ""We didn't like that, because it was just so silent in there,"" Lee said. ""When I was up there, you could probably hear me breathing. It adds to the stress.""

Another factor: The Olympics is a long and grueling competition. By Monday, gymnasts had been competing for more than a week. Biles, who participated in all but one possible event, performed an Olympics-high 17 routines throughout the competition. ""I've been out on that floor so many times competing, so obviously exhaustion and all of that sets in,"" she said.

The floor exercise gold medal went to Brazil's Rebeca Andrade, who won by just 0.033 after Biles was docked six-tenths of a point for twice stepping out of bounds. U.S gymnast Jordan Chiles won bronze.

""I'm not very upset or anything about my performance at the Olympics. I'm actually very happy, proud and even more excited that it's over,"" Biles said afterward.

Now that her time at the Paris Olympics has come to a close, the question of her future has started to simmer. At 27, Biles is already older than most elite female gymnasts. After the 25-year-old Rebeca Andrade and 23-year-old Jordan Chiles, no competitor who faced Biles on Monday was older than 21. Most were still in their teens.

Biles has not said whether she intends to retire from gymnastics now that her Olympic run has ended. On Sunday, she chastised journalists for inquiring.

""You guys really gotta stop asking athletes what’s next after they win a medal at the Olympics,"" she wrote on the social media site X. ""Let us soak up the moment we’ve worked our whole lives for."" (When one user asked what her next step would be after Paris, Biles replied: ""babysitting the medal."")"
"Biles wins silver in gymnastics floor, her fourth medal in Paris.",https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240805-biles-caps-glittering-campaign-with-floor-exercise-silver-after-beam-fall,"Paris (AFP) – Narrowly missing her chance to get a record-setting tally of five gold medals in one Games, star US gymnast Simone Biles on Monday capped her glittering campaign with a floor exercise silver. After falling from the beam in the first major hiccup of her triumphant return to the Olympics, Biles gave a stellar floor performance and came second to Brazilian Rebeca Andrade, who has become the country’s most decorated Olympic athlete with six medals to her name.

US gymnastics superstar Simone Biles polished off a redemptive Paris Olympics campaign with a floor exercise silver on Monday, shrugging off a balance beam fall to finish runner-up to Brazilian Rebeca Andrade.

Biles went into the final day of competition with a chance to push her tally of Paris gold to a record-setting five in one Games.

She had already led the United States to team gold and regained the all-around crown she first won as part of a four-gold haul in Rio in 2016.

She soared to the vault title with a stellar rendition of her signature Yurchenko double pike vault to take her career tally of Olympic gold to seven.

But she couldn't find her way back to the top of the podium on Monday, two out-of-bounds errors proving too costly in an otherwise breathtaking final floor routine.

Andrade had already moved into first place with an energetic and elegant routine that garnered 14.166 points.

Biles earned 14.133 for silver ahead of teammate Jordan Chiles, who took bronze with 13.766. Chiles's score was upgraded after a review of her degree of difficulty, a devastating blow for Romania's Ana Barbosu who thought she had earned bronze with her score of 13.700.

Biles's legion of fans gave her a standing ovation anyway, and Biles departed the floor mat with both arms raised in acknowledgement.

Her earlier fall from the beam – one of several in the final – was the first major hiccup of her triumphant Olympic return, three years after a bout of the disorientating ""twisties"" cut short her Tokyo Games campaign.

Biles finished fifth in beam, where Alice D'Amato became the first Italian woman gymnast to claim Olympic gold with a score of 14.366.

Teammate Manila Esposito joined D'Amato on the podium in third, with China's Zhou Yuqin taking silver.

The treacherous nature of the 10cm-wide beam was clear when the first three starters made big mistakes.

China's world silver medallist Zhou lost her balance and had to grab the beam to avoid coming off.

American medal contender Sunisa Lee took a hard fall onto the beam when her foot slipped at the end of an aerial series. Brazilian Julia Suarez also fell and Romanian Sabrina Maneca-Voinea fell twice.

D'Amato had a couple of minor wobbles in an otherwise impeccable routine to seize first place just before Biles competed.

The US superstar, again greeted rapturously by a Bercy Arena crowd dotted with celebrities, made a confident start.

But she slipped off on an aerial series, drawing a collective gasp from the crowd.

Lee said she and Biles were both put off by crowd members trying to quiet others who were cheering during the beam competition – including competitors trying to encourage their teammates.

""You could feel the tension in the room,"" Lee said. ""Me and Simone were like, 'Why are they shushing?'

""She came off, and she was like 'I don't know why they were shushing in the middle of my routine'.""

Visibly disappointed, Biles had to wait an agonizingly long time for her score of 13.100 to be posted.

That was nowhere near good enough, and Biles's chance to join Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina and US swimmer Katie Ledecky as the only women to pile up nine Olympic golds was over – at least for this year.

The 27-year-old hasn't quite ruled out a return for the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.

Oka treble

In another apparatus final littered with mistakes, Oka edged 17-year-old Colombian Angel Barajas.

They finished with the same score of 14.533 but Oka, 20, pocketed the gold thanks to a higher score for execution.

There was nothing to separate China's Zhang Boheng and Taiwan's Tang Chia-Hung, who shared bronze on 13.966.

Oka added a fourth medal, bronze, in a parallel bars final won by China's defending champion Zou Jingyuan.

Zou scored a massive 16.200 points to retain the title he won in Tokyo in emphatic style, adding a first Paris gold to his team and rings silvers.

Ukraine's Illia Kovtun took silver with 15.500 points ahead of Oka's 15.300.

"Biles wins silver in gymnastics floor, her fourth medal in Paris.",https://people.com/simone-biles-wins-four-medals-2024-olympics-8690143,"Simone Biles is leaving Paris having made herself proud — and having set a few records.

The athlete, already the most decorated gymnast of all time, finished out the 2024 Paris Olympics by winning her fourth medal of the Games, a silver in the women's artistic gymnastics individual floor routine on Aug. 5.

In a press conference after the event, Biles, 27, told reporters she was immensely proud of her performance, especially considering the difficult road she'd had in getting herself back into competition shape.

""I've accomplished way more than my wildest dreams, not just as this Olympics, but in this sport,"" she said. ""I can't be mad at my performances. A couple of years ago I didn't think I'd be back here at an Olympic game.""

Biles was forced to bow out of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 after she was struck with a bout of the dreaded ""twisties,"" which made it difficult for her to safely perform her highly technical flips.

She also competed in the women's individual balance beam final on Monday, but landed in fifth place with a 13.100 score after falling.

The athlete started her Summer Games with a gold in the team event alongside Suni Lee, Hezly Rivera, Jade Carey and Jordan Chiles. Then, in the individual all-around, Biles also took gold. She is the oldest gymnast to ever win the all-around.

On Aug. 3, she won her third gold medal of these Games after earning a 15.300 on the vault.

Overall, Biles has now won 11 Olympic medals. She's won 30 world championship medals, and is the most decorated gymnast of all time.

Earlier in these Games, Biles was subtly asked if she'd be returning for the next Summer Olympics in four years, which will take place in Los Angeles.

During a press conference at Bercy Arena after the vault final, a reporter questioned, ""Is this the last time we're going to see you vaulting in competition?""

""This is my last, definitely Yurchenko double pike [vault]. I mean I kind of nailed that one. So never say never,"" said Biles in response. ""The home Games — the next Olympics is at home, so you just never know. But I am getting really old.""

"Biles wins silver in gymnastics floor, her fourth medal in Paris.",https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/08/05/olympic-gymnastics-live-results/74194380007/,"PARIS — Simone Biles won silver in the women’s floor exercise final on Monday at the 2024Paris Games, giving her four medals, including three golds, at these Games. It is the first time she has not won gold in a floor exercise final — ever.

Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade won gold. After a score inquiry, Jordan Chiles won bronze, her updated total moving her to third place from fifth.

The medal is the 11th of Biles’ Olympic career, seven of which are gold. Biles won four medals in Paris, leading the U.S. to gold in the team final and winning gold in the all-around and vault finals and silver in the floor final.

""I’ve accomplished way more than my wildest dreams, not just at these Olympics but in gymnastics,"" she said in a news conference Monday. ""Walking way with four medals, I’m not mad about it. I’m pretty proud of myself.”

Simone Biles, Jordan Chiles bow down to Rebeca Andrade

The greatness of Simone Biles can be summed up in one photo.

2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.

It’s not of her with her many, many medals. Or of a score that reflects another dominant performance. It doesn’t show her soaring high above the vault. It’s of Biles and Jordan Chiles, bowing down to new Olympic floor champion Rebeca Andrade as the Brazilian steps onto the medals podium at the 2024 Paris Games.

“I love Rebeca. She’s absolutely amazing,” Biles said Monday afternoon. “Jordan was like, 'Should we bow to her?’ And I was like, 'Absolutely.’ It was just the right thing to do.”

Yes, but not many athletes — not many people — would be big enough to celebrate someone else’s success in the wake of their own disappointment. Or mature enough to do it so genuinely. Not many would be generous enough to show the grace that so often isn’t extended to her. Read Nancy Armour's column on Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles bowing down to Rebeca Andrade after the floor final.

What Simone Biles said after floor, beam finals

Before Simone Biles won silver on floor, she finished fifth in the balance beam final, in which nearly every gymnast came off beam, including USA’s Suni Lee, who finished sixth.

""Today has been absolutely wild,"" she said. ""I've been competing here at the Olympics for, what, a week or so now? I don't know, I've been on that floor so many times competing. So obviously exhaustion and all that sets in, but we still had to go out and compete one more time today.

""It's such an honor to compete with these girls on both the beam and on the floor, obviously wasn't my best performances, but at the end of the day, it's whoever meddled meddled and that's what's so exciting because you just never know.

""So I'm not very upset or anything about my performance. I think these Olympics I'm actually very happy, proud and even more excited that it's over.""

Why Jordan Chiles' score changed on floor

Ana Barbosu of Romania was celebrating on the floor with her country's flag, jumping up and down, when Jordan Chiles' new score came through. She was granted one-tenth of a point increase in her difficulty score, which moved her above Barbosu and gave her the bronze.

After the routine, her coaches Cecile and Laurent Landi submitted an inquiry with the judging panel, and it worked. Chiles' execution score was not changed, but the D score went up by one tenth of a point, to 5.9, and that was enough to give her a bronze. Read the full explainer on why Jordan Chiles' score changed in the floor final.

Simone Biles floor routine

Simone Biles scored a 14.133 to take second place behind Rebeca Andrade with two competitors left. Biles stepped out of bounds twice but stuck the landing on the Biles I. She held her salute until she was off the podium.

During warmups, she overcooked the Biles II and took a hard, awkward fall. She could be seen mouthing, ""I'm fine"" after. Biles tweaked her calf during qualifying on July 28 and has had it wrapped in competition since.

There was a score inquiry for Jordan Chiles after her floor routine and she ultimately won bronze with a 13.766.

Simone Biles on silent balance beam final: 'It was really weird and awkward'

If you were expecting raucous cheers or thumping music in the background during the balance beam final, you would've been disappointed. As each of the each competitors mounted the beam, the arena went almost completely silent.

Simone Biles and Suni Lee each got some shushes from the crowd while cheering for each other, which they agreed was ""annoying,"" said Lee, who finished sixth after coming off during her routine.

""You're trying to stay in your zone, and then people start cheering and then the shushing gets louder, so really, they should be shushed because they're louder,"" Biles said after the beam and floor finals. ""It was really weird and awkward. And we've asked several times if we can have some music, or some background noise, so I'm not really sure what happened there. But, yeah, not our favorite. None of us liked it.""

Rebeca Andrade floor routine

The Brazilian drew a massive applause from the crowd with a terrific routine that earned her a 14.166 and ultimately gold. She hopped on a few of the landings but that goes into the nitpicking category. She pumped her fist when she finished and looked skyward. During the medal ceremony, Brazilian fans erupted into cheering Andrade, chanting her name just before the medal was draped around her neck.

Simone Biles leotard change

Simone Biles wore a new leotard for the floor final, swapping her blue and white one for one that is red and blue.

Simone Biles balance beam video

Simone Biles came off the balance beam on her aerial series, scoring a 13.100 and finishing fifth. It's the first time in 33 individual finals at the world championships or Olympics (on events other than uneven bars) that she did not win a medal.

Suni Lee on balance beam

It wasn't to be for Suni Lee in the balance beam final. Seeking her fourth medal of these Games, Lee's right foot slipped off the balance beam at the end of her aerial series, causing her to split the beam and then take a hard fall onto the mat. The result was a score of 13.100 that effectively eliminates her shot at the podium.

The 21-year-old appeared frustrated as she re-mounted the beam and finished her routine after the fall, and as she walked away afterwards. But then she started to gradually lighten after talking with her coach, Jess Graba, and Simone Biles. Within moments, Lee was smiling and laughing again, perhaps remembering the breadth of what she's already achieved in Paris. After returning from a pair of kidney ailments, Lee won a second consecutive all-around Olympic medal — this time a bronze — to go with team gold and another bronze on uneven bars Sunday.

Why is Simone Biles called the GOAT?

Biles is the greatest gymnast of all time. She has consistently dominated the sport for over a decade, which would have been an unimaginable feat just a few years ago as most gymnasts reach their peak in their late teens. Her ability to win is in a class of its own. With 41 Olympic and world championship medals, Biles has won the most of any gymnast in history. She has also not lost an all-around competition since 2013.

Biles redefines the possibilities of her sport not just in her record-breaking number of wins and medals, but also in the unmatched difficulty of the skills she completes. Biles has no less than five skills named after her — two on the vault and floor and one on the balance beam — because she was the first, and in most cases, the only athlete to complete them in competition.

Simone Biles' moves named after her: What to know

Simone Biles has left her mark on the sport of gymnastics, in addition to her combined 41 world championship and Olympic medals. Biles has five skills named after her: Two on vault, two on floor exercise and one on balance beam. Here’s are the Simone Biles moves named after her.

Today marks the last day of artistic gymnastics competition from the Bercy Arena and the women’s balance beam and floor exercise finals are the main events. That's partly because Simone Biles will be looking to continue her imperious form and add more gold medals to her tally in both events after taking three in her first three events at these Games. She’ll be joined on the beam by Suni Lee, herself on a comeback journey, and by Jordan Chiles on the floor. The beam event is at 6:38 a.m. ET and 12:38 p.m. local time, while the floor exercise is at 8:24 a.m. ET and 2:24 p.m. local time.

Elsewhere, with track and field events well underway, Team USA's Valerie Allman will be hoping to spin up a storm in the women's discus event at 2:30 p.m. ET and 8:30 p.m. local time. That follows the men's pole vault final, at 1:00 p.m. ET and 7:00 p.m. local time, where Sam Kendricks will be hoping to take home a medal. He'll have to outjump Sweden's record-breaker Mondo Duplantis, though. On the track, the women's 5,000m final is at 3:15 p.m. ET and 9:15 p.m. local time; and the women's 800m medal event is at 3:47 p.m. ET and 9:47 p.m. local time.

Team USA is going for the top spot in the women's 3x3 basketball tournament: their semifinal game against Spain is at 11:30 a.m. ET and 5:30 p.m. local time, with the gold medal game at 3:00 p.m. ET and 9:00 p.m. local time. The men's final also happens today a half hour later than the women's final.

In non-medal events, Chase Budinger and Miles Evans are among the American beach volleyball pairs to play today. They face Norway's defending champions at 8:00 a.m. ET and 2:00 p.m. local time.

Biles scored a 14.133, narrowly missing gold by 0.033 of a point to Brazil's Rebeca Andrade (14.166). Biles, who appeared to have reaggravated a calf injury during warmups that she had been competing with this Olympics, stepped out of bounds on two tumbling passes, which led to 0.6 in penalties.

Biles' Team USA teammate, Jordan Chiles, also made the podium winning the bronze (13.766), which marked her first individual Olympic medal in her first apparatus final. Biles also competed in the balance beam final, where she finished in fifth place after a fall. Her Team USA teammate, Suni Lee, tied for fifth with a 13.100 score after she also fell.

Her husband, Chicago Bears safety Jonathan Owens, was at home following along on an off day, and he shared his support for his wife on Instagram. Owens was granted time off from training camp, where he got to watch Biles win gold in the team and all-around finals.

Biles won four medals in the Paris Olympics, winning gold in the team final, all-around final and vault final, as well as silver in the floor final. She now has 11 Olympic medals, which is more than any other American gymnast. Biles holds the record for most golds, which stands at seven.

While Biles doesn't want to talk about what comes next, she didn't rule out a potential return when the Olympics heads to Los Angeles in 2028.

“Never say never. The next Olympics is at home, so you just never know,” she said Saturday after winning gold on vault. “But I am getting really old.”

One thing we can probably expect: Biles to be at Soldier Field supporting her husband when he takes the field on Sept. 8, for the Bears' season opener against the Tennessee Titans."

Biles had been bidding for a fourth gold in Paris on the final day of competition but after slipping off the balance beam earlier errors also proved costly on the floor.

But the 27-year-old insisted she could not be disappointed by her medal haul in the French capital including three gold as US teammate Jordan Chiles snatched bronze.

""Rebeca's so amazing, she's queen,"" said Biles.

""She's such an excitement to watch and then all the fans in the crowd always cheering for her, so it was just the right thing to do.

""It was an all-black podium so that was super exciting for us but then Jordan was like should we bow to her and I was like absolutely.""

Biles' crowd-pleasing acrobatic floor routine to Taylor Swift's hit song ""Ready For It"" included two of the skills named after her.

But a 0.6-point deduction for twice stepping out of bounds proved costly as she scored 14.133, narrowly behind Andrade's gold-winning score of 14.166.

The Brazilian, already a gold medallist in the vault at the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Games in 2021, won her fourth medal in Paris after all-around and vault silver and team bronze.

Despite finishing fourth in the balance beam earlier, Andrade picked herself up to ""show people it's possible"".

""It wasn't about beating Simone but beating myself,"" said the 25-year-old

""It was very cute of them. They are the world's best athletes and what they did means a lot to me, we're always rooting for each other, the final is very difficult for everyone.""

Andrade said she was proud of the all-black gymnastics podium at Olympics after the world championships, to ""show black power again, we can make it happen"".

""I love myself, I love my skin colour, but I'm not focused on that. Rebeca goes beyond her colour. The same goes for Simone and Jordan.""

Biles also finishes the Paris Games with four medals after winning golds in the team, all-around and vault.

Her Olympic total now stands at 11 -- seven gold, two silver, and two bronze.

Her well-publicised troubles with the debilitating mental block known as the ""twisties"" led to her withdrawal from multiple events in Tokyo three years ago.

Chiles, 23, took bronze after initially placing fifth after a review upped her difficulty score and pushed Romania's Ana Barbosu off the podium into fourth.

Barbosu was in tears as she had been unfurling the Romanian flag to celebrate.

""I was so tired, I didn't realise my coaches had put in an enquiry but when it came through I was very proud of myself,"" said Chiles, who also won team gold.

The crowd at Bercy Arena seemed to rise as one when Simone Biles completed her floor exercise on Monday, applauding not only her performance in the event and her stunning showing in Paris but the totality of her career, the most dominant by a women’s gymnast of all time.

In a stirring — and vindicating — coda to her Olympics, Biles won her fourth medal of the Games, a silver to go along with her three golds, in the team competition, the all-around and the vault. Rebeca Andrade of Brazil, who finished second to Biles in the all-around and vault, won gold with 14.166, edging out Biles (14.133) and Jordan Chiles of the United States (13.766), who won bronze after a few moments of confusion.

The judges raised Chiles’s score by one-tenth of a point after reviewing it, enough to push her into third from fifth place. Ana Barbosu of Romania, who thought she had won bronze, dropped to fourth, a painful moment for a Romanian program that has tried to rebuild after a poor decade in competition.

The judges’ decision had no bearing on Biles, whose return to the Olympics showcased a woman in full, defiant and bold. Three years ago in Tokyo, during the vault in the team final, Biles became disoriented in the air and afterward withdrew from all but the balance beam.

Even as encouragement poured in, Biles endured criticism from all corners of the internet. She was called a quitter, a loser and un-American.

Having regained her self-confidence, Biles reported to Paris in superb form, and she dominated the first week of competition. A few hours before competing on the floor on Monday, Biles missed the podium in the balance beam final on Monday because of a fall.

She is a stunning performer on the floor, where she seems to fly through the air, making gravity look like a mere suggestion. Biles nailed her triple-double — which she had fallen on in warm-ups — and then stepped out of bounds with both feet, a three-tenth deduction, on her second pass. She hit her third pass and then went out of bounds with both feet again on her fourth.

When Biles saw her score on the floor, she grimaced. The deductions for going out of bounds had cost her gold.

But they did not diminish her experience in Paris, where she reaffirmed her status as the best gymnast ever. Biles has won 11 Olympic medals, seven of them gold, and 41 total across the Olympics and world championships, 30 of them gold.

Every time Biles, 27, competes is a glimpse into greatness, and it is possible that these Olympics were her final appearance on the world stage. The prospect of a U.S. Olympics appeals to her — the 2028 Games will be held in Los Angeles — but she also knows how taxing another four years of training would be on her body and mind. Whether she submits to those demands is a decision for another day.

After events, fans often do not stick around for the medal ceremony, opting to beat the rush to the exits. But after the floor exercise on Monday, the stands remained full, and the fans kept chanting, “USA! USA!” No one, it seemed, wanted to see Biles’s Olympics end."

Simone Biles closed out the 2024 Summer Olympics with a silver in the women's floor exercise.

The star gymnast posted a score of 14.133 to earn her fourth medal of the Paris Games. That brings her career total to 11 overall. Brazil's Rebeca Andrade came out on top to win her second Olympic gold. Jordan Chiles rounded out the podium.

Gold: Rebeca Andrade (Brazil), 14.166

Bronze: Jordan Chiles (United States), 13.766

Biles had to mentally regroup after a slip in the balance beam relegated her to fifth place in the event earlier in the day. The floor exercise provided an opportunity to end the Paris Games on a high.

The 27-year-old posted the highest score in qualifying by some distance and also had the best performance on the floor during the team and individual all-around competitions.

While Biles didn't have one mistake that proved costly, but multiple minors deductions combined to put her just below Andrade.

Chiles, who was the last gymnast to perform, gave the United States one more shot to add to its medal haul.

It initially looked like the 23-year-old was shut out of a podium spot. The judges gave her a 13.666 score, which put her fourth and below Romania's Ana Barbosu. However, the U.S. submitted an inquiry that resulted in her getting bumped up to 13.766 and ahead of Barbosu.

Biles hasn't ruled out competing for a place on Team USA at the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, though she joked she's ""getting really old."" This was in all likelihood her last Olympic go-round."

Simone Biles added a silver in the women's floor exercise to her Olympics resume on Monday.

Biles produced a score of 14.133 to take second behind Brazil's Rebeca Andrade.

Biles' second-place finish gave Team USA its only silver medal in gymnastics in Paris. Biles played a role in the three gymnastics golds with wins in the all-around, vault and team competition.

Her American teammate Jordan Chiles had an excruciating wait for her bronze medal.

Chiles initially scored out of the top three, but a judges' inquiry corrected her score and put her in third place ahead of Romania's Ana Barbosu.

The bronze was Chiles' first individual medal as an Olympian. She earned gold in Paris and silver in Tokyo in the team competition."

Simone Biles won silver in the gymnastics floor routine final at the Paris Olympics on Monday, wrapping an extraordinary return to the Games with her fourth medal.

The iconic athlete scored 14.133 after two deductions for landing out of bounds.

Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade, who was up before her, scored 14.166, securing the gold.

“I think Rebeca got this one,” Biles said moments before her own score was announced.

Biles’ fellow U.S. competitor Jordan Chiles, who has a gold and silver medal to her name from the team competitions in Paris and Tokyo, came in third to win bronze.

She had initially placed fifth, with Romania’s Ana Bărbosu in line for the bronze, but a last-minute upgrade of Chiles’ score from 13.666 to 13.766 put her on the podium.

An elated Biles and Chiles were seen embracing after the surprise announcement.

Biles said before the Games that Andrade “scares” her the most out of her competition. The two have been seen applauding and hugging one another throughout the competitions despite their rivalry.

Biles had fallen back while landing her signature triple double tumbling pass during the warmup. Afterwards, her team re-taped her calf, which she had tweaked during the qualifiers on July 28.

In 2016, Biles soared to global superstardom when she competed in the Rio Olympics team event and four individual competitions, winning gold in all but the balance beam, where she took bronze.

“I’m not the next Usain Bolt or Michael Phelps. I’m the first Simone Biles,” she told reporters at the time.

Due to concerns about her mental health, which manifested in a disorienting phenomenon known in the gymnastics world as the “twisties,” Biles dropped out of the Tokyo Olympics during the team event. She went on to pull out of all the individual events too, except the balance beam, where she won a bronze medal.

Her decision sparked conversations around the world about prioritizing mental health and self care, especially in the sporting world, where elite athletes often face immense mental pressures on top of grueling physical ones.

She has since become an advocate in that space and has spoken candidly about going to regular therapy to process past traumas as part of her journey back to fighting shape.

Biles added three more gold medals to her collection in Paris, missing out on a podium finish just once, in the balance beam event earlier on Monday morning. After winning the coveted all-around event on Thursday, Biles wrote simply on Instagram, “mental health matters.”

Biles and teammates Chiles, Suni Lee, Jade Carey and Hezly Rivera dubbed themselves the Golden Girls after their triumph in the team event last week in a nod to a remarkable fact: they are the oldest American team to compete at the Olympics since 1952."
"Biles wins silver in gymnastics floor, her fourth medal in Paris.",https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/simone-biles-silver-medal-win-paris-olympics-2024/,"Simone Biles' performance at the Paris Olympics 2024 has been nothing short of extraordinary.

The iconic gymnast ended her time at the Olympic Games by winning silver in the women's artistic gymnastics floor category. Brazilian gymnast Rebeca Andrade took gold in the competition, while Team USA's very own Jordan Chiles secured the bronze medal. Biles reportedly lost out on the top prize due to ""some messy landings,"" which led to her scoring 14.133, which was 0.033 less than Andrade's score, the BBC reported.

Despite missing out on a fourth gold medal at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, Biles leaves the competition having demonstrated her spectacular skill. In fact, Biles' wins at the Paris Olympics helped her achieve a jaw-dropping accolade; it was revealed Biles now holds more Olympic medals than any other American gymnast, which is quite the feat.

Having paved the way for American excellence at the Olympics, Biles also stood up for other athletes on numerous occasions. Having already won multiple medals, Biles revealed she was sick and tired of being asked ""what's next"" after her Olympic victories.

Taking to X, Biles wrote, ""you guys really gotta stop asking athletes what’s next after they win a medal at the Olympics."" She continued, ""let us soak up the moment we’ve worked our whole lives for."" Biles also responded to a fan asking, ""What is your next step after winning Gold medal??"" In a pitch perfect response, the gymnast said, ""babysitting the medal.""

At the 2024 Paris Olympics alone, Biles won gold medals in the women's gymnastics individual vault final, the individual all-around, and in the women's artistic team all-around alongside her teammates Suni Lee, Jordan Chiles, Jade Carey, and Hezly Rivera. Having also won silver in the floor category, Biles is taking home an impressive haul for Team USA.

While the majority of Biles' experience at the Paris Olympics appears to have been positive, she noted some major issues with the Olympic village. In a ""Get Ready With me"" TikTok video shared on August 2, Biles revealed she'd avoided spending time in the Olympic village as her anxiety had been heightened. ""It's because the first day we got here, and I got to the cafeteria and a lot of people were asking me for photos, like non-stop,"" she said in the video. ""And whenever I sat down to eat, my anxiety was so bad I was shaking."" However, the gymnast also noted she'd had therapy that morning, and was tempering her nerves ahead of the competition."

PARIS, France — In the final event of her comeback campaign in Paris, Simone Biles stunned audiences with her stellar floor exercise.

Biles added an 11th medal to her Olympic career in Monday's floor finals with another silver. Her epic medal performance came within hours of slipping off the apparatus in the balance beam event final.

Brazil's Rebeca Andrade won gold in the floor exercise by .033.

The 27-year-old Biles, considered the greatest in the history of the sport, wasn’t at her usual best during a routine set to music from pop icons Taylor Swift and Beyonce.

But with a uniform change and a fresh mindset, Biles clinched her fourth medal in Paris — just one less than she did eight years ago in Rio de Janeiro.

“I can’t be more proud of how I’ve done,"" Biles said. “I’m 27 years old walking away from this Games with four medals to add to my collection. Not mad about it.”

Her fellow teammate Jordan Chiles also performed a fan-favorite routine set to Beyonce tunes. She also earned a spot on the medal stand, alongside Biles and Andrade.

Chiles won a bronze medal after a last-minute score change.

The 23-year-old — the last competitor of the day — initially received a 13.666 from judges. After some delay, her total was boosted by 0.1 when she filed an inquiry about her difficulty score, pushing Chiles past Romanians Ana Barbosu and Sabrina Maneca-Voinea and into third.

Biles ended nine days of competition in Paris by silencing the critics once and for all who have long derided her for pulling out of multiple events at the Tokyo Games three years ago.

There was plenty of history on the line for Biles in what could have been the last competition of her Olympic career.

The 27-year-old Olympian is now tied with Czechoslovakia's Vera Caslavska for the second-most medals by a female gymnast in Olympic history, trailing only former Soviet Union great Larisa Latynina's 18.

Floor exercise is Biles’ signature event, one that allows her to mix boundary-pushing tumbling passes that are the hardest ever done in her sport with charismatic choreography that work together to produce perhaps the most exciting 75 seconds in her sport.

The excitement, however, was tinged a bit by an uncharacteristic lapse in execution.

The routine ends with Biles blowing a kiss, a little wink that she has incorporated into her program in various forms for years.

Whether it served as a kiss goodbye remains anyone’s guess. Maybe even Biles’.

She has stayed relatively quiet on what lies ahead for her beyond the Paris Games, though she did nudge the door open a little for a possible return when the Olympics shift to Los Angeles in 2028."
"Biles wins silver in gymnastics floor, her fourth medal in Paris.",https://www.whec.com/national-world/simone-biles-finishes-off-her-return-to-the-olympics-with-a-silver-on-floor-exercise/,"PARIS (AP) — The “Redemption Tour” did not end with a golden encore for Simone Biles.

By the time she entered Bercy Arena for the beam and floor exercise finals on Monday, she was drained. Mentally. Physically. All of it.

It’s what this event does. What this sport does.

No one knows that better than the 27-year-old who has spent the last decade relentlessly propelling gymnastics — both competitively and culturally — forward.

So when Biles hopped off balance beam to miss out on one medal, then stepped out of bounds twice during her floor routine to finish second in her signature event for the first time in memory, she shrugged.

Gymnastics happens. Even to the greats. Even to the GOAT.

The woman who didn’t think she’d even be here a couple of years ago will leave Paris — and perhaps her final Olympics — with three golds and a silver and something perhaps even more valuable: peace.

“I accomplished way more than my wildest dreams, not just at this Olympics, but in the sport,” the 11-time Olympic medalist said. “So I can’t be mad at the performances. … Competing then walking away with four medals. I’m not mad about it.”

Biles certainly didn’t look mad during the awards ceremony after the floor exercise — the first one of her career at a major competition that ended with her looking up at someone else.

Instead, she and good friend and bronze medalist Jordan Chiles bowed to Rebeca Andrade, the Brazilian who has spent the last three years as the best gymnast in the world not named Biles.

“It was just the right thing to do,” Biles said. “She’s queen.”

Then the three Black women posed together on the podium four days after Biles, Andrade and Sunisa Lee, who is Hmong-American, stood in the same spot following the all-around. Their collective success is symbolic of a sport that is becoming more diverse and more inclusive at the highest level, led by someone who still describes herself as “Simone Biles from Spring, Texas who flips.”

For a long time, the flipping is what separated Biles from everyone else. Her routines are packed with so much difficultly that a wobble here or a step out of bounds there ultimately hasn’t mattered.

It did in what could be the final routine of her career. Bothered perhaps by a left calf injury she aggravated during qualifying last week, Biles wasn’t at her best during a 75-second set that features music from pop icons Taylor Swift and Beyonce and the hardest tumbling passes ever done by a woman.

Twice at the end of the passes that feature elements bearing her name in the sport’s Code of Points, her feet landed on blue boundary, costing her valuable tenths and creating just enough room for Andrade’s score of 14.166 to stand.

When a 14.133 and the No. 2 — indicating she was still in second — flashed next to Biles’ name, a packed arena that included NFL icon Tom Brady let out an “ooohhhhh” of surprise.

Biles was not one of them.

“I’m not very upset or anything about my performance at the Olympics,” she said. “I’m happy, proud and even more excited that it’s over.”

Whether it’s fully over, she’s not saying. Though Chiles may have offered a hint as they talked to reporters afterward, with Chiles leaning over and saying under her breath “I’m going to miss you man.”

So will gymnastics. The Olympics too.

Biles’ 11 career medals at the Games (seven gold, two silver, two bronze) ties Czechoslovakia’s Vera Caslavska for the second-most by a female gymnast in Olympic history.

A chance at making it a dozen ended earlier Monday when Biles fell during the beam final, finishing fifth. She was hardly the only one. Four of the finalists came off during their routines, which were done in a quiet arena that is typically a wall of sound during competition.

Not this time after the International Gymnastics Federation had the in-house DJ hit pause during event finals, which Biles said made it “really weird and awkward.”

The silence and intermittent shushing didn’t bother Italy’s Alice D’Amato, who finished off a breakout Games for the Italians — silver medalists in the team compeition — by putting together a steady set that seemed immune to the pressure or the moment. Zhou Yaqin of China earned silver with a 14.100, just ahead of bronze medalist Manila Esposito of Italy.

Biles praised D’Amato and Esposito for providing “building blocks” that she believes will help inspire young girls in Italy to take up the sport.

It’s something Biles has done during her long stay in the spotlight. She’s in no hurry to make any decision on if it’s time to let someone else step forward.

She offered “never say never” when asked over the weekend if the Los Angeles Games in 2028 are a possibility.

She will be 31 then, an age when most gymnasts have long since retired. Yet considering the gap that still exists between herself and nearly everyone else in the sport — save for Andrade, who pushed Biles as hard as she’s been pushed — anything is possible.

That is for later. For now, there is merely appreciation. The critics that pounced after Tokyo have gone quiet. So have whatever inner demons remained.

“I couldn’t have asked for a better Olympic Games, a better support system,” she said. “Thank you Paris.”

"Biles wins silver in gymnastics floor, her fourth medal in Paris.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/aug/05/simone-biles-gymnastics-olympics-beam-floor-result-paris-2024,"Simone Biles’s third and perhaps last Olympic Games came to an end on Monday afternoon with the floor exercise final, where she was pipped by Brazilian rival Rebeca Andrade for the gold by 0.033 points.

The 27-year-old, the most decorated women’s gymnast ever and the oldest American woman to make an Olympic gymnastics team since the 1950s, added a fourth medal at these Paris Games after previous golds in the team event, the all-around and the vault. She has now won 11 medals in an extraordinary Olympic career spanning eight years.

Competing third to last of the nine finalists, Biles was given a standing ovation after an extraordinary routine where she completed the eponymous Biles II triple double on the first pass and a Biles I double layout with half twist on the third, but was dinged by deductions for stepping out of bounds that left her 0.033 behind Andrade.

Jordan Chiles of the United States took the bronze, climbing from fifth to third after an inquiry. She was reduced to tears of joy after her updated score of 13.766 flashed on the screen, only 0.066 points clear of the Romanian pair of Ana Barbosu and Sabrina Maneca-Voinea.

Biles extended her mark as the most decorated women’s gymnast ever, with a combined 41 medals between the Olympics and world championships.

“I can’t be more proud of how I’ve done,” she said afterwards. “I’m 27 years old walking away from this Games with four medals to add to my collection. Not mad about it.”

With a second career gold to add to her three silvers and one bronze, the popular Andrade became the most decorated Brazilian Olympian ever. Andrade’s other gold came at Tokyo 2020 in the vault after Biles pulled out.

Earlier Biles had missed out on her fourth medal in the balance beam on Monday after she fell during her routine and finished in fifth place, one position ahead of her US teammate Suni Lee, who also fell.

Meanwhile, Italy’s Alice D’Amato didn’t win that final so much as survive it. But a routine that avoided major errors turned out to be enough for the 21-year-old from Brescia to win an improbable Olympic title, her country’s first ever gold medal in artistic gymnastics, sharing the podium with teammate Manila Esposito, who earned bronze. Biles finished fifth with an identical score to Lee, while Chinese teenager Zhou Yaqin took silver.

On the final day of a meet that began seven days ago with Italy capturing their first medal in artistic gymnastics in 96 years, Brescia and Esposito managed to hold their nerve while one heralded rival after another made costly mistakes in a beam final whose footage won’t be sent to the Olympic Museum in Lausanne for posterity.

The beam, which dares gymnasts to perform routines of extraordinary rigour on a platform 4ft above the ground and not much wider than a credit card, is the sport’s most precarious apparatus. On Monday in what can only be described as one of those days, at least half of the eight finalists fell victim to the discipline’s essential unpredictability.

Competing first in the running order of eight was Zhou, the 18-year-old Olympic debutante who took silver on beam behind Biles at last year’s worlds, who was on her way to a flawless routine before a balance check that forced her to bend over and grab the beam, drawing audible gasps from the crowd and a significant deduction from the judges. Her score of 14.100 was a disappointment after qualifying highest with 14.866.

Next was Lee, who put together a solid set until slipping on the last skill of her aerial series and splitting the beam in what appeared to be a very painful fall. She was consoled by longtime coach Jess Graba after completing her set for a score of 13.100, ending her Paris Games with a team gold and two bronzes, including one in the all-around, no minor haul for a gymnast who overcame a pair of career-threatening kidney ailments just to reach the starting line.

The door was suddenly open for Biles to become the third Olympic beam champion from the United States after Shannon Miller and Shawn Johnson.

But first D’Amato took to the apparatus and breezed through a mistake-free routine for a score of 13.466, which moved her into gold and guaranteed her a medal, prompting roars of applause from the crowd.

The clouds had parted for Biles to win an eighth Olympic gold and first ever on the beam, but she walked backward and off the beam after a back handspring-layout stepout-layout stepout, a sequence she’s rarely erred on historically. Biles climbed back on and stuck her dismount then, after an interminable wait, she was given a score of 14.100, the same as Lee and out of the medals.

Earlier, China’s Zou Jingyuan won the gold in the men’s gymnastics parallel bars event, becoming the first man in 32 years to win medals on rings and bars at the same Olympics. Ukraine’s Illia Kovtun won the silver medal and Japan’s Shinnosuke Oka took the bronze. In the men’s horizontal bar final, Oka won his third gold medal of the Olympics in a final riddled with mistakes. Colombian teenager Angel Barajas took silver and Taiwan’s Tang Chia-hung and China’s Zhang Boheng shared bronze."
"Biles wins silver in gymnastics floor, her fourth medal in Paris.",https://www.bustle.com/entertainment/olympics-2024-simone-biles-won-silver-gymnastics-floor-exercise,"The GOAT ended her 2024 Olympics run with another notch on her belt. On Aug. 5, Simone Biles took home the silver medal in the women’s artistic gymnastics floor exercise final, marking her fourth and final medal of the Paris Games.

Biles started her Olympics journey strong by leading Team USA — aka the “Golden Girls” — to a gold medal in the team final, making her the most decorated Olympic gymnast in U.S. history. She went on to win gold in the all-around and vault finals, extending her reign. Her silver finish marks Biles’ 11th Olympic medal across her gymnastics career, seven of which are gold.

During the competition, Biles scored a 14.133 after stepping out of bounds twice but managing to stick the landing on one of her signature skills, the Biles I. This was the first time she had not won gold in a floor exercise final at the Olympics. Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade, who’s long been considered Biles’ closest competitor, narrowly came in first with a score of 14.166.

Biles’ silver medal should be considered a rebound after she and her USA teammate Suni Lee didn’t medal in the balance beam final earlier in the day, placing fifth and sixth, respectively. It was an unexpected finish for Biles, who previously won bronze in the beam final at the 2016 Rio and 2020 Tokyo Games, although many other gymnasts also had trouble throughout the competition.

No matter what happened in the day’s events, the 2024 Olympics were a huge personal and athletic victory for Biles, who established her reputation as a GOAT at the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. She entered the delayed 2020 Games in Tokyo, Japan as a favorite to win, but had to pull out of several events after experiencing “the twisties,” leading her to take a break from gymnastics.

At 27 years old, Biles entered the 2024 Games as the oldest U.S. gymnast to compete at the Olympics since 1952 and is part of the oldest U.S. women’s gymnastics team ever. This sparked speculation that Paris could mark her final Olympics. However, she told USA Today on Aug. 3 to “never say never,” leaving open the possibility of competing at the Los Angeles Games in 2028.

“The next Olympics is at home, so you just never know, but I am getting really old,” she said, laughing. But for now, she doesn’t want to be asked about it anymore, writing on X, “You guys really gotta stop asking athletes what’s next after they win a medal at the Olympics.”

On Monday, Brazilian Rebeca Andrade won the gold medal in floor exercise during the final day of artistic gymnastics at the Paris 2024 Olympics.

Italians Alice D’Amato and Manila Esposito also shone, winning gold and bronze on the balance beam, respectively, while Colombian Angel Barajas took silver on the high bar. Simone Biles, who couldn’t add to her tally of three golds, earned a silver medal.

The American fell from the beam and stepped out of bounds twice during her floor routine, errors she had not made in her previous performances in Paris. Andrade secured her fourth medal of these Games, her first gold, with a score of 14.166 points, delivering a brilliant and secure routine.

Biles’ routine, with a difficulty score of 6.900 compared to Andrade’s 5.900, allowed her to reach silver despite her two out-of-bounds steps, totaling 14.133 points. Behind her was her teammate Jordan Chiles with 13.766 points, who successfully appealed for an increase in her score.

This was the second time in a few minutes that the Brazilian had outperformed Biles, also finishing ahead on the balance beam, although both were off the podium. The beam event brought previously unknown Olympic glory to Italian gymnastics, with D’Amato (14.366) and Esposito (14.000) winning gold and bronze, separated by China’s Yaqin Zhou (14.100).

After the team silver, Italy reaffirmed its status as a leading nation in women’s gymnastics, second only to the United States. Until now, their gymnasts had never won a medal on the balance beam.

Biles had a routine poised for the podium, but a backward acrobatic series caused her to lose her footing and fall. The judges deliberated extensively over her score, ultimately giving her a 13.100, which placed her out of medal contention, with Andrade also surpassing her.

Four out of the eight finalists fell. The American has never won an Olympic gold on the balance beam, although she has two bronzes from the past two Games. She ends these Games with three golds (team, individual all-around, and vault) and one silver (floor).

There was also a surprise in the final men’s event, the high bar, where Japan’s Shinnosuke Oka (14.533) took gold. Colombian 17-year-old Angel Barajas (14.533) won silver in his first season in the senior category. The bronze was shared by China’s Boheng Zhang and Taiwan’s Chia-Hung Tang, both scoring 13.966.

This was the first Olympic medal in Colombian gymnastics history and the country’s first podium finish at Paris 2024. Competing in Bercy, Barajas displayed composure that allowed him to avoid the mistakes of some favorites in a final with numerous falls.

The junior world runner-up in 2023, Barajas delivered a routine above average, including four well-executed releases, two connected, and a dismount with a double somersault and twist that he nailed. His only visible mistake was a slight lack of tension in his body at times.

This sequence by Rebeca Andrade! Art! 🇧🇷 pic.twitter.com/HFlJJWHYgF — Rafa Sales Ross (@rafiews) August 5, 2024

His difficulty score of 6.600 combined with an execution score of 7.933 totaled 14.533. He momentarily held second place and maintained it until the last two gymnasts competed, ensuring at least a bronze. Croatian Tin Srbic fell twice and was eliminated. Zhang, the favorite, performed well but spoiled his routine with a poor dismount.

Only in the parallel bars final did things go as expected. Chinese gymnast Jingyuan Zou retained his Olympic title with the highest score recorded in the entire competition, 16.200. Zou had already achieved that score in the preliminary round and repeated it in the final with a calm, clean routine, scoring 6.900 for difficulty and 9.300 for execution.

The silver medal went to Ukrainian Ilia Kovtun (15.500), one of the most consistent gymnasts of the last cycle, and the bronze to the new all-around Olympic champion, Japan’s Oka Shinnosuke (15.300). Both are 20 years old, six years younger than the champion.

Chinese and Ukrainian gymnasts have alternated victories on this apparatus in the last eight Games. Ukrainian Oleg Verniaiev, gold medalist in 2016, fell and lost all chance of a medal.

Artistic gymnastics concluded with the United States leading the medal table (3-1-6), followed by Japan (3-0-1) and China (2-5-2). Fifteen countries made it to the podium at least once.

Biles finished out her Paris Olympics with a silver medal in the individual floor exercise and fifth place finish in the balance beam

Jamie Squire/Getty Simone Biles enters the arena ahead of the floor exercise final on Aug. 5.

Simone Biles is leaving Paris having made herself proud — and having set a few records.

The athlete, already the most decorated gymnast of all time, finished out the 2024 Paris Olympics by winning her fourth medal of the Games, a silver in the women's artistic gymnastics individual floor routine on Aug. 5.

In a press conference after the event, Biles, 27, told reporters she was immensely proud of her performance, especially considering the difficult road she'd had in getting herself back into competition shape.

""I've accomplished way more than my wildest dreams, not just as this Olympics, but in this sport,"" she said. ""I can't be mad at my performances. A couple of years ago I didn't think I'd be back here at an Olympic game.""

Biles was forced to bow out of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 after she was struck with a bout of the dreaded ""twisties,"" which made it difficult for her to safely perform her highly technical flips.

She also competed in the women's individual balance beam final on Monday, but landed in fifth place with a 13.100 score after falling.

The athlete started her Summer Games with a gold in the team event alongside Suni Lee, Hezly Rivera, Jade Carey and Jordan Chiles. Then, in the individual all-around, Biles also took gold. She is the oldest gymnast to ever win the all-around.

On Aug. 3, she won her third gold medal of these Games after earning a 15.300 on the vault.

Overall, Biles has now won 11 Olympic medals. She's won 30 world championship medals, and is the most decorated gymnast of all time.

Earlier in these Games, Biles was subtly asked if she'd be returning for the next Summer Olympics in four years, which will take place in Los Angeles.

During a press conference at Bercy Arena after the vault final, a reporter questioned, ""Is this the last time we're going to see you vaulting in competition?""

""This is my last, definitely Yurchenko double pike [vault]. I mean I kind of nailed that one. So never say never,"" said Biles in response. ""The home Games — the next Olympics is at home, so you just never know. But I am getting really old.""

Biles had never lost a major international competition in the event, including at the 2016 Rio Olympics, though she did withdraw from the competition at the 2020 Tokyo Games, citing the need to protect her physical and mental health.

Biles missed the podium earlier in the day with a fifth-place finish in balance beam after a fall. Fellow American Suni Lee finished sixth, while Italy's Alice D'Amato won gold.

Biles' silver in floor is her fourth medal in Paris, adding to the gold she won in the team, all-around, and vault events.

It's the 11th career medal for the 27-year-old U.S. star, tying her with Czechoslovakia's Vera Caslavska for second-most by a female gymnast in Olympic history. They trail Soviet Union gymnast Larisa Latynina's 18."

In extraordinary, error-strewn scenes that played out in front of a chattering crowd, the slippery beam took out half of the eight competitors – including Biles herself.

Biles, who had already won team, all-around and vault titles, looked a strong contender for gold after two of her main challengers – teammate Sunisa Lee and China’s Zhou Yaqin – slipped during their routines following shaky starts. Romania’s Sabrina Maneca-Voinea was particularly haunted by the greasy apparatus, slipping twice during her display.

“Beam final is always the most stressful,” said Biles, who lost her footing after a double layout before producing a flawless dismount, to finish fifth.

“Usually we have music or background noise, or whatever that may be. Honestly, we do better in environments when there’s noise going on because it feels most like practice. Today we could hear some of those Android ringtones going off, the photo flickers.

“Then people start cheering and the shushing gets louder. It was really weird and awkward. We’ve asked several times if we can have some music or background noise. I’m not really sure what happened there. None of us liked it. Yeah, it was an odd beam final.”"

PARIS -- American gymnast Simone Biles didn't get the golden send-off she sought.

Biles earned silver in the floor exercise finals on Monday -- her fourth medal in Paris and 11th Olympic medal overall -- after a routine that included a couple of costly steps out of bounds.

Brazil's Rebeca Andrade became the first gymnast to beat Biles in a floor final in a major international competition, posting a score of 14.166 that finished just ahead of Biles at 14.133.

Jordan Chiles, a longtime friend and teammate of Biles, earned the bronze.

Biles, considered the greatest in the history of the sport, wasn't at her usual best during a routine set to music from pop icons Taylor Swift and Beyonce.

She's going home with gold medals from the team, all-around and vault finals and a silver that came as a surprise in her signature event.

""I can't be more proud of how I've done,"" Biles said. ""I'm 27 years old walking away from this Games with four medals to add to my collection. Not mad about it.""

Biles' overall medal total (including seven gold, two silver, two bronze) ties Czechoslovakia's Vera Caslavska for the second most by a female gymnast in Olympic history. She missed a chance to add a fifth Paris medal earlier Monday when she fell during the beam final, finishing fifth.

Though she can make it look easy at times, it is not. She thudded to the mat during her floor warm-up and had the balky left calf she tweaked in qualifying last week rewrapped before she competed.

Her tumbling passes weren't perfect -- she stepped out of bounds twice -- but her difficulty is usually so far above everyone else that it hardly matters.

Not this time. She received a 7.833 execution score that included 0.6 in deductions for stepping out of bounds, allowing Andrade to win her second Olympic gold.

Still, wearing a red-white-and-blue leotard featuring thousands of crystals, Biles ended nine days of competition in Paris by silencing the critics once and for all who have long derided her for pulling out of multiple events at the Tokyo Games three years ago.

""I've accomplished way [more than I thought I would],"" she said. ""A couple years ago, I didn't think I'd be back here.""

Chiles -- the last competitor of the day -- initially received a 13.666 from judges. After some delay, her total was boosted by 0.1 when she filed an inquiry about the difficulty component of her score. That pushed Chiles past Romanians Ana Barbosu and Sabrina Maneca-Voinea and into third.

Biles said after winning the vault final Saturday that she noticed her haters were ""really quiet now, so that's strange.""

As opposed to the constant roar of support that followed Biles wherever she went inside Bercy Arena, which has become a hub for celebrities from across the spectrum -- including former NFL great Tom Brady on Monday -- whenever she performs.

Floor exercise is Biles' signature event, one that allows her to mix boundary-pushing tumbling passes that are the hardest ever done in her sport with charismatic choreography that work together to produce perhaps the most exciting 75 seconds in her sport.

The excitement, however, was tinged a bit by an uncharacteristic lapse in execution.

The routine ends with Biles blowing a kiss, a little wink that she has incorporated into her program in various forms for years.

Whether it served as a kiss goodbye remains anyone's guess -- maybe even Biles'.

She has stayed relatively quiet on what lies ahead for her beyond the Paris Games, though she did nudge the door open a little for a possible return when the Olympics shift to Los Angeles in 2028.

""Never say never,"" Biles said after claiming her second Olympic vault title earlier in the Games. ""Next Olympics are at home. So you just never know. I am getting really old.""

She will be 31 then, an age when most gymnasts have long since retired. Yet Biles is redefining that adage in real time, and considering the gap that still exists between herself and nearly everyone else in the sport -- save for Andrade, who pushed Biles as hard as she's been pushed in nearly a decade -- anything is possible.

Her floor silver came about an hour after a beam final in which half of the eight women in the field found themselves hopping off in the middle of their routine after losing their balance.

Biles included. She lost her balance at the end of her acro series and received a score of 13.100 to wind up fifth, tied with teammate Sunisa Lee.

Like Biles, Lee saw her hopes for gold end in the middle of her routine when she fell during the same part of her routine as Biles.

Afterward, the two Olympic champions and longtime friends, who have a staggering 17 Olympic medals between them, commiserated over the weird vibe inside an oddly silent arena that is usually throbbing with music at all times.

""It adds to the stress, just because it's like you, yes, you're the only one up there,"" said Lee, who will take some time off before making any decision about her future. ""So I was feeling the pressure.""

Alice D'Amato of Italy took the gold on beam with a score of 14.366. Zhou Yaqin of China earned silver with a 14.100, just ahead of bronze medalist Manila Esposito of Italy. Italy, which won silver behind the U.S. in the team competition, had never medaled on beam before.

The awards podium stand has long served as a second home for Biles during a career that includes 41 medals in major international competitions. A number that may never be broken and -- who knows? -- could possibly even be added to in Los Angeles.

""It means the world that I could come back out here and compete on an international stage again, representing my country, Biles said. ""I couldn't have asked for a better Olympic Games, a better support system, better teammates. So yeah, thank you. Thank you. Paris.""

EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- After being one of seven members from the 2023 Michigan football program accused of violating NCAA rules in a draft of the NCAA's notice of allegations obtained by ESPN on Monday, Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh denied any wrongdoing.

""Never lie. Never cheat. Never steal. I was raised with that lesson,"" he said at a brief news conference, appearing to read from a prepared statement. ""I have raised my family on that lesson. I have preached that lesson to the teams that I have coached. No one is perfect. If you stumble, you apologize and you make it right. Today, I do not apologize. I did not participate, was not aware nor complicit in those said allegations. So, it's back to work and attacking with an enthusiasm unknown to mankind.""

Harbaugh, who left Michigan to coach the Los Angeles Chargers after winning a national championship in January, is accused of committing a Level 1 violation, the most serious category in the NCAA's enforcement process. The NCAA accuses Harbaugh of not cooperating because he denied the organization's request to view relevant messages and phone records from his cellphone. The draft says Harbaugh could face a ""show-cause"" restriction if he ever opts to return to college sports.

Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter and defensive backs coach Steve Clinkscale, who came to the NFL with Harbaugh from Michigan, are also accused of recruiting violations in the draft notice.

Clinkscale is accused of helping a recruit get verified on Instagram and of writing a $100 check for a golf charity event run by a recruit's father. Former Michigan linebackers coach Chris Partridge and ex-DC Minter are accused of Level 2 violations for allegedly sending text messages to a high school sophomore recruit.

Clinkscale and Minter did not speak to reporters Monday. Partridge is now an assistant coach for the Seattle Seahawks. Harbaugh's news conference abruptly ended after his statement on the NCAA's accusations, lasting just over five minutes. His news conferences typically last close to 20 minutes."
Harbaugh 'was not aware' of any U-M violations.,https://www.ocregister.com/2024/08/05/chargers-coach-jim-harbaugh-unaware-of-violations-at-michigan/,"EL SEGUNDO — Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh on Monday denied any knowledge of or wrongdoing by the University of Michigan football staff while he was the head coach. Harbaugh, hired by the Chargers in January, was one of seven members of the Wolverines program accused of NCAA violations.

ESPN obtained a draft copy of the notice of allegations on Sunday.

“Yeah, I do have a comment,” Harbaugh said. “Never lie. Never cheat. Never steal. I was raised with that lesson. I have raised my family on that lesson. I have preached that lesson to the teams I have coached. No one is perfect. If you stumble, you apologize and you make it right. Today, I do not apologize. I have not participated and was not aware nor complicit in those said allegations. So, for me, it’s back to work and attacking with an enthusiasm unknown to mankind.”

Sherrone Moore, Harbaugh’s successor at Michigan, faces possible sanctions.

The NCAA accuses Harbaugh of not cooperating with its investigation because he denied the organization access to his cellphone’s text and voice messages, what it considers to be a Level 1 violation, the most serious. He could face a “show-cause” restriction if he returns to coaching in college.

In addition, Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter and defensive backs coach Steve Clinkscale are accused of recruiting violations in the draft notice of violations. Minter and Clinkscale left Michigan for the Chargers with Harbaugh after leading the Wolverines to the national title last season.

The Big Ten suspended Harbaugh for the final three regular-season games of the 2023 season for violating the conference’s sportsmanship rules relating to a sign-stealing scandal involving a former staffer. In one instance, evidence showed Connor Stalions was disguised as a Central Michigan coach and wearing a sideline pass during the Chippewas’ game against Michigan State.

The draft notice does not indicate there is evidence that Harbaugh knew of Stalions’ ongoing actions, but suggested that Harbaugh failed to notice possible “red flags” related to Stalions’ activity. Stalions resigned in November after reports of his illegal scouting operation were published in the media.

Minter was accused of sending a text message to a recruit who was a high school sophomore at the time, a Level 2 violation. Clinkscale was accused of providing illegal benefits to recruits, including paying for meals and writing a $100 check to a recruit’s father for a charity golf tournament.

Clinkscale also is alleged to have helped a recruit get verified on Instagram.

Harbaugh also served a self-imposed three-game suspension to begin the 2023 season related to possible recruiting violations, including buying recruits meals. It was reported that the NCAA’s efforts to expedite the case collapsed because Harbaugh refused to cooperate in the investigation.

Despite the suspensions and the possibility of NCAA sanctions, Harbaugh led the Wolverines to a 15-0 record and the national championship in January. The Chargers then hired him on Jan. 24. Minter and Clinkscale were hired in the weeks that followed as the franchise retooled its coaching staff.

Harbaugh spent the past nine seasons at Michigan, his alma mater. He’s also coached the San Francisco 49ers in the NFL and collegiately at Stanford and the University of San Diego. He spent 15 seasons as a quarterback in the NFL, including two with the Chargers in 1999 and 2000.

EXTRA POINTS

Harbaugh said final decisions hadn’t been made on who might play and who might sit out the first of the Chargers’ three exhibition games on Saturday against the Seattle Seahawks at SoFi Stadium. He said those who do play would be made on an “individual, case-by-case” basis. …

The Chargers ratcheted back the intensity of Monday’s practice, the 11th session of training camp, after a joint practice with the Rams on Sunday. In fact, practice was delayed by 30 minutes from its original starting time of 10 a.m. to give the players additional rest after Sunday’s physical session. …

Quarterback Justin Herbert watched practice for a second consecutive day while wearing a walking boot to protect the plantar fascia injury in his right foot. Harbaugh said he didn’t have an update on Herbert’s condition. Herbert is expected to wear the boot for approximately two weeks."

El Segundo, Calif. — Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh on Monday said he has no reason to apologize as he continued to deny having any knowledge of the impermissible-scouting operation that triggered an NCAA investigation of his Michigan program during its championship run last year.

“Never lie. Never cheat. Never steal. I was raised with that lesson. I have raised my family on that lesson. I have preached that lesson to the teams I’ve coached. No one’s perfect. If you stumble, you apologize and you make it right,"" Harbaugh said after practice.

“Today, I do not apologize. I did not participate. I was not aware nor complicit in those said allegations. So for me, it’s back to work and attacking with an enthusiasm unknown to mankind.""

Harbaugh left the Wolverines on Jan. 24 to become coach of Los Angeles, two weeks after he led his alma mater to its first national title since 1997.

Harbaugh could face Level 1 NCAA violations — the most serious the association can levy to an individual — as part of an investigation into impermissible scouting and sign-stealing.

More:Wojo: Wolverines and Sherrone Moore can’t escape the sign-stealing shadow

Michigan is expected to receive a notice of allegations from the NCAA soon.

A draft of the notice includes accusations of rules violations by Harbaugh and other staff members, including Sherrone Moore, who was promoted from offensive coordinator to head coach, three people briefed on the document told The Associated Press on Sunday.

The people spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the notice was confidential.

Connor Stalions, a former low-level recruiting staffer, is accused of running an off-campus, advanced-scouting scheme for more than two years at Michigan. Stalions sent people to the games of Michigan's opponents to digitally record play signals to be used to steal signs during games. Advanced scouting and recording signs is against NCAA rules.

Harbaugh was suspended twice for a total of six games last season, first at the start of the season for an unrelated NCAA investigation into recruiting violations. Michigan resolved its portion of that case in April and was placed on three years' probation.

The Big Ten suspended Harbaugh for the final three games of the 2023 regular season to punish Michigan for violating the conference’s sportsmanship policy after its own investigation of the sign-stealing scheme.

The sign-stealing case is still likely months — at least — from being resolved. NCAA policy gives schools 90 days to respond to a notice of allegations. After a response, the school would be scheduled for a hearing in front of the NCAA’s committee on infractions, though a negotiated resolution would still be possible."

Harbaugh, who departed his alma mater to take the head coaching job with the Los Angeles Chargers in January, hasn’t changed his stance, despite ESPN reporting Sunday details of a draft of an NCAA notice of allegations that accuses the 61-year-old and other members of his staff of violating NCAA rules.

According to the report, Harbaugh is facing a Level I violation – the most severe of rule infractions – for allegedly failing to cooperate with investigators by denying requests from the NCAA to look through his messages and phone records in relation to the sign-stealing probe, which centers around former staffer Connor Stalions. Harbaugh could face a show-cause penalty if he returns to the college level.

“Never lie. Never cheat. Never steal,” Harbaugh told reporters Monday during training camp. “I was raised with that lesson. I have raised my family on that lesson. I have preached that lesson to the teams I’ve coached. No one’s perfect. If you stumble, you apologize and you make it right. Today, I do not apologize. I did not participate, was not aware nor complicit in those said allegations. So, it’s back to work and attacking with an enthusiasm unknown to mankind.”

Harbaugh and Stalions are two of seven staffers from the 2023 Michigan football team found to allegedly have violated NCAA rules. According to the ESPN, the report notes there was no evidence that Harbaugh was involved in Stalions’ sign-stealing operation or that he knew what was going on, but that he failed to actively look for or evaluate “red flags.”

Current head coach Sherrone Moore is the lone current Michigan staff member accused of an NCAA violation, according to the report. Moore, who served as interim head coach for four games in 2023 when Harbaugh was suspended, allegedly deleted a thread of 52 text messages with Stalions in October when news of the NCAA investigation became public.

Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter and defensive backs coach Steve Clinkscale, who followed Harbaugh from Michigan, are accused of recruiting violations in the draft notice, per ESPN.

The school also faces a Level 1 violation charge, according to the draft, because of its “pattern of noncompliance within the football program” and institutional efforts to hinder or thwart the NCAA’s investigation, ESPN reported.

Meanwhile, Harbaugh and the Chargers begin their preseason schedule Saturday against the Seattle Seahawks."

Former head coach Jim Harbaugh, former linebackers coach Chris Partridge and Denard Robinson, formerly assistant director of personnel, are all accused of Level 1 violations. The Head Coach Responsibility rule would come into play for Harbaugh, who did not provide phone and email records to the NCAA and is accused of not cooperating with the NCAA. Harbaugh, who led Michigan to the 2023 national championship is now head coach of the Los Angeles Chargers, and Moore, who had been offensive coordinator/offensive line coach, was elevated to head coach in January.

Moore is facing a Level II allegation.

ESPN was the first to report the contents of the draft NOA on Sunday. A source who has viewed the draft of the NOA, but is not authorized to speak publicly about its contents, confirmed details of the document to The Detroit News.

Generally, a draft of a Notice of Allegations lays out accusations and findings from the NCAA but does not issue penalties. The NCAA's Allegation Review Board (ARB) met at the end of June to discuss the NOA draft. The school and individuals involved will have an opportunity to respond and it’s possible a negotiated resolution is reached with the NCAA. The NCAA later issues the final Notice of Allegations and penalties eventually are revealed in what has been lengthy processes.

“Our athletic department and university continue to cooperate with the NCAA regarding our ongoing investigation,” Michigan football spokesman David Ablauf said in a message to The Detroit News on Sunday. “We do not have an update to share regarding its status at this time.”

This is the second investigation for which Michigan football has been involved in recent years. An investigation into impermissible recruiting during the COVID-19 recruiting dead period resulted in a school-imposed three-game suspension for Harbaugh at the start of last year and Harbaugh was charged with a Level I violation for “unethical or dishonest conduct and a failure to cooperate,” according to the NOA that was delivered to Michigan last October and recently released to The News.

Moore served a one-game suspension as part of a negotiated resolution for the first investigation, and that could make Moore considered a repeat offender in this latest investigation.

The NCAA enforcement staff alleges that on Oct. 19 and Oct. 20, 2023, after it was announced on Oct. 19 that the NCAA was investigating Michigan, that Moore allegedly deleted 52 text messages with Stalions. Moore also allegedly deleted a single message to another football staff member on Oct. 20. The messages were recovered by the NCAA through device imaging and Moore ""subsequently"" produced them to the enforcement staff, according to the draft NOA.

Stalions, according to the draft NOA, failed to cooperate with its investigation. ESPN reports, but The News could not confirm, that in October 2023, Stalions removed hard drives from the Michigan football offices and also gave a football player a sheet containing play-calling signals of a future opponent.

Partridge, fired last November on the day Michigan was leaving for a game at Maryland, is accused of encouraging a player to lie to NCAA investigators. The Detroit News reported on Nov. 17, the day Partridge was fired, that two sources said his firing was because he pressured at least one player to be untruthful or not to cooperate with NCAA investigators who had been conducting interviews on campus.

As for Harbaugh, who has maintained he was not aware of the illegal scouting, he could face a show-cause penalty from the NCAA as a repeat offender. Tom Mars, who has represented Harbaugh in the NCAA investigations, said the charge of not cooperating with investigators is of little concern.

“The way I see it, this is like being in college and getting a letter from your high school threatening to suspend you because you didn’t sign the yearbook,” Mars told The Detroit News on Sunday. “So, I’d be surprised if Coach Harbaugh lets this distract him from winning a Super Bowl.”

At the heart of the allegations is Stalions, who was hired by Michigan May 3, 2022, according to his contract, as a “player personnel analyst” with a salary of $56,100. He allegedly orchestrated the illegal scouting/sign-stealing scheme that launched an NCAA investigation on Oct. 18, 2023.

Two days later, Stalions was suspended with pay. On Nov. 3, he resigned and according to his personnel file obtained by The Detroit News, Stalions failed to cooperate with the investigation and resigned a day after a scheduled a disciplinary review conference with Michigan officials.

Brad Beckworth, Stalions’ attorney, issued a statement shortly after his client resigned saying, in part: ""Connor also wants to make it clear that, to his knowledge, neither Coach Harbaugh, nor any other coach or staff member, told anyone to break any rules or were aware of improper conduct regarding the recent allegations of advanced scouting.""

Stalions will be featured in a Netflix documentary, “Untold: Sign Stealer” on Aug. 27 and will, according to the streaming service, publicly address the allegations for the first time.

This NCAA investigation, the second to hit Michigan football since 2021, led the Big Ten to suspend Harbaugh based on information provided by the NCAA for the final three regular-season games that included a game at Penn State and the regular-season finale against Ohio State.

Stalions reportedly purchased tickets in his name to multiple games from 2021-2023 involving future Michigan opponents, according to an ESPN report, and he sent different people to shoot video of the signs. The Washington Post received results of an outside investigative firm revealing Stalions had plans and budgets for impermissible scouting of opponents contained in computer drives maintained and accessed by multiple Michigan coaches.

He graduated from Lake Orion High in 2013 and is a 2017 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy. Stalions is a former officer in the Marine Corps and worked as a volunteer with Michigan for several years before his hiring.

According to the ESPN report, the NCAA alleges multiple team interns and at least one other full-time team employee knew about the sign-stealing scheme and participated in it and that Stalions led them to believe it was not against the rules. Also, the NCAA revealed in the draft, according to the report, that evidence shows Stalions was on the Central Michigan sideline for the season opener last season at Michigan State. Stalions was in disguise and wearing Central Michigan coaching apparel. It remains unclear how Stalions obtained the sideline pass. Screenshots from that game showing what appeared to be Stalions surfaced on Oct. 31. CMU, in a statement to The News on July 30, said it is still cooperating with the NCAA investigation.

Nearly two weeks after Stalions resigned, linebackers coach Partridge was fired. According to his termination letter, Partridge failed to abide by the university’s directive to not discuss the investigation. Partridge issued a statement after the conclusion of the regular season and said there were inaccuracies in the reason for his termination. There had been speculation in national media reports that Partridge destroyed computer evidence.

“I want to be clear: I had no knowledge whatsoever of any in-person or illegal scouting or illegal sign stealing,” Partridge wrote in a social media post. “Additionally, at no point did I destroy any evidence related to an ongoing investigation.”

Michigan then withdrew a lawsuit against the Big Ten to attempt to return Harbaugh to the sideline for the final regular-season games.

There also were several alleged violations unrelated to the sign-stealing investigation in the NOA draft, according to ESPN. Partridge is accused of Level 2 violations involving holding on-campus training sessions with at least four recruits during the spring and summer of 2023. Also according to the ESPN report, Partridge, former defensive backs coach Steve Clinkscale and Robinson are accused of providing impermissible benefits to recruits in 2023, including paying for a recruit's meal and providing recruits with team gear. Clinkscale allegedly helped a recruit get verified on Instagram and wrote a $100 check to a golf charity outing that was run by a recruit's father. Partridge and former defensive coordinator Jesse Minter are accused of Level 2 violations for sending text messages to a recruit who was a high school sophomore.

The NCAA applies three levels to its violations — Level I, a “severe breach of conduct”, Level II, a “significant breach of conduct” and Level III, “breach of conduct.”

Level I violations, per an NCAA graphic, “seriously undermine or threaten the integrity of college sports” and provide a recruiting or competitive advantage. They can include “lack of institutional control” and “Violation of head coach responsibility rules” among others.

Level II violations are, according to the NCAA, “more than minimal but less than a substantial or extensive recruiting, competitive or other advantage.” They can be “systemic violations that do not amount to lack of institutional control."" And Level III violations are considered isolated or limited in nature.

Harbaugh 'was not aware' of any U-M violations.,https://thebharatexpressnews.com/jim-harbaugh-again-denies-knowledge-of-michigan-sign-theft-scheme-i-make-no-apologies/,"Los Angeles Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh said Monday he has no reason to apologize, continuing to deny knowledge of the impermissible scouting operation that led to an NCAA investigation into his Michigan program during last year’s championship run.

“Never lie. Never cheat. Never steal. I was raised with that lesson. I raised my family with that lesson. I preached that lesson to the teams I coached. Nobody’s perfect. When you stumble, you apologize and you make it right,” Harbaugh said after practice. “Today, I’m not apologizing. I didn’t participate. I was not aware of those allegations and I was not complicit in them. So for me, it’s back to work and attacking with a zeal unknown to humanity.”

Harbaugh left the Wolverines on January 24 to become Los Angeles’ coach, two weeks after leading his alma mater to its first national title since 1997.

Harbaugh could face violations of NCAA Level 1 rules, the most serious the association can impose on an individual, as part of a investigation into unauthorized scouting and board theft.

Michigan is expected to be notified of the allegations by the NCAA soon.

A draft of the notice includes allegations of rule violations by Harbaugh and other staff members, including Sherrone Moorewho was promoted from offensive coordinator to head coach, three people with knowledge of the document told The Associated Press on Sunday.

The people spoke to AP on condition of anonymity because the statement was confidential.

Connor Stallionsa former low-level recruiting staffer, is accused of running an off-campus, advanced-scouting scheme at Michigan for more than two years. Stalions sent people to Michigan opponents’ games to digitally record game signals that could be used to steal signs during games. Advanced scouting and board recording violate NCAA rules.

Harbaugh was suspended twice last season for a total of six games, first at the start of the season for an unrelated NCAA investigation in violations of the recruiting law. Michigan settled its part of that case in April and was placed on three years’ probation.

The Big Ten Harbaugh suspended for last three games of the 2023 regular season to punish Michigan for violating the conference’s sportsmanship policy, following its own investigation into the board-stealing scheme.

The sign-stealing case is likely months — at least — away from resolution. NCAA policy gives schools 90 days to respond to a notice of allegations. After a response, the school would be scheduled for a hearing before the NCAA Committee on Infractions, though a negotiated resolution would still be possible."

SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) — Noah Lyles paced on the far end of the track, hands folded over the top of his head, wistfully looking up at a scoreboard that would, sooner or later, flash an answer he’s been seeking over three sweat-soaked years.

Was all that toil since the last Olympics — all the work on the practice track and in the weight room in the name of finding a centimeter here or a millisecond there — really going to be worth all the trouble?

Ten seconds passed, then 20. Then, nearly 30. And then, the answer popped up.

Yes, Lyles is the 100-meter champion at the Paris Olympics. The World’s Fastest Man.

Just not by very much.

The American showman edged out Jamaica’s Kishane Thompson on Sunday by five-thousandths of a second — that’s .005 of one tick of the clock — in a race for the ages.

The final tally in this one: Lyles 9.784 seconds, Thompson 9.789.

The new champion said that before he left for Paris, one of his physio guys ensured him this race would be a squeaker.

“He said, ‘This is how close first and second are going to be,’” Lyles said as he pinched his thumb and his forefinger together so they were almost touching. “I can’t believe how right he was.”

For perspective, the blink of an eye takes, on average, .1 second. That was 20 times longer than the gap between first and second.

It was so close, that when the sprinters crossed the line and the word “Photo” popped up next to the names of Lyles, Thompson and five others in the eight-man field, Lyles walked over to the Jamaican and said “I think you got the Olympics dog.”

Thompson, who raced three lanes to the left of Lyles and had no clue where he was on the track, wasn’t convinced.

“I was, ‘Wow, I’m not even sure, because it was that close,’” the Jamaican said.

Time would tell. It always does. When Lyles’ name came up first, he snatched his name tag off the front of his bib and held it to the sky. Moments later, he shouted at the TV camera: “America, I told you I got this!”

The first four racers were separated by less than .03. The top seven all finished within .09 of each other.

America’s Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81. “That’s probably one of the most beautiful races I’ve been in,” he said.

In the photo finish, Kerley’s orange shoe crossed the line before anyone, or anything. But it’s the chest breaking the barrier that counts. Lyles’ chest crossed first.

This was the closest 1-2 finish in the 100 since at least Moscow in 1980 — or maybe even ever.

Back then, Britain’s Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in an era when the electronic timers didn’t go into the thousandths of a second. The same was true in 1932, when Eddie Tolan won the Olympics’ first ever photo finish.

Lyles conceded that during the excruciating wait, he was pretty sure he had dipped his chest just a tad too soon. Dipping, it turns out, is one of the few things he doesn’t work on over and over again at his training track in Florida.

“But I would say I have a decent history with dipping,” he said, recalling races he won in high school and as a junior.

The 9.784 marked a new personal best for Lyles and made him the first American champion in the marquee race at the Olympics since Justin Gatlin in 2004.

Lyles is hoping to go even bigger than that, and maybe take this sport back to a day when it was Carl Lewis and Edwin Moses lighting up the track — a must-see affair, the likes of which Lyles headlined in front of around 80,000 on a warm night at the Stade de France.

The mission started after Lyles settled for a bronze medal in Tokyo in his favorite — and then, only — sprint, the 200. Those COVID-impacted Games were a terrible experience for Lyles. He rededicated himself to bettering his mental health, but also looked for a new mission — the 100 meters and, with it, a chance at track immortality.

The practice was tough for a sprinter never known as a great starter, but he stuck with it. When he won the world championships last year, then backed it up by winning the 200, his goal for Paris was very much in sight.

But when he came into the Olympic final having finished second in both his qualifying races and staring across at one sprinter who had run faster than him this year — Thompson — and another who had beaten him twice this year — Jamaica’s Oblique Seville — he knew this would be no coronation.

Thompson added another roadblock when, during the introduction, he let out a primal scream, the likes of which Lyles has been unleashing in some of his biggest races.

“I thought ‘Man, that’s my thing, that’s crazy,’” Lyles said.

Lyles galloped and leapt about 20 yards down the track before returning to the starting line, where the runners waited some three minutes for the gun to finally sound.

It was worth the wait.

Now, the question that could be debated for years is: What was the difference in this one?

Could it have been Lyles’ closing speed and that lean into the line that he thought was mistimed?

Was it his ability to stay in reach of everyone among this straight line of sprinters over the first 60 meters — a skill he’s been working on in tedious practice after practice since he took on the shorter sprint?

The answer: all that and more.

“Everyone in the field came out knowing they could win this race,” Lyles said.

It took 9.784 seconds, then about 30 seconds more, for the scoreboard to flash the name of the man who actually did.

“Seeing that name, I was like ‘Oh my gosh, there it is!’” Lyles said.

Gold (and bronze) for Ukrainian high jumpers

Yaroslava Mahuchikh won Olympic gold in the high jump for her war-torn country of Ukraine and, as a bonus, had company. Her teammate Iryna Gerashchenko won the bronze and the teammates hopped, skipped and jumped around the track parading their blue-and-yellow flags in a heartfelt celebration.

Mahuchikh needed fewer tries to clear the winning height of 2 meters than Australia’s Nicola Olyslagers, and so, added the sport’s biggest prize of all — Olympic gold — to her world championship and world record.

Kerr vs Ingebrigtsen is a go for heated men’s 1,500

The best rivalry in track will culminate Tuesday when reigning world champion Josh Kerr of Britain takes on defending Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen of Norway.

They squared off in Sunday’s semifinal, too, and Ingebrigtsen edged out the Brit, looking over to him twice as they surged down the homestretch, to win a race that felt like it meant more than it should have in 3:32.38.

“They should be expecting one of the most vicious and hardest 1,500s the sport’s seen in a very long time,” Kerr said.

Did Ingebrigtsen agree?

“Depends who you ask, maybe,” he said. “I mean, racing is what you want it to be.”

He may also be able to claim the title of the most famous—and certainly the fastest—anime fan.

After a spectacularly close photo-finish saw Lyles take gold, the 27-year-old Team USA runner—known to be a showman—made sure to dedicate a bit of his celebrations to his love for the genre of Japanese animation popularly associated in the U.S. with nerds, pressing his wrists together to strike the signature pose of Goku from Dragon Ball Z.

In the anime, the pose, known as the Kamehameha, is an energy attack commonly used as the ultimate move to finish off opponents. On the track, it’s a fixture—along with various other references to his favorite animes—in Lyles’ repertoire of pre- and post-race routines.

“If you ever wondered why I put my hands together stretched out in front of me it’s because Goku did,” he wrote on Instagram in March, in a post paying tribute to the late manga artist and Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama. “This is the great effect that the creation of Akira Toriyama has had on my life.”

On top of his athletic achievements, Lyles’ obsession with anime has become part of his persona that has captivated audiences across the globe.

During the U.S. Olympic trials in June, at which Lyles won the 100-m and 200-m sprints, he was seen whipping out Yu Gi Oh! cards from under his bib before his races, flaunting his collectibles for the camera—as part of a bet with shot putter Chase Ealey, a fellow anime fan who wore Naruto-inspired leg weights.

And in 2019, Lyles dyed his hair silver ahead of his first appearance at the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships. “In Dragon Ball Z, Goku’s final stage, or form, is Ultra Instinct. His hair turns silver/gray,” he told the Washington Post of the stylistic choice. “I’m ready to go. I’m ready to make the team. I’m in my highest state.”

But Lyles is far from the only Olympian who has been spotted geeking out at the Games. During his introduction at the Tokyo Olympics, Greek long jumper Miltiádis Tentóglou squatted down and touched his fist to the ground in a tribute to Monkey D. Luffy, the protagonist of the anime One Piece. Italian race walker Massimo Stano and U.S. shot putter Payton Otterdahl similarly recreated One Piece poses in Tokyo.

Lyles, for his part, was always confident he would deliver a serious performance in Paris—as much as he was sure he’d also bring levity and laughter to the Games.

“If you need somebody to entertain you for this Olympics … I got you,” he told TIME in May. “And I can promise you, if you’re watching me, you will not be bored.”"

The difference between Gold medalist Noah Lyles and Oblique Seville, who finished last, was just 0.22 seconds. Noah Lyles piped the rest of the pack by having his torso ahead, at the right time.

Noah Lyles was the slowest to get off the block and the last amongst the 8 runners at the 30m mark. However, the world 100m and 200m champion kicked on and edged Kishane Thompson, who topped the semi-finals, by a whisker. The victory was sealed by the barest of margins in a spectacular photo finish.

It appeared that Kishane Thompson's boot went past the finish line first, but Lyles aced the finishing position, getting his torso ahead. The crowd at the Stade de France held its breath along with the runners to learn the result of the men's 100m race after the photo finish. They were made to wait for a few seconds before the official result was displayed on the big screen, much to the delight of Lyles and the American fans in Paris.

Wondering how Noah Lyles won the Gold? Not able to decipher the positions from the photo finish? Don't worry. Read on.

Initially, it appeared that Thompson might have won, but after a thorough review of the photo finish images, Lyles was declared the winner with a time of 9.79 seconds, just five-thousandths of a second ahead of Thompson. This victory highlighted the rules governing photo finishes in athletics and the most critical aspect of it -- the torso crossing the finish line first.

WHAT IS A PHOTO FINISH?

1. Slit-Video System: The primary technology used to determine the winner in a photo finish is the slit-video system. This system scans an ultra-thin segment of the track precisely aligned with the finish line, capturing images 2,000 times per second. This provides an unbroken image of each athlete crossing the line, which is then coordinated with the athlete's time.

2. Backup Camera: In addition to the slit-video system, there is a backup camera positioned on the other side of the field. This camera ensures that the finish is captured even if a runner is obscured by another athlete.

3. Flash Timer: The flash timer, which clocks the final times of athletes, has a margin of error. At worst, this error can be within 0.01 or 0.02 of the official time. This margin is crucial in extremely close finishes like the one between Lyles and Thompson.

4. Torso Crossing: The most critical aspect of a photo finish is the body part that must cross the finish line. According to Olympic rules, it is the torso (or trunk) of the athlete that must cross the line, not the head, arms, legs, or feet. This is why some runners lean forward when crossing the line, ensuring their torso crosses first.

5. Diving Across the Finish Line: While it is legal for runners to dive across the finish line, it is not significantly faster than running the last few steps. Studies have shown that acceleration decreases while a runner is in the air, making diving less effective than it might seem.

6. Review Process: In the event of a close finish, officials review the images captured by the slit-video system and backup camera to determine the winner. This review process ensures that the athlete who crosses the finish line first, as defined by the torso crossing, is declared the winner.

Noah Lyles, who has proved his mettle at the biggest stage, will now be favourites to win the sprint double in Paris.

Noah Lyles put on the performance of a lifetime to win the men’s 100m gold by five-thousandths of a second in 9.79 seconds, in a blistering final where a 9.91 from Jamaican Oblique Seville was only good enough to finish last.

“I wouldn’t say nervous – I’d say I was extremely curious as to what was going to happen. That’s how me and my therapist phrase it. I’m curious as to what I’m going to do, how am I going to pull this off,” he told reporters.

“I came in third-fastest from the semis. I’m like ‘This is going to be serious, this is not going to be easy’. And I had said OK, my therapist said ‘You need to let go, you need to relax and you need to be yourself’.”

Lyles is already familiar with all the highs and lows of his sport long before he arrived in Paris, and has publicly discussed the work he put into his mental health to rebound from the pit of depression he found himself in three years ago.

How Lyles edged Kishane Thompson and the rest?

Jamaica’s Kishane Thompson let out a scream after crossing the finish line. For a brief moment, he thought maybe he was the Olympic champion.

By the slimmest of margins, Thompson was beaten out for gold on a perfectly timed lean from Lyles. Their times of 9.79 seconds needed to be calculated farther out to determine the winner — with Lyles winning 9.784 to 9.789. Thompson was five-thousandths of a second away from joining the company of fellow Jamaican Usain Bolt as an Olympic champion.

How it panned out:

Lyles was slowest out of the blocks among the competitors. He took 0.178 seconds to get up and going.

Thompson, who made a slow start as well, surged ahead in the race but by the slimmest of margins.

At the 40m mark, Lyles trailed the eight athlete pack but no one was really pulling away to lead.

At about three seconds into the race, Lyles starts to pick up pace and get closer to the quickest runners.

At the 50m mark, Lyles wasn’t at the back of the pile but not in command of the race either as Thompson maintained his lead.

At the 60m mark, the entire group seemed to be in sync with runners averaging 40.23kmph (25mph).

Fred Kerley, who would win bronze, appeared to be stride to stride with Thompson after the 75m mark.

With 90m gone, Lyles was still not the leading runner. If the race was 99m and not 100m, he would have finished second.

At the 100m mark, both Lyles and Thompson were clocked at 9.78 seconds. Further inspection put their difference at five-thousandths of a second.

The top-ranked runner needed to produce his fastest time ever to win an Olympic gold and even then the gap was just 0.005 seconds!

What is a photo finish?

The race was so close that when it was over, seven of the eight runners had “Photo” written next to their names, needing closer inspection.

At the final moment in the race, it appeared that Thompson’s leg was ahead of Lyles. Then how did the American win? The reason lies in the specifics of the photo finish rule.

World Athletics’ rulebook says, “As the runners approach the finish line, a “slit-video” system scans an ultra-thin segment of the track precisely aligned with the finish line – scans it 2,000 times per second, providing an unbroken image of each athlete crossing the line – and coordinates it with the athlete’s time. In a few seconds, the scoreboard will show the order of finish and each runner’s time to 1/100th of a second.

For those confused as to why Noah Lyles was awarded Gold instead of Thompson, even though Thompson’s foot crossed 1st:



The clock stops when your torso crosses the line *not* 1st body part. Noah leans w/ his chest, while Thompson subtly concaves his chest. That was the difference pic.twitter.com/13WqNsjrvm — Emmanuel Acho (@EmmanuelAcho) August 4, 2024

“If two athletes finish in a virtual dead heat, the finish image can be greatly enlarged and the finishing time read to 1/1000th of a second so the judges can separate them.”

“In case an athlete’s image is masked or obscured for any reason, there’s a back-up camera on the infield so the athlete can be seen from the other side if necessary.”

At the finish line, Thompson’s foot appears to cross the line first. But the rules stipulate that the body part that has to cross the finish line for an official registration of timing is the torso. “The torso or the trunk of a person includes the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and the back,” explain the rules."

Lyles managed to beat Jamaica’s Kishane Thompson by 0.005 seconds in what was a dramatic photo finish at the Paris Games. Both sprinters were eventually given a rounded-up timing of 9.79 seconds each but what separated the two was .005 seconds difference in their overall timing.

Lyles finished with .784 to Thompson’s .789 which saw him finish on the top spot on the podium. Thompson led in the majority of the race but it was Lyles’ stunning acceleration towards the end which saw him emerge on top, leaving the fans and his fellow competitors in disbelief.

What is a photo finish?

A photo finish is a term often used to describe an incredibly close race where multiple competitors are finishing a particular race at the same time. In such a case, a photo of the athletes crossing the finishing line is examined and observed to determine the winner. Photo finish is used as the naked eye can’t catch the action where the difference could be a few milliseconds or even less.

How is a photo finish decided at the Olympics?

At the Olympics and all other major events organised by World Athletics, a slit-video system is used when the runners approach the finish line during an event. The slit-video system has the ability to scan an ultra-thin segment of the track with the finish line. It can scan up to 2000 times per second which helps in determining the timing of each athlete crossing the line.

There are multiple cameras installed to get different angles in case an athlete’s view is blocked by another. But it is not only the foot crossing the finishing line that determines the winner. An athlete’s torso has to cross the line for the final timing to be registered. The torso or trunk of a person includes the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and back.

For those confused as to why Noah Lyles was awarded Gold instead of Thompson, even though Thompson’s foot crossed 1st: The clock stops when your torso crosses the line *not* 1st body part. Noah leans w/ his chest, while Thompson subtly concaves his chest. That was the difference pic.twitter.com/13WqNsjrvm — Emmanuel Acho (@EmmanuelAcho) August 4, 2024



During the 100m final at the Paris Olympics, it was Thompson who led for the majority of the race and his foot appeared to have hit the finishing line first. However, it was Lyles who took the gold medal as his torso surpassed the finishing line ahead of the Jamaican, handing him a victory by the barest of margins.

He may also be able to claim the title of the most famous—and certainly the fastest—anime fan.

After a spectacularly close photo-finish saw Lyles take gold, the 27-year-old Team USA runner—known to be a showman—made sure to dedicate a bit of his celebrations to his love for the genre of Japanese animation popularly associated in the U.S. with nerds, pressing his wrists together to strike the signature pose of Goku from Dragon Ball Z.

In the anime, the pose, known as the Kamehameha, is an energy attack commonly used as the ultimate move to finish off opponents. On the track, it’s a fixture—along with various other references to his favorite animes—in Lyles’ repertoire of pre- and post-race routines.

“If you ever wondered why I put my hands together stretched out in front of me it’s because Goku did,” he wrote on Instagram in March, in a post paying tribute to the late manga artist and Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama. “This is the great effect that the creation of Akira Toriyama has had on my life.”

On top of his athletic achievements, Lyles’ obsession with anime has become part of his persona that has captivated audiences across the globe.

During the U.S. Olympic trials in June, at which Lyles won the 100-m and 200-m sprints, he was seen whipping out Yu Gi Oh! cards from under his bib before his races, flaunting his collectibles for the camera—as part of a bet with shot putter Chase Ealey, a fellow anime fan who wore Naruto-inspired leg weights.

And in 2019, Lyles dyed his hair silver ahead of his first appearance at the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships. “In Dragon Ball Z, Goku’s final stage, or form, is Ultra Instinct. His hair turns silver/gray,” he told the Washington Post of the stylistic choice. “I’m ready to go. I’m ready to make the team. I’m in my highest state.”

But Lyles is far from the only Olympian who has been spotted geeking out at the Games. During his introduction at the Tokyo Olympics, Greek long jumper Miltiádis Tentóglou squatted down and touched his fist to the ground in a tribute to Monkey D. Luffy, the protagonist of the anime One Piece. Italian race walker Massimo Stano and U.S. shot putter Payton Otterdahl similarly recreated One Piece poses in Tokyo.

Lyles, for his part, was always confident he would deliver a serious performance in Paris—as much as he was sure he’d also bring levity and laughter to the Games.

“If you need somebody to entertain you for this Olympics … I got you,” he told TIME in May. “And I can promise you, if you’re watching me, you will not be bored.”

American Noah Lyles won the 2024 Paris Olympic Games 100-metre final in what was one of the if not the greatest 100-metre global championships in history.

So close, a photo finish and a difference within the 1000s of a second were analyzed post-race to decide between Kishane Thompson of Jamaica and Lyles. Lyles and Thompson both finished in 9.79 seconds. The difference was .784 and .789.

I Told You America I Got This! #OlympicChampion pic.twitter.com/boBOZv3650 — Noah Lyles, OLY (@LylesNoah) August 4, 2024

Taking third was American Fred Kerley who was a surprise finalist. He clocked 9.81 seconds for a season-best performance.

Jamaica’s Oblique Seville who beat Lyles twice in the rounds, finished dead last in 9.91 seconds. Defending Olympic champion Lamont Marcell Jacobs finished fifth in the time of 9.85. He was seen leaving the venue with a wrap around his upper leg. Likely he has not healed from the injury that was referenced in the Netflix series Sprint.

Akani Simbine of South Africa set a new national record at 9.82, as did Letsile Tebogo of Botswana in 9.86. All eight finishers clocked sub-10 seconds.

There was a prolonged delay to start the race, while the athletes were waiting in the blocks. Off the line Jacobs had the best start, otherwise, it was a blanket first few steps and until after 70 metres there was almost no gap between all eight competitors.

Lyles promised a win, but even he wasn’t sure until the decision was made. Lyles has a goal of four gold medals in Paris. He has three to go.

He had an emotional lap celebrating around the 400, track including a stop to hug his mother among other people.

On social media, I continue to be inundated with questions about what factors were considered in separating the two - American Noah Lyles, who was declared winner, and Jamaican Kinshane Thompson, who got the silver - despite both athletes finishing with the same time of 9.79s.

Officially, Lyles won by 5000th of a second, or numerically, by 0.005s. The final times were determined to be 9.784s for Lyles and 9.789s for Thompson.

Officially, it was the slimmest margin a champion has ever been determined in Olympics history, and the first time all eight (8) finalists ran sub-10 times in 100m.

The still pictures at the finish line show the Jamaican's foot firmly planted on the finish line first and his head appears to be ahead of Lyle's as well, leading many to suggest that means he won, and thus was robbed.

The same image shows Lyle's torso, or upper body, slightly ahead, confirming he won the race.

In the end, it took the photo finish, a few vital seconds - as athletes, spectators and journalists held their breath - to confirm the 27-year-old American as the winner.

But there are people who are hearing the idea of a torso being important in determining athletics results, so let's explain.

To understand what happened on Sunday night, we first need to understand how World Athletics - the governing body for athletics explains what a photo finish is.

At the finish line of every athletic track, there are a number of equipment installed to determine who crossed the line first.

First is the “slit-video” system, which scans an ultra-thin segment of the track precisely aligned with the finish line at an incredible 2,000 times per second. This provides an unbroken image of each athlete crossing the line — and coordinates it with the athlete’s time.

In addition to that, there’s another camera on the other side of the field in case a runner is hidden or blocked by another runner.

Then there's the flash timer, which clocks the final times of athletes.

Now, according to experts, that system has a margin of error that can throw times off by 0.01 or 0.02 of the official time. But this is not an issue because, that margin is compensated for by the other two systems in place.

Now the most important part of determining the official timing, which in turn decides the race, is the body part that has to cross the finish line.

In the 100m final at the Paris Olympics, Thompson’s foot looks like it breached first. The athlete’s torso is the body part that has to cross the finish line for official timing registration. The torso, or trunk, of a person includes the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and back.

In the event of a close race like Sunday's the review process is conducted where evidence from all three systems are consolidated to ensure the athlete whose torso crossed first, however marginal, is rightfully declared the winner. In this case, it was Noah Lyles.

Lyles started joint-slowest out of the 8 men in the final, along with Botswana's Letsile Tebogo, and was in 8th place for the first half of the race, but his phenomenal top end speed meant he was able to catch up with the rest of the pack and nick the win in the process.

The Jamaican started out in fourth place and led the race right until the last 10m before Lyles took over and nosed ahead for gold.

This was already the most competitive final at the Olympic level, with it being the first time that an athlete with a sub-10 mark failed to make the last run. All eight finalists clocked sub-10 timings in the final, and fine margins separated one from the other.

Noah Lyles matched his big talk by sprinting to 100m Olympic glory in Paris on August 4.

The American has repeatedly indicated his desire to win at least three gold medals at the summer games as he seeks to follow in the footsteps of Usain Bolt.

The 100m is considered his weaker event compared to the 200m, but the 27-year-old silenced his naysayers after he crossed the line in 9.79 seconds to become the new Olympic champion.

Noah Lyles beats Kishane Thompson at Paris 2024

So close was the race that Lyles beat pre-race favourite Kishane Thompson by five-thousandths of a second. Thompson had run impressive times in the heats and semi-finals, leaving many fans convinced he was the favourite.

The naked eye shows the Jamaican sprinter reached the line first, but after what looked like an extremely long wait, Lyles was awarded the win, sparking emotional celebrations.

So, how did Lyles win? Tuko.co.ke explains.

Men's 100m final splits

First of all, and for context, it is important to note that, save for the finishing line, Lyles did not lead the race at any point. In fact, at the 30-metre mark, he was the last one of the eight athletes. He rose to third at the 70-metre mark behind Thompson and eventual bronze medalist Fred Kerley.

With 10 metres to go, the world champion from Budapest was second to Thompson in another remarkable exhibition of his top-end speed. They crossed the line at the same time and were made to wait to see who had won.

Enter technology.

How Noah Lyles beat Kishane Thompson at Paris Olympics

In such tight cases, World Athletics employs the Total Athletics Operating System thanks to its partnership with Seiko, a watch company.

The technology measures athletes' times to the +/—1/10,000th of a second by examining things like starting, timing, photo finish, wind measurement, and electronic distance measurement.

Photo-finish rule explained

The photo-finish rule was used in the men's 100m final where ""a ""sl1t-video"" system scans an ultra-thin segment of the track precisely aligned with the finish line -- scans it 2,000 times per second, providing an unbroken image of each athlete crossing the line,"" as captured on World Athletics website.

Now, and this is perhaps the most important part, Thompson appeared to cross the line first, but Lyles led with his torso, which is the body part used to determine the winner.

""The winner of the race is the athlete whose torso crosses the finish line first. Any other body parts that may cross before the torso, such as head, hands and feet, will not count.""

As the debate rages on, Lyles will revel in his new status as an Olympic gold medalist. he might still leave Paris with the three he desires, but getting one in his 'weak' 100m was the hardest.

Julien Alfred wins 100m gold

TUKO.co.ke also reported that Julien Alfred defeated Sha'Carri Richardson to win the gold medal in the women's 100m.

The Saint Lucia sprinter was the outside contender for the gold medal but surprised everyone by winning with a time of 10.72 seconds.

Lyles winning the race wasn’t surprising. The 27-year-old is, after all, the defending world champion of the race following his victory at the 2023 World Athletics Championships in Budapest last year.

Although the extreme closeness of the race was indeed surprising, with Lyles pulling out the win by just 0.005 seconds in a literal photo finish over silver medalist Kishane Thompson of Jamaica, it wasn’t the most surprising aspect of the race.

To me, that honor goes to what Lyles had on his wrist when he crossed the finish line.

PARIS (AP) — Snoop Dogg steps out of a sleek black SUV, his entourage in tow, as a Parisian crowd erupts into chants of “Snoop, Snoop, Snoop!” outside the NBC set.

Decked out in a custom-made, Noah Lyles-themed USA sweatsuit, the ultra-smooth entertainer glides past the adoring fans with flashing phone cameras into the Musee de l’Homme. Inside, his longtime friend Martha Stewart greets him with a hug. They chat, clink champagne glasses and then he “crip walks” onto the set to film a Sunday night segment.

OK, the show can start — Snoop has arrived. Literally.

At the Paris Games, grand entrances have become the norm in Snoop’s spectacular Olympic life.

“When the lights are on, that’s when I shine the best,” he told The Associated Press after returning from watching Lyles’ historic victory in the 100-meter sprint and filming a primetime segment with Mike Tirico and Stewart, a surprise guest.

“This opportunity was nothing but a chance for me to show the world what it’s supposed to look like when you put the right person in the right environment,” Snoop said.

Snoop, 52, has become the star of the Paris Games, ascending to new heights with several memorable moments. He’s carried the Olympic torch, captivated audiences as NBC’s prime-time correspondent, swam with Michael Phelps, attended a U.S. women’s soccer game with Megan Rapinoe, danced with Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles, and cheered on Caeleb Dressel alongside the swimmer’s wife and son.

The rap icon is currently in his comfort zone. And sleep? Even that’s having a hard time catching up with the on-the-go multihyphenate entertainer.

“It’s more about relaxing rather than sleeping because I’m having so much fun,” he said. “This ain’t the town to sleep in. This ain’t the time to sleep. This is time to be on it like you want it. It’s different events happening day and night. I want to be active with everything, because I love the American athletes and competition. This is what I’m here for.”

Stewart said she’s extremely proud of how Snoop is successfully taking on the challenge. She was impressed by his ability to genuinely connect with Olympians and their family members.

“I think he’s done an amazing job for the Olympics,” said Stewart, who attended a equestrian team dressage event with Snoop on her 83rd birthday Saturday. For the horseback riding competition, the duo wore matching helmets, black jackets and white pants.

“This is the celebration of the finest athleticism ever in the world and he has made it so accessible to everybody,” she continued. “That’s his talent. Everybody loves him.”

Snoop also has the Games’ most in-demand souvenir: A Snoop Dogg pin, which shows him wearing a blue top while exhaling rings colored the same as the Olympics logo. He’s gifted one to tennis star Coco Gauff, but passed on offering more details for now on how to obtain more saying, “I’m going to be honest with you. I have zero answers for that.”

Meanwhile, Snoop has mastered the art of being himself in front of the television camera — even for a global audience. He initially went into his correspondent assignment, thinking NBC wanted more “buttoned-up” commentary from him until network executives encouraged him to be his authentic self — especially after seeing his in-person potential during the U.S. Olympic trials.

At the trials, Snoop had done casual on-video interviews with a few Olympians about their sports, including women’s basketball player A’ja Wilson, gymnast Sunisa Lee, skateboarder Jagger Eaton and beach volleyball players Sara Hughes and Kelly Cheng. He met with Lyles and participated in a 200-meter race — clocking in at 34.44 seconds — with NBC analyst and former Trinidadian track star Ato Boldon and former U.S. national champion Wallace Spearmon.

“This is what I do. I do it every day,” said the rapper, who had already become a fan favorite during the Tokyo Games, when he and Kevin Hart did in-studio commentary for Peacock in which he called a “layup drill.”

“That’s why it’s not hard for me,” he said. “It’s not like an act. The bits that we do. They’re comfortable. They’re not stretched or forced. It’s me being me.”

Snoop’s presence in Paris is part of NBC’s bet to boost ratings by infusing coverage with pop culture. So far, the U.S. broadcaster’s strategy has worked, combined with the star power from U.S. Olympians such as Biles, Katie Ledecky and Sha’Carri Richardson. Through a five-day span beginning with the opening ceremony on July 26, the company averaged 34 million people a day watching on NBC, cable networks and Peacock, up from 19 million over the same period in Tokyo.

On Saturday, the network drew nearly 35 million, doubling Tokyo’s second Saturday numbers.

Tirico credits Snoop with being a major piece to NBC’s coverage. He said the rapper’s hard work matches his creative talents.

“That license to color outside the lines is what makes the greats, great. He knows how to do that and keep the picture looking good,” said the sportscaster, who has worked with Snoop during ideas sessions. “I’m not surprised because I’ve seen the process in some of the pre-meetings. He’s added more than I ever imagined he would.”

Snoop has come a long since he broke through 30 years ago as part of the West Coast gangsta rap scene with Dr. Dre in a career marred with several brushes with the law. He branched out as an actor in films like “Training Day” and “Starsky & Hutch,” and as a reality star with Stewart’s “Martha & Snoop’s Potluck Dinner Party.”

“But remember, I’m a rapper. So ain’t no rapper ever did what I’m doing,” said Snoop, who first showed his on-camera commentary capabilities for his viral take on the Jake Paul-Nate Robinson boxing match in 2020.

“It’s limitations to the field that I come from,” he said. “Rappers aren’t supposed to do this. I tend to do the unthinkable.”"

Lyles is now the first American man to clinch the 100-m gold since Brooklyn-born Justin Gatlin claimed the title in 2004. However, the undoubted world-class “jock,” as typical high school movies would call him, is also an “adorkable” nerd. He's repeatedly claimed his status, proving his worth as a certified – and certainly the most famous – anime fan.

His 100-m dash victory has also earned him the title of the fastest anime fan, which even Japanese media approved of.

After his spectacularly breath-taking narrow win that put Lyles just 0.005 seconds ahead of Jamaica's Kishane Thompson, the American sports star took his celebratory to the next level, pulling a classic Dragon Ball fan move, with the US flag wrapped around him. Mimicking the signature “Kamehameha” attack from the cult-classic manga and anime franchise Dragon Ball, the 27-year-old made his love for Japanese pop culture public.

American sprinter Noah Lyles doesn't compromise on his love for anime to deliver a serious pro performance

This wasn't the first time he struck the pose for the ultimate energy attack. Lyles previously professed his love for the one-of-a-kind shonen franchise on social media as well. In a March Instagram post, he paid a heartfelt tribute to the late mangaka and Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama, who died on March 1 of a blood clot in his brain. Lyles, who's apparently made it a common practice to strike out references to his favourite anime title during pre and post-race routines, shared a similar game-winning shot of himself, editing an energy blast into the picture, which also lends a glimpse at his silver-dyed hair.

If you ever wonder why I scream out before a big race it’s because Goku did.

In addition to his post-game celebrations, Lyles flaunted his Yu Gi Oh! cards before his races during the US Olympic trials in June. His new tradition resulted from a running bet with world champion shotputter Chase Ealey, who shared his love for anime with Lyles. In exchange for Lyles whipping out his Yu Gi Oh! cards to the camera before races, Ealey promised to wear his Rock Lee leg weights, inspired by Naruto, during her finals.

Despite their cheeky nerding-out sessions, both Lyles and Ealey's performances of Olympic standards stand as a testament to the notion that being a professional doesn't necessarily always have to be all about donning a monochromatic, uptight vision. Sometimes, work and play go hand in hand, and Lyles declared he would deliver a serious performance at the Paris Games without compromising on his fun side.

“If you need somebody to entertain you for this Olympics … I got you. And I can promise you, if you’re watching me, you will not be bored,"" he told Time in May.

Japanese media has clearly been keeping track of the American Olympic wonder, as the sports newspaper Daily Sports (and other outlets) proudly hailed Lyles as “Mankind’s fastest otaku” in an article headline.

His performance comes while we wait for Dragon Ball Daima, the next chapter in the storied franchise. Goku and the Z Fighters are turned into children by a mysterious enemy, causing chaos while they try to figure out what’s going on.

This particular installment is bittersweet, because it’s the last to involve creator Akira Toriyama, who died suddenly earlier this year. If only he could see Lyles and understand the profound influence of his works.

"Armand ""Mondo"" Duplantis breaks pole vault world record in gold.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mondo-duplantis-pole-vaulting-record-olympic-gold-paris-2024/,"Recapping the weekend at the Olympics as Paris Games enter final week

American-born pole vaulter Armand ""Mondo"" Duplantis broke a world record for a ninth time at the Paris Olympics on Monday and brought home a gold medal for Sweden.

The Louisiana-born 24-year-old athlete cleared 6.25 meters Monday, beating the mark of 6.24 meters he set in the Xiamen Diamond League in China in April, launching higher than a giraffe on each record-breaking vault. Silver went to Sam Kendricks of the U.S. with a vault of 5.95 meters and Greece's Emmanouil Karalis took bronze with a vault of 5.90 meters.

Duplantis has been breaking world records since February 2020. In addition to Olympic gold in Paris and in Tokyo, he's won four World Championships — two indoors and two outdoors. The Olympics compared Duplantis' dominance in the world of pole vaulting to swimmer Katie Ledecky's skills in the 1,500 meter freestyle and Simone Biles' skills in gymnastics.

Both of Duplantis' parents are athletes and his father pole vaulted in the U.S. According to the Olympics, the elder Duplantis' pole vault personal best was 5.80 meters in 1993.

Though Duplantis was born in the U.S. and went to college in Louisiana, he competes for Sweden, his mother's native country. He spent his summers in Sweden as a child, according to the Olympics.

Duplantis attended Louisiana State University, the same school as runner Sha'Carri Richardson, according to the Olympics. The pole vaulter moved to Sweden after college. He was named Swedish Newcomer fo the Year in 2018 and Swedish Male Athlete of the Year in 2019, 2021 and 2022.

He isn't the only athlete competing for a country other than the one they were born in. Kaylia Nemour, a gymnast who took home gold for Algeria in the women's uneven bars final, was born in France. Her father is Algerian."
"Armand ""Mondo"" Duplantis breaks pole vault world record in gold.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/aug/05/2024-paris-olympic-games-armand-duplantis-pole-vault-world-record,"Finally, Mondo Duplantis has the spotlight. The formalities on the track have been dispensed with, Keely Hodgkinson has won her gold medal, Noah Lyles has been awarded his, and for the first time this evening all eyes are on a 24-year-old from Sweden via Louisiana, the bar suspended 6.25m high and the still, warm air between them.

Duplantis has already won his gold medal, his second in a row. Nobody really cares about that part very much. He had to jump four times to win the competition, and it turns out it didn’t really need to do the first two, or the fourth. It’s a little like the bit at the end of Eurovision where the winner gets to play again, except the winner is The Beatles, and the winning song was Octopus’s Garden, and now they’re going to play the whole of Sgt Pepper as an encore.

But when you have just won your 18th straight meet, hold nine of 10 highest vaults in history and eight world records in four years, you get graded on a slightly different curve. And so the night has sharpened to the duel everyone wanted to see: Duplantis v gravity, Duplantis v the laws of physics, Duplantis now v Duplantis four months ago, when he set his last world record of 6.24m. The bar is at 6.25m.

He starts with two failures. It feels ridiculous to nitpick at a double Olympic champion for not breaking the world record. But there is a rare opportunity here. An opportunity to give these Games a genuinely historic moment. Not to mention the pole vault, a sport whose popularity and reach has always been somewhat restricted by its own basic weirdness.

This is, after all, an event that few lay people can really grasp and even fewer have performed to competence. The bar to entry – pun intended – is dauntingly high. Duplantis was the son of a pole vaulter, started vaulting at the age of four in his back garden. Which – not to get all Malcolm Gladwell about this – certainly doesn’t hurt.

But the immense skill, the freakish physical conditioning, those 20 perfect strides performed at sprint speed, the strength and height of the grip, the way his hands respond to the “feel” of the pole as it slides into the back of the plate, the gymnast’s flexibility to propel himself not just over the bar but around it, all while wielding a prop from a Laurel and Hardy movie: this, perhaps, is the part people overlook.

Duplantis can be that crossover figure. Duplantis, with his floppy hair and haunting eyes and preppy fashion choices, like Withnail played by Timothée Chalamet in a Vampire Weekend video, can give the pole vault its crowning glory. Like the legendary Sergey Bubka before him, Duplantis is on a handsome cash bonus for every world record he breaks. Over the last 40 years, the pair of them have broken the world record 25 times, most of them by a centimetre at a time. But none of those ever came in an Olympics.

As they come out for the warm-up, the other vaulters have backpacks and Duplantis has a designer wheelie-suitcase. There are very few events where you can tell who’s going to win from the way they come out to warm up. But here a complete pole vault newcomer would instantly clock the lineup and go: yeah, it’s the guy with the designer wheelie-suitcase, isn’t it?

Then comes the long wait. And being Armand “Mondo” Duplantis involves quite a lot of waiting. He is the only competitor to skip the first height of 5.50m, sitting on the floor while the others have a go, drumming his knees in time to the stadium music. He clears 5.70m like he’s basically stepping over a cat. Passes 5.80m. Sails over 5.85m with such ease that had he wanted to knock the bar over with his hand, it’s not immediately clear he could have reached it.

Sam Kendricks of the United States and Emmanouil Karalis of Greece both clear 5.90m and tear off into the crowd with full-on football celebrations. Duplantis passes 5.90m – good banter, this – before vaulting 5.95m while smoking a cigarillo. And little of this passes with any fanfare. Really this is an event that takes place on the off-beats, something that tends to happen while bigger, louder things are happening nearby. An Olympic record of 6.10m is shattered in the scruffy swash of Hodgkinson’s noise.

Now, at long last, Duplantis has the spotlight. It’s his third and final attempt. The roar is humongous, and focused on him alone. He sets off. In a few seconds he will be earthbound and away, into the crowd, the star of the greatest show on earth.

But let’s leave him right here, sailing through clean clear air, higher than any human before him, a man flying beyond the earthly plane and into immortality."
"Armand ""Mondo"" Duplantis breaks pole vault world record in gold.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/08/05/mondo-duplantis-pole-vault-world-record-gold-olympics/,"SAINT-DENIS, France — The only man standing on the track was the one everybody had come to see. Victory had belonged to Armand “Mondo” Duplantis in every functional sense since he had remembered to lug his poles into Stade de France. He operates on a different plane than any other pole vaulter the sport has ever seen. He trains for the moments when the competition is over, when every eye is on him and his only rival is himself.

Duplantis had broken the world record eight times before Monday night. One last jump would determine whether Duplantis could reduce the barrier between man and flight again, by one more centimeter.

Duplantis failed on his first two tries to break his world record. Before his third, he spoke with his father and coach, Greg, and decided on a crucial adjustment. He sprinted down the runway, soared into the night and became one of the forever athletes of the Paris Olympics.

A Louisiana-born pole-vaulting genius who matriculated at LSU and competes under the flag of his mother’s native Sweden, Duplantis cleared 6.25 meters (20 feet 6 inches) on his final attempt. The Stade de France stadium lights flickered. The best crowd he had ever seen outside of Tiger Stadium produced a delirious wall of sound. He sprinted off the mat to the corner of the stadium, where he hugged his girlfriend and slapped high-fives with his brothers.

“If I don’t beat this moment in my career, I’m pretty okay with that,” Duplantis said. “I don’t think you can do much better than what just happened.”

Duplantis pushes limits as much as any athlete at these Games. For one night, he would be content with a new barrier. Duplantis mingled afterward on the track with Carl Gustaf Folke Hubertus, the king of Sweden. (“Fam vad cool,” Duplantis said in Swedish — very cool.) He planned to party with family, and his brothers would drag him to karaoke, voice hoarse from interviews and all.

“I’ll probably have some liquid courage and get up onstage,” Duplantis said.

He had proved himself the ultimate performer well before Monday. Duplantis first broke the world record in February 2020, nudging it up one centimeter to 6.17 meters. He has since made it his lucrative plaything. Duplantis had broken it seven more times since, always by a centimeter, which maximizes the number of times he can trigger sponsorship bonuses for world records.

Duplantis’s record at the start of the night stood at 6.24 meters (20 feet 5¾ inches). Only three other men in the field had surpassed a six-meter bar, and American Sam Kendricks had not done so in five years.

The competitive portion of the night was about the silver medal. Kendricks won it with a 5.95-meter clearance three years after an experience that embittered him. He tested positive for the coronavirus and could not compete at the Tokyo Olympics. Kendricks, the Rio de Janeiro bronze medalist, was mad that a follow-up test he believed cleared him was not used. He was incensed at how he was put in isolation and, in his mind, discarded.

“I don’t want to be bitter,” Kendricks said. “I want to love all the people that are involved in it. I know back in the day, there’s a lot of people that love me that were put between a rock and a hard place. They weren’t able to be next to me. And it hurts me that I have to be mad at somebody.”

Kendricks takes pride in his two victories over Duplantis, including at the 2019 world championships. He understood that eventually the prodigy finding his way would surpass him. “I’m a very small boogeyman in Mondo’s life,” Kendricks said.

The night at Stade de France slowly arced toward Duplantis. The mayhem of the women’s 5,000 meters passed. American Valarie Allman claimed her second consecutive discus gold medal. Duplantis’s vanquished competitors celebrated their silver and bronze. Only he remained.

First, he set the bar at 6.10 meters, shattering the 6.03-meter Olympic record. Then he asked for the bar to put at 6.25 meters, higher than it had ever been set before.

On his first attempt, he banged his right elbow on top of the bar. On his second, he achieved the requisite height but shortly after he began his fall to Earth, his chest hit the bar. He walked to the first row of the stands and spoke with his father.

Pole vaulters are allowed to move the standards — the uprights that hold the bar in place — closer or further from their takeoff point. Duplantis had taken his first two cracks at the record with the standards 70 centimeters away from the plant box.

Duplantis had jumped high enough on his second try, but he had not soared far enough. So Greg devised a solution. Duplantis would move the standards from 70 to 60 centimeters — 10 centimeters closer to his takeoff.

When Duplantis walked to the official, an instinct overcame him. At many events, the standards only move in increments of five. With Olympic-level equipment, officials could be as precise as they wanted. Duplantis asked not for the 60 that Greg prescribed but 62.

“It would be dope and a nice jab at my father if 62 was the perfect number,” Duplantis said.

Once the standards had been reset, Duplantis carried his pole to the back of the runway and leaned it on his shoulder. When Duplantis was a child, Greg, who was a pole vaulter at LSU, built a runway in his backyard out of an abandoned track he bought for pennies on the dollar. Each time his youngest son ran down it, he imagined a bar set beyond the world record at the Olympic final.

“I felt like I had already been in this moment 1,000 times,” Duplantis said.

Now, Duplantis raised his arms over his head and clapped once. The crowd responded with thunder. Another clap, then another. Faster: Clap. Clap. Clap clap. Clap clap clap clapclapclapclapclapclapclapclapclap.

Duplantis bolted. His extraordinary ability begins with his speed. Many pole vaulters take up the sport once they realize they will never possess the world-class speed of a sprinter. Duplantis might have it.

“He runs with God’s hand on his back,” Kendricks said.

The neon yellow pole glowed in his hands. At full speed, Duplantis jammed the top of his pole into the plant box.

“You feel the takeoff spot,” Duplantis said. “Right when I hit it at the takeoff, I kind of knew.”

Duplantis inverted, rose two stories off the ground, twisted his body and folded himself like a trapdoor. The bar remained still. He floated to the mat and landed with a roar. He hugged his family, and then he walked back to the coaches box and embraced Greg.

Duplantis had surpassed another limit. Every new mark invites the question of how far he can fly. He lives his life to expand the possible. For one night, Duplantis would embrace what he had done instead of what he could do next."
"Armand ""Mondo"" Duplantis breaks pole vault world record in gold.",https://www.walb.com/2024/08/05/mondo-duplantis-breaks-pole-vault-world-record-gold-medal-performance-olympics/,"SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) — The pole vaulter they call “Mondo” really can put on a show.

With the rest of the action at the Olympic track wrapped up for the evening and the crowd of 80,000 at the Stade de France still on their feet, Armand Duplantis rested the pole on his right shoulder and took a deep breath. Then, he lifted up that long piece of carbon fiber and took off down the runway and into the night sky.

Another Olympic gold medal already was his. When he came crashing down into the padding on the other side of that sky-high, pink-tinted bar, so was another world record.

Duplantis, the Louisiana-born 24-year-old who competes for his mother’s native Sweden, cleared 6.25 meters (20 feet, 6 inches) to break the world record for the ninth time — but the first time on his sport’s grandest stage.

His next move was a sprint to the stands to hug his girlfriend and celebrate his record and second Olympic gold with all those friends and family wearing yellow and blue. The country’s king and queen were on hand, as well, to witness Sweden’s latest history-making leap into the pole vault pit.

“It’s hard to understand, honestly,” he said. “If I don’t beat this moment in my career, then I’m pretty OK with that. I don’t think you can get much better than what just happened.”

It felt only right that the Duplantis drama came with Noah Lyles in the building.

A night after the American sprint star electrified track with a .005-second victory in the men’s 100 meters, Lyles was on hand to receive his gold medal and watch Duplantis electrify field to the tune of 6.25 meters — about the height of a typical two-story building.

The drama played out over a half hour at the end of the night, long after a slow-and-strange women’s 5,000 meters had wrapped up and after Keely Hodgkinson had captured the first track medal for Britain at this meet in the 800, the evening’s last race.

That usually signals a time for folks to start heading for the exits.

But Mondo’s encore was worth staying for, and most everyone did.

“Mondo is an extraordinary jumper because of four factors,” said American Sam Kendricks, who finished second. “One, he’s got a great coach for a long time. He’s had a lot of time to do it. He’s got great equipment and understanding of the event. He’s a fan of sport, and he’s got God’s hand on his back.”

By winning a second straight gold medal and breaking the record for the ninth time — each time by one centimeter — Duplantis is now next to, if not above, Sergei Bubka as the greatest ever in this event.

Duplantis is in the conversation with America’s Ryan Crouser, a world-record holder and three-time gold medalist in shot put, as among the most dominant athletes on the field side of this sport.

And when it comes to delivering great theatre, as he showed once again, Duplantis is in a class of his own.

After he sealed the victory over Kendricks, then captured the Olympic record by clearing 6.10 meters, Duplantis had the bar moved to one centimeter higher than the world-record height.

Following his first miss, he used a break while Lyles was receiving t he gold medal for his 100-meter victory, to study video on a tablet with his parents, who met decades ago while they were both on the LSU track and field team.

Another miss ensued, then another long break.

The fans clapped in rhythm and sang along to the French song “Alleur de Feu” — “Light the Fire” — getting ready for Mondo’s leap into history.

A home-grown talent, Duplantis learned this sport on a pole vault pit his parents dug in their back yard in Lafayette, Louisiana.

During long afternoons of jumping in that pit, Duplantis often envisioned himself going for a world record on his last jump at the Olympics.

Maybe not in the equation — the parties that world record and Olympic title would set off. An hour after the stadium cleared, the song “Dancing Queen” by the Swedish group ABBA was playing loud and proud outside the stadium.

“For it to actually happen the way that it did and for me to put the right jump together at the right time, it’s just, like, how do you explain it?” he said. “It’s bigger than words for me.”

Chebet of Kenya wins wild women’s 5,000 meters

Duplantis was the closing act on a night that included an upset by Kenya’s Beatrice Chebet in the women’s 5,000 meters. One of the world’s best distance runners, Chebet’s Kenyan teammate Faith Kipyegon, ended up with silver, but only after winning an appeal of her initial disqualification for trading elbows with world-record holder Gudaf Tsegay.

The appeal left Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands with the bronze medal. Hassan will also race in the 10,000 and marathon, trying to duplicate her three distance medals from the Tokyo Games.

Lyles returns to the track

Lyles returned to the track the day after his memorable win in the 100 meters to start the quest for his second gold, this one in the 200.

He won his opening heat in 20.19 seconds, then stuck around to receive his gold medal.

He said he did it all on only a little more than 4 hours of sleep.

“I had to stop watching the race,” he said of his decision to call it a night at 2:45 a.m. after his win. “Throughout the day, it’s kind of just been meandering trying to get the body started, jump starting it.”

The Swedish pole vaulter flew over the bar at a new world record height of 6.25m, having already secured Paris 2024 gold earlier in the evening on Monday, 5 August with a vault of 6.00m.

This is the ninth time Duplantis has broken the world record, beating the mark of 6.24m he set in the Xiamen Diamond League in April this year.

“I haven’t processed how fantastic that moment was,"" he said after his historic jump. ""It’s one of those things that don’t really feel real, such an out-of-body experience. It’s still hard to kind of land right now.

""What can I say? I just broke a world record at the Olympics, the biggest possible stage for a pole vaulter. [My] biggest dream since a kid was to break the world record at the Olympics, and I’ve been able to do that in front of the most ridiculous crowd I’ve ever competed in front of.”

The crowd he spoke of in the Stade de France has become used to breathtaking moments at these Olympics, but few can compare to this mammoth effort from Duplantis.

As chants of “Mondo, Mondo, Mondo” rang around the stadium, Duplantis did what he does best, first breaking the Olympic record with a jump of 6.10m and then raising the bar higher to 6.25m.

As he flew over the bar, he was met with roars from across the masses of people inside the Stade de France who had witnessed the greatest jump — and jumper — in history.

“I tried to clear my thoughts as much as I could,"" he said of the momentous reception he received from the stands. ""The crowd was going crazy. It was so loud in there, it sounded like an American football game. I have a little bit of experience being in a 100,000-capacity stadium, but I was never the centre of attention. [I was] just trying to channel the energy everybody was giving me, and they were giving me a lot of it. It worked out.”

With the screams of joy from the crowd only matched by Duplantis' own, the 24-year-old jumped from the mat and straight into the arms of his loved ones.

On a night filled with unforgettable moments, this is one that will be talked about for years to come.

His gold medal in Paris continues his incredible streak at major international outdoor championships, which has seen him win gold at the past three worlds and — after Monday — the last two Olympic Games.

Sam Kendricks of the USA won silver with a jump of 5.95m and Greece’s Emmanouil Karalis took bronze (5.90m)."
"Armand ""Mondo"" Duplantis breaks pole vault world record in gold.",https://uk.news.yahoo.com/armand-duplantis-breaks-pole-vault-202237547.html,"With Armand Duplantis, the question is never whether he’ll win but how high he’ll fly. The 24-year-old Swede had broken the pole vault world record eight times, pushing the limits of possibility centimetre by centimetre. And here on a sultry night at the Stade de France, at 10.15pm, with the track races long finished and nobody moving an inch from their seat, he did it again.

The event really began when Duplantis cleared 6.00m. Greece’s Emmanouil Karalis and USA’s Sam Kendricks tried and failed to match him, earning bronze and silver respectively. Which just left the Mondo show.

After some brief hugs with his parents to celebrate gold, Duplantis strode across the track and set to work, first breaking the Olympic record of 6.03m set by Thiago Braz in 2016, though you suspect Braz had mentally released that one a while ago. Kendricks geed up the crowd as Duplantis glided over with room to spare.

The bar moved up to the world-record height of 6.25m. After two failed attempts, he lay down and stretched out his back, giving his body every possible chance of bending over the bar in his final try.

Duplantis stood at the top of the runway with his pole resting on his shoulder. He took a couple of sharp breaths and muttered “come on” to himself, as volleys of “Allez Mondo!” shook the stadium. Then he ran, muscles straining, hair trailing in the wind like Tarzan. He slid his pole into the box and launched into the air in one smooth motion, contorting his body into a perfect right-angle before whipping his arm away from contact. The bar never twitched.

He was celebrating before gravity had thrown him onto the mat. Then he was up, letting off a primal roar before rushing into the arms of his girlfriend, the Swedish model and TikTokker Desire Inglander. Abba’s Dancing Queen blared from the speakers as he embarked on a victory lap.

“I don’t know how to put into words what I’m feeling,” Duplantis said after the bedlam subsided. “I feel so grateful for how tonight played out. I didn’t let myself believe that I was Olympic champion until it was all done. I think it’s been such a fight to show up and to be at our best and do it when it matters.

“I feel so grateful for having this come together, a little bit of luck on our side, and being able to walk away on top. It’s just so special.”

Pole vault is ostensibly a silly endeavour, the only track and field event whose most Googled queries are to ask who invented it and why. But it is also compelling sport and dazzling art in equal measure. Essentially what happened here is that 80,000 people lost their minds as they watched a Swedish man clear the height of a large giraffe with nothing but a stick in his hands.

Duplantis has always had the ingredients, as the son of an American pole-vaulter and a Swedish heptathlete. But ever since he first cleared Renaud Lavillenie’s record of 6.15m in 2020, he has found ways of reaching new, unfathomable heights.

You can take your pick from his list of records and achievements. At 24, he is already a double Olympic champion, and a double world champion too. The top 10 clearances in history are all his. My personal favourite is that he hasn’t won silver or bronze medal since 2019. This was the apex of five years of unfettered dominance.

That made the expectation enormous, not just to win but to put on a show. In Paris, Duplantis made theatre.

“Pressure is becoming my friend. I think it’s one of those things I’ve learnt can bring out the best in you if you embrace it. I felt like I was really in the zone and just doing great, and I felt that so much in my prelim. And then tonight, I think on my first throw, I felt the weight of, ‘Holy crap, this is the Olympics’.

“It took me a minute to find my groove, but once my coach got me in a better headspace, and we just took it throw by throw, it felt like things were just clicking and that stadium filled with 80,000 people were just bringing out the best in all the athletes. I’m so grateful to embrace that and be part of such a historic night.”"

NPR is in Paris for the 2024 Summer Olympics. For more of our coverage from the games head to our latest updates.

PARIS — Even though Armand Duplantis, aka Mondo, had already set eight world records, fans had even higher hopes — that the 24-year-old would do it again, and do it on the Olympic stage.

It seemed like a greedy ask — a superhuman performance — that is, until he did it.

While the Swedish-American pole vaulter kept his cool, chatting with opponents who'd already finished their competition in between attempts, he kept his fans on the edge of their seats until the last possible moment.

On his third and last run, Duplantis cleared bar on his way to knocking down his own world record by .01 meters.

The world record holder now has a new mark: 6.25 meters.

Duplantis, who won gold in his Olympic debut at the Tokyo Games, flew well over the previous Olympic record of 6.03 set by Brazilian Thiago Braz at the Rio de Janeiro Games in 2016. USA's Sam Kendricks finished with silver. Emmanouil Karalis of Greece won bronze.

Duplantis says his calm demeanor comes from his preparation. He was first handed a pole at age 3 by his parents, who are also his coaches.

“I really wasn’t all that nervous,” he said after his historic jump. “I’ve just always had so much confidence in my abilities.""

To hype himself up before each attempt, Duplantis clasped his hands together over his head, cueing to fans to start their steady clap as he bolted down the runway. A sizable sea of yellow and blue showed massive support for the pole vaulter on a busy Monday night at Stade de France stadium.

""What can I say?” he said. “I just broke a world record at the Olympics, biggest possible stage for a pole vaulter. The biggest dream since a kid was to break the world record at the Olympics, and I’ve been able to do that in front of the most ridiculous crowd I’ve ever competed in front of.”

On his last, world-record jump, he said he worked to clear his mind and channel the energy from the crowd.

“It was so loud in there, it sounded like an American football game,” he said. “I have a little bit of experience being in a 100,000 capacity stadium, but I was never the center of attention. It worked out."""

"Armand ""Mondo"" Duplantis breaks pole vault world record in gold.",https://www.news-herald.com/2024/08/05/armand-mondo-duplantis-breaks-pole-vault-world-record-katie-moon-advances-to-final/,"By EDDIE PELLS

SAINT-DENIS, France — The pole vaulter they call “Mondo” really can put on a show.

With the rest of the action at the Olympic track wrapped up for the evening and the crowd of 80,000 at the Stade de France still on their feet, Armand Duplantis rested the pole on his right shoulder and took a deep breath. Then, he lifted up that long piece of carbon fiber and took off down the runway and into the night sky.

Another Olympic gold medal already was his. When he came crashing down into the padding on the other side of that sky-high, pink-tinted bar, so was another world record.

Duplantis, the Louisiana-born 24-year-old who competes for his mother’s native Sweden, cleared 6.25 meters (20 feet, 6 inches) to break the world record for the ninth time — but the first time on his sport’s grandest stage.

His next move was a sprint to the stands to hug his girlfriend and celebrate his record and second Olympic gold with all those friends and family wearing yellow and blue. The country’s king and queen were on hand, as well, to witness Sweden’s latest history-making leap into the pole vault pit.

Also in pole vault, Olmsted Falls graduate Katie Moon advanced to the finals in the women’s competition. Moon, the reigning Olympic gold medalist, was one of 11 competitors who cleared 4.55 meters.

The finals are set for 1 p.m., EDT, Aug. 7.

It felt only right that the Duplantis drama came with Noah Lyles in the building.

A night after Lyles electrified track with a .005-second victory in the men’s 100 meters, he was on hand to receive his gold medal and watch Duplantis electrify the field to the tune of 6.25 meters.

The drama played out over a half hour at the end of the night, long after a slow-and-strange women’s 5,000 meters had wrapped up and after Keely Hodgkinson had captured the first track medal for Britain at this meet in the 800, the evening’s last race.

That usually signals a time for folks to start heading for the exits.

But Mondo’s encore was worth staying for, and most everyone did.

Early in meets, it’s not uncommon to find Duplantis laying down in the waiting area, biding his time. He often skips lower heights that he knows he can clear, saving up energy for moments like these.

He is a master of pacing and timing, and when the stage becomes his own, he delivers drama like this.

After Duplantis sealed the victory over America’s Sam Kendricks by clearing 6.10, he had the bar moved to one centimeter higher than the world-record height. Following his first miss, he used a break while Lyles was receiving t he gold medal for his 100-meter victory, to study video on a tablet with his parents, who met while they were both on the LSU track and field team.

Another miss ensued, then another long break.

All of the racing had ended, but the crowd stayed put.

This time, tension ratcheted up a notch. The fans clapped in rhythm and sang along to the French song “Alleur de Feu” — “Light the Fire” — getting ready for Mondo’s last try.

Duplantis got ready first by teetering on a foam roller, then removing his shoes, then putting them back on again.

Finally, he stood up, rested the pole against his shoulder and lined up for the last try. When he cleared the bar, he set off a celebration in Sweden — and in France. An hour after the stadium cleared, the song “Dancing Queen” by the Swedish group ABBA was playing loud and proud outside the stadium.

By winning a second straight gold medal and breaking the record for the ninth time — each time by one centimeter — Duplantis is now next to, if not above, Sergei Bubka as the greatest ever in this event.

Duplantis is in the conversation with America’s Ryan Crouser, a world-record holder and three-time gold medalist, as among the most dominant athletes on the field side of this sport.

When it comes to delivering great theatre, as he showed once again, Duplantis is in a class of his own.

Chebet of Kenya wins women’s 5,000 meters after Kipyegon disqualified

Duplantis was the closing act on a night that included an upset by Kenya’s Beatrice Chebet in the women’s 5,000 meters. One of the world’s best distance runners, Chebet’s Kenyan teammate Faith Kipyegon, appeared to have the silver. After the race, Kipyegon was disqualified for trading elbows with world-record holder Gudaf Tsegay, with two laps left.

Kipyegon’s ouster elevated Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands to a silver medal. Hassan will also race in the 10,000 and marathon, trying to duplicate her three distance medals from the Tokyo Games.

Lyles returns to the track

Lyles returned to the track the day after his memorable win in the 100 meters to start the quest for his second gold, this one in the 200.

He won his opening heat in 20.19 seconds, then stuck around to receive his gold medal.

He said he did it all on only a little more than 4 hours of sleep.

“I had to stop watching the race,” he said of his decision to call it a night at 2:45 a.m. after his win. “Throughout the day, it’s kind of just been meandering trying to get the body started, jump starting it.”

Back to back for US discus thrower Val Allman

Val Allman won her second straight Olympic gold with a throw of 69.50 meters to easily top China’s Feng Bin.

The medals from Allman and Kendricks gave the U.S. 11 so far in the meet, including three golds. That’s five more than second-place China and The Netherlands.

Hodgkinson brings first gold of Olympic track to Britain

Keely Hodgkinson captured Britain’s first gold medal of the track meet, winning the 800 meters in 1:56.72.

This gold goes with the silver she took behind Athing Mu in 2021. Mu did not qualify for the Olympics after getting tripped up during the U.S. trials."

SAINT-DENIS, France -- The pole vaulter they call ""Mondo"" really can put on a show.

Those in attendance concurred.

""Mondo is an extraordinary jumper because of four factors,"" said American Sam Kendricks, who finished second. ""One, he's got a great coach for a long time. He's had a lot of time to do it. He's got great equipment and understanding of the event. He's a fan of sport, and he's got God's hand on his back.""

By winning a second straight gold medal and breaking the record for the ninth time -- each time by one centimeter -- Duplantis is now next to, if not above, Sergei Bubka as the greatest ever in this event.

Duplantis is in the conversation with America's Ryan Crouser, a world-record holder and three-time gold medalist in shot put, as among the most dominant athletes on the field side of this sport.

And when it comes to delivering great theater, as he showed once again, Duplantis is in a class of his own.

After he sealed the victory over Kendricks, then captured the Olympic record by clearing 6.10 meters, he had the bar moved to one centimeter higher than the world-record height.

The fans clapped in rhythm and sang along to the French song ""Alleur de Feu"" -- ""Light the Fire"" -- getting ready for Mondo's leap into history.

A homegrown talent, Duplantis learned the sport on a pole vault pit his parents dug in their backyard in Lafayette, Louisiana.

During long afternoons of jumping in that pit, Duplantis often envisioned himself going for a world record on his last jump at the Olympics.

Maybe not in the equation -- the parties that world record and Olympic title would set off. An hour after the stadium cleared, the song ""Dancing Queen"" by the Swedish group ABBA was playing loud and proud outside the stadium.

""For it to actually happen the way that it did and for me to put the right jump together at the right time, it's just, like, how do you explain it?"" he said. ""It's bigger than words for me.""

Duplantis was the closing act on a night that included an upset by Kenya's Beatrice Chebet in the women's 5,000 meters. One of the world's best distance runners, Chebet's Kenyan teammate Faith Kipyegon, ended up with silver, but only after winning an appeal of her initial disqualification for trading elbows with world-record holder Gudaf Tsegay.

The appeal left Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands with the bronze medal. Hassan will also race in the 10,000 and marathon, trying to duplicate her three distance medals from the Tokyo Games."

In front of a huge crowd at Stade de France in Paris on Aug. 5, Duplantis, 24, made history again with a vault of 6.25m.

The Swiss track and field star broke his own record of 6.24m. But then again, he broke his own record eight times before that, too.

Establishing himself as inarguably the greatest pole vaulter ever, Duplantis has now broken the world pole vault record nine times since Feb. 2014.

It came down to the final minute, the heat deciding score dropping only after the final horn had sounded. In the end, Caroline Marks of the United States is your Women's Surfing Gold Medalist.

The heat started slow with both Marks (USA) and Tatiana Weston-Webb of Brazil waiting patiently for Mother Nature to send a good wave their way. After both failing to get a wave above a 1.0 for nearly 10 minutes, Marks made the drop on a solid set wave, faded her bottom turn a bit, and pulled up and in to a round, pristine barrel. It wasn't the deepest of the day or the longest but it was clean, beautiful even, and she came out flawlessly. She got a 7.50 for it and, like the Men's Final earlier, the first good wave ridden also proved to be the Gold Medal winner.

Weston-Webb (BRA) answered with a tube of her own, albeit on a smaller wave, and rode it straight into a couple strong rail turns. The result was a 5.83.

The plot thickened as Marks (USA) failed to find a big second score. A short little tube ride and hooking top turn got her a 3.00, a number which would eventually become her second best score for a heat total of 10.50. She was close to coming out of another big barrel but the lip clipped her as she high-lined it towards the exit. The wipeout left the door open for Weston-Webb (BRA) in the final 90 seconds.

A small wave presented itself and Weston-Webb (BRA) took off needing only a 4.68 to win Gold. She used her rail game to tear the wave up, gouging multiple turns just before time expired. After a few minutes of uncertainty, the judges scores came in- a 4.50. Just shy of a Gold Medal performance.

Back on the beach, Marks (USA) was a vision of pure joy. “I’m so honoured and so happy, this is just incredible and I’m so emotional."" she said, ""So happy to do this for my family and everyone back home. Wow, I’m just so happy.”"
"Armand ""Mondo"" Duplantis breaks pole vault world record in gold.",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5682112/2024/08/05/mondo-duplantis-pole-vault-final-sam-kendricks/,"SAINT-DENIS, France — Sweden’s Armand Duplantis, pole in hand, stood on the runway staring down a bar higher than anyone’s ever cleared. Something special was brewing. It was tangible inside Stade de France.

The competition portion of men’s pole vault was over. Duplantis — the Lafayette, La., native and LSU product who competes for his mother’s home nation — secured the gold medal in four jumps. Clearing 6.0 meters was enough to win the gold medal at these Paris Olympics.

He is now the first back-to-back Olympic champion in men’s pole vault since American Bob Richards, who won in the 1952 Helsinki Games and the 1956 Melbourne Games. Duplantis and Richards are the only men’s pole vaulters with two Olympic golds in the event.

But Duplantis still had two more jumps. He used the fifth to break the Olympic record at 6.10 meters. The other races and throws were done and Duplantis still had one jump left. An encore remained.

One of the few one-name stars at these Olympics, Mondo, was going for the world record. He owns the last eight. The bar was set to 6.25 meters. The fervent crowd engaged for the theater of an all-time great.

“MON-DO! Clap. Clap. MON-DO! Clap. Clap.”

Save for the bit of a fight from American Sam Kendricks, this was the only uncertainty about Duplantis’ night.

Mondo is inevitable. He’s won 30 of his last 31 rounds of pole vault. His last defeat came in June 2023 at a Diamond League event in Monaco, when he was hampered by a hamstring injury and finished fourth. Whether a qualifying round or a final with stakes, Duplantis just doesn’t lose.

“He’s got God’s hands on his back,” Kendricks said. “He’s the fastest pole vaulter out there.”

He went charging down the runway. But he missed the first of three attempts. He was too far back when he swung up and his shin hit the bar.

As he does following jumps, he went to talk to his father and coach, former American pole vaulter Greg Duplantis. But his mother, Helena Duplantis, the former Swedish heptathlete, had tips for him, too.

“She can always sneak in there and give sneaky great advice, especially with the run part,” he said. “Just trying to stay tall but still keep all the momentum going forward.”

Following the gold medal ceremony for the 100 meters featuring Noah Lyles, Duplantis was back on the runway, attempting 6.25 for a second time. The crowd was at it again.

“MON-DO! Clap. Clap. MON-DO! Clap. Clap.”

This time, he led the crowd in a progressive clap, the one that starts slow and builds. A chorus of 69,000 people clapping in unison. For the second night in a raw, chills whisked through Stade de France.

Then as he took off, an escalating roar followed him down the runway. Duplantis pointed his pole, planted it in the box, swing his feet towards the sky. But the same thing happened. He didn’t get up and over without making contact with the bar.

He was down to his third and final attempt to break the record.

Duplantis said he didn’t hit the spot he needed to for optimal energy transfer. It would have to be a perfect jump, executed flawlessly. Pole vaulting is as much science as art, as much precision as feel. He made a technical adjustment, moving the uprights a little closer.

Kendricks wasn’t saying Mondo got that from him. But he was saying part of Mondo’s refinement was from coming up in the sport behind Kendricks and being a sponge. It’s created a pole vaulter who has the science and art down, the precision and feel.

“Once upon a time, Mondo did need some help,” Kendricks said. “He was the little cricket on the field of play. I remember him in 2017. He was a sprite like no other. Wide-eyed. New uniform. He knew more about me and my jumps than I knew about myself. He’s been the biggest pole vault fan that’s why knowing him is so infectious. I hate that we lost him to Sweden. I wish we can get him back to America one of these days.”

He was the only one of America’s three world-ranked pole vaulters to make it to the Olympic final. He missed out on the Tokyo Games because of the COVID pandemic and spent the entire time sequestered in a hotel. He has been vocal about his disdain for the Olympics after his last experience, even at one point suggesting he might not come to Paris even if he qualified.

Good thing for him he did. Kendricks, who turns 32 in September, took silver to go with his bronze from Rio in 2016. He tried to match 6.0 meters but failed on his three attempts. He becomes the 11th pole vaulter in history with multiple medals, and the third American (Richards, Bob Seagren).

But in this moment, Kendricks was just a fan of pole vault and a supporter of his good buddy. He joined the rest of the exuberant witnesses in pulling for Mondo as he hit the runway for a third time.

This time, Duplantis didn’t have to entice the crowd. It started the progressive clap on its own. As Duplantis scurried down the runway, the roaring crowd crescendo. The people in Stade de France knew this was it, an all or nothing attempt. And it was if the audience wanted to push Duplantis over with its energy.

He planted. He swung. And he cleared it. He was so high, you could stand a baguette between his pelvis and the bar.

The stadium erupted. As he fell to the mat, the crowd roared loud enough to rattle the spine. Duplantis popped off the mat and roared right back.

The greatest pole vaulter of all time set another world record. Of course he did. Mondo is inevitable.

“It’s hard to understand, honestly,” Duplantis said, pausing to gather his thoughts, shaking his head as he grappled with what happened. He took a deep breath. “If I don’t beat this moment in my career, I’m pretty ok with that. I don’t think you can really get much better than what happened.”

"Armand ""Mondo"" Duplantis breaks pole vault world record in gold.",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/live-blogs/paris-olympics-2024-live-updates-day-ten-scores-results/XOqC8eDGCzc5/,"Anyone who was hoping for some humility from Noah Lyles will appreciate the story he told after easily winning his heat in the first round of the men’s 200 meters.

Hours after he had the world abuzz from his dramatic win in the men’s 100 meters, Lyles was making another run for his girlfriend. Jamaican sprinter Junelle Bromfield left her spikes at their massage therapist's Airbnb, which Lyles said is next to the Olympic village.

He was on his way from the massage therapist back to the village when she asked him to pick up her bag with the spikes. Of course he did. His reward for the greatest moment of his professional life was carrying his bag, her bag “and some toiletries” to the Olympic village, walking gingerly to preserve his spent legs. At 2 a.m.

“Here I am,” Lyles said with a smile, feigning exasperation. “Olympic champion in the 100 meters, waddling to my girlfriend’s room with all this stuff. I’m a good boyfriend.” To be fair, she was scheduled to run in the first round of the women’s 400 meters at about noon on Monday. Lyles wasn’t scheduled to run until 9 p.m.

She finished third in her heat and qualified for the semifinals. Lyles was unaffected. He won his heat in a smooth 20.19 seconds. Though it was only the sixth-fastest time of the first round, it did nothing to dismiss his claims he won’t be beaten in the event.

“That was just kind of getting the legs moving, Lyles said. It’s been quite the 24 hours for Lyles, who snatched the spotlight of these Olympics. But with his main event still to go, Lyles said he didn’t do much to celebrate.

“I peed in a cup. Did media. Got a massage,” said Lyles, who took part in the medal ceremony at the end of the night’s festivities. “I watched a few videos. I watched Total Running Projections. I’m a big fan of the YouTube channel. I watched… people playing video games. Then I fell asleep.”

But he did watch the race and re-live his legendary moment. Last night. This morning. Multiple times throughout the day.

“When I first saw it,” he said, “I was like, ‘Ah, I really was in last place.”

Lyles said it wasn’t that he got out slow. Looking at the data, he is convinced the rest of the field just had amazing starts. He said his splits over the first 60 meters were good. But what happened to put him over the top was a goal of his he finally reached. He’s been looking for a particular time on one of his 10-meter split."

PARIS — Former LSU field star Armand ""Mondo"" Duplantis won gold at the men's pole vault finals on Monday in Paris.

Duplantis vaulted 6.25 meters at the Paris finals, both an Olympic and world record. He previously held the pole vault world record of 6.24 meters.

Duplantis' gold medal, which he won for Sweden, is the second time he has medaled in the pole vault. He previously won gold in the Tokyo Games in 2021.

Duplantis, originally from Lafayette, competes for his mother's homeland. He previously competed on LSU's field team where he broke multiple records. He has since become the highest-ranked pole vault athlete in the world.

Duplantis joins four other LSU athletes—Team USA's Brooks Curry, Mexico's Juan Celaya-Hernandez, Team USA's Vernon Norwood and Team USA's Sha’Carri Richardson—who medaled at this year's Olympics. His medal, however, is the first gold an LSU athlete has won from Paris.

LSU's track and field team congratulated Duplantis' victory by calling him ""THE GEAUXT!"""

Mondo Duplantis broke his own pole vault world record Monday night, August 5 at the Olympics, clearing 6.25 meters (20 feet, 6 inches) to cap his second straight gold medal performance on the sport’s biggest stage.

Duplantis cleared the mark on his third and final try. It marked the ninth time the Louisiana-born 24-year-old, who competes for his mother’s native Sweden, has broken the record, but the first time at the Olympics. Duplantis last broke the record April 20 in China.

America’s Sam Kendricks won the silver medal and Emmanouli Karalis of Greece took the bronze.

After Duplantis had the victory sealed by clearing 6.10, he had the bar moved to one centimeter higher than the world-record height. Following his first miss, he used a break while Noah Lyles was receiving the gold medal for his 100-meter victory the night before to study video evidence with his parents on a tablet.

Another miss ensued, then another long break.

All of the other events were over, but most of the crowd, including the king and queen of Sweden, stayed in the arena, singing along to the French song ""Alleur de Feu"" (Light the Fire) and clapping in rhythm.

Finally, Duplantis lined up for the last try and cleared it, then went sprinting toward the stands to celebrate.

The 24-year-old, who had secured successive Olympic titles by clearing six metres, set an Olympic record of 6.10m with his next attempt.

And he improved his world best of 6.24m, that he set in April, by one centimetre at his third and final attempt, to the delight of the crowd in the Stade de France.

The two-time world champion has now broken the record on nine occasions.

Duplantis, the first athlete to retain the pole vault title since American Bob Richards in 1952 and 1956, raced to his friends and family after breaking the world record.

He then embarked on a lap of the track draped in the Swedish flag, as Abba's 'Dancing Queen' blasted out of the stadium sound system.

“I haven’t processed how fantastic that moment was,"" said Duplantis. ""It’s one of those things that you don’t really feel is real. It's such an out of body experience.

""The biggest dream since a kid was to break the world record at the Olympics, and I’ve been able to do that in front of the most ridiculous crowd I’ve ever competed in front of.

“The party is going to be pretty big. Not that much sleep, a lot of partying, a good time.”

American Sam Kendricks cleared 5.95m to take silver, while Greece's Emmanouil Karalis secured bronze on countback with a best of 5.90m."

After a wonderful end to the surfing competition, Day 10 of Paris 2024 is over.

It was a memorable one, which featured world records falling in four different sports, headlined by Mondo Duplantis in the men’s pole vault, but also the Team GB women’s team sprint track cycling team, Aleksandra Miroslaw in the women’s speed climbing, and the Italian mixed team skeet shooters during qualifying.

Thanks for joining us today – there’s lots more in store tomorrow, on Day 11:

The men's basketball competition reaches the quarter-final stage (from 11am), with the top eight teams from the groups going head-to-head as the competition switches from Lille to the Bercy Arena in Paris. Men's hockey is also reaching its conclusion, reaching the last four, as is women's football.

Elsewhere, the first gold medal will be awarded in boxing at the historic Roland-Garros Stadium, while the canoe sprint events begin at the Nautical Stadium in Vaires-sur-Marne.

There are just 15 gold medal events on 6 August, but they include the second half of the women's sprint double in athletics, which is one of our selected highlights of the day:

Athletics (track and field) – New champion to be crowned in absence of Jamaican stars and Richardson

The reigning women's 200m Olympic champion, Elaine Thompson-Herah, isn’t in Paris after missing the Jamaican championships and trials.

But her teammate Shericka Jackson isn’t in action either, after pulling out of the 200m heats having been struggling with an injury she recently picked up.

And USA’s Sha’Carri Richardson didn’t qualify in the 200m either.

That could make the biggest challenger for gold U.S. champion Gabby Thomas, the bronze medallist in Tokyo. Thomas is fourth all-time behind Flo-Jo, Jackson, and Thompson-Herah.

There are also two Britons in the final, including 2019 world champion Dina Asher-Smith, as well as St. Lucia’s newly crowned 100m Olympic champion Julien Alfred.

Skateboarding - Sky Brown goes for gold

The women's park skateboarding event takes place today (prelims 12:30pm, final 5:30pm), which – as it did three years ago – could produce one of the youngest podiums of the entire Olympic Games.

All three medallists from Tokyo – Yosozumi Sakura, now 22; Hiraki Cocona, now 15; and Sky Brown, also 15 – are back, and they're joined by the likes of 14-year-old Australian Arisa Trew and 16-year-old Kusaki Hinano, among others.

Yosozumi, the defending champion, nearly didn't qualify – Brown's final run at the Olympic Qualifier Series in Budapest salvaged the day for her best friend, who now has a shot at retaining her title.

But in the face of the young guns, that's by no means guaranteed.

This marks the ninth time that Mondo Duplantis has shattered the world record, a streak which first started on February 8, 2020.

This is Mondo Duplantis’ second consecutive Olympic gold medal. Behind Mondo Duplantis, American Sam Kendricks claimed silver, while Emmanouli Karalis of Greece secured the bronze.

Remarkably, Mondo Duplantis already had his gold medal secured by leaping over 6.10m on the night. But then he had the bar moved one centimeter higher than the world-record height. He missed his first attempt. Then there was a break as the 100 metres medal ceremony was to be held where Americans Noah Lyles and Fred Kerley besides Jamaica’s Kishane Thompson received their medals.

After missing his second attempt, Mondo Duplantis nailed his third effort of the night at the new world record height.

"Armand ""Mondo"" Duplantis breaks pole vault world record in gold.",https://www.springfieldnewssun.com/nation-world/mondo-duplantis-breaks-pole-vault-world-record-in-gold-medal-performance-at-olympics/7GKTAOQG4JAYHCOO3VFSD75WI4/,"Another Olympic gold medal already was his. When he came crashing down into the padding on the other side of that sky-high, pink-tinted bar, so was another world record.

Duplantis, the Louisiana-born 24-year-old who competes for his mother's native Sweden, cleared 6.25 meters (20 feet, 6 inches) to break the world record for the ninth time — but the first time on his sport’s grandest stage.

His next move was a sprint to the stands to hug his girlfriend and celebrate his record and second Olympic gold with all those friends and family wearing yellow and blue. The country's king and queen were on hand, as well, to witness Sweden's latest history-making leap into the pole vault pit.

“It’s hard to understand, honestly,” he said. “If I don’t beat this moment in my career, then I’m pretty OK with that. I don’t think you can get much better than what just happened.”

It felt only right that the Duplantis drama came with Noah Lyles in the building.

A night after the American sprint star electrified track with a .005-second victory in the men's 100 meters, Lyles was on hand to receive his gold medal and watch Duplantis electrify field to the tune of 6.25 meters — about the height of a typical two-story building.

The drama played out over a half hour at the end of the night, long after a slow-and-strange women's 5,000 meters had wrapped up and after Keely Hodgkinson had captured the first track medal for Britain at this meet in the 800, the evening's last race.

That usually signals a time for folks to start heading for the exits.

But Mondo's encore was worth staying for, and most everyone did.

“Mondo is an extraordinary jumper because of four factors,” said American Sam Kendricks, who finished second. “One, he’s got a great coach for a long time. He’s had a lot of time to do it. He’s got great equipment and understanding of the event. He’s a fan of sport, and he’s got God’s hand on his back.”

By winning a second straight gold medal and breaking the record for the ninth time — each time by one centimeter — Duplantis is now next to, if not above, Sergei Bubka as the greatest ever in this event.

Duplantis is in the conversation with America’s Ryan Crouser, a world-record holder and three-time gold medalist in shot put, as among the most dominant athletes on the field side of this sport.

And when it comes to delivering great theatre, as he showed once again, Duplantis is in a class of his own.

After he sealed the victory over Kendricks, then captured the Olympic record by clearing 6.10 meters, Duplantis had the bar moved to one centimeter higher than the world-record height.

Following his first miss, he used a break while Lyles was receiving t he gold medal for his 100-meter victory, to study video on a tablet with his parents, who met decades ago while they were both on the LSU track and field team.

Another miss ensued, then another long break.

The fans clapped in rhythm and sang along to the French song “Alleur de Feu” — “Light the Fire” — getting ready for Mondo’s leap into history.

A home-grown talent, Duplantis learned this sport on a pole vault pit his parents dug in their back yard in Lafayette, Louisiana.

During long afternoons of jumping in that pit, Duplantis often envisioned himself going for a world record on his last jump at the Olympics.

Maybe not in the equation — the parties that world record and Olympic title would set off. An hour after the stadium cleared, the song “Dancing Queen” by the Swedish group ABBA was playing loud and proud outside the stadium.

“For it to actually happen the way that it did and for me to put the right jump together at the right time, it’s just, like, how do you explain it?” he said. ""It’s bigger than words for me.”

Chebet of Kenya wins wild women's 5,000 meters

Duplantis was the closing act on a night that included an upset by Kenya's Beatrice Chebet in the women's 5,000 meters. One of the world's best distance runners, Chebet's Kenyan teammate Faith Kipyegon, ended up with silver, but only after winning an appeal of her initial disqualification for trading elbows with world-record holder Gudaf Tsegay.

The appeal left Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands with the bronze medal. Hassan will also race in the 10,000 and marathon, trying to duplicate her three distance medals from the Tokyo Games.

Lyles returns to the track

Lyles returned to the track the day after his memorable win in the 100 meters to start the quest for his second gold, this one in the 200.

He won his opening heat in 20.19 seconds, then stuck around to receive his gold medal.

He said he did it all on only a little more than 4 hours of sleep.

“I had to stop watching the race,” he said of his decision to call it a night at 2:45 a.m. after his win. “Throughout the day, it’s kind of just been meandering trying to get the body started, jump starting it.”

Back to back for US discus thrower Val Allman

Val Allman won her second straight Olympic gold with a throw of 69.50 meters to easily top China's Feng Bin.

The medals from Allman and Kendricks gave the U.S. 11 so far in the meet, including three golds.

​Hodgkinson brings first gold of Olympic track to Britain

​Keely Hodgkinson captured Britain’s first gold medal of the track meet, winning the 800 meters in 1:56.72.

This gold goes with the silver she took behind Athing Mu in 2021. Mu did not qualify for the Olympics after getting tripped up during the U.S. trials.

Armand “Mondo” Duplantis, 24, won gold for Sweden in today’s pole vault final at the Stade de France. Raised in Louisiana by an American father and a Swedish mother, Duplantis has represented his mother’s home country in numerous world and European championships and competed for LSU in 2019.

The 5-foot-11 three-time European champion set a new world record with a jump of 6.25 meters, breaking his previous record of 6.24, and secured his second gold medal with a jump of 6.1 meters. 6.25 meters is 20 and a half feet.

Since 2020, Duplantis has recorded a jump at every height from 6.17 to 6.25 meters, the nine highest jumps of all time. The previous world record holder, Renaud Lavillenie, jumped 6.16 meters in 2014.

This is Duplantis’ second Olympics. He also won gold in Tokyo with a jump of 6.02 meters.

Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands may not have successfully defended her title the women’s 5,000 meters, but with a silver medal in the first leg of what would be a historic Olympic treble, the 31-year-old continues to push the boundaries of belief in middle- and long-distance running.

Hassan, who possesses unmatched speed down the stretch, ran out out of track as she tried to chase down Faith Kipyegon and Beatrice Chebet of Kenya, who won the race in 14:28.56, and had to settle for a bronze medal. Gudaf Tsegay, the world record holder, finished a disappointing ninth.

But minutes after the finish, officials disqualified Kipyegon for obstruction and elevated Hassan to the silver and Nadia Battocletti of Italy to the bronze. And with the 5,000 out of the way, Hassan will shift her attention to the 10,000 meters, which will take place on Friday night. After that, she will have roughly 36 hours to recover for the marathon, which is scheduled for Sunday morning.

The effort seems absurd until you consider who is making it, and that it might even be easier than the one Hassan attempted in Tokyo three years ago. There, Hassan competed in the 5,000, the 10,000 and the 1,500. She won the gold medal in the two long distance races and took the bronze in the 1,500.

Why might that have been more difficult? In general runners who have the endurance to win the 5,000 and the 10,000 don’t have the speed to compete at the highest level in 1,500.

Apparently, Hassan does, but rather than treading on familiar ground, Hassan decided to set a goal of winning a medal in the three longest distance running events that just one other runner has accomplished. In 1952, Emil Zatopek, the Czech distance great, won all three races at the Helsinki Olympics."
"Armand ""Mondo"" Duplantis breaks pole vault world record in gold.",https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/noah-lyles-back-track-olympics-drama-run-round-112588568,"Armand “Mondo” Duplantis broke his own pole vault world record Monday night at the Olympics, clearing 6.25 meters (20 feet, 6 inches) to cap his second straight gold-medal performance on the sport’s biggest stage

SAINT-DENIS, France -- The pole vaulter they call “Mondo” really can put on a show.

With the rest of the action at the Olympic track wrapped up for the evening and the crowd of 80,000 at the Stade de France still on their feet, Armand Duplantis rested the pole on his right shoulder and took a deep breath. Then, he lifted up that long piece of carbon fiber and took off down the runway and into the night sky.

Another Olympic gold medal already was his. When he came crashing down into the padding on the other side of that sky-high, pink-tinted bar, so was another world record.

Duplantis, the Louisiana-born 24-year-old who competes for his mother's native Sweden, cleared 6.25 meters (20 feet, 6 inches) to break the world record for the ninth time — but the first time on his sport’s grandest stage.

His next move was a sprint to the stands to hug his girlfriend and celebrate his record and second Olympic gold with all those friends and family wearing yellow and blue. The country's king and queen were on hand, as well, to witness Sweden's latest history-making leap into the pole vault pit.

“It’s hard to understand, honestly,” he said. “If I don’t beat this moment in my career, then I’m pretty OK with that. I don’t think you can get much better than what just happened.”

It felt only right that the Duplantis drama came with Noah Lyles in the building.

A night after the American sprint star electrified track with a .005-second victory in the men's 100 meters, Lyles was on hand to receive his gold medal and watch Duplantis electrify field to the tune of 6.25 meters — about the height of a typical two-story building.

The drama played out over a half hour at the end of the night, long after a slow-and-strange women's 5,000 meters had wrapped up and after Keely Hodgkinson had captured the first track medal for Britain at this meet in the 800, the evening's last race.

That usually signals a time for folks to start heading for the exits.

But Mondo's encore was worth staying for, and most everyone did.

“Mondo is an extraordinary jumper because of four factors,” said American Sam Kendricks, who finished second. “One, he’s got a great coach for a long time. He’s had a lot of time to do it. He’s got great equipment and understanding of the event. He’s a fan of sport, and he’s got God’s hand on his back.”

By winning a second straight gold medal and breaking the record for the ninth time — each time by one centimeter — Duplantis is now next to, if not above, Sergei Bubka as the greatest ever in this event.

Duplantis is in the conversation with America’s Ryan Crouser, a world-record holder and three-time gold medalist in shot put, as among the most dominant athletes on the field side of this sport.

And when it comes to delivering great theatre, as he showed once again, Duplantis is in a class of his own.

After he sealed the victory over Kendricks, then captured the Olympic record by clearing 6.10 meters, Duplantis had the bar moved to one centimeter higher than the world-record height.

Following his first miss, he used a break while Lyles was receiving t he gold medal for his 100-meter victory, to study video on a tablet with his parents, who met decades ago while they were both on the LSU track and field team.

Another miss ensued, then another long break.

The fans clapped in rhythm and sang along to the French song “Alleur de Feu” — “Light the Fire” — getting ready for Mondo’s leap into history.

A home-grown talent, Duplantis learned this sport on a pole vault pit his parents dug in their back yard in Lafayette, Louisiana.

During long afternoons of jumping in that pit, Duplantis often envisioned himself going for a world record on his last jump at the Olympics.

Maybe not in the equation — the parties that world record and Olympic title would set off. An hour after the stadium cleared, the song “Dancing Queen” by the Swedish group ABBA was playing loud and proud outside the stadium.

“For it to actually happen the way that it did and for me to put the right jump together at the right time, it’s just, like, how do you explain it?” he said. ""It’s bigger than words for me.”

Duplantis was the closing act on a night that included an upset by Kenya’s Beatrice Chebet in the women’s 5,000 meters. One of the world’s best distance runners, Chebet’s Kenyan teammate Faith Kipyegon, ended up with silver, but only after winning an appeal of her initial disqualification for trading elbows with world-record holder Gudaf Tsegay.

The appeal left Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands with the bronze medal. Hassan will also race in the 10,000 and marathon, trying to duplicate her three distance medals from the Tokyo Games.

Lyles returned to the track the day after his memorable win in the 100 meters to start the quest for his second gold, this one in the 200.

He won his opening heat in 20.19 seconds, then stuck around to receive his gold medal.

He said he did it all on only a little more than 4 hours of sleep.

“I had to stop watching the race,” he said of his decision to call it a night at 2:45 a.m. after his win. “Throughout the day, it’s kind of just been meandering trying to get the body started, jump starting it.”

Val Allman won her second straight Olympic gold with a throw of 69.50 meters to easily top China's Feng Bin.

The medals from Allman and Kendricks gave the U.S. 11 so far in the meet, including three golds.

​Keely Hodgkinson captured Britain’s first gold medal of the track meet, winning the 800 meters in 1:56.72.

This gold goes with the silver she took behind Athing Mu in 2021. Mu did not qualify for the Olympics after getting tripped up during the U.S. trials.

The gold medal in the men’s pole vault belonged to Armand Duplantis. The events of the night were done, including the gold medal ceremony for the 100 meters featuring Noah Lyles.

But an encore remained. One of the few one-name stars at these Olympics, Mondo, was going for the world record. He set the last eight. The bar was set at 6.25 meters. The fervent crowd at Stade de France was all in for the theater of an all-time great.

“MON-DO! Clap. Clap. MON-DO! Clap. Clap.”

Save for the bit of a fight American Sam Kendricks put up, this was the only uncertainty about Duplantis’ night. He missed the first attempt. He was too far when he swung up and his shin hit the bar.

He was back on the runway, attempting 6.25. The crowd was at it again.

“MON-DO! Clap. Clap. MON-DO! Clap. Clap.”

The energy of the stadium lifted as he ran down the runway. But the same thing happened. He didn’t get up and over without making contact on the bar. He missed the second attempt. He was down to his third and final try.

Even Kendricks was locked in. But now, Kendricks was just a fan of pole vault and a supporter of his good buddy. He joined the rest of the exuberant fans in pulling for Mondo as he hit the runway for a third time.

This time, Duplantis didn’t have to lead the crowd in the progressive clap, the one that starts slow and build. The crowd just did it on its own. He ran down the runway. The cheer of the crowd seemed to push him. He planted. He swung. He cleared it.

The stadium erupted as he fell to the mat, a roar loud enough to rattle the spine. The greatest pole vaulter of all time set another world record. Of course he did. Mondo is inevitable."

MEMPHIS, Tenn — Former Ole Miss Rebel Sam Kendricks is bringing home more hardware after securing silver in the men's pole vault at Paris Olympics on Monday.

Kendricks leaped to great heights for Team USA after clearing a season best 5.95m.

He fell short to 24-year-old two-time Olympic champion Armand ""Mondo"" Duplantis of Sweden, who broke his own world record to clinch the gold.

The Oxford, MS native is the third U.S. athlete to quality for the event three times. He took home bronze after jumping 5.85m in 2016, but Kendricks was not able to compete in 2021 after testing positive for COVID-19 while in the Olympic Village."

Hours after he had the world abuzz from his dramatic win in the men’s 100 meters, Lyles was making another run for his girlfriend. Jamaican sprinter Junelle Bromfield left her spikes at their massage therapist's Airbnb, which Lyles said is next to the Olympic village.

He was on his way from the massage therapist back to the village when she asked him to pick up her bag with the spikes. Of course he did. His reward for the greatest moment of his professional life was carrying his bag, her bag “and some toiletries” to the Olympic village, walking gingerly to preserve his spent legs. At 2 a.m.

“Here I am,” Lyles said with a smile, feigning exasperation. “Olympic champion in the 100 meters, waddling to my girlfriend’s room with all this stuff. I’m a good boyfriend.” To be fair, she was scheduled to run in the first round of the women’s 400 meters at about noon on Monday. Lyles wasn’t scheduled to run until 9 p.m.

She finished third in her heat and qualified for the semifinals. Lyles was unaffected. He won his heat in a smooth 20.19 seconds. Though it was only the sixth-fastest time of the first round, it did nothing to dismiss his claims he won’t be beaten in the event.

“That was just kind of getting the legs moving, Lyles said. It’s been quite the 24 hours for Lyles, who snatched the spotlight of these Olympics. But with his main event still to go, Lyles said he didn’t do much to celebrate.

“I peed in a cup. Did media. Got a massage,” said Lyles, who took part in the medal ceremony at the end of the night’s festivities. “I watched a few videos. I watched Total Running Projections. I’m a big fan of the YouTube channel. I watched… people playing video games. Then I fell asleep.”

But he did watch the race and re-live his legendary moment. Last night. This morning. Multiple times throughout the day.

“When I first saw it,” he said, “I was like, ‘Ah, I really was in last place.”

Lyles said it wasn’t that he got out slow. Looking at the data, he is convinced the rest of the field just had amazing starts. He said his splits over the first 60 meters were good. But what happened to put him over the top was a goal of his he finally reached. He’s been looking for a particular time on one of his 10-meter split."

On the tenth day of the Paris Olympics, Armand ""Mondo"" Duplantis of Sweden won gold—and set a new world record during the men's pole vault record. Duplantis, who was born and raised in Lafayette, Louisiana, chose to compete for Sweden in honor of his mother's heritage.

After he broke the world record and won gold, he ran to the stands to embrace his parents, and his girlfriend, Desiré Inglander.

""Desiré brings me such a great balance in life,” Duplantis said earlier this year. ""It’s so nice to be able to come home and escape into a completely different world, absorb ourselves in each other and whatever we’re doing. She’s a great travel buddy.""

Here, meet Desiré Inglander, Mondo Duplantis's girlfriend:

She's a Swedish model and influencer.

Inglander has hundreds of thousands of followers on TikTok (@desiresinglander) and Instagram (@desireinglander), where she shares outfit snaps and other glimpses at her life in Sweden.

Inglander and Duplantis started dating in 2020.

They met at a Midsummer party in Stockholm, where Inglander was ""very single and not ready to mingle,"" as she said. ""I was in the mood of, ‘I’m going to do my own thing, nobody can stop me.'""

Duplantis recalls, “The problem was, people flirt in a very different way in Sweden than where I’m from. [In Louisiana] there’s a lot more talking – you talk for a long time. So at the party, I was just trying to talk to Desiré, like ‘Hey, what’s up, I’m Mondo...’ but she didn’t want anything to do with it or me. She just wanted to dance.""

They started talking via Snapchat, and finally went on a date a few months later.

She's Mondo's ""biggest fan.""

Inglander is always in the stands during Duplantis's pole vault competitions, cheering him on throughout his record breaking career. Per Vogue Scandinavia, ""Uninhibited shows of affection during live competition broadcasts have cemented their relationship in the public eye.""

The 24-year-old had the gold medal wrapped up when he hit a first-time clearance at 6m on Monday night.

He then raised the bar to 6.10m and shattered the Olympic record on his first attempt. But he wasn't done there, having the bar lifted all the way to 6.25m - 1cm more than the most recent world record he set in China earlier this year.

The Swede narrowly missed his first two attempts at 6.25m, before soaring over the bar with his third and final leap. The world record sparked unreal scenes in the Stade de France, with Duplantis celebrating with his girlfriend and family, and fans going nuts around the stadium.

Duplantis has now cemented his status as the greatest pole vaulter in history. Popularly known as ""Mondo"", he is the first man to win back-to-back Olympic pole vault titles since Bob Richards of the USA, who achieved the feat with victories in 1952 and 1956.

It marks the ninth time the US-born 24-year-old, who competes for his mother’s native Sweden, has broken the record. However Monday night was the first time he's done it at the Olympics. He started his run of bettering his won world record in February 2020, and has broken it by one centermetre each time.

American Sam Kendricks won silver with a best of 5.95m, while Greece's Emmanouil Karalis took the bronze (5.90). Steve Hooker said in commentary for Channel 9: “Gravity looks a little bit different for Armand Duplantis. I’m just looking at the bar at 6.25 and it’s still in the air, after a human went over it! Extraordinary.”

Australia's Kurtis Marschall in awe of Armand Duplantis

Australia's Kurtis Marschall battled through ankle pain after dislocating it earlier this year to finish a creditable sixth. Marschall's best moment of Monday night's competition came with a first-time clearance at 5.85m, after he had passed his final two attempts at 5.80m.

But the Aussie - who won bronze at the 2023 world championships - wasn't able to go any higher, bowing out with two unsuccessful attempts at 5.95m. But it still marked a massive improvement from Marschall's performance in the Tokyo Olympics final three years ago, when he failed to register a height at all.

The Aussie then had a front-row seat for Duplantis' heroics. ""That was his plan all along - get the Olympic record first, just get that done, because he didn't clear it in Tokyo, he went straight to the world record then,"" said Marschall.

""He just wanted to get 6.10 done first and then his clearances during the night were proof that he was going to jump 6.25 for sure. He's got so much more in him, it's ridiculous.""

Marschall has spent time with Duplantis in Sweden in recent years - training and hanging out - and considers him a good mate. ""It's sick to just be pulled along by him, to be in his wake is more than I could have asked for in this sport,"" the Aussie said.

""Maybe if it was a different era, then 5.85 would have got me a medal. Obviously I would have liked a bit more of a ideal prep. But getting to this point where I am, and jumping amongst some of the best guys in the world at the moment is more than I could have asked for. Just seeing (Duplantis) do that brings more eyes to the sport and more eyes to the sport is better. He's honestly the GOAT.""

The gold medal in the men’s pole vault belonged to Armand Duplantis. The events of the night were done, including the gold medal ceremony for the 100 meters featuring Noah Lyles.

But an encore remained. One of the few one-name stars at these Olympics, Mondo, was going for the world record. He set the last eight. The bar was set at 6.25 meters. The fervent crowd at Stade de France was all in for the theater of an all-time great.

“MON-DO! Clap. Clap. MON-DO! Clap. Clap.”

Save for the bit of a fight American Sam Kendricks put up, this was the only uncertainty about Duplantis’ night. He missed the first attempt. He was too far when he swung up and his shin hit the bar.

He was back on the runway, attempting 6.25. The crowd was at it again.

“MON-DO! Clap. Clap. MON-DO! Clap. Clap.”

The energy of the stadium lifted as he ran down the runway. But the same thing happened. He didn’t get up and over without making contact on the bar. He missed the second attempt. He was down to his third and final try.

Even Kendricks was locked in. But now, Kendricks was just a fan of pole vault and a supporter of his good buddy. He joined the rest of the exuberant fans in pulling for Mondo as he hit the runway for a third time.

This time, Duplantis didn’t have to lead the crowd in the progressive clap, the one that starts slow and build. The crowd just did it on its own. He ran down the runway. The cheer of the crowd seemed to push him. He planted. He swung. He cleared it.

The stadium erupted as he fell to the mat, a roar loud enough to rattle the spine. The greatest pole vaulter of all time set another world record. Of course he did. Mondo is inevitable."

Hours after he had the world abuzz from his dramatic win in the men’s 100 meters, Lyles was making another run for his girlfriend. Jamaican sprinter Junelle Bromfield left her spikes at their massage therapist's Airbnb, which Lyles said is next to the Olympic village.

He was on his way from the massage therapist back to the village when she asked him to pick up her bag with the spikes. Of course he did. His reward for the greatest moment of his professional life was carrying his bag, her bag “and some toiletries” to the Olympic village, walking gingerly to preserve his spent legs. At 2 a.m.

“Here I am,” Lyles said with a smile, feigning exasperation. “Olympic champion in the 100 meters, waddling to my girlfriend’s room with all this stuff. I’m a good boyfriend.” To be fair, she was scheduled to run in the first round of the women’s 400 meters at about noon on Monday. Lyles wasn’t scheduled to run until 9 p.m.

She finished third in her heat and qualified for the semifinals. Lyles was unaffected. He won his heat in a smooth 20.19 seconds. Though it was only the sixth-fastest time of the first round, it did nothing to dismiss his claims he won’t be beaten in the event.

“That was just kind of getting the legs moving, Lyles said. It’s been quite the 24 hours for Lyles, who snatched the spotlight of these Olympics. But with his main event still to go, Lyles said he didn’t do much to celebrate.

“I peed in a cup. Did media. Got a massage,” said Lyles, who took part in the medal ceremony at the end of the night’s festivities. “I watched a few videos. I watched Total Running Projections. I’m a big fan of the YouTube channel. I watched… people playing video games. Then I fell asleep.”

But he did watch the race and re-live his legendary moment. Last night. This morning. Multiple times throughout the day.

“When I first saw it,” he said, “I was like, ‘Ah, I really was in last place.”

Lyles said it wasn’t that he got out slow. Looking at the data, he is convinced the rest of the field just had amazing starts. He said his splits over the first 60 meters were good. But what happened to put him over the top was a goal of his he finally reached. He’s been looking for a particular time on one of his 10-meter split."

Pole vaulting phenom Armand Duplantis always promised to be one of Paris 2024's main attractions even before smashing another world at the Olympic Games.

Few athletes have a chokehold on their sport like Duplantis. Better known as Mondo, he has now set the last nine world records in the pole vault, beginning his siege in 2020, and has a trophy cabinet of the ages.

His feats have seen him almost transcend athletics, and he won his first - and certainly not last - Olympic gold in Tokyo while barely breaking a sweat.

He arrived in the French capital as a shoo-in for gold and possibly one of the heaviest favourites throughout the Games and backed that up with a historic jump of 6.25m. His exploits have earned him a tidy fortune and some brand endorsements to match.

The 24-year-old Swedish-American athlete was born in Lafayette, Louisiana. His father, Greg, was a pole vaulter, and his mother, Helena Hedlund, was a Swedish long-jumper.

Beginning his journey at three years old, after giving the sport a go at his US family home, a young Duplantis set world best after world best as he progressed through the age groups.

He first tasted title success at the age of 15, winning the under-18 world title, and seemingly got addicted. In 2017, he became the European junior champion, and in 2019, he finished runner-up at the World Championships.

At 21, he became Sweden's first gold-medal vaulter, reaching the summit of his sport. But he wasn't done there; he was named European champion in 2022 and world champion in 2022 and 2023 - since becoming unbeatable.

The nickname Mondo, meaning' world' in Italian, was reportedly given to him by his godfather. Alongside titles, his everlasting legacy will be his eight consecutive world records. Though he'd have much to do to surpass the widely considered all-time best pole vaulter, Ukrainian Sergey Bubka, if anyone can become their sport's greatest, it's Mondo.

His first record occurred in 2020 when he bested Renaud Lavillenie's six-year-old 6.16m with a 6.17. Unsatisfied with this, the Swede then went on a spree, registering seven more records and producing the current highest feat of 6.24m. He attempted to reach the 6.25m mark at the Paris Diamond League in July, but failed - only to achieve the feat in the same city.

His stardom has earned him an estimated £4million, with brand endorsements from Red Bull and Puma adding to his prize money. If he retains his gold in Paris, he will earn an additional £40,000."

Left with one final world record attempt available to him at 6.25 metres, the man known as ""Mondo"" got a crowd of some 75,000 people clapping him at the top of the runway, then bounded in and soared over the bar.

In doing so, he took down his own world record of 6.24m and broke the pole vault world record for the ninth time.

The USA's Sam Kendricks won silver with a jump of 5.95m and Greek Emmanouil Karalis claimed bronze by clearing 5.90m.

Australian Kurtis Marschall, competing at the Olympics just three months after badly dislocating an ankle at the national athletics championships in Adelaide, finished sixth with a jump of 5.85m.

Marschall won bronze at last year's world championships in Budapest and had his eyes set on claiming a maiden Olympic medal in Paris, and although his bid to land on the podium didn't come off, sitting beside the runway and watching ""Mondo"" rewrite track and field's history books lifted the West Australian's spirits.

Duplantis successfully defended his Tokyo 2020 gold medal to become only the second man to clinch two pole vault Olympic golds, matching the heroics of the USA's Bob Richards at the Helsinki 1952 and Melbourne 1956 Games.

The 24-year-old had the gold medal wrapped up when he cleared six metres.

He then raised the bar to 6.10m, seven centimetres higher than the Olympic record, and looped over it on his first attempt.

Then he set his sights on clearing 6.25m, aiming to go one centimetre higher than the 6.24m he'd recorded in the Chinese city of Xiamen in April.

And after dislodging the bar on his first two attempts at the stratospheric height, he sent the Stade de France crowd delirious with the greatest vault the world has ever seen.

Ecstatic with his otherworldly feat, he leapt off the mat and sprung towards the front row of the crowd, greeting his girlfriend with an emotional embrace.

""Gravity looks like it just works a little bit different for 'Mondo' Duplantis,"" said Australian Olympic pole vault champion Steve Hooker on the Nine coverage.

""We all knew it was coming,"" Marschall, speaking in the media mixed zone, said of Duplantis' record-breaking jump.

""I think he just teased us a little bit with those first two misses.

""... It's sick to just be pulled along by him. To be in his wake is more than I could have asked for in this sport. Yeah, maybe if it was a different era 5.85m would have got me a medal, but at the moment it's just ridiculous.""

"Armand ""Mondo"" Duplantis breaks pole vault world record in gold.",https://sports.inquirer.net/578683/swedens-mondo-duplantis-pole-vaults-invincible-superstar,"Sweden’s Armand Duplantis cemented his place in pole vaulting history by defending his Olympic crown in world record-setting style on Monday to underline his total dominance in the discipline.

The 24-year-old US-born prodigy, often described as a rock star of athletics by World Athletics chief Sebastian Coe, set a new world record of 6.25 meters as he claimed a second gold.

It was the first time in 68 years, since Bob Richards in 1952 and 1956, that a vaulter has won back-to-back titles.

Duplantis has been practically unbeatable over the last five years, winning every major title in the sport after being beaten at the Doha worlds in 2019 by American Sam Kendricks, who won silver on Monday.

Duplantis won Olympic gold in Tokyo three years ago before winning back-to-back outdoor World Championships in 2022 and 2023. He added two world indoor crowns in 2022 and 2024 as well as three straight European Championship titles in 2018, 2022 and 2024.

He is not immune to setting world records at global championships and Paris was the third time. It was also his ninth successive progression of the mark.

He broke the record twice in 2020, three times in 2022, twice in 2023 and for the first time this year, in April in the Xiamen Diamond League meet.

Duplantis said you get used to the pressure of being the man everyone wants to beat.

“Every competition I go to I’m going to be a big favorite. It is what it is. The reason for that is that I have been showing it as well,” he said.

“I go into every competition trying to jump as high as I possibly can. I think it should be enough to do what I know I can do. You get used to it and you know how to control it.”

Coached by his American father Greg, a former pole vaulter, Duplantis is a product of a track and field-crazy family which had their own vaulting apparatus in the garden, though he insists he was no “lab rat”.

“I started pole vaulting when I was about four years old,” Duplantis has said.

The six-time Louisiana state champion, who spent summers with his Swedish maternal grandparents in Sweden, added: “When you have a pole vault pit in your backyard, you’re going to try it.

“I fell in love with pole vault at a young age and stuck with it.”

Duplantis had already surpassed his father’s personal best by the age of 17.

He announced his prodigious talent to a wider audience when he won the European outdoor title in Berlin in 2018 with a vault of 6.05m, a world junior record.

From then on, apart from the “blip” in Qatar, it has been a bed of roses for Duplantis, whose world record now stands a massive 9cm further than a previous best by another jumper, France’s Renaud Lavillenie.

The only rival to have hit the 6m barrier is American Chris Nilsen in Eugene in February. He was absent from Paris and his closest rival on the day was Kendricks with 5.95m.

Such is his dominance, Duplantis often enters competition when half the field have already bombed out.

He is then left in his element, goading the public into raucous support as he first nails victory and then ups the bar for a world record attempt.

Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands may not have successfully defended her title the women’s 5,000 meters, but with a silver medal in the first leg of what would be a historic Olympic treble, the 31-year-old continues to push the boundaries of belief in middle- and long-distance running.

Hassan, who possesses unmatched speed down the stretch, ran out out of track as she tried to chase down Faith Kipyegon and Beatrice Chebet of Kenya, who won the race in 14:28.56, and had to settle for a bronze medal. Gudaf Tsegay, the world record holder, finished a disappointing ninth.

But minutes after the finish, officials disqualified Kipyegon for obstruction and elevated Hassan to the silver and Nadia Battocletti of Italy to the bronze. And with the 5,000 out of the way, Hassan will shift her attention to the 10,000 meters, which will take place on Friday night. After that, she will have roughly 36 hours to recover for the marathon, which is scheduled for Sunday morning.

The effort seems absurd until you consider who is making it, and that it might even be easier than the one Hassan attempted in Tokyo three years ago. There, Hassan competed in the 5,000, the 10,000 and the 1,500. She won the gold medal in the two long distance races and took the bronze in the 1,500.

Why might that have been more difficult? In general runners who have the endurance to win the 5,000 and the 10,000 don’t have the speed to compete at the highest level in 1,500.

Apparently, Hassan does, but rather than treading on familiar ground, Hassan decided to set a goal of winning a medal in the three longest distance running events that just one other runner has accomplished. In 1952, Emil Zatopek, the Czech distance great, won all three races at the Helsinki Olympics."

The pole vaulter is certainly one of the Olympic Games' biggest attractions with many already comparing him to the legendary Sergey Bubka.

In fact, the star athlete has already hit double figures for gold medals won at the youth, junior and senior world and European championships - both indoors and outdoors.

Who is Armand Duplantis?

Armand Duplantis was born on November 10, 1999 in Lafayette, Louisiana and is also known as Mondo.

Duplantis was raised by American pole vaulter father Greg Duplantis and Swedish long jumper mother Helena Hedlund.

The star athlete ultimately opted to compete for his mum's home country of Sweden.

In 2015 at the tender age of 15, the pole vaulter won the world Under-18 title and two years later he conquered the Under-20 world record with a clearance of 5.90m.

Duplantis earned his first ever Olympics honour at Tokyo 2020 when he won the gold medal.

Armand Duplantis' world records

Armand Duplantis is now gunning to break his ninth world record at Paris 2024.

Here is the full list of Duplantis' world records:

8 February, 2020 - 6.17m

15 February, 2020 - 6.18m

7 March, 2022 - 6.19m

20 March, 2022 - 6.20m

24 July, 2022 - 6.21m

25 February, 2022 - 6.22m

17 September, 2023 - 6.23m

21 April, 2024 - 6.24m

Armand Duplantis' medals

Armand Duplantis already counts a whopping eight medals across all competitions.

Here is the full breakdown of Duplantis' stunning success:"
"Armand ""Mondo"" Duplantis breaks pole vault world record in gold.",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/live-blogs/paris-olympics-2024-live-updates-day-ten-scores-results/XOqC8eDGCzc5/inMfDCcOr4zB/,"On his first attempt at 6.00 meters, Armand Duplantis was so high, you could’ve stood a baguette between his pelvis and the bar. And in one visual, it was clear why he’s one of the few one-name stars at these Olympics. Mondo.

His best is summarily insurmountable by anyone currently in pole vault. Opponents’ best hope is an off day by him. But even his less-than-best is often good enough.

He was more than good enough at Stade de France on Monday in the men’s pole vault final. His jump of 6.00 meters was enough to secure the gold medal in the men’s pole vault final on Monday.

Duplantis is inevitable. He’s won 19 straight rounds of competition. His last loss came in June 2023 at a Diamond League event in Monaco, when he was hampered by a hamstring injury and finished fourth. Before that, he’d won 12 straight. Whether a qualifying round or a final with stakes, he just doesn’t lose. His win Monday makes it 30 of his last 31.

Duplantis is the first back-to-back gold medal winner in the Olympics since American Bob Richards, who won in the 1952 Helsinki Games and in the 1956 Melbourne Games. Only Duplantis and Richards have two Olympic golds in the event.

The only American to make it to the Olympic final was Sam Kendricks. He missed out on the Tokyo Games because of the COVID pandemic and spent the entire time sequestered in a hotel. He has been vocal about his disdain for the Olympics after his last experience, even at one point suggestion he might not come to Paris even if he qualified.

Good thing for him he did. Kendricks, who turns 32 in September, took silver to go with his bronze from Rio in 2016. He tried to match 6.0 meters but failed on his three attempts. He becomes the 11th pole vaulter in history with multiple medals, and the third American (Richards, Bob Seagren).

Duplantis’ childhood idol, Frenchman Renaud Lavilenie, is one of the multiple-medallists. Duplantis is just 25."
"Armand ""Mondo"" Duplantis breaks pole vault world record in gold.",https://nypost.com/2024/08/05/sports/mondo-duplantis-celebrates-record-pole-vault-for-sweden-in-wild-scene/,"Now that’s how you celebrate a world record

In the pole vault final, Sweden’s Mondo Duplantis not only won gold with a 6.25-meter jump — he set a world record with the feat at the Paris Olympics on Monday.

With the crowd from Stade de France in full throat and even other competitors cheering him on, the 24-year-old Duplantis narrowly soared over the 6.25m bar, then sprinted over to kiss his girlfriend, Swedish model Desire Inglander.

Duplantis also embraced Swedish teammates, one of whom he even punched in celebration.

To cap it all off, Duplantis hit a Michael Jordan-esque shrug after greeting his awaiting family in the front row.

That wasn’t his only relevant celebration, though.

Duplantis also mimicked Turkey’s famed silver medalist shooter Yusuf Dikec, who participated with minimal protective gear and led some to believe he had previous sharpshooting experience.

Maybe most impressive is that the Lafayette, La. native had already won gold with a 6.10-meter vault on Monday, but still had more left in the tank and willingly wanted to attempt a higher mark.

The win for Duplantis notched his second straight Olympic gold after also doing so in Tokyo.

Duplantis’ new zenith ever-so-slightly beat his own previous best of 6.24 meters in April.

His first-place finish also came on the heels of gold in the 2024 World Indoor Championships and at the 2024 European Championships.

Duplantis competed for LSU collegiately and won the 2019 NCAA indoor championship with the Tigers.

As to why he’s representing Sweden instead of the United States, Duplantis’ mom, Helena, is a former Swedish volleyball player and heptathlete.

Duplantis’ athletic prowess doesn’t stop with his accolades, either.

His brother, Antoine, was a 12th-round pick by the Mets out of LSU in 2019, although he hasn’t played minor league baseball since 2022.

The gold medal in the men’s pole vault belonged to Armand Duplantis. The events of the night were done, including the gold medal ceremony for the 100 meters featuring Noah Lyles.

But an encore remained. One of the few one-name stars at these Olympics, Mondo, was going for the world record. He set the last eight. The bar was set at 6.25 meters. The fervent crowd at Stade de France was all in for the theater of an all-time great.

“MON-DO! Clap. Clap. MON-DO! Clap. Clap.”

Save for the bit of a fight American Sam Kendricks put up, this was the only uncertainty about Duplantis’ night. He missed the first attempt. He was too far when he swung up and his shin hit the bar.

He was back on the runway, attempting 6.25. The crowd was at it again.

“MON-DO! Clap. Clap. MON-DO! Clap. Clap.”

The energy of the stadium lifted as he ran down the runway. But the same thing happened. He didn’t get up and over without making contact on the bar. He missed the second attempt. He was down to his third and final try.

Even Kendricks was locked in. But now, Kendricks was just a fan of pole vault and a supporter of his good buddy. He joined the rest of the exuberant fans in pulling for Mondo as he hit the runway for a third time.

This time, Duplantis didn’t have to lead the crowd in the progressive clap, the one that starts slow and build. The crowd just did it on its own. He ran down the runway. The cheer of the crowd seemed to push him. He planted. He swung. He cleared it.

The stadium erupted as he fell to the mat, a roar loud enough to rattle the spine. The greatest pole vaulter of all time set another world record. Of course he did. Mondo is inevitable."

After a wonderful end to the surfing competition, Day 10 of Paris 2024 is over.

It was a memorable one, which featured world records falling in four different sports, headlined by Mondo Duplantis in the men’s pole vault, but also the Team GB women’s team sprint track cycling team, Aleksandra Miroslaw in the women’s speed climbing, and the Italian mixed team skeet shooters during qualifying.

Thanks for joining us today – there’s lots more in store tomorrow, on Day 11:

The men's basketball competition reaches the quarter-final stage (from 11am), with the top eight teams from the groups going head-to-head as the competition switches from Lille to the Bercy Arena in Paris. Men's hockey is also reaching its conclusion, reaching the last four, as is women's football.

Elsewhere, the first gold medal will be awarded in boxing at the historic Roland-Garros Stadium, while the canoe sprint events begin at the Nautical Stadium in Vaires-sur-Marne.

There are just 15 gold medal events on 6 August, but they include the second half of the women's sprint double in athletics, which is one of our selected highlights of the day:

Athletics (track and field) – New champion to be crowned in absence of Jamaican stars and Richardson

The reigning women's 200m Olympic champion, Elaine Thompson-Herah, isn’t in Paris after missing the Jamaican championships and trials.

But her teammate Shericka Jackson isn’t in action either, after pulling out of the 200m heats having been struggling with an injury she recently picked up.

And USA’s Sha’Carri Richardson didn’t qualify in the 200m either.

That could make the biggest challenger for gold U.S. champion Gabby Thomas, the bronze medallist in Tokyo. Thomas is fourth all-time behind Flo-Jo, Jackson, and Thompson-Herah.

There are also two Britons in the final, including 2019 world champion Dina Asher-Smith, as well as St. Lucia’s newly crowned 100m Olympic champion Julien Alfred.

Skateboarding - Sky Brown goes for gold

The women's park skateboarding event takes place today (prelims 12:30pm, final 5:30pm), which – as it did three years ago – could produce one of the youngest podiums of the entire Olympic Games.

All three medallists from Tokyo – Yosozumi Sakura, now 22; Hiraki Cocona, now 15; and Sky Brown, also 15 – are back, and they're joined by the likes of 14-year-old Australian Arisa Trew and 16-year-old Kusaki Hinano, among others.

Yosozumi, the defending champion, nearly didn't qualify – Brown's final run at the Olympic Qualifier Series in Budapest salvaged the day for her best friend, who now has a shot at retaining her title.

But in the face of the young guns, that's by no means guaranteed.

Markus Gilliar/GES Sportfoto/Getty Images

It was another dramatic day at the Olympic Games that saw world records, legends slip, others soar and a relatively new sport to these Games have its breakout moment.

The day started with a dramatic triathlon. Germany took home the Olympic gold medal in the mixed relay triathlon after a late comeback by Laura Lindemann helped overcome a 12-second deficit to help the Germans get the win. The USA defending its silver medal from Tokyo and Great Britain picked up the bronze in a photo finish in front of the packed Paris streets.

The build up of the race was dominated by ongoing discussions around the safety of the River Seine.

The action then moved to the gym, where Simone Biles was aiming to go for her fourth and fifth gold medals in Paris. Instead, in the women’s floor exercise, Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade won the gold, with Biles winning her 11th medal with a silver and Jordan Chiles taking home the bronze medal.

Biles had fallen off the beam earlier in the day and then struggled with another fall during her warm up. She took to the floor with her left calf strapped with tape.

In the men’s horizontal bar, the vast majority of competitors struggled with either staying on the bars or with their landings.

Alice D’Amato’s sterling routine won her the gold medal in the women’s balance beam competition, a final that was also marked by disappointing performances from some of the sport’s top stars, who struggled to stay on the beam.

On the track, there was an early huge upset when Molly Caudery from Team Great Britain failed to clear 4.55 meters in the women’s pole vault qualification round. She will not be in Wednesday’s final.

The winners of the men’s and women’s 100-meter sprints – Noah Lyles and Julien Alfred cruised into the finals of the 200-meter sprint.

A frantic finish in the women’s 5,000-meter final saw Kenyan Beatrice Chebet streak away from her compatriot and two-time Olympic medalist Faith Kipyegon in the closing stages. Kipyegon endured some drama after the race. She was initially disqualified and then appealed the decision. Two hours after the race was over, she was reinstated, taking the silver.

Great Britain’s Keely Hodgkinson led from the front to win the women’s 800-meter final, upgrading the silver medal she won at the Tokyo Olympics.

American discus thrower Valarie Allman struck gold for the second consecutive Olympic Games. Her best throw of the day went 69.50 meters, more than half a meter better than her gold medal throw in Tokyo in 2021.

And Sweden’s Mondo Duplantis won the gold again in the men’s pole vault. Not satisfied with just taking the gold, Duplantis then beat his own world record, raising the bar to 6.25 meters.

And in the nightcap, the 3x3 basketball tournament had a breakout moment with thrilling finals in both the men’s and women’s gold matches. Both matches went down to the last shot, with Germany winning the women’s gold and The Netherlands edging out host nation France to take the gold in the men’s game.

On the track, Sweden's pole vaulter Armand Duplantis won gold and then broke the world record with a magnificent attempt of 6.25metres.

American sprinter Noah Lyles returned to the track just one day after he was crowned the fastest man in the world in one of the most thrilling 100m finals in history, winning his 200m heat at the Stade de France.

Lyles' compatriot Valarie Allman took gold in the women's discus, while Britain's Keely Hodgkinson won a dominant gold in the women's 800m as Monday also marked the first appearance of track cycling at the Velodrome National.

There was disappointment for superstar gymnast Simone Biles earlier in the day as she missed out on the chance to add to her incredible haul of seven Olympic gold medals, though she did come away from the women’s floor exercise final, the last gymnastics event of these Games, with a silver.

In a sensational finish to the fifth day of track and field at the Stade de France, Duplantis sailed over the bar raised to 6.25 metres to rapturous applause from a 69,000-capacity crowd.

It bettered by 1cm his own previous best of 6.24m set at the Xiamen Diamond League meet in April.

Remarkably it was the ninth time the US-born Swede had broken the record.

In the competition before the procession, American Sam Kendricks won silver with a best of 5.95m, Greece’s Emmanouil Karalis taking bronze (5.90) on countback.

The gold meant Duplantis became the first man to retain the pole vault title since American Bob Richards in 1952 and 1956.

Mondo Duplantis is his own competition.



Is he the most dominant athlete of this generation?#Paris2024#Olympicspic.twitter.com/CXwRtHgavO — Sportstar (@sportstarweb) August 5, 2024

It had been, he said, an “out-of-body experience”.

“What can I say? I just broke a world record at the Olympics, the biggest possible stage for a pole vaulter,” said Duplantis.

“The biggest dream since a kid was to break the world record at the Olympics, and I’ve been able to do that in front of the most ridiculous crowd I’ve ever competed in front of.”

As soon as he crashed down on the landing mat after his third and final successful attempt at 6.25m, Duplantis bounced away on the track to embrace family and friends in the stands.

Draped in the Swedish flag and with Abba’s “Dancing Queen” booming around the stadium, Duplantis made an emotional lap of the track.

The music halted as he leaned down to ring the victory bell, capping yet another exceptional display from the irrepressible 24-year-old.

Competition opened in perfect, balmy conditions at 5.50 metres. Duplantis skipped that, all of his 11 opponents opting, successfully, to make an attempt.

The Swede came in at 5.70m, sailing over with no problem. He skipped 5.80m, by which time four athletes had dropped out.

- Field narrowed -

Duplantis then cleared 5.85m in his second vault of the night by a considerable margin.

Kendricks followed suit, and the pair then went over at 5.95m.

That proved too much for the rest of the field as Australian Kurtis Marschall, Turkey’s Ersu Sasma, Ernest John Obiena of the Philippines and Karalis fell by the wayside.

Karalis took bronze on 5.90m countback from Obiena, but passed on 5.95.

The bar was raised to 6.00m. First up was Kendricks, but he brought down the bar. Duplantis followed and made no mistake, to the delight of a raucous crowd at France’s national stadium.

Kendricks had two more failures, leaving just Duplantis in the competition. The bar was immediately raised to 6.10m, which posed no problem for the Swede.

The crowd erupted as the in-track panels flashed up the next height: 6.25m, a world record mark.

His first effort was very close, catching the bar with his elbow.

Sam Kendrick who finished second in the pole vault explains that Mondo moved the standards that hold the bar from 70cm away from the line to 62 cm from the line - 8cm closer to him before he cleared 6.25m in his third attempt. He said Mondo did this because he knew he was getting… pic.twitter.com/QckNSlD0pW — jonathan selvaraj (@jon_selvaraj) August 5, 2024

For his second attempt, Duplantis asked for the slow clap in unison made famous by supporters of Iceland’s football team.

There were no demands for the third, just total concentration.

“I tried to clear my thoughts as much as I could,” Duplantis said.

“The crowd was going crazy. It was so loud in there, it sounded like an American football game. I have a little bit of experience being in a 100,000-capacity stadium, but I was never the centre of attention.

“I was just trying to channel the energy everybody was giving me, and they were giving me a lot of it. It worked out.”

As he accelerated down the runway, yellow pole held aloft, the crowd bayed. Successfully planted, the pole flexed and up shot Duplantis, body bending so his feet went up first.

Then came the explosion of delight, with another world record and a second Olympic gold bagged in a memorable night’s work.

But celebrations will not end there.

“I started a tradition a few years ago, when Mondo (Duplantis) became so hard to beat,” said Kendricks.

“The winner buys dinner. Mondo won by a lot tonight, so he’s going to buy us dinner.”

Duplantis added: “The party is going to be pretty big. Not that much sleep, a lot of partying, a good time.”"

After a wonderful end to the surfing competition, Day 10 of Paris 2024 is over.

It was a memorable one, which featured world records falling in four different sports, headlined by Mondo Duplantis in the men’s pole vault, but also the Team GB women’s team sprint track cycling team, Aleksandra Miroslaw in the women’s speed climbing, and the Italian mixed team skeet shooters during qualifying.

Thanks for joining us today – there’s lots more in store tomorrow, on Day 11:

The men's basketball competition reaches the quarter-final stage (from 11am), with the top eight teams from the groups going head-to-head as the competition switches from Lille to the Bercy Arena in Paris. Men's hockey is also reaching its conclusion, reaching the last four, as is women's football.

Elsewhere, the first gold medal will be awarded in boxing at the historic Roland-Garros Stadium, while the canoe sprint events begin at the Nautical Stadium in Vaires-sur-Marne.

There are just 15 gold medal events on 6 August, but they include the second half of the women's sprint double in athletics, which is one of our selected highlights of the day:

Athletics (track and field) – New champion to be crowned in absence of Jamaican stars and Richardson

The reigning women's 200m Olympic champion, Elaine Thompson-Herah, isn’t in Paris after missing the Jamaican championships and trials.

But her teammate Shericka Jackson isn’t in action either, after pulling out of the 200m heats having been struggling with an injury she recently picked up.

And USA’s Sha’Carri Richardson didn’t qualify in the 200m either.

That could make the biggest challenger for gold U.S. champion Gabby Thomas, the bronze medallist in Tokyo. Thomas is fourth all-time behind Flo-Jo, Jackson, and Thompson-Herah.

There are also two Britons in the final, including 2019 world champion Dina Asher-Smith, as well as St. Lucia’s newly crowned 100m Olympic champion Julien Alfred.

Skateboarding - Sky Brown goes for gold

The women's park skateboarding event takes place today (prelims 12:30pm, final 5:30pm), which – as it did three years ago – could produce one of the youngest podiums of the entire Olympic Games.

All three medallists from Tokyo – Yosozumi Sakura, now 22; Hiraki Cocona, now 15; and Sky Brown, also 15 – are back, and they're joined by the likes of 14-year-old Australian Arisa Trew and 16-year-old Kusaki Hinano, among others.

Yosozumi, the defending champion, nearly didn't qualify – Brown's final run at the Olympic Qualifier Series in Budapest salvaged the day for her best friend, who now has a shot at retaining her title.

But in the face of the young guns, that's by no means guaranteed.

Duplantis had earlier cleared 6.10 to set an Olympic record and, with the entire stadium watching after all other events had finished, he surpassed the 6.24 mark he set in April."

Mondo Duplantis was conducting an orchestra at the Stade de France. 70,000 people, including the King of Sweden, Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia, his parents, coaches, competitors and girlfriend, were clapping in sync and cheering for the 24-year-old as he put on a show for the ages. The Swede first smashed the Olympic Record of 6.10m and then successfully raised the bar to where no one had done it until then in history.

When he soared over the bar for the last time in the evening, he retained his Olympic Gold medal. It was an evening that will stand testimony to the fact that live sport is the best reality television.

Mondo Duplantis became only the second man to retain the pole vault Gold at the Olympics. He became the first man since Daley Thompson in 1984 to set a world record in a field event at the Olympics. Reuters Photo

SHOWMAN MONDO SHOWS OFF

6.25m it was! And when he breached that height, the decibel level at the stadium hit the roof. Regardless of their country, every soul at the Olympic stadium, including his nearest rival Sam Kendricks, erupted in awe. A mystical performance played on the big screen for those who tuned in to watch one of the greatest athletes of all time in action.

The theatre was beyond believable. Mondo Duplantis needed only five jumps in the men's pole vault final to secure the Gold medal. He flew over the bar at 6.10m to shatter the Olympic record. USA's Kendricks managed 5.95m for Silver and Greece's Karalis Emmanouil vaulted 5.90m for Bronze.

When Mondo pushed for 6.25m, he had no competitors. The other eleven men, who fought for glory on Monday, were all his cheerleaders. The biggest of them all was Kendricks as the true spirit of the Olympics was on show in the French capital. Mondo Dupantis with Sam Kendricks and Karalis Emmanouil (Reuters Photo)

*ONE, TWO AND THREEEEEEEEE!*

Spectators at the stadium were singing ""Alleur de Feu (Light the fire)"" as Mondo walked up to mark his run-up for the first of the three attempts at clearing 6.25m.

Mondo Duplantis's knee hit the crossbar while flying away in his first attempt at breaking the world record. Mondo used the break during the 100m Gold medal ceremony, to study the highlights of his jump with his coaching team.

He couldn't clear the 6.25m vault on his second attempt.

Mondo Duplantis then took off his shoes and used a foam roller for his back along the track while having a casual chat with Sam Kendricks, who was pushing him to go for 6.25m.

As the six-minute countdown clock wound down, Mondo confirmed to an official who walked up to him that he would want to adjust the depth from 70cm to 62cm to help him get a better distance while vaulting off the pole. Duplantis put his shoes back on, walked up to the starting point of his run-up and signalled to the crowd to start clapping.

There was a sense of inevitability when Mondo went for his third attempt to clear 6.25m. An on-air commentator optimistically backed Mondo to do it.

And he did it!

The start, the acceleration, the planting, the take-off, the pull and turn, the inversion, the fly away, and the leg clearance were all perfect. Mondo flew over the bar at 6.25m. It stayed intact this time.

MONDO PARTY IN PARIS

Mondo bounced off the mat and ran towards his close ones at the stands. The crowd roared, watching a special athlete push the boundaries yet again, delving into his unending repository of hunger to be the best and break the records.

Mondo Duplantis's girlfriend, who was one of those waiting to film the special moment, apparently dropped her phone after seeing her man vault over the bar and land in the history books. Mondo Duplantis celebrates with his girlfriend after winning the Paris Olympics Gold (Reuters Photo)

Duplantis began his streak of breaking records when he flew over the bar at 6.17m in February 2020. He has since broken it, one centimetre at a time, as many as eight times. Before the Paris Games, he achieved 6.24m at the Xiamen Diamond League in April. He pushed it by a centimetre on Monday.

The greatest pole vaulter of all-time continues to add to his resume.

Swedish pole vaulter Armand “Mondo” Duplantis won the gold medal in Monday’s men’s pole vault final at the Paris Olympics. Insanely enough though, the gold medal was not even the most impressive part of the day for Duplantis. After already clinching the gold, Duplantis went for a new world record by attempting to clear a bar set at a height of 6.25 meters (20 feet, 5.5 inches). With the crowd at the Stade de France stadium buzzing, Duplantis gave it a go … and he got it.

Check out the awesome video of Duplantis breaking the world record and then running over to celebrate with his loved ones.

MONDO DUPLANTIS ENDS THE NIGHT WITH A NEW WORLD RECORD. #ParisOlympics pic.twitter.com/0egeRdxphW — NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) August 5, 2024

Duplantis, still only 24, was already the world record holder, first setting it in 2020 at 6.17 meters. Since then, Duplantis has broken his own world record eight different times and entered competition at the Paris Games with nine of the top 10 pole vaults of all-time. Most recently before Paris, Duplantis cleared 6.24 meters at the 2024 Diamond League in April.

Mondo Duplantis is MY goat. pic.twitter.com/YCxhked1SK — Brett Hanfling (@Brett_Hanfling) August 5, 2024

But setting a new world record at the Olympics is an entirely different ballgame. The previous record during Olympic competition was held by Brazilian pole vaulter Thiago Braz, who cleared 6.03 meters at the 2016 Rio Games. With Duplantis going all the way up to 6.25 meters on Monday in Paris, it is just the third time that the pole vault world record has been broken at the Olympics and the first time since 1980.

Duplantis is now a back-to-back Olympic gold medalist (after winning at the 2020 Tokyo Games with a top vault of 6.02 meters) as well as a two-time World outdoor champion and a two-time World indoor champion too. His continued success is a welcome sight for the sport of pole vaulting, which had only made headlines prior to that at this year’s Olympics because of a funny competition mishap."
"Armand ""Mondo"" Duplantis breaks pole vault world record in gold.",https://thewillnews.com/duplantis-breaks-pole-vault-world-record-at-paris-olympics/,"August 05, (THEWILL) – Armand Duplantis, known widely as Mondo, has broken his own world record in the men’s pole vault at the 2024 Paris Olympics. The Swedish athlete cleared 6.25 metres on his third attempt, following his gold medal win earlier in the competition.

This achievement marks Duplantis’s ninth world record and cements his status as one of the most dominant athletes in the sport.

The event took place at Stade de France, where an enthusiastic crowd cheered Duplantis on with rhythmic chants of “MON-DO!” The athlete had already secured gold by clearing 6.0 metres, making him the first back-to-back Olympic champion in men’s pole vault since American Bob Richards in 1952 and 1956.

American Sam Kendricks claimed the silver medal, adding to his bronze from the 2016 Rio Olympics. Kendricks, who missed the Tokyo Games due to COVID-19 restrictions, becomes the third American to win multiple Olympic medals in pole vault, joining Richards and Bob Seagren.

Duplantis’s victory extends his remarkable winning streak to 30 out of his last 31 competitions. His most recent defeat occurred in June 2023 at a Diamond League event in Monaco, where he was hampered by a hamstring injury."

Duplantis raised the heat in the final by etching his name into the history book with a set of remarkable performances in the final of the event at the Paris Olympics.

In Rio 2016, Brazil's Thiago set the Olympic record by registering a jump of 6.03m. Duplantis beat the Olympic record by clearing 6.10m.

The Swedish pole vaulter raised the bar high by beating his own world record of 6.24m, which he set in the Xiamen Diamond League in April this year.

With 'Mondo' echoing throughout Stade de France, Duplantis set the new world record height of 6.25m in his third attempt.

He went towards the stand to celebrate the remarkable moment with his loved ones and was met with roars of applause from the crowd that witnessed the greatest jump in the history of the event at the Olympics.

Overall, this was the ninth time Duplantis broke the world record at the age of just 24 years.

His gold medal triumph resonates with the remarkable run he has had in the past couple of major tournaments.

Duplantis has won a gold each in the past three World Championships and Paris and Tokyo Olympics.

Kendricks was the closest to Duplantis and won the silver medal with a jump of 5.95m and Greece's Emmanouil Karalis settled for the bronze medal with a jump of 5.90m. (ANI)

He obliterated it with one attempt at the unnecessarily emphatic height of 6.10m. Most would consider that a fair night’s work but with the 800m women’s final concluded and nothing else left on the schedule this became the Duplantis show.

The world record stood at 6.24m, clinched by Duplantis earlier this year. The bar was raised a centimetre higher and for the first two jumps it looked as if Duplantis and a Swede-heavy crowd would be going home with the odd combination of a gold medal and mild disappointment. They need not have worried.

Duplantis led the crowd with the traditional arms-over-head claps of increasing speed before his first attempt but got serious by his third. There was silence as he composed himself, then a wave of encouraging roars for his run up. Pole safely planted, what he did next with his body was sublime. Legs pointed above his head at the apex of his jump before a contortion which put him into the optimum position to twirl over the bar."

The night ended with Sweden's Armand Duplantis, gold medal already secured, feeling the full weight of the crowd as he pursued a pole vault world record. On his third and final jump, he got it and gave Stade de France a reason to explode one more time.

Elsewhere, USA's Valarie Allman defended her discus gold medal with a win in Paris, while Great Britain's Keely Hodgkinson lived up to expectations by winning gold in the women's 800-meter.

Kenya picked up a gold medal with Beatrice Chebet winning the women's 5000-meter, but the nation was denied another medal when Faith Kipyegon was disqualified for obstruction.

Meanwhile, more medal hopefuls spent Monday jockeying for position. The first round of the men's 200-meter was dominated by the U.S., with Noah Lyles qualifying for the semifinals but his teammates Kenneth Bednarek and Erriyon Knighton leading the field with the top two times.

In the women's 200-meter, USA's Gabrielle Thomas and Saint Lucia's Julien Alfred advanced to what could be a thrilling final on Tuesday.

Breaks own world record with leap of 6.25

Silver for Kendricks, rare Greek bronze

Sweden’s Mondo Duplantis retained his Olympic pole vault title with ludicrous ease on Monday, needing only four successful attempts to take gold with 6.00 meters, then capped a memorable night by beating his own world record with a clearance of 6.25.

READ: Pole vault champion Duplantis sails through to final

Duplantis, one of the hottest favorites of the athletics program, went above and beyond to the delight of the crowd.

Having seen off silver medalist American Sam Kendricks and Greece’s bronze winner Emmanouil Karalis for the gold, he duly knocked off 6.10 at the first attempt to overhaul Thiago Braz’s Olympic record 6.03 from the 2016 Rio Games.

With all other events finished, the capacity Stade de France crowd then focused fully on Duplantis’ bright yellow shirt and neon pink-lit pole frame as he tried to beat the world record of 6.24 he set in April.

The first two attempts were close but he slipped over and around the bar with incredible athleticism on the third, bringing a deafening roar from the 69,000 fans who had stayed to witness athletics history.

Still only 24, Duplantis is the world record holder, double Olympic, double world, triple European and double indoor world champion.

“I haven’t processed how fantastic that moment was,” he said. “It’s one of those things that don’t really feel real, such an out of body experience.

“It’s the biggest possible stage for a pole vaulter. The biggest dream since I was a kid was to break the world record at the Olympics, and I’ve been able to do that in front of the most ridiculous crowd I’ve ever competed in front of.

“I felt really prepared. I’ve never been so locked in my life than in these past three months. Now I’m just ready to eat a bunch of food. The party is going to be pretty big.”

Ultimate target

Around three hours earlier, the pole vault had been something of a sideshow to the track action as Duplantis entered the fray at 5.70 and promptly cleared it by about a meter.

He sat out 5.80 before flying easily over 5.85, as others all around him were starting to fall by the wayside.

He then cleared 6.00 – the ultimate target for most vaulters – as if he was warming up, and that was all he needed.

Kendricks, the 2017 and 2019 world champion and 2016 Olympic bronze medalist, missed the Tokyo Games after testing positive for COVID following his arrival and spoke this week about the turmoil he suffered as brands considered him “damaged goods”.

The pent-up emotion exploded when he equaled his season’s best of 5.95 but he could not get over 6.00 with three attempts, leaving Duplantis as the winner on that height, without a fail.

Karalis, 24, cleared his personal best of 5.93 this season and was delighted to get over 5.90. His attempts at 5.95 and 6.00 never looked convincing but he was delighted with his bronze having finished joint-fourth in Tokyo.

It was Greece’s fourth bronze in the event but first since 1956, after a shared bronze in the first Games of 1896, when the winning height was 3.30 meters.

The six-time Olympic medallist fell short of qualifying for the men's 100-metre final on Sunday night, a first in his career at the Games, and quickly pivoted to running the opening round of the 200 on Monday.

De Grasse, from Markham, Ont., ran a time of 20.30 seconds to finish second to American Noah Lyles (20.19) in Heat 6 and book his ticket into Wednesday's semifinals at Stade de France. The final is set for Thursday night.

""It was tough,"" De Grasse said. ""Of course you get the messages from family and back home and I tried to keep my phone on silent not to think about that because I was trying to shift my mind to the 200.

""Of course it's always tough when you get those messages like, 'It's OK,' and everyone's trying to cheer you up but I just had to shake that off and keep my phone on silent and not really answer those messages until after.""

WATCH l De Grasse advances directly into men's 200m semifinals: Reigning Olympic champ Andre De Grasse coasts into the 200m semifinals Duration 3:51 Andre De Grasse of Markham, Ont., finished second in his men's 200-metre first-round heat, with a time of 20.30 seconds, to advance directly into the semifinals at Paris 2024.

That wasn't all that was tough for the 29-year-old De Grasse.

""I didn't really get that much sleep last night, I guess I was so wired after the races,"" he said. ""I had to just meditate and just relax, lay in bed for a little longer after breakfast.

""Today was tough to get up but at least now we got a day off tomorrow and then probably just do a shakeout, warm-up and get ready for the semifinals on Wednesday.""

De Grasse is the reigning Olympic champion in the 200, setting a personal best of 19.62 seconds at the Tokyo Games in 2021.

He missed the 100 final on Sunday night, finishing fifth with a season-best time of 9.98 seconds in the semifinals. However, he has performed well in the 200 this year, demonstrating significant improvement after two years of injury and struggling to return to form.

He closed last season with his fourth-best time ever, 19.76 seconds, to win the Diamond League title in September.

Before the Olympics, he last ran the 200 at the Hungarian Athletics Grand Prix on July 9, where he won with a season-best 19.98 seconds. His coach, Rana Reider, told The Canadian Press that De Grasse ran 'really conservative' in that race.

""I always believe in myself, whether it's the 100 or 200,"" De Grasse said. ""I work every single day to prepare for both events so for me I know it's going to be a task, it's not going to be a laydown.

""Of course you have the Americans, you have the kid from Botswana [Letsile Tebogo] so there's a lot of people in that field that are going to bring their A-game, so I've got to make sure I'm on top of mine and just be ready for that moment.""

Duplantis breaks own men's pole vault world record

Mondo Duplantis broke his own pole vault world record Monday night at the Olympics, clearing 6.25 meters (20 feet, 6 inches) to cap his second straight gold-medal performance on the sport's biggest stage.

Duplantis cleared the mark on his third and final try. It marked the ninth time the Louisiana-born 24-year-old, who competes for his mother's native Sweden, has broken the record, but the first time at the Olympics.

Duplantis' string of breaking records, each time by one centimetre, started Feb. 8, 2020. His previous record came April 20 in China.

WATCH l Duplantis height of 6.25m sets world record: Armand Duplantis claims pole vault gold medal, sets world record Duration 1:55 Sweden's Armand Duplantis height of 6.25m set the world record in the men's pole vault final of the at the Paris 2024.

America's Sam Kendricks won the silver medal and Emmanouli Karalis of Greece took the bronze.

After Duplantis had the victory sealed by clearing 6.10, he had the bar moved to one centimeter higher than the world-record height. Following his first miss, he used a break while Noah Lyles was receiving the gold medal for his 100-metre victory the night before, to study video with his parents on a tablet.

Another miss ensued, then another long break.

All of the other events were over, but most of the crowd, including the king and queen of Sweden, stayed in the arena, singing along to the French song ""Alleur de Feu"" — ""Light the Fire"" — and clapping in rhythm.

Duplantis teetered on a foam roller, removed his shoes, then put them back on. Finally, he lined up for the last try and cleared it, then went sprinting toward the stands to celebrate the close of another memorable night at the Olympic track and field meet.

Leduc out of women's 200m final

In the women's 200, Audrey Leduc of Gatineau, Que., finished sixth in her semifinal and did not advance to Tuesday's final.

Jacqueline Madogo of Guelph, Ont., who won her repechage heat earlier Monday, placed seventh in the other semifinal and also failed to qualify for the final.

Newman into women's pole vault final

Earlier in the day, Alysha Newman advanced into her first Olympic women's pole vault final. The 30-year-old from London, Ont., cleared 4.55 metres on her first attempt in qualifying action to advance.

Newman is the Canadian record holder at 4.83 metres and is in her third Olympics.

She has cleared 4.75-plus metres in three of her last four meets leading into the Paris Games after returning from an ankle injury suffered in March just before the world indoor championships.

""This is my first Olympic final and I think we can't forget that in [2004], Dana Ellis finished sixth at Athens,"" Newman said. ""So I would like to walk around and say I'm one of the best of all time [in Canada] but she still has me beat on that.

""So I think deep down, I want her to know that she's motivated me to get to this point and that I want to finish higher than she did because without her in the sport, I never would've saw those numbers to try and compete and get those bars again. So I'm really looking forward to the final.""

Saskatoon's Anicka Newell did not qualify after failing to get over the bar on all three of her attempts at 4.55.

Jean-Simon Desgagnes also qualified for the men's 3000 steeplechase final on Monday.

The 26-year-old from Quebec City finished fifth in Heat 3 with a time of eight minutes 25.28 seconds to take the last qualifying spot in his heat for Wednesday's final."

In an incredible show of effortless talent, skill, and power, world no. 1 Armand Duplantis smashed the Olympic and world records for men’s pole vault.



With a second-straight gold medal already in the bag after clearing 6.0 meters with ease, Duplantis jumped and completed 6.10 meters, erasing the previous Olympic record of 6.03 meters set by Brazil’s Thiago Braz in Rio 2016.

Just for good measure, Mondo also then reset his own world record, clearing 6.25 meters on his third try. Naturally, 6.25 meters also became the new Olympic record.



Mondo's previous world record of 6.24m was just set earlier this year in China.

Duplantis only needed four jumps to secure the gold medal in Paris 2024, clearing 5.70m, 5.85m, 5.95m, and 6.0m all on his first attempts.

His smashing of the Olympic and world records in Paris 2024 also comes as Duplantis' semi-redemption story, as he failed to do the same back in Tokyo 2020.

After clearing 6.02m for his first Olympic gold medal in Japan, Duplantis attempted to break the Olympic and his then-world record in one go, attempting to jump 6.19 meters. At the time, his world record stood at 6.18 meters.

He failed on his three attempts in Tokyo, but would later get 6.19m in 2022. Mondo would then slowly increase his world records, jumping to 6.20m and 6.21m also in 2022, followed by 6.22m and 6.23m last year, and finally, 6.24m in April and 6.25m in the Olympics."
"Armand ""Mondo"" Duplantis breaks pole vault world record in gold.",https://www.myjoyonline.com/paris-2024-mondo-duplantis-soars-to-mens-pole-vault-gold/,"Armand ‘Mondo’ Duplantis has done it again.

The Swedish pole vaulter flew over the bar at a new world record height of 6.25m, having already secured Paris 2024 gold earlier in the evening on Monday, 5 August with a vault of 6.00m.

This is the ninth time Duplantis has broken the world record, beating the mark of 6.24m he set in the Xiamen Diamond League in April this year.

The crowd in the Stade de France has become used to breathtaking moments at these Olympics, but few can compare to this mammoth effort from Duplantis.

As chants of “Mondo, Mondo, Mondo” rang around the stadium, Duplantis did what he does best, first breaking the Olympic record with a jump of 6.10m and then raising the bar higher to 6.25m.

As he flew over the bar, he was met with roars from the Stade de France crowd who had witnessed the greatest jump — and jumper — in history.

With the screams of joy from the crowd only matched by Duplantis' own, the 24-year-old jumped from the mat and straight into the arms of his loved ones.

On a night filled with unforgettable moments, this is one that will be talked about for years to come.

His gold medal in Paris continues his incredible streak at major international outdoor championships, which has seen him win gold at the past three worlds and — after Monday — the last two Olympic Games.

Sam Kendricks of the USA won silver with a jump of 5.95m and Greece’s Emmanouil Karalis took bronze (5.90m).

Armand Duplantis was nicknamed ‘Mondo’ — ‘world’ in Italian — at a young age by a family friend. It is easy to retrofit what was probably just a loving act of childhood innocence, but at 24, Duplantis has conquered the pole vault world numerous times.

In March, he claimed his fourth world title (2022 indoors and outdoors; 2023 outdoors; 2024 indoors) and in June, his fourth European title (outdoors in 2018, 2022 and 2024, and indoors in 2021).

Duplantis is the overwhelming gold medal favourite in Paris. He won in Tokyo three years ago. Out-jump everyone and he will be the first man to retain the pole vault Olympic title since Bob Richards (the United States) in 1956.

Duplantis is to pole vaulting what Usain Bolt was to sprinting; Michael Phelps to swimming; Simone Biles to gymnastics. It is a Duplantis dynasty.

His first world record was 6.17 metres (20ft 3in) in Poland in February 2020. A week later, he jumped one centimetre higher in Glasgow. Duplantis was lucky he was in Europe and not at home in Lafayette, Louisiana. He wouldn’t have been able to pop any champagne corks there — Duplantis didn’t turn 21 until that November.

Six more world records have followed, each time by a centimetre. Most recently, Duplantis jumped 6.24m three months ago in China, his first outdoor competition of the season. That would raise eyebrows and spark doping-related questions in other events. No such thing happens in the pole vault. That is just what Mondo does.

After all, Duplantis is responsible for 61 of the 189 jumps of at least six metres. Nine of the top 10 jumps in history are his, with only Renaud Lavillenie’s 6.16m effort from 2014 interrupting the pattern. Duplantis keeps smashing the ceiling but prides himself on consistency, with such a high-performance floor. He has only lost three times since the start of 2022 and not at all since July 2023 — 17 straight wins. He cleared six metres in 36 of his 50 competitions from 2022 onwards, including eight out of 11 this calendar year.

Duplantis featured on Tigers Win, a Louisiana State University (LSU, of which he is an alumnus) podcast, in April 2023. He was asked when he last failed. The answer: 2019, his final collegiate year. Duplantis finished second in the NCAA final in June, second in the Diamond League final in August, and was runner-up at the World Championships in October. The loss fuelled him. The next year, 2020, he improved his personal best by 13 centimetres (from 6.05m to 6.18m).

In 2000, academic Francoys Gagne updated his Differentiated Model of Giftedness and Talent. It theorised that those with natural abilities need a mix of luck, personal qualities and the right environment to develop and realise their talent.

Duplantis could be the poster boy. He comes from a family of athletes: Greg, his father, was an elite vaulter for the U.S. Helena, his Swedish mother, was an international heptathlete and volleyball player. Duplantis’ maternal roots are why he represents Sweden, not the U.S. His parents are still his coaches.

Mondo has two older brothers who vaulted at a decent level. He grew up pole vaulting in his backyard and still holds all age-group world records between seven and 12 years old. Certainly a sporting fairytale, but also an oversimplification for explaining Duplantis’ success. This is where biomechanics provide answers.

David Young, professor of physics at LSU, explains that elite pole vaulters need four component parts: “The speed of a world-class sprinter, the ability of a long jumper, the agility of a gymnast and the flexibility of a ballerina.”

Chris Mills, a senior lecturer in biomechanics at the University of Portsmouth, breaks this down to The Athletic: “A good vault involves mastery of each phase.” For Duplantis, Mills says, “It is not just one element that he excels at.”

“A fast run-up is key as ultimately this will permit a greater grip height (of the pole). The higher you grip, the higher you vault,” says Mills. “Mondo has one of the highest approach speeds on the run-up, he grips high.”

His words echo what American pole vaulter KC Lightfoot said about Duplantis this summer: “He’s just so fast down the runway. He’s faster than all of us by quite a bit. Speed equals height in pole vault.”

GO DEEPER Chasing Mondo Duplantis: In Olympic pole vault, a trio of Americans try to topple a giant

Duplantis (5ft 11in) is small by pole vault standards, built more like Lavillenie (5ft 10in) than the U.S.’s Chris Nilsen (6ft 5in). As a high-schooler, he ran the 100m in 10.57s (wind-assisted by 0.1m/s) and long jumped 7.15m.

In a press conference for a Brussels Diamond League meet in 2022, Jamaican sprinter Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (who has the most global women’s sprint titles in history) asked how fast he could run 100m. He looked her in the eyes and said he’d beat her. Duplantis didn’t give a time.

Mills says run-ups are “typically 14-20 strides”. Duplantis runs from afar. His 20-stride run-up (pole vaulters count every other step, so it is a 10-step run-up) stretches 45 metres.

Mills explains “the plant phase”, where Duplantis brings the pole down and plants it into the box, which is only “20 centimetres deep and 60 centimetres wide”. It is wider at the front and narrower at the bottom, where it slopes down.

The pole hits the strike plate and slides down to the back of the box where it reaches a ‘cavity’. This rectangle at the back of the box gives the pole space to move and bend when it hits the back wall. Duplantis says a big part of his success is reacting to how the pole moves.

Pole vaulters need to “ensure they maximise their height at take-off by reaching up as high as possible from an accurate take-off position. The prep for the take-off and position are critical to converting run-up speed and that kinetic energy to the pole, and storing it as strain energy,” says Mills.

Duplantis is a right-handed vaulter, so that hand grips the top of the pole, palm facing the sky. The left hand is further down, palm facing the floor. Therefore, he jumps off his left leg (image one in the sequence above), which stays straight as he jumps (image two).

Next, a lot of things happen in the blink of an eye. “After take-off, the pole vaulter exerts force, via their hands, on the pole to aid the movement of the pole bend forward towards the bar,” says Mills.

“Once the pole vaulter has swung past the cord of the pole — an imaginary line between the top and bottom of the pole — the task becomes whole body rotation about the top hand (Duplantis’ right),” Mills explains. “The vaulter must swing upside down as quickly as possible (image three), to ensure they are in an optimal position as the pole starts to recoil.”

Duplantis, compared to other vaulters, gets into this inverted position much faster. It resembles how someone might ‘cannonball’ into a swimming pool. His left leg swings up, from straight. It follows the right knee (which was bent at take-off) and drives to the chest.

Mills says it is Duplantis’ “timing on the pole and his ability to transfer the energy from the pole into himself that propels him to the heights that have never been achieved by any other athlete”.

Imagine a coiled spring. “The strain energy in the pole is released and simultaneously the athlete pulls along the line of action to maximise vertical velocity, while maintaining sufficient horizontal velocity, to clear the bar,” says Mills.

The legs shoot straight up as the pole straightens. If the events up until that point were explosive and sprinter-like, Duplantis now becomes half-gymnast, half-ballerina. Nilsen once said, “Mondo is the perfect mix between strength, finesse and speed.”

In the extension phase, “vaulters perform a half-turn followed by a pike position (upside-down V) over the bar”, says Mills. There is detail. Duplantis’ left hand comes off the pole as his feet clear the bar, then he pushes the pole away with his right hand just before the feet come down and the rest of the body follows. The chest and arms are whipped away from the bar as Duplantis falls.

His jumps never lack height, a testament to his speed. When his failures do come it is because his angles are slightly off and he comes down on the bar, clipping it with his legs or chest (see his 6.19m attempts at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021).

That happened at the World Indoor Championships in Glasgow early this year. Duplantis won, of course, but didn’t manage any first-time clearances, needing three attempts at 5.85m, two at 5.95m, and three at 6.05m to win. He said it was the “hardest I have ever worked”. On an off-day, by his standards, Duplantis still took gold and had three world-record attempts.

Duplantis is so good that he now has to pass at heights. This creates a psychological endurance test. At the (outdoor) European Championships in June, which Duplantis won with a 6.10m championship record, he went in at 5.65m and cleared first-time through to and including 6.05m, his winning height. There were two hours and 27 minutes between his first and fifth jumps. Duplantis laid on his foam roller in between.

All this means he ends up in two competitions: having to beat everyone else first, then getting to target the world record. Whereas others might build up from their competition-winning height to the world record, Duplantis goes straight for it. This completely flips the physical and mental demands, as he then has to be prepared to jump higher in quick succession.

Being the best in the world means you have few athletes to look at for guidance and inspiration. Duplantis does sprint sessions four times a week and only jumps once, partly because his technical base is so good, mainly due to the physical tax of repeated jumps at these heights. When he does jump, he’ll be at the track for hours, even if the session itself is only 45 minutes, but the warm-up and cool-down are long and complex. He still doesn’t like lifting weights.

Duplantis should be more arrogant. He acknowledges, rather than boasts, that he has won everything and broken every record. His support for fellow athletes in competitions belies his success. Duplantis wins graciously. There will be fewer more predictable events to watch in Paris, yet slightly paradoxically, few more watchable.

Mondo has a world stage to shine on again.

1h ago 21.32 EDT Weston-Webb makes the most of a low wave, carving four hard turns that could be enough to claim the lead with one minute remaining. Marks is paddling back out after very briefly catching a barrel, but we’re now waiting on the last score for the Brazilian to decide the gold and silver medals. Share Updated at 21.40 EDT

1h ago 21.27 EDT Weston-Webb works her way back into the final with crisp carving on a short wave. It earns a 5.83, which is not enough to claim the lead but could be a handy back up score if she finds another wave of consequence. Marks gets a brief barrel and now leads 10.50 to 7.63, but the gold medal will likely go to the surfer that can add the stronger second score in the four minutes remaining. Share Updated at 21.30 EDT

1h ago 21.17 EDT Marks completes the first wave of the women’s gold medal match, delaying her turn into the barrel, briefly stalling in the tube and riding out clean. That is the new benchmark with a 7.50, giving the American an 8.00 to 0.76 lead with less than 14 minutes remaining. Share Updated at 21.19 EDT

1h ago 21.11 EDT Weston-Webb paddles for the first wave of the final following 10 minutes of waiting, but after a late drop in the Brazilian crashes out. Marks tries to make her pay immediately, pulls into a barrel but it quickly closes in. The American takes a nominal 0.50 to 0.33 lead. Share Updated at 21.15 EDT

2h ago 20.57 EDT Women's surfing final: Marks v Weston-Webb It’s straight into the women’s surfing gold medal match between America’s Caroline Marks and Brazil’s Tatiana Weston-Webb. Marks is already assured of her first Olympic medal after finishing fourth in Tokyo 2020, while Weston-Webb knows this break well and picked up a perfect 10 at Teahupo’o just a few months ago.

2h ago 20.40 EDT Robinson has priority for the next set but the waves are low and the bar is high with the Australian needing almost a perfect 10, or at least two very strong scores, to overtake Vaast. The local surfer leads 17.67 to 7.83 as the clock ticks down to only 12 minutes remaining in the gold medal match. Share

2h ago 20.30 EDT Vaast gets into another barrel, stalls his pace to stay deep in the wave and exits with a hard carve on a huge face. The French surfer is awarded a 9.50 for his first wave and an 8.17 for his second. Robinson is handed a 7.83 and he has all the work to do in the 20 minutes remaining. Share Updated at 20.35 EDT

2h ago 20.27 EDT The Teahupo’o sand is packed with fans watching on, while there are several more boats off to the side with an even better view, and after almost 10 minutes the ocean joins the party. Vaast grabs the first wave with a long tube ride, holds it deep for several seconds and exits with arms aloft. Robinson is onto the next wave in the set but it closes out quicker, and it looks like the French surfer will take an early advantage. Share Updated at 20.28 EDT

2h ago 20.17 EDT Men's surfing final: Robinson v Vaast The Paris 2024 men’s surfing gold medal match will see Australia’s Jack Robinson facing French goofy-footer Kauli Vaast.

Defay started strong and controlled the heat, while Hennessy just could not find a wave of consequence. Defay is ecstatic, wiping away tears and letting out huge cries of joy. Share

2h ago 20.10 EDT Back in Tahiti, Brisa Hennessy has clutched at a few lower waves but hasn’t been able to get enough out of them. Defay takes the best wave for at least 10 minutes, holds her place in the barrel and exits to carve up a huge face but loses her footing on the way back down. The Costa Rican is almost out of time here. Share

3h ago 19.58 EDT France’s Johanne Defay is controlling this women’s bronze medal match, busy catching the majority of waves and finding a third barrel to stretch her lead with a 6.83. Brisa Hennessy now needs a 9.66, as she trails 12.66 to 4.50 (and each surfer’s best two waves make up their score) with under 15 minutes remaining. Share Updated at 20.04 EDT

3h ago 19.52 EDT Defay again gets a short barrel before coming out for three aggressive carves and a 5.57. Hennessy is made to wait her turn and jumps at the first wave to come through for several minutes, takes off late and settles into the barrel but the lip closes in and knocks her off – it’s only a 1.50. Share

3h ago 19.43 EDT Johanne Defay gets the first wave of the women’s bronze medal match. There is only a short barrel but the 30-year-old adds three powerful turns to score a solid 5.83. Hennessy follows up straight away, three quick carves getting her on the board with a 3.00. Share Updated at 20.10 EDT

3h ago 19.33 EDT Brazil’s Gabriel Medina adds an Olympic bronze medal to his three world titles, edging out Peru’s Alonso Correa 15.54 to 12.43. A pair of clean barrels were the difference, but Medina’s aggression through the turns also stood out. Share Updated at 21.44 EDT

3h ago 19.29 EDT Correa is waiting patiently as the clock ticks down. He has two minutes to find a wave – with a hefty barrel – that offers an 8.72 or better. Share

3h ago 19.21 EDT Medina gets another barrel, holding his speed to sit deep and make a classy exit. The Brazilian goes straight into an alley-oop but loses his feet on the landing. That’s still enough for Medina to stretch his lead over Correa – 15.27 to 12.43 – with less than nine minutes remaining. The Peruvian will likely need a tube to overtake Medina but the good news is that heavier waves have now arrived. Share Updated at 19.23 EDT

3h ago 19.19 EDT Three-time world champion Medina bursts back into the heat as he gets a deep, long tube and hangs on through the exit. Three fast carves make it surely the best score of the heat so far. Correa was on the wave ahead but missed out on a barrel and could only throw in four carves. The Brazilian gets back out quicker than Correa and takes priority for the next set. Share Updated at 19.41 EDT

3h ago 19.09 EDT Correa is piling on the pressure with the next wave as he gets a short tube, riding out from the back of it, then carves hard to make the most of his turn. The Peruvian now leads 11.83 to Medina’s 6.54 with 20 minutes remaining. Share

4h ago 19.02 EDT Surfing bronze medal match: The two goofy footers are made to wait for a set to come through but Correa gets the first wave of the men’s third-place final. The Peruvian holds on as the barrel closes out then adds a couple of carves to get the first score on the board. Medina responds straight away, no tube so he carves hard, but Correa looked to have the better of their opening waves. Share Updated at 19.40 EDT

"Armand ""Mondo"" Duplantis breaks pole vault world record in gold.",https://thebharatexpressnews.com/american-mondo-duplantis-breaks-pole-vault-record-while-competing-for-sweden-at-the-olympics/,"Looking back at the Olympic Games weekend as the Paris Games enter their final week

American-born pole vaulter Armand “Mondo” Duplantis broke a world record for the ninth time on Monday at the Olympic Games in Paris, taking home a gold medal for Sweden.

The 24-year-old athlete from Louisiana jumped 6.25 meters on Monday, breaking the 6.24 meters he set in April at the Xiamen Diamond League in China. He jumped higher than a giraffe in each record jump. Silver went to Sam Kendricks of the US with a jump of 5.95 meters and Greece’s Emmanouil Karalis took bronze with a jump of 5.90 meters.

Duplantis has been breaking world records since February 2020. In addition to Olympic gold in Paris and Tokyo, he has won four world championships: two indoor and two outdoor. The Olympics compared Duplantis’ dominance in the world of pole vaulting to that of swimmer Katie Ledecky‘s skills in the 1,500 meter freestyle and Simone Biles‘skills in gymnastics.

Duplantis’ parents are both athletes, and his father was a pole vaulter for the U.S. According to the Olympics, the elder Duplantis’ personal best in the pole vault was 5.80 meters in 1993.

Although Duplantis was born in the U.S. and went to college in Louisiana, he competes for Sweden, his mother’s native country. According to the Olympics, he spent his childhood summers in Sweden.

Duplantis attended Louisiana State University, the same school as runner Sha’Carri Richardsonaccording to the Olympics. The pole vaulter moved to Sweden after his studies. He was named Swedish Newcomer of the Year in 2018 and Swedish Male Athlete of the Year in 2019, 2021 and 2022.

He is not the only athlete to compete for a country other than his own. Kaylia Nemour, a gymnast who won gold for Algeria in the women’s uneven bars final, was born in France. Her father is Algerian.

Harrison Butker of the Kansas City Chiefs is reportedly becoming the highest paid NFL kicker.,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/05/sport/harrison-butker-nfl-highest-paid-kicker-spt/index.html,"CNN —

Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker has agreed to a four-year deal that makes him the highest-paid kicker in the NFL, according to reports.

Butker announced the extension on X but provided no details. Unidentified sources told ESPN’s Adam Schefter and NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport the contract is worth $25.6 million, including more than $17 million in guaranteed money.

“There’s no place I’d rather be than with the Chiefs, excited to finalize a 4 year extension. To the Heights!” the three-time Super Bowl champion posted on X.

The 29-year-old represented himself in negotiations, according to Schefter and Rapoport. According to ESPN, Butker’s deal would pass the $6 million per season contracts of Justin Tucker of the Baltimore Ravens and Jake Elliott of the Philadelphia Eagles.

CNN has reached out to the Chiefs for comment.

Butker has made 89% of the field goals he has attempted in his seven-year career – second best in history – with his longest kick a 62-yarder in the 2022 season. Last season he made 33 of 35 field goal attempts. In February, he kicked a Super Bowl record 57-yarder in the third quarter as the Chiefs downed the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 in overtime.

In May, Butker made controversial comments during a commencement speech at Benedictine College, a small Catholic school in Atchison, Kansas.

He decried Pride Month as a “deadly sin” and suggested that women find more fulfillment through getting married and having children than by pursuing careers.

Butker faced significant backlash for his comments from fans and from groups like LGBT advocacy organization GLAAD. The NFL distanced itself from Butker’s words, while his teammates quarterback Patrick Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce said they didn’t agree with Butker’s speech but valued him as a teammate.

Butker later reaffirmed his commitment to his comments: “If it wasn’t clear that the timeless Catholic values are hated by many, it is now. … Our love for Jesus and thus our desire to speak out should never be outweighed by the longing of our fallen nature to be loved by the world.”

Last month, tennis great Serena Williams hosted the ESPY Awards, where she, along with her sister Venus Williams and Abbott Elementary actress Quinta Brunson, took a verbal shot at Butker.

“So go ahead and enjoy women’s sports like you would any other sports because they are sports,” Venus said to wrap up the segment.

“Except you, Harrison Butker. We don’t need you,” Serena quipped.

“At all, like ever,” Brunson added.

The Kansas City Chiefs and Harrison Butker have agreed to a contract extension that will make him the highest-paid kicker in the NFL, according to multiple reports.

Butker had one year left on his current deal. The new contract is reportedly for $25.6 million over four years, including $17.75 million guaranteed. Butker is now signed with the Chiefs through 2028.

Butker, a seventh-round draft pick of the Carolina Panthers, has kicked for Kansas City since 2017. He has converted 89.1% of his 197 career field-goal attempts in the regular season. And he has been even more accurate in the playoffs, hitting 91.4% of his kicks, helping the Chiefs win three Super Bowls since 2019.

It has been an eventful year for Butker.

In February, he kicked three field goals in Kansas City’s 25-22 win in the Super Bowl.

In May, giving the commencement speech at Benedictine College, a Catholic liberal arts school in Atchison, Kansas, he made remarks that were widely criticized for being antisemitic, misogynist and anti-LGBTQ.

Butker defended his comments by saying he has chosen to speak out more often about his Catholic faith. ""It’s a decision I’ve consciously made and one I do not regret at all,"" he said.

A few of Butker’s teammates distanced themselves from his comments, as did the NFL.

“Harrison Butker gave a speech in his personal capacity,” Jonathan Beane, the NFL’s senior vice president and chief diversity and inclusion officer, told People in a statement. “His views are not those of the NFL as an organization. The NFL is steadfast in our commitment to inclusion, which only makes our league stronger.”

And now Butker, 29, is entering his eighth NFL season as the best-paid player at his position.

The Chiefs will open their regular season Sept. 5 against the Baltimore Ravens on NBC."

Butker has been a contributor in each of the Chiefs' Super Bowl-winning seasons since 2019. He made 94.3% of his field goals and all 38 of his extra points in 2023.

The kicker made headlines this offseason after delivering a controversial commencement speech at Benedictine College. Butker said some Catholic leaders were ""pushing dangerous gender ideologies onto the youth of America"" and criticized the ""deadly sin sort of pride that has a month dedicated to it."" He also said the women in attendance ""have had the most diabolical lies told to you,"" expressing his belief that most of them were ""most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world"" rather than their future careers.

The NFL released a statement asserting that Butker's ""views are not those of the NFL as an organization."" Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce said they didn't necessarily agree with Butker's opinions but defended his character and described him as a good teammate. Butker stood by the contents of his speech, saying he had no regrets.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- A fight-filled day at a joint practice between the New York Giants and Detroit Lions saw seemingly everything, including quarterback Daniel Jones inciting a scuffle on Monday at the Quest Diagnostics Training Center.

It's especially notable considering Jones is coming off ACL surgery late last year and wasn't fully cleared for football until days before the start of training camp. That didn't stop the Giants' starting quarterback from taking offense to center Greg Van Roten getting pushed into the ground after a play by Lions defensive lineman Alim McNeill.

That's when Jones came over and shoved McNeill in the back to spark a scrum on the field.

""A situation happens like that, you try to stand up for your guys,"" Jones said. ""I thought it was good competitive practice all day [Monday] and we made some plays and did some good things. There are some things we need to shore up, for sure, but good intensity and competitive spirit.""

It was one of approximately eight skirmishes that occurred on the field Monday between the Giants and Lions during a testy practice in the 90-plus-degree heat in New Jersey. They were happening so fast and furiously on the abutting fields that it became difficult to keep count.

It took only a few minutes to figure what kind of day this was going to be. The Giants' defense got into it with Lions star receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown on the second play of live drills. That melee involved several punches being thrown, always a questionable tactic considering the players were still armed with their helmets.

That fracas occurred on a separate field from Jones and the Giants' offense. Not to be outdone, they joined the fight club just moments later. The feistiness and energy seemed to be contagious.

Giants coach Brian Daboll got upset with Lions defensive lineman Levi Onwuzurike for hitting Jones' arm while he was throwing on one play. Contact with the quarterbacks, all wearing red jerseys, is supposed to be off limits at practice.

Daboll reprimanded Onwuzurike loudly following the play. Not surprisingly, moments later, Jones pushed McNeill and they were off to the races.

""I appreciate [Daboll's support],"" Jones said. ""That's not something that typically happens in a practice situation. But it's a competitive practice, and guys are going hard.""

The Giants still don't necessarily want Jones involved in those types of fights. He's coming off a season where he made just six starts because of neck and knee injuries.

Jones was pulled out of the skirmish for which he supplied the lighter fluid by a team employee who was working on the field. As he tried to reenter the scrum, a coach prudently pulled him away.

""Oh, Lord. Daniel got jiggy with it. Daniel was out there with it?"" Giants edge rusher Brian Burns said when informed of his quarterback's actions. ""Yeah. I'm going to need him to back up. Let his O-line handle that.

""But Daniel, he's a competitor, man. He's a fighter. So, I don't expect anything less from him. But I don't need him in that. I don't need him to get hit. Keep him healthy.""

The Lions came to New Jersey perhaps a little cranky, after they were delayed some six hours the previous day during their travels. They were undoubtedly ready regardless.

It's unlikely the outcome would have been different anyway given their approach from the top down.

""You want to go out there and compete. You want to push them to be better,"" Lions coach Dan Campbell said before practice. ""So, like, our mentality is we're finishing on the ball. If you don't like it, that's all right and then that's when it leads into bigger things than it needs to be. But you know what, who cares? I mean, we're just coming out here trying to get good work.""

Ultimately, the two teams walked off the field at the conclusion of practice without further incident. Many players and coaches comingled as if it were just another training camp workout.

Albeit one that at times resembled more of a Royal Rumble than a football practice."

The New York Giants are at training camp with the Detroit Lions on Monday. They're getting in some joint practice — or at least trying to. The players seem a tad more interested in fighting with each other.

The Giants and Lions have gotten into multiple fights, most of which have been caught on camera by members of the media or fans attending the open practice. The reasons for those fights? It's unclear. Players get chippy toward each other during these early practices for any reason at all.

This first fight is just a sea of players in blue and white scuffling and pushing each other until everyone just kind of loses interest and walks back.

Neither are these head coaches.

Dan Campbell and Brian Daboll go way back. They’ve worked together on staff before. They’ve competed against one another. They appreciate how the other does business. It’s why these teams are meeting for joint practices for the second year in a row, hoping to get some good work in.

“Looking forward to working with the Giants,” Campbell said. “Appreciate Daboll and (Giants President and CEO John K. Mara, Esq.) Mr. Mara and (Giants Senior Vice President and General Manager) Joe Schoen, everybody hosting us here. So, we’re excited about the work, we know we’ve got a good practice partner and it’ll be a great chance to evaluate where a number of our players are at as well as theirs and get better.”

It feels like that happened on Monday. The physicality, the intensity and the competitive nature between these teams was on full display. Here’s what we saw.

One of the most intense practices

This is my third year covering the NFL, and I’ve seen some intense practices. Campbell believes you need to get real live reps to prepare for the season, and the Lions get their fair share in. That’s what he was hoping to see this morning, prior to the start of practice. There was no conversation with players to keep their intensity in check on Monday.

GO DEEPER Daniel Jones among many Giants involved in fights at joint practice with Lions

“No, look, I told them, ‘Man, like we always do.’ We’re competing and we’re not pulling back,” Campbell said. “But this will be evaluated like a game, so if you do something that’s going to cost us in a game, that’s part of your evaluation.’ But we’ve got to go, we’ve got to get better, we can’t just be tiptoeing either.”

Yeah, nobody tiptoed. Quite the opposite.

The beat estimates somewhere between 8-10 skirmishes — give or take a few. It started early. Amon-Ra St. Brown caught a pass, and after the play, a Giants defender poked it free. It led to some shoving, and eventually, a sideline-clearing shuffle. It was just the start.

It felt like something every few minutes whenever the teams were together for team periods. It didn’t matter if it was Detroit’s No. 1 offense vs. the Giants’ No. 1 defense or vice versa. You couldn’t put your head down immediately after a play or you’d run the risk of missing who started another one.

Coming off the field, I asked Lions’ LB Jack Campbell about it.

“You want to go out there and compete,” Campbell said. “You want to push them to be better. So like, our mentality is we’re finishing on the ball, we’re gonna punch at the ball, if you don’t like it, that’s all right, and then that’s when it leads into bigger things than it needs to be. But you know what, who cares? I mean, we’re just coming out here trying to get good work. I mean, the Giants are a heck of a football team and that’s what it’s all about. This week is about coming out here and competing.”

Campbell said it was more the fast-paced nature of practice than anything overly physical that stood out. He said he’s had practices at Iowa that were similar, and even Lions’ camp. But Monday’s intensity admittedly high on all fronts.

Knowing these head coaches and what they’re about, it’s no surprise.

“I feel like that’s just how we practice, and I mean, maybe they didn’t appreciate it,” Campbell said. “I don’t know. But I mean, it’s the same on their defense. Being on defense, you just gotta have the mindset of like kinda taking it right up to the edge but not going over, you know what I mean? When you go on the field nothing is — I don’t take nothing personal. Just go out there and play your game. And if you’re pissed at someone, then go compete with him the next snap.”

A day following the defense

Admittedly, it’s hard to cover everything during a joint practice when you’re alone on a beat. You essentially have to pick one side a day over the two-day practice period. I put a poll on Twitter for Lions fans to decide how today was covered, and nearly 64 percent of chose defense.

So, defense it was.

Gonna have to pick a side each day. Should I start with the Lions’ offense or defense today? — Colton Pouncy (@colton_pouncy) August 5, 2024

The first period featuring the Giants’ offense and the Lions’ defense came during a 7-on-7 period. I only watched part of it, trying to also take a peek at the OL/DL one-on-ones. The lack of pass-rush certainly benefits the offense in this period, but I’d say the Giants’ offense was efficient early on. They were able to move the ball a bit with some plays over the middle, and it felt like there were times Lions defenders didn’t tap a Giants’ ball carrier until they were into the second level.

After that, though, things certainly evened out. Here’s how I charted the first 11-on-11 period for Detroit’s starting defense.

Note: things happen fast during joint practices, so it’s possible something was missed with only one look at things. This is what I had written in my notes.

After some special teams work, the Giants’ starting offense was back at it against the Lions’ starters.

Jones pass tipped by Levi Onwuzurike at the line of scrimmage. Came around the edge as Jones stepped up in the pocket, tipped it from behind, which led to a floater that hung for a bit in the air, nearly picked off by Jack Campbell. Daboll was fuming at the play, arguing that Onwuzurike got way too close to Jones.

Singletary rush middle. Tackled by Barnes for a short gain. After the play, Anzalone and Giants G Greg Van Roten got into it, with Anzalone shoving Van Roten into the ground several times before being pushed aside. By the end of the play, even Jones was involved.

Overall, I think it’s fair to say the Giants won the 7-on-7 period against Detroit’s first-team defense. Too many guys open from what I saw (wasn’t charting it as I watched both the 7-on-7 and OL/DL drills partaking at the same time). But things certainly tightened up for the team periods. There were a lot of checkdowns and dump-offs leading to completions, but Detroit kept the yards after catch in check. I’d say the defense was well-positioned on some completed passes. I would’ve liked to see a bit more from Hutchinson and McNeill disrupt things a bit more in those team settings, but the quick/short game kind of took them out at times.

News, notes and observations

• Lions TE Sam LaPorta did not practice Monday. Campbell said he’s dealing with something that occurred last week and that he wouldn’t partake Monday.

• Lions DB Brian Branch was out there for individual periods and the 7-on-7 portion, but he’s not ready for a full team period yet.

• Lions CB Terrion Arnold left practice with trainers to be evaluated for a concussion. Arnold took on a block from Giants’ tackle Andrew Thomas, leading to a loud thud. Rakestraw entered the lineup in his absence.

• Lions RG Kevin Zeitler left practice and was evaluated for a shoulder injury. We’ll see what Campbell says on Tuesday.

• The two most impressive reps of the day in OL/DL drills were courtesy of Hutchinson and McNeill. Hutchinson used a vicious spin move to absolutely work his former Michigan teammate and Giants G Jalen Mayfield. McNeill, meanwhile, just completely obliterated Jake Kubas, a 2024 UDFA out of North Dakota State. Expected, but the pure strength on the play was impressive. It was like he wasn’t even trying.

• I watched Lions LB Malcolm Rodriguez run stride-for-stride downfield with RB Dante Miller for a PBU. Might’ve gotten away with a faceguard, but hey, it wasn’t called.

• Not exactly a hot take, but Nabers is gonna be good. He’s explosive after the catch, gets in and out of his breaks so efficiently and went up high for a jump ball vs. Melifonwu and nearly came down with it. The officials ruled him out of bounds as the ball bobbled a bit coming down, but man, he was right there. Campbell said the Lions “liked him a lot” coming out of the draft, but knew they were in no position to get him.

• Ennis Rakestraw Jr. got some first-team reps at nickel and outside cornerback on Monday. The Lions were rotating between Amik Robertson (who also played outside a little bit), Emmanuel Moseley and Rakestraw at nickel. Good sign for the rookie that he’s getting more looks with the ones. Most of his damage has come against the twos.

• Morice Norris is having an excellent camp. On one series, he got a hand on a pass intended for TE Tyree Jackson, recorded a sack against Giants backup QB Drew Lock and blew up a dump-off to a Giants’ back — knocking his helmet off and causing one of the many skirmishes as both sidelines cleared. Those three plays came on a five-play sequence.

• Even though Daboll didn’t like it, Onwuzurike’s tipped ball against the first-team offense was exactly what you want to see. He won his individual rep, got in the backfield and affected the play, leading to a near-turnover. Onwuzurike was also in the middle of a mix-up or two on Monday, so it appears he’s bringing that same intensity we’ve seen in Lions camp to New Jersey.

Calm Daboll has been replaced by game-day Daboll today. He has been fired up. He blew up on Lions DL Levi Onwuzurike for tipping a Daniel Jones pass from his hand. QBs are off limits in practice and Daboll didn’t appreciate how close Onwuzurike got to Jones. Daboll also very… — Dan Duggan (@DDuggan21) August 5, 2024

• Kyle Peko continues to rep over Brodric Martin, including plenty of first-team reps. He looks like he’s pushing to be part of the rotation — especially if DJ Reader isn’t ready to go to start the season. We’ll see if the Lions can make the numbers work.

• Mitchell Agude had a tipped pass and a pressure on plays I watched him. I wonder when he’s going to get more work against the starters. Feels like he’s earned that look.

• I wasn’t watching the Lions’ offense today, but I did chart its first offensive possession in the red zone. Goff completed a touchdown to Jameson Williams. Believe an 18-yard strike. After that, I had a Jahmyr Gibbs run stuffed (that led to more shoving — shocker). Then three straight incompletions to Brock Wright, Shane Zylstra and Amon-Ra St. Brown. Will focus more on the offense on Tuesday.

A fight is even more likely in joint practice situations when teams finally get to square off in a physical, competitive setting against members of another team.

The New York Giants and the Detroit Lions had several scuffles during their joint practice on Monday at Quest Diagnostics Training Center in East Rutherford, New Jersey in front of a crowd of fans. A multitude of separate instances where large groups of players were seen shoving one another and punches were even thrown between both teams.

New York Giants starting quarterback Daniel Jones was involved in one of the skirmishes, a sight that organizations and fans alike especially never want to see at practice. With Giants’ general manager Joe Schoen even getting in on one of the fights in an attempt to break up the altercations. Both of which can be seen below.

Schoen had seen enough of the scuffling between the two teams as well and tried his best to separate one of the fights. Coming off of the sidelines for one of the altercations alongside other staffers in an attempt to deescalate the situation. Which Lions head coach Dan Campbell did as well, a former player for the Giants who was selected in the third round of the 1999 NFL Draft with the No. 79 overall pick by New York.

“It’s always good to come back and I’ve said this before, I’ll say it again. I was drafted a Giant and I was here for four years, some of best friendships I had and still have are with those people that I played with here, my wife and I both,” Campbell said ahead of the joint practice. “And then the Mara family will always be special to me. Mr. Mayor, God rest his soul, was the best and and John Mara, I have a ton of respect for.”

“There’s a ton of people that are still here in the organization that I was with and so they’ll always be near and dear to my heart. And this place, it’s always going to give you that sense of what it was when you were here,” Campbell added. “So yeah, it’s special to be back and I appreciate being back and I appreciate the people in this organization very much. Because they gave me a go and I probably wouldn’t be here had it not been for them.”

Campbell’s players did not exactly have the same warm-heartedness for the Giants in the way their head coach did. But thankfully no players were injured during the various scuffles and the two teams will be able to square off for all to see in a preseason matchup on Thursday at MetLife Stadium."

NEW YORK -- After having their two-year run as national champions come to an end, the Georgia Bulldogs will open the season ranked No. 1 in the preseason USA Today Coaches Poll.

The Bulldogs received 46 of the 55 first-place votes from college football coaches in the poll released Monday. Preseason No. 2 Ohio State got seven votes at No. 1 and was followed by Oregon, Texas and Alabamain the top five.

The Associated Press preseason college football poll is scheduled to be released next Monday.

Texas and defending national champion Michigan each also got a first-place vote. The Wolverines will open ranked No. 8 after losing coach Jim Harbaugh and quarterback JJ McCarthy to the NFL.

The No. 6 ranking by the Ole Miss Rebels represents the program's highest preseason ranking in the coaches' poll since 1970. Notre Dame is No. 7, andPenn State and Florida Statefollow Michigan to round out the top 10.

The Southeastern Conference had nine teams in the poll, including half of the top 12, with Missouri at No. 11 and LSU at No. 12. It's the highest starting spot for SEC newcomer Texas since 2010 and the lowest for the Crimson Tide since 2009.

The Big Ten also had four teams in the top 10 and six ranked overall, and the Big 12 opens with five ranked teams.

Independent Notre Dame was the only team outside the Power 4 conferences that was ranked.

The University of Alabama football program is in a familiar spot for the first time since 2009.

USA Today unveiled its Top 25 Preseason Coaches Poll and Alabama debuts at No. 5.

Nick Saban had the Crimson Tide ranked in the same position heading into his third season as head coach. Alabama parlayed the moment into winning a Southeastern Conference Championship, a BCS National Championship, and crowning the school’s first-ever Heisman Trophy winner in Mark Ingram. Kalen DeBoer, the Tide’s new head coach, has his sights set on big things.

Two SEC schools are ahead of Alabama — Georgia and Texas — and the Crimson Tide plays the Bulldogs in week five of the regular season at Bryant-Denny Stadium. Alabama faces Georgia on Saturday, Sept. 28 coming off a bye week.

It could wind up battling Texas for an SEC Championship or meet the Longhorns in the College Football Playoff.

Alabama has its lowest preseason ranking since ’09, but that does not matter to DeBoer.

He wants this team focused on dominating fall camp in preparing for the season. National media has undervalued the Tide this summer; however, Alabama looks to show everyone it still runs college football in the fall.

The SEC led all conferences with nine of its 16 teams making the top 25, which was voted on by a panel of 55 FBS coaches. Georgia had 46 first-place votes, followed by Ohio State (seven), Texas (one) and reigning national champion Michigan (one). Missouri (No. 11), LSU (No. 12), Tennessee (No. 15), Oklahoma (No. 16) and Texas A&M (No. 20) also represent the SEC in the poll.

The Big Ten had four teams in the top 10, with Michigan (No. 8) and Penn State (No. 9) joining the Buckeyes and Ducks. Washington, last year’s national runner-up, received the most votes of teams outside the top 25.

The Big 12 had the third-most teams in the poll with five, with preseason conference championship favorite Utah being the highest among Big 12 teams at No. 13. Kansas State (No. 17), Oklahoma State (No. 18), Arizona (No. 21) and Kansas (No. 24) also made the rankings.

The ACC had four teams make the poll: Florida State (No. 10), Clemson (No. 14), Miami (No. 19) and NC State (No. 22).

All four power conferences officially expanded this summer via conference realignment. Six of the teams in the top 25 changed leagues: Oregon and USC (Pac-12 to Big Ten), Texas and Oklahoma (Big 12 to SEC) and Utah and Arizona (Pac-12 to Big 12). The former Pac-12, which is now down to only Oregon State and Washington State, would have placed four programs in the preseason poll.

No teams from Group of 5 conferences made the poll — Memphis was the closest, finishing fifth in the “others receiving votes” category. Boise State was sixth among those outside the poll, and Liberty, which received the Group of 5’s New Year’s Six bid last season, was 10th among “others receiving votes.”

Louisville, Virginia Tech, SMU, Auburn, West Virginia and Wisconsin were also among the top 10 teams that received votes but missed the top 25.

Who’s overrated? Who’s underrated?

Is it possible to say the No. 2 team is underrated? Ohio State has a loaded roster with plenty of returning talent and key transfer portal additions like running back Quinshon Judkins, safety Caleb Downs and quarterback Will Howard. Georgia’s recent championship history and Heisman Trophy favorite in quarterback Carson Beck certainly make the Bulldogs deserving of the No. 1 spot, but it was intriguing to see the Buckeyes get only seven first-place votes compared to Georgia’s 46.

Michigan, the reigning national champion, begins outside the top five but still in the top 10 as Sherrone Moore takes over for Jim Harbaugh. Washington, now led by Jedd Fisch after Kalen DeBoer took the Alabama job, missing the top 25 after playing for a national championship is a bit surprising. Fisch’s former team, Arizona, should be a Big 12 title contender with quarterback Noah Fifita and receiver Tetairoa McMillan returning.

Ole Miss’ No. 6 ranking is eye-opening, but the Rebels also had a productive offseason in the portal, landing impact players like Princely Umanmielen and Walter Nolen. They have also finished in the top 11 of the College Football Playoff rankings each of the last three years, signs of what Lane Kiffin is building in Oxford.

Missouri feels a bit underrated at No. 11. The Tigers finished in the top 10 last season and return quarterback Brady Cook and receiver Luther Burden III.

Alabama in the top five is no surprise given the program’s pedigree, but there’s less certainty in Tuscaloosa than normal after the offseason staff changes following Nick Saban’s retirement. The Crimson Tide’s No. 5 ranking is their lowest preseason ranking since 2009.

"Imane Khelif, Olympic boxer at center of gender dispute, calls for a gender equality debate.",https://time.com/7008028/iba-boxing-gender-controversy-paris-olympics/,"The International Boxing Association (IBA), which has spent these Olympics ripping the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and its president, Thomas Bach, and calling into question the gender eligibility of two boxers in the competition—igniting international controversy and exposing the boxers to torrents of online abuse—came to Paris this morning to hold a press conference in an ornate, airless ballroom with mirrors and a cracked ceiling. The task at hand, supposedly, was to provide documentary evidence that Imane Khelif of Algeria and Lin Yu-Ting of Chinese Taipei, who through a pair of preliminary-round victories are now assured at least a bronze medal at the Paris Games, do not belong in the women’s boxing category. Khelif fights in her 66-kg semifinal match, against Janjaem Suwannapheng of Thailand, on Tuesday. Yu-Ting faces Esra Yildiz Kahraman of Turkey in a 57-kg Wednesday semifinal bout.

If anything, the IBA threw even more confusion into the mix—and is likely to expose Khelif and Yu-Ting to more animosity. And if the organization was trying to boost its bona fides and prove it should be running boxing in the Olympics, the IBA failed miserably on that front.

First of all, this rogue press event—held during the heat of competition, overshadowing exploits on the field of play—started about an hour late, with no official explanation granted. There was chirping that Umar Kremlev, the president of the IBA, was going to make a surprise appearance remotely, and technicians were working on the Russian translation capabilities. The three principals who were slated to speak – IBA Secretary General and CEO Chris Roberts; Dr. Ioannis Filippatos, president of the European Union Boxing Committee and former chair of the IBA’s medical committee; and IBA coaches-committee chairman Gabriele Martelli – were all seated and looked ready to get going. “Guys, you are wasting our time, my god!” a German reporter shouted.

No one disagreed with that assessment.

Kremlev finally appeared on an electronic screen behind the live speakers. But no one could hear him as he spoke, a 2020-era Zoom issue (maybe he was muted). Twice during the approximately 90-minute session of filibustering, chaotic press questioning, and overall unpleasantness, the microphone feedback sent shudders through the hearts of the some 100 reporters packed into a sweaty room. AV errors aside, the more serious problem was the messaging.

Roberts, for example, started out claiming that the IBA didn’t want to overshadow the Olympics and was only touching down in Paris because of Khelif’s victory last week over Angela Carini of Italy: Carini withdrew after 46 seconds; the controversy exploded from there.

That argument felt specious, since Kremlev had been trying to draw attention to Khelif and Yu-Ting and their supposed ineligibility well before the Games, and many journalists, and a portion of the public, were attuned to it. He told a Russian news agency in 2023 that unspecified tests “proved” that they “had XY chromosomes and were thus excluded from sports events.” This included the IBA’s 2023 Women's World Boxing Championships in New Delhi, from which the organization disqualified the two boxers.

After the opening ceremonies on July 26, Kremlev wrote on X that “the 2024 Olympic Games are outright sodomy and the destruction of traditional values throughout the world and Thomas Bach is responsible for this.”

Today Kremlev offered an opening “statement” that was a rambling, nearly 20-minute bizarre airing of grievances. Rather than address the subject at hand, he started by criticizing the opening ceremonies, an event in everyone’s rearview mirror. “As a Christian, the Olympic opening ceremony was something horrible,” he said in Russian through an interpreter. “It was horrible for Christians and Muslim people around the world, all people with a spiritual life.” He argued that Khelif and Yu-Ting’s participation in the Olympics was unfair. “Today we are destroying sport, especially feminine sport,” he said. He went on to claim Bach was corrupt, held himself and the IBA as women’s-rights crusaders—all four press-conference speakers were male—and said the IBA, unlike the IOC, was a true democratic, transparent organization (the IOC has said it stripped the IBA of its governing authority, in part, due to its lack of transparency regarding its financial ties to Gazprom, the Russian state-owned energy company. The IBA said it ended its relationship with Gazprom in 2023. Kremlev said on Monday that he had nothing to hide.)

Kremlev seemed hung up on the prize money he said he would be offering the women defeated by Khelif and Yu-Ting at the Olympics, and accused the IOC of hoarding revenues and failing to distribute them to athletes. He returned to knocking the opening ceremonies and Bach and continued to brandish his role as equality and fairness advocate.

“It was a chaotic farce,” IOC spokesperson Mark Adams wrote to TIME in an email, in response to questions about the organization’s response to Kremlev and the IBA. “The organization and the content of this press conference tells you everything you need to know about their governance and credibility.”

Filippatos brandished his credentials as a gynecologist and in-vitro fertilization specialist and argued that science clearly defines biological sex, despite evidence to the contrary. Medicine, he said, “is not opinion. I know who is woman and man.” He and Kremlev both implied that Khelif and Yu-Ting could be transgender athletes, despite assertions from both athletes’ camps that they are not, that they were born as women and grew up as women.

“It may be transgender women,” said Kremlev through an interpreter. “Maybe not.” Kremlev said it was up to Khelif and Tu-Ting to prove that they were women, saying that he, for example, could produce documents to “prove I was a real man, not a woman.”

Reporters shouted over one another and threw out questions about the salaries of IBA members and potential political alignments with right-wing politicians in Italy. At no time during the disorganized, frustrating gathering did any IBA member express a shred of sympathy for the online bullying and abuse that Khelif and Yu-Ting have faced.

I finally got a chance to ask Kremlev for his message to the women. At first, he said he didn’t understand the question. I tried again. He didn’t really answer it. He said Algeria and Taiwan were great countries. He fell back on the rules-are-rules canard And he noted that the athletes had high testosterone levels, “like a man.” (The IBA previously said the athletes did not undergo a testosterone exam.) He said he didn’t know these two boxers personally and that the IBA would be ready to offer psychological services if needed (why would the boxers possibly go to the organization causing them heartache for help?).

Kremlev said he was “not here to say they’re bad, others are good. We want people to abide by the rules, that’s all.”

In all, despite the buildup, the IBA didn’t offer much new. Despite the officials claiming repeatedly that the test results are private, Roberts gave a timeline of testing for the Khelif and Yu-Ting and promised documentation. As of Wednesday night in Paris, the documentation hasn’t been posted to the IBA website, as press rep assured TIME would happen.

Some exasperated reporters left early. Khelif’s fellow Algerian Olympic boxer, Roumaysa Boualam, entered the room as the press conference was wrapped in the Algerian flag and shouted her support for Khelif in protest of the IBA.

There’s a very fair discussion to be had about gender participation in sports. It’s a nuanced, difficult subject. This was not the way to do it. By coming to Paris and adding to an already combustible situation, the IBA failed Khelif and Yu-Ting. It failed all athletes, really. It certainly failed itself."
"Imane Khelif, Olympic boxer at center of gender dispute, calls for a gender equality debate.",https://www.crosswalk.com/slideshows/5-key-questions-and-answers-about-the-olympic-boxing-gender-controversy.html,"2. Are Khelif and Lin men?

Slide 2 of 5

This is the heart of the controversy.

Umar Kremlev, a Russian and the president of the International Boxing Association (IBA), was reported in Russian media last year as saying “DNA testing” had shown Khelif and Lin “have XY chromosomes” -- that is, male chromosomes.

Both Khelif and Lin were stripped of their wins at the 2023 IBA Women’s World Boxing Championships. (Khelif had advanced to the gold medal match but was pulled from the tournament before fighting in that round; Lin was stripped of a bronze medal.)

The IBA later released a statement stating, “The athletes did not undergo a testosterone examination but were subject to a separate and recognized test, whereby the specifics remain confidential.”

The International Olympic Committee, though, says both boxers are female. The IOC released a statement last week saying: “As with previous Olympic boxing competitions, the gender and age of the athletes are based on their passport.”

“We have seen in reports misleading information about two female athletes competing at the Olympic Games Paris 2024,” the IOC said. “The two athletes have been competing in international boxing competitions for many years in the women’s category, including the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, International Boxing Association (IBA) World Championships and IBA-sanctioned tournaments.”

The IOC added, “These two athletes were the victims of a sudden and arbitrary decision by the IBA. Towards the end of the IBA World Championships in 2023, they were suddenly disqualified without any due process.”

There is no record of either boxer ever competing as a male.

The IBA previously oversaw boxing in the Olympics. However, due to various issues related to governance, financial management, and judging integrity, the IOC suspended the IBA’s recognition in 2019 and eventually decided to cut ties completely in 2023. The IOC took over the management of boxing for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics (held in 2021) and continued to do so for the Paris 2024 Games. Meanwhile, about three dozen nations have left IBA to form a new organization, World Boxing, in hopes of keeping boxing in the Olympics in 2028.

“We have two boxers who are born as a woman, who have been raised a woman, who have a passport as a woman, and who have competed for many years as women,” said IOC President Thomas Bach.”

And this is the clear definition of a woman. There was never any doubt about them being a woman.”

Some observers have speculated that Khelif and Lin could be DSD (Differences in Sex Development), whereby they would have female genitalia but male chromosomes. That, though, is merely conjecture.

Meanwhile, Khelif’s father presented a birth certificate to media members in recent days showing she was born female.

“Imane is a little girl that has loved sport since she was six years old; she used to play football,” Amar Khelif said. “These critics and rumors aim to destabilize Imane; they don’t want her to be the champion of the world.”

Other observers dismiss Kremlev’s claims and Russian media altogether, noting that Russia has a history of doping scandals and systematic cheating in sports, which undermines the credibility of their claims. Russia, for example, was banned from the Olympics of 2018, 2020, and 2022 due to the fallout of a doping scandal. (Days prior to Khelif’s disqualification, she had defeated a previously unbeaten Russian boxer; her disqualification meant that the Russian boxer was undefeated once again.)

Kremlev, though, stands by his claim.

“I do not understand why they kill women’s boxing,” he said of the IOC. “Only eligible athletes should compete in the ring for the sake of safety.”

On Monday, the IBA held a news conference where IBA Chief Executive Chris Roberts said the organization could not release the test results but that the public could “read between the lines.”

“The results of the chromosome tests demonstrated both boxers were ineligible,” Roberts said.

"Imane Khelif, Olympic boxer at center of gender dispute, calls for a gender equality debate.",https://nz.news.yahoo.com/boston-globe-apologizes-headline-error-153134361.html,"The Boston Globe apologized for a headline that said Algerian Olympic boxer Imane Khelif was transgender ― as controversy swirled around unsubstantiated claims that she is a man.

“Transgender boxer advances,” the newspaper headline read on Friday, referring to her win over Italy’s Angela Carini.

Khelif has since clinched a medal in the Paris Games, but accusations that she was born a man have generated online hate toward her.

She was born a woman and has fought as a woman for years, including the previous Olympics. But an unspecified “gender eligibility test” conducted by a suspect oversight organization led to her being disqualified from the 2023 world championships.

The headline that the Globe wrote for her Olympics bout in Paris on Thursday appeared on top of an Associated Press story by Greg Beacham that properly identified Khelif as a woman.

“A significant error was made in a headline on a story ... about Algerian boxer Imane Khelif incorrectly describing her as transgender. She is not. Additionally, our initial correction of this error neglected to note that she was born female,” the Globe wrote in its correction on Saturday. “We recognize the magnitude of this mistake and have corrected it. This editing lapse is regrettable and unacceptable and we apologize to Khelif, to Associated Press writer Greg Beacham, and to you, our readers.

Khelif has called for the bullying to end.

Noting Khelif and a Taiwanese boxer facing the same scrutiny, IOC President Thomas Bach said previously:

“We have two boxers who are born as a woman, who have been raised a woman, who have a passport as a woman, and who have competed for many years as women. And this is the clear definition of a woman. There was never any doubt about them being a woman.”

This led to a heated debate on social media. Many accuse the Algerian boxer of being male or transgender, calling it unfair to women’s sports. J.K. Rowling and Elon Musk also joined the debate, questioning the decision made by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Simultaneously, several childhood pictures of Algerian boxer Imane Khelif surfaced on social media, aiming to prove that she is female.

Along with Khelif, Taiwan’s double world champion Lin Yu-ting was cleared to compete in Paris despite both being disqualified at the 2023 World Championships after failing the International Boxing Association (IBA) gender eligibility tests.

Why is Khelif at the center of the controversy? What is the current IOC criteria for determining gender? What is the dispute between the IBA and IOC? How will the Olympic matches unfold in the coming days?

"Imane Khelif, Olympic boxer at center of gender dispute, calls for a gender equality debate.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/08/03/olympics-boxing-imane-khelif-woman/,"VILLEPINTE, France — After the referee raised Imane Khelif’s hand here Saturday afternoon, declaring the Algerian boxer the winner of her quarterfinal bout and clinching her an Olympic medal, Khelif fell to her knees, shouting and crying. Then she punched the Olympic rings in the middle of the canvas. Whether the blow was out of joy or rage was difficult to discern. In a week, Khelif had gone from a little-known amateur fighter to the center of an online furor engulfing the Paris Games.

Khelif and Taiwan’s Lin Yu Ting were disqualified from last year’s International Boxing Association world championships after the organization alleged without evidence that tests revealed the women, who are not transgender, had XY chromosomes, suggesting they may have a testosterone-based advantage over other women fighters.

The International Olympic Committee, which severed ties with the IBA last year and is running the boxing competition at these Games, has said the fighters meet its eligibility requirements, which require boxers to fight in the gender category that matches how they are identified on their passports.

So Khelif fought. And because Olympic boxing gives bronze medals to both losing semifinalists, her unanimous decision over Hungary’s Anna Luca Hamori meant that whatever happens in her semifinal bout Tuesday, she will go home with a medal. When this was clear, she couldn’t stop crying.

She cried as hundreds of Algerian fans, waving flags and shouting her name, stomped on the steel stands inside this makeshift arena inside an airport convention hall. She cried as she walked out of the ring and under the stands. She cried as she walked into the interview area behind the bleachers, where dozens of television reporters shouted questions in Arabic, and she occasionally screamed answers in return. She even cried as her coaches led her past at least 100 reporters who had gathered to ask her questions, too.

Khelif beat Hamori soundly. But both women exchanged strong blows, and there was nothing like the one punch that made Khelif’s first opponent, Italy’s Angela Carini, quit less than a minute into their fight Thursday. That punch landed hard and in the process ignited a storm of rhetoric from former president Donald Trump, author J.K. Rowling and an army of online anti-transgender activists. On Saturday, Khelif won each of the bout’s three rounds by landing her swings more consistently.

In the days before the fight, Hamori herself stirred the controversy, sharing an Instagram post showing an image of a female boxer facing off against a muscled monster with horns, according to screenshots from her account published by French media outlet Le Parisien. (The Instagram story was no longer visible by Saturday afternoon.)

Not long after Khelif walked through the interview area in tears, though, Hamori’s tenor had changed. A Hungarian sports official grabbed a microphone in the area and said Hungarian officials believe the IOC will make the right decisions when looking at the future of Olympic boxing, Then Hamori took the microphone.

“I’m so proud of myself,” she said. “That was my childhood dream. So I am so happy, and I wish good luck to my opponents and the others in the finals.”

Christian Klaue, the IOC’s public affairs director, later said he had talked with Hungary’s Olympic media directors about changing the rhetoric around the boxers.

“It has been fine in boxing ... for the last 50 or 60 years,” Klaue said. “And now in three days it seems to be an issue, which is beyond reasonable looking at the reaction socially. But the reaction on social media is not because of the issue but because of this topic being so polarized.”

The IOC and IBA are embroiled in a long-standing fight over control of Olympic boxing. The IOC’s decision last summer to strip the IBA of its Olympic governance authority, combined with the IOC’s decision to ban Russia from competition here, has fueled suspicion that IBA president Umar Kremlev, a Russian sports power broker, is seeking to disrupt the Games.

Late Friday night, Kremlev said in a statement that he will pay prize money to the boxers who lost their opening-round bouts to the fighters at the Paris Games. The IBA says it typically pays Olympic gold medalists $100,000. Kremlev said he would pay that amount to Carini and Uzbekistan’s Sitora Turdibekova, who lost to Lin on Friday.

Kremlev’s prize-money offer was not well received by IOC President Thomas Bach, who has been the target of raging social media posts from Kremlev. Russia and the IBA “have undertaken … before these Games, a defamation campaign against France, against the Games, against the IOC,” Bach said during a news conference here Saturday morning.

IOC officials initially tried to sidestep questions about the boxers’ presence at the Olympics. But they have turned up their rhetoric in recent days as anti-transgender activists seized the issue and news coverage followed.

IOC officials said the two women are not transgender and never faced questions about their gender or testosterone levels before the IBA disqualifications. The IOC and other sports officials have said they have never been given information about the tests the IBA said it performed or what standard the IBA said the boxers failed to meet."
"Imane Khelif, Olympic boxer at center of gender dispute, calls for a gender equality debate.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/olympics/2024/08/05/imane-khelif-iba-explain-olympics-gender-row-boxer-live/,"The boxing governing body at the centre of the Olympics gender row branded the two athletes “men” in a shambolic Paris press conference that undermined its credibility.

“We don’t verify what they have between their legs”, said Umar Kremlev, the International Boxing Association’s president, in an ill-advised outburst as he launched into a series of wild tirades. Kremlev, whose body still receives financial backing from Russian state-owned Gazprom, also upped the ante in his war with the International Olympic Committee by standing by his slur that Thomas Bach is a “sodomite”.

Appearing an hour late via video-link from Moscow, Kremlev had been addressing the IBA’s expulsion of Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting last year. The pair are now both certain of medals as women in Paris despite being ruled ineligible by tests carried out by the IBA in 2022 and 2023.

“The tests show they were men,” said Kremlev in Russian, after it was explained that the pair were among four boxers who were initially suspected of being male. “We don’t verify what they have between their legs. We don’t know if they were born like that, or if some changes were made. The second tests confirmed the first tests. If people have doubts, refer to them. They can make their own tests.”

With boxing in crisis, the IBA had been attempting to reinforce its credibility in front of a packed room of journalists, but were questioned over apparent inconsistencies after Kremlev talked of “raised testosterone” while others talked of sex chromosome tests. One test in India last year and a prior test in Turkey in May 2022 “concluded the boxer’s DNA was that of a male consisting of XY chromosomes,” according to IBA correspondence sent to the International Olympic Committee in June 2023.

Khelif had earlier said the furore was having “massive effects” as she called for restraint. “I send a message to all the people of the world to uphold the Olympic principles and the Olympic Charter, to refrain from bullying all athletes, because this has effects,” she said."

Algerian women's boxer Imane Khelif has bravely taken a stand against the hateful critics amid the engulfing controversy at the Paris Olympics, particularly focusing on the intense scrutiny regarding her gender.

The athlete's story and her fight for respect and recognition are capturing attention as she vies for the coveted Olympic gold. Khelif was met with criticism after dominating Italian opponent Angela Carini in a brief but decisive 66-kilogram class bout that lasted a mere 46 seconds before Carini retreated to her corner, signaling the end of the match at the North Paris Arena.

Despite securing herself a medal and making strides in Paris, Khelif is dealing with backlash that has left the 25-year-old boxer feeling wounded by the debate. In an emotionally charged interview with SNTV on Sunday night, delivered in Arabic, Khelif passionately condemned the toxic rhetoric about her gender, calling it ""harmful to human dignity.""

She implored the global community to embrace the true spirit of the Olympics, urging: ""I send a message to all the people of the world to uphold the Olympic principles and the Olympic Charter, to refrain from bullying all athletes, because this has effects, massive effects.""

Elaborating on the damage caused by such negativity, she stated: ""It can destroy people, it can kill people's thoughts, spirit, and mind. It can divide people. And because of that, I ask them to refrain from bullying.""

Controversy is not new to Khelif; back in 2023, she failed a gender eligibility test despite being a biological female and, along with fellow boxer Lin Yu-Ting, was banned from the 2023 World Championships overseen by the International Boxing Association. Despite these setbacks, the International Olympic Committee gave Khelif the green light to compete in the current Olympic Games.

She had been a regular competitor in IBA events for several years without any issues until she was suddenly suspended from last year's world championships. The Russian-dominated body, which has been at odds with the IOC for years, has declined to share any details about the tests.

After her victory over Hungary's Anna Luca Hamori on Saturday, Khelif made her way to the center of the ring, waved to her ecstatic fans, knelt down, and slammed her palm on the canvas. Her smile slowly disappeared as she became overwhelmed by her emotions.

""I couldn't control my nerves,"" Khelif admitted. ""Because after the media frenzy and after the victory, there was a mix of joy and at the same time, I was greatly affected, because honestly, it wasn't an easy thing to go through at all. It was something that harms human dignity.""

Taiwan's Lin has also secured an Olympic medal amidst the controversy surrounding unproven allegations about her gender. Khelif hinted that the stress and agony of the scandal combined with the competition has been challenging, especially when she is so far away from home.

""I am in contact with my family two days a week. I hope that they weren't affected deeply,"" Khelif added. ""They are worried about me. God willing, this crisis will culminate in a gold medal, and that would be the best response.""

When questioned about undergoing any tests beyond doping ones, Khelif chose not to respond. She then thanked the IOC for their support and insisted that no accusations would deter her from pursuing Algeria's first Olympic gold in women's boxing.

"Imane Khelif, Olympic boxer at center of gender dispute, calls for a gender equality debate.",https://www.inkl.com/news/watch-live-international-boxing-association-holds-press-conference-amidst-paris-olympics-gender-debate,"Watch as the International Boxing Association (IBA) holds a press conference in Paris on Monday 5 August as the gender debate continues at the Olympic Games boxing tournament.

Algerian boxer Imane Khelif and Taiwan’s double world champion Lin Yu-ting are at the centre of the controversy, after both were cleared to compete in Paris despite having been disqualified during the 2023 World Championships after the IBA said they had failed a gender eligibility test.

Over the weekend, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said the gender tests conducted by the IBA were illegitimate and lacked credibility.

The testing process at that 2023 event, which only came towards the end of the competition after the boxers had already fought several bouts, was completely arbitrary, the IOC said.

The IOC last year stripped the IBA of its status as boxing’s governing body over governance and finance issues, taking charge of the Paris Games boxing competition and applying eligibility rules from the 2016 and the 2021 Olympics.

Khelif’s dominance in Thursday’s round-of-16 welterweight fight against Angela Carini, who withdrew after 46 seconds following a barrage of punches from the Algerian, triggered a furore that swept social media.

Both Khelif and Lin have now reached the semi-finals in their weight categories in Paris."

(AP Photo/Vadim Ghirda)

PARIS (AP) — Olympic boxer Imane Khelif said the wave of hateful scrutiny she has faced over misconceptions about her gender “harms human dignity,” and she called for an end to bullying athletes after being greatly affected by the international backlash against her.

The Algerian athlete spoke about her tumultuous Olympic experience on Sunday night in an interview with SNTV, a sports video partner of The Associated Press.

“I send a message to all the people of the world to uphold the Olympic principles and the Olympic Charter, to refrain from bullying all athletes, because this has effects, massive effects,” Khelif said in Arabic. ""It can destroy people, it can kill people’s thoughts, spirit and mind. It can divide people. And because of that, I ask them to refrain from bullying.”

The victories of Khelif and fellow boxer Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan in the ring in Paris have become one of the biggest stories of the Paris Games. Both women have clinched their first Olympic medals even as they have faced online abuse based on unsubstantiated claims about their gender, drawing them into a wider divide over changing attitudes toward gender identity and regulations in sports.

The 25-year-old Khelif acknowledged the pressure and pain of enduring this ordeal while competing far from home in the most important event of her athletic career.

“I am in contact with my family two days a week. I hope that they weren’t affected deeply,” she said. “They are worried about me. God willing, this crisis will culminate in a gold medal, and that would be the best response.”

The vitriol stems from claims by the International Boxing Association, which has been permanently banned from the Olympics, that both Khelif and Lin failed unspecified eligibility tests for the women’s competition at last year’s world championships.

Khelif declined to answer when asked whether she had undergone tests other than doping tests, saying she didn’t want to talk about it.

She expressed gratitude to the International Olympic Committee and its president, Thomas Bach, for standing resolutely behind her while the banned former governing body of Olympic boxing stoked a furor around her participation in Paris.

“I know that the Olympic Committee has done me justice, and I am happy with this remedy because it shows the truth,” she said.

She also has seen massive support at her bouts, drawing cheers when she enters the arena and crowds waving Algerian flags chanting her first name. She will fight again Tuesday in the women's 66-kilogram semifinals at Roland Garros.

Khelif repeatedly made clear she won't allow chatter or accusations to deter her from attempting to claim Algeria's first Olympic gold medal in women's boxing.

“I don’t care about anyone’s opinion,” Khelif said a day after beating Anna Luca Hamori of Hungary. “I came here for a medal, and to compete for a medal. I will certainly be competing to improve (and) be better, and God willing, I will improve, like every other athlete.”

Although she is aware of the worldwide discussion about her, Khelif said she has been somewhat removed.

“Honestly, I don’t follow social media,"" she said. “There is a mental health team that doesn’t let us follow social media, especially in the Olympic Games, whether me or other athletes. I’m here to compete and get a good result.”

Khelif started her Olympic run last Thursday with a victory over Angela Carini of Italy, who abandoned the bout after just 46 seconds. Carini later said she regretted her decision and wished to apologize to Khelif.

That unusual ending raised the chatter around Khelif into a roar, drawing comments from the likes of former U.S. President Donald Trump, “Harry Potter” writer J.K. Rowling and others falsely claiming Khelif was a man or transgender.

The IOC repeatedly declared her and Lin qualified to participate in the Olympics, and it has decried the murky testing standards and untransparent governance of the IBA, which was banished entirely from the Olympics last year in an unprecedented punishment for a governing body.

Khelif clearly felt the weight of the worldwide scrutiny upon her, and her victory over Hamori on Saturday appeared to be cathartic. After the referee raised Khelif's hand with the win, she went to the center of the ring, waved to her fans, knelt and slammed her palm on the canvas, her smile turning to tears.

“I couldn’t control my nerves,"" Khelif said in the interview. ""Because after the media frenzy and after the victory, there was a mix of joy and at the same time, I was greatly affected, because honestly, it wasn’t an easy thing to go through at all. It was something that harms human dignity.”

She had competed in IBA events for several years without problems until she was abruptly suspended from last year's world championships. The Russian-dominated body — which has faced years of clashes with the IOC — has refused to provide any information about the tests.

Algeria’s national boxing federation is still an IBA member.

Khelif is from rural northwestern Algeria, and she grew up playing soccer until she fell in love with boxing. Overcoming her father’s initial objections, she traveled 10 kilometers (about 6 miles) by bus to train for fights in a neighboring town.

After reaching the sport’s top level in her late teens, she struggled early in her career before reaching an elite level. Khelif has been a solid, if unspectacular, international competitor for six years, and she lost to eventual gold medalist Kellie Harrington of Ireland at the Tokyo Olympics.

Khelif’s next bout in Paris is against Janjaem Suwannapheng of Thailand. If Khelif wins again, she will fight for a gold medal Friday.

“Yes, this issue involves the dignity and honor of every woman and female,” she told an Algerian broadcaster in brief remarks Sunday after beating Hamori. “The Arab population has known me for years and has seen me box in the IBA that wronged me (and) treated me unfairly, but I have God on my side.”

Imane Khelif has been at the centre of controversy at the Paris Olympics since her second round opponent Angela Carini of Italy quit after just 46 seconds.

Khelif was disqualified from the 2023 world championships after failing an unspecified gender eligibility test, and her presence at the Paris Olympics has become a divisive issue

Here's all you need to know about Khelif and the controversy:

Who is Imane Khelif?

Imane Khelif is a 25-year-old female boxer from Algeria. Khelif is from the rural northwestern part of the country and was one of Algeria’s first three Olympic women’s boxers sent to Tokyo three years ago. She won her opening contest over Tunisian Mariem Homrani but lost her quarter-final bout to eventual gold medalist Kellie Harrington.

What has Khelif achieved?

Khelif is an accomplished amateur who won a silver medal at the International Boxing Association’s (IBA) world championships in 2022. She has also achieved Gold medals at the 2022 African Championships, the 2022 Mediterranean Championships, and the 2023 Arab Games. Khelif currently holds a record of 43 wins and 9 losses thus far.

Why was she disqualified from the World Championships?



Khelif reached the final of the 2023 World Championships and was disqualified by the IBA before the fight could take place as the governing body said Khelif had elevated levels of testosterone in her system.

The Algerian had competed at the World Championships before, winning the silver medal without any issue but was disqualified by the governing body after she defeated undefeated Russian boxer Azalia Amineva en route to the final.

The IBA is controlled by Umar Kremlev, who is Russian and brought in the state-owned energy supplier Gazprom as its primary sponsor and moved much of the governing body’s operations to Russia. The circumstances of that disqualification have been considered peculiar with Khelif calling the situation “a big conspiracy”. As a result of the disqualification, Amineva had her undefeated record restored.

How Khelif was allowed to compete at the Olympics?

Khelif was assigned female at birth and it says so on her passport, which is the International Olympic Committee’s threshold for eligibility for boxing because of the rift between the sport’s governing body and the IOC.

Khelif was born a female and therefore carries a passport that states as such, which is the entry-level threshold for the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) eligibility for women's boxing.

The IOC has come out In support of Khelif, stating that she is not transgender, and had criticised the tests that the IBA conducted. The governing body of boxing has revealed little about the nature of the tests, including what was tested and who tested it. This lack of transparency would be unacceptable in major Olympic sports, and the IBA was stripped of its status as the governing body for boxing by the IOC last year because it failed to complete reforms on governance, finance, and ethical issues.

A similar situation happened to South African runner Caster Semenya, a biological woman who won gold in the London 2012 and Rio 2016 Olympics but was later barred by the IOC from competing due to a new testosterone regulation.

What is the controversy surrounding Khelif in Paris?

In the second round of the women's 66kg division, Khelif defeated Angela Carini on Thursday, with the Italian boxer quitting after just 46 seconds, portraying Khelif as an unstoppable force that threatens the health of her opponents. Carini would exclaim that ""It's not fair!"" after a particularly hard punch from the Algerian. Khelif received online backlash from those who questioned her gender as a result of this.

Carini has since apologised to Khelif over the situation via the Italian newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport, stating that ""all this controversy makes me sad...I'm sorry for my opponent, too. If the IOC said she can fight, I respect that decision.""

No medical evidence that Khelif has XY chromosomes or elevated levels of testosterone has been published.

When is Khelif's next fight in Paris?

After her win over Hungary's Luca Hámori which guaranteed her at least a Bronze medal from Paris, Khelif will next appear in the ring on Tuesday, August 6 where she'll face Thailand's Janjaem Suwannapheng in the semi-finals.

""It can destroy people, it can kill people’s thoughts, spirit and mind. It can divide people. And because of that, I ask them to refrain from bullying.”Khelif and Lin Yu-ting , a boxer from Taiwan, have achieved remarkable success at the Paris Games, securing their maiden Olympic medals. However, their triumphs have been overshadowed by a storm of online harassment stemming from allegations regarding their gender.The controversy has thrust them into the center of a broader debate concerning evolving perceptions of gender identity and the rules governing sports competitions.At the age of 25, Khelif has openly recognized the immense strain and anguish caused by this experience, which has unfolded while she competes on the world stage, far from the comfort of her homeland, in the most significant competition of her sporting journey.“I am in contact with my family two days a week. I hope that they weren’t affected deeply,” she said. “They are worried about me. God willing, this crisis will culminate in a gold medal, and that would be the best response.”The International Boxing Association, which has been permanently excluded from the Olympics, has made allegations that Khelif and Lin did not meet certain undisclosed eligibility requirements for the women's tournament at the previous year's world championships, leading to widespread criticism and hostility.When questioned about whether she had undergone any tests apart from doping tests, Khelif chose not to respond, preferring to avoid discussing the matter.Khelif conveyed her appreciation to the International Olympic Committee and its president, Thomas Bach, for their unwavering support amidst the controversy surrounding her participation in the Paris Olympics, which was fueled by the banned former governing body of Olympic boxing.“I know that the Olympic Committee has done me justice, and I am happy with this remedy because it shows the truth,” she said.Khelif has experienced an outpouring of support during her fights, with spectators cheering her entrance into the arena and waving Algerian flags while chanting her name.Her next bout is scheduled for Tuesday in the women's 66-kilogram semifinals.The boxer has emphasized that she remains focused on her goal and will not be distracted by rumors or allegations. Khelif is determined to secure Algeria 's inaugural Olympic gold medal in women's boxing, refusing to let any external factors hinder her pursuit of this historic achievement.“I don’t care about anyone’s opinion,” Khelif said a day after beating Anna Luca Hamori of Hungary. “I came here for a medal, and to compete for a medal. I will certainly be competing to improve (and) be better, and God willing, I will improve, like every other athlete.”“Honestly, I don’t follow social media,"" she said. “There is a mental health team that doesn’t let us follow social media, especially in the Olympic Games, whether me or other athletes. I’m here to compete and get a good result.”Imane Khelif's Olympic journey commenced last Thursday with a triumph over Italy's Angela Carini, who withdrew from the match after a mere 46 seconds. Carini subsequently expressed remorse for her choice and desired to extend an apology to Khelif.This peculiar conclusion amplified the discussions surrounding Khelif, eliciting remarks from individuals such as former U.S. President Donald Trump, 'Harry Potter' writer JK Rowling, and others who erroneously asserted that Khelif was a man or transgender.The IOC consistently affirmed the eligibility of both her and Lin to compete in the Olympics. Moreover, it denounced the ambiguous testing criteria and lack of transparency in the governance of the IBA, which faced an unprecedented reprimand last year by being completely excluded from the Olympics.Khelif evidently sensed the immense global attention directed towards her, and her success against Hamori on Saturday seemed to provide a sense of relief.Following the referee's declaration of Khelif's victory, she proceeded to the ring's center, acknowledged her supporters, knelt down and forcefully struck the canvas with her palm, as her smile transformed into tears.“I couldn’t control my nerves,"" Khelif said in the interview. ""Because after the media frenzy and after the victory, there was a mix of joy and at the same time, I was greatly affected, because honestly, it wasn’t an easy thing to go through at all. It was something that harms human dignity.”Khelif had been participating in IBA events without any issues for several years until she was unexpectedly suspended from the previous year's world championships.The IBA, which is dominated by Russians and has a history of conflicts with the IOC, has not provided any details regarding the tests that led to her suspension.Despite the suspension, Algeria's national boxing federation remains a member of the IBA.Khelif, who hails from a rural area in northwestern Algeria, initially played football before discovering her passion for boxing. Despite her father's initial resistance, she would travel 10 kilometers (about 6 miles) by bus to attend training sessions in a nearby town.Although she faced challenges early in her career, Khelif eventually reached an elite level in her late teens. She has been a consistent, albeit not exceptional, competitor on the international stage for six years. At the Tokyo Olympics, she was defeated by Ireland's Kellie Harrington, who went on to win the gold medal.Khelif's next match in Paris is against Thailand's Janjaem Suwannapheng. If she emerges victorious, she will compete for the gold medal on Friday.“Yes, this issue involves the dignity and honor of every woman and female,” she told an Algerian broadcaster in brief remarks Sunday after beating Hamori. “The Arab population has known me for years and has seen me box in the IBA that wronged me (and) treated me unfairly, but I have God on my side.”"
"Imane Khelif, Olympic boxer at center of gender dispute, calls for a gender equality debate.",https://www.ibtimes.co.in/algerian-boxer-khelif-makes-historic-win-amid-gender-eligibility-debate-870838,"In a historic moment for Algerian sports, boxer Imane Khelif has secured herself an Olympic medal in the women's 66kg category at the Paris Olympics, becoming the first woman from her country to achieve this milestone. However, her victory has been overshadowed by a gender eligibility debate that has sparked controversy and online abuse. Khelif's victory over Hungary's Anna Luca Hamori not only secured Algeria's first boxing medal since 2000 but also secured her place into the semi-finals, where she will face Thailand's Janjaem Suwannapheng.

Khelif and Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-ting have found themselves at the center of a gender eligibility debate due to differing eligibility criteria set by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Boxing Association (IBA). Both athletes were disqualified from last year's World Championships by the IBA following unspecified eligibility tests but were cleared to compete in the Paris Olympics under IOC rules. This discrepancy has led to scrutiny and online abuse, prompting Khelif to call for an end to the bullying and negative rhetoric.

In an interview with SNTV, Khelif expressed her concerns about the impact of such bullying on athletes. It can destroy people, it can kill people's thoughts, spirit, and mind. It can divide people. And because of that, I ask them to refrain from bullying, she said. She also expressed her hope that her journey would culminate in a gold medal and thanked the IOC and its president, Thomas Bach, for their support.

Meanwhile, Lin Yu-ting, who will compete against Turkey's Esra Yildiz in the women's 57kg semifinal, has also been embroiled in the controversy. Following her unanimous decision victory over Bulgaria's Svetlana Kamenova Staneva, Lin has faced a mix of support and criticism. Despite the controversy, Lin has remained focused and grateful for the support from her country. I know all of Taiwan's people are standing behind me and supporting me, and I will carry this energy to the end, she said.

The Taiwan Olympic Committee released a statement reaffirming Lin's eligibility to compete, as determined by the IOC's rules. The committee condemned the online abuse directed at Lin and called for an end to such behavior, expressing full support for the athlete. The controversy surrounding Khelif and Lin's eligibility has sparked a broader conversation about gender and sports. IOC spokesman Mark Adams has called for a stop to the spread of misinformation across social media that has resulted in both athletes facing online abuse. We feel these women have been targeted, particularly on social media, they've been subject to death threats, we feel strongly about that to remind people this is absolutely not a transgender issue, Adams told Sky Sports News.

The gender eligibility debate is not new in sports. In 2009, South African runner Caster Semenya was sidelined for 11 months because of track and field rules about hormone levels. Semenya, who was identified as female at birth and has been legally identified as female her entire life, has one of a number of conditions known as differences in sex development (DSDs), which cause naturally high testosterone.

The controversy surrounding Khelif and Lin's eligibility and the subsequent online abuse they have faced underscore the need for clear guidelines and respectful discourse in sports. As Khelif and Lin continue their Olympic journey, their experiences serve as a reminder of the challenges that athletes can face beyond the competition and the importance of fostering a supportive and inclusive environment in sports."

PARIS (AP) — Olympics organizers said Sunday that arbitrary testing imposed on boxers Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-Ting that led to a storm of vitriol misidentifying the women as transgender or men was “so flawed that it’s impossible to engage with it.”

International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams again vigorously defended Khelif of Algeria and Lin of Taiwan, hammering the sport’s now-banned governing body, the International Boxing Association, that claimed the fighters failed unspecified eligibility tests for women’s competition.

The two athletes were “carted off and tested” during the 2023 boxing world championships because “there were suspicions against them,” Adams said, slamming the process that singled them out.

“I need hardly say if we start acting on suspicions against every athlete of whatever, then we go down a very bad route,” he said.

He rejected the testing in its entirety.

“There’s a whole range of reasons why we won’t deal with this,” Adams said. “Partly confidentiality. Partly medical issues. Partly that there was no basis for the test in the first place. And partly data-sharing of this is also highly against the rules, international rules.”

“The whole process is flawed,” Adams added. “From the conception of the test, to how the test was shared with us, to how the tests have become public, is so flawed that it’s impossible to engage with it.”

Lin and Khelif have been at the center of a clash over gender identity and regulations in sports as critics have brought up their disqualification last year. The IBA claimed they failed “to meet the required necessary eligibility criteria and were found to have competitive advantages over other female competitors.”

The Russian-dominated governing body was given the unprecedented punishment of being permanently banned from the Olympics last year and has not run an Olympic boxing tournament since the Rio de Janeiro Games in 2016.

Adams confirmed that the IOC received a letter from the IBA that the 3 Wire Sports website reported concerned Khelif and Lin and, it said, was sent in June of last year to Olympic organizers.

Adams wouldn’t discuss the letter’s contents but reiterated: “Those tests are not legitimate.”

“There was indeed a letter,” he said. ”I’m not going to discuss the individual intimate details of athletes, in public, which I think is pretty disgraceful for those who have leaked that material. Frankly, to be put in that position must be awful. On top of all of the social media harassment that these these athletes have had.”

IOC President Thomas Bach had sought Saturday to draw a line under days of global scrutiny about the female boxers and what he described as a politically motivated “cultural war.”

“We have two boxers who are born as women, who have been raised as women, who have a passport as a woman and have competed for many years as women,” Bach said. “Some want to own a definition of who is a women.”

Bach linked the furor to what he called a wider, Russian-led campaign against the IOC and the Paris Olympics, where only 15 Russian athletes are competing as neutrals. The IOC and international sports bodies have isolated Russia because of the country’s invasion of Ukraine.

“What we have seen from the Russian side and in particular from the (IBA),” Bach said, “they have undertaken already way before these Games with a defamation campaign against France, against the Games, against the IOC.”

"Imane Khelif, Olympic boxer at center of gender dispute, calls for a gender equality debate.",https://evrimagaci.org/tpg/olympics-spotlight-on-gender-identity-sparks-debate-5250,"Olympics Spotlight On Gender Identity Sparks Debate Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting face backlash as IOC condemns hate speech

As the Paris 2024 Olympics continue to unfold, the events in the boxing ring have ignited intense discussions around gender identity, sports regulations, and societal perceptions of women athletes. Central to this debate are the experiences of Algerian boxer Imane Khelif and Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-ting, both of whom have faced startling scrutiny and backlash, largely stemming from misconceptions related to their gender.

Immediately following Khelif's recent fight against Italy's Angela Carini, who withdrew just 46 seconds into the match, the milieu surrounding female athletes grew increasingly fraught. Carini was visibly emotional, and her departure from the fight has been interpreted by many as indicative of larger issues relating to gender and competition in sports.

Khelif's victory came amid a wave of online abuse that cast doubts on her identity as a female athlete. Prominent public figures, including former U.S. President Donald Trump and author J.K. Rowling, expressed their opinions on social media, often framing Khelif as being transgender or questioning her status as a woman. Such comments have raised alarm bells among LGBTQ+ advocates, who argue that these discussions perpetuate a culture of hostility that endangers the very athletes whose identities are under siege.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach entered the fray, condemning the ""hate speech"" directed at Khelif and Yu-ting. Bach stated, ""We will not take part in a politically motivated cultural war."" His remarks highlight the IOC’s commitment to fostering an inclusive environment in a global sporting arena that has been historically plagued with gender bias and discrimination.

Khelif and Yu-ting were both previously disqualified from a 2023 boxing championship under controversial circumstances. The Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA) cited them as having failed eligibility tests, the specifics of which have remained vague and often criticized for their lack of transparency. Bach defended both boxers, asserting, ""We have two boxers who are born as women, who have been raised as women, who have a passport as a woman and have competed for many years as women."" His call for a scientifically grounded definition of womanhood seeks to challenge the stigmas perpetuated by the rhetoric surrounding trans issues in sports.

The tensions surrounding gender identity in athletics can be traced back to the broader societal discourse about what constitutes femininity and womanhood. The participation of transgender women in sports remains a contentious topic, stirring passionate debates about fairness, competition, and inclusion. Activists argue that these disputes often detract from the empowerment of women in sports and instead focus scrutiny on individual identities.

Throughout the Olympics, both Khelif and Yu-ting maintain that their identities and experiences as women should not be subjected to such intense public debate. Their resolve displays a larger trend of athletes stepping forward amid adversity, not merely to defend their rights but to ensure equality in sports.

LOcal Manager of the LGBTQ+ youth organization @fullout had to state, ""The vitriol directed towards Imane Khelif is not just an attack on her, but on what so many of us are fighting for: the right to compete, the right to exist as our true selves, and the right for our identities and experiences to be validated."" Perhaps as the games continue, these boxers will exemplify the strength and resilience of female athletes everywhere, paving the way for future discussions that hold the potential to reshape societal understandings of gender.

The path forward is complex, yet it calls for greater compassion between individuals with varied experiences. As the conversations surrounding these topics evolve, they encourage not only awareness but also an understanding that sport is an avenue for intersectionality, integrating various identities within the global community.

In this rapidly changing landscape, the athletic spotlight shone brightly on Khelif and Yu-ting, serving as a reminder that the fight for recognition and respect will forge ahead, along with the hope that future generations of athletes will engage in a more uplifting dialogue around identity and sport.

As the world tunes in to witness Olympic greatness, the narratives unfolding around athletes challenge everyone to reconsider their perspectives on women in sports, especially regarding the evolving definitions of identity, gender, and competition."

Lin and Algeria's Imane Khelif have been at the centre of a social media storm at the Games due to them being disqualified at the 2023 World Championships after falling foul of unspecified International Boxing Association's gender eligibility rules.

""I know all of Taiwan's people are standing behind me and supporting me, and I will carry this energy to the end,"" Lin said after her win.

International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach said on Saturday there ""was never any doubt"" that Lin and Khelif were women who had every right to compete at the Games.

The boxing tournament in Paris is being organised by the IOC, which stripped the IBA of international recognition in 2023 over governance and finance issues.

On Friday, the Bulgarian Olympic Committee said it had voiced its concerns over the two boxers' presence at the tournament during a meeting with the IOC's Medical and Scientific Commission on July 27.

""Yu-ting is great!"" Taiwan President Lai Ching-te wrote on his Facebook page after Lin's victory.

""In recent days, Taiwan's people have been indignant at the slander against her. Facing the challenge, Yu-ting is fearless and uses her strength to crush the rumours. Let us continue to cheer for her!""

In Saturday's bout, the taller Lin attempted to sit back and let her opponent come to her in the first round, a strategy which had mixed results as she was struck with a few big shots.

In the second round, double world champion Lin was more direct and took the fight to Staneva, who showcased her frustration by grappling Lin and pushing her onto the canvas.

With a 3-0 lead heading into the final round, Lin once again tried to be evasive and found herself on the floor when she was accidentally tripped by Staneva, who held the ropes open for the Taiwanese boxer to exit the ring at the end of the fight.

Lin, who will face Turkey's Esra Yildiz in the semi-finals, is assured of a medal, adding to compatriots Wu Shih-yi and Chen Nien-chin efforts from Saturday.

Algerian Khelif is also assured of at least bronze after winning her welterweight quarter-final against Hungary's Luca Anna Hamori by unanimous decision on Saturday.

The debate over Khelif and Lin's participation in the tournament rocketed after the Algerian won her round-of-16 bout in 46 seconds on Thursday, when her Italian opponent Angela Carini pulled out of the fight.

Carini was hit with multiple punches in the first 30 seconds, before raising her hand and returning to her corner to withdraw from the fight, saying she had felt intense pain and was worried about her own safety.

After the bout, Carini said she did not harbour any ill feeling towards the Algerian."
"Imane Khelif, Olympic boxer at center of gender dispute, calls for a gender equality debate.",https://www.inkl.com/news/olympics-organizers-denounce-flawed-testing-of-boxers,"In a recent development, Olympics organizers have strongly criticized the arbitrary testing imposed on boxers Imane Khelif of Algeria and Lin Yu-Ting of Taiwan. The testing, which led to a wave of misidentification and vitriol, was deemed flawed and unacceptable by the International Olympic Committee.

The controversy arose when the International Boxing Association, the now-banned governing body of the sport, claimed that Khelif and Lin had failed unspecified eligibility tests for women's competition. The athletes were subjected to testing during the 2023 boxing world championships based on suspicions against them, a process that was heavily criticized for its lack of transparency and fairness.

IOC spokesman Mark Adams vehemently defended the athletes, emphasizing that acting on mere suspicions without concrete evidence sets a dangerous precedent. He highlighted the numerous flaws in the testing process, citing concerns about confidentiality, medical issues, and data sharing that violated international rules.

Adams categorically rejected the testing and expressed his frustration with how the situation was handled from start to finish. He emphasized that the entire process was deeply flawed and made it impossible for the IOC to engage with the results.

Khelif and Lin found themselves at the center of a larger debate surrounding gender identity and sports regulations following their disqualification by the IBA last year. The governing body's controversial decision to bar them from competition was a contributing factor to its permanent ban from the Olympics.

Since the Rio de Janeiro Games in 2016, the IBA has not overseen an Olympic boxing tournament, underscoring the ongoing repercussions of its actions. The incident involving Khelif and Lin serves as a stark reminder of the complexities and challenges surrounding gender equality and fairness in sports.

As the fallout from this testing debacle continues, it raises important questions about the need for more rigorous and transparent protocols in ensuring a level playing field for all athletes.

Having clinched a guaranteed medal at the Olympics, Khelif spoke about the impact of the bullying and harassment she has experienced over the last week.

“I send a message to all the people of the world to uphold the Olympic principles and the Olympic Charter, to refrain from bullying all athletes, because this has effects, massive effects,” Khelif told SNTV, a sports video partner of The Associated Press, in Arabic. “It can destroy people, it can kill people’s thoughts, spirit and mind. It can divide people. And because of that, I ask them to refrain from bullying.”

Khelif, as well as Taiwan’s boxer Lin Yu-ting, have been at the center of a gender-eligibility controversy. The two allegedly failed “gender-eligibility tests” from the IBA, and the head of the IBA claimed they tested XY on a chromosome test. The IOC has forcefully said the two women are female.

On Monday, the International Boxing Association held a press conference in Paris to refute the IOC’s claim. In what has been described as a “chaotic” press conference, the IBA again asserted the two athletes failed a chromosome test, though they reportedly didn’t give a lot of details about that.

Khelif guaranteed herself at least a bronze medal by winning her quarterfinal match. In Olympic boxing, everyone who makes the semifinals earns at least a bronze, as there is no bronze-medal match.

She broke down in tears in the ring after learning she will walk away from Paris with a medal, an outpouring of emotion after an emotionally difficult week.

She also talked to the outlet about the effects on her family back in Algeria, adding to the mental impact of the attacks on her, her country and her gender.

“I am in contact with my family two days a week. I hope that they weren’t affected deeply,” she told SNTV. “They are worried about me. God willing, this crisis will culminate in a gold medal, and that would be the best response.”

Khelif competes in her semifinal match on Tuesday."
"Imane Khelif, Olympic boxer at center of gender dispute, calls for a gender equality debate.",https://nz.news.yahoo.com/boxer-beat-imane-khelif-2022-111510585.html,"Irish boxer Amy Broadhurst, who beat Imane Khelif at the 2022 World Championships, has defended the Algerian amid the gender controversy storm that has engulfed her at the Olympics.

Khelif was disqualified hours before her gold-medal bout at the women’s World Championships in New Delhi last year after she failed to meet the International Boxing Association’s (IBA) eligibility criteria, which prevent athletes with male XY chromosomes competing in women’s events. Taiwan’s double world champion Lin Yu-ting lost her bronze medal at the same competition, after she too failed to meet the criteria.

The IBA did not specify why the boxers failed their gender eligibility tests but did clarify that neither underwent testosterone examinations. Neither Khelif, 25, nor two-time world champion Lin, 28, identifies as transgender or intersex.

The IBA was stripped of its recognition by the IOC last year over governance and finance issues, with the Olympic body running the boxing competition in Paris itself, and it has allowed both women to participate.

On Thursday, Khelif landed a heavy punch on her opponent, Italy’s Angela Carini, in their last-16 bout which forced Carini to quit after only 46 seconds. After Khelif’s hand was raised to signal her victory, Carini dropped to her knees in tears and could also be heard telling her coach, “It’s not right, it’s not right!” before promptly leaving the arena.

Carini suffered a suspected broken nose, and the 25-year-old told reporters that she had never been punched so hard in her career.

The situation has caused a deluge of hate, aggression and misinformation online surrounding Khelif with the likes of author JK Rowling and billionaire Elon Musk voicing their opposition to her competing in the Games.

but before the Algerian’s victory at Paris 2024, Broadhurst – a boxer who beat Khelif in the welterweight final of the 2022 IBA Women’s World Championships – defended her in a social media post.

“Have a lot of people texting me over Imane Khelif,” she wrote on Twitter/X. “Personally I don’t think she has done anything to ‘cheat’.

“I think it’s the way she was born and that’s out of her control. The fact that she has been [beaten] by nine females before says it all.”

The IOC said the rules of eligibility were based on those of the Tokyo Games in 2021 and cannot be changed during a competition.

In a statement, the IOC wrote: “The current aggression against these two athletes is based entirely on this arbitrary decision, which was taken without any proper procedure, especially considering that these athletes had been competing in top-level competition for many years.

“The IOC is saddened by the abuse that the two athletes are currently receiving,” it added. “Every person has the right to practice sport without discrimination.”

Khelif is next scheduled to fight on Saturday (3 August) at 4.22pm BST and victory would guarantee the Algerian a bronze medal at 66kg and the chance to compete for silver or gold."

Olympic boxing has been gripped by a heated debate on gender eligibility in recent days after Algeria’s Imane Khelif beat Italian Angela Carini in a fight lasting only 46 seconds – sparking international outcry and a flurry of dangerous misinformation.

Concerns were raised after Carini stopped the match in less than a minute before telling her coach “it’s not right,” and later saying she had “never been hit so hard” in her career.

Her comments were believed to allude to Khelif’s disputed eligibility for competing against other women. It was the Algerian boxer’s disqualification by the International Boxing Association (IBA) in 2023 that first raised doubts about her gender eligibility.

The organisation found that she had and fellow boxer Lin Yu-Ting of Taiwan had failed “to meet the required necessary eligibility criteria and were found to have competitive advantages over other female competitors.”

This is despite Khelif being born and raised a woman, and not identifying as either transgender or intersex.

Recent years have seen the IBA’s legitimacy and impartiality come into question. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) stripped the organisation of its status as boxing’s governing body in 2023, and has said the tests of both Khelif and Yu-Ting were illegitimate.

The Russian-linked body has since hit back, writing in a statement: “The IBA will never support any boxing bouts between the genders, as the organization puts the safety and well-being of our athletes first”.

The organisation will now hold a press conference in Paris highlighting covering its “stance on ineligible boxers” as Khelif continues to progress through the competition. She faces Thailand’s Janjaem Suwannapheng in her semi-final bout on Tuesday.

Here’s everything you need to know about the IBA as the debate rages on:

What is the International Boxing Association (IBA)?

With roots in the 1920 Antwerp Olympic games, the IBA was at a point one of the largest governing bodies in amateur boxing. It was renamed from the AIBA in 2021, and hosts the biennial World Boxing Championships.

It was from this competition that Khelif and Yu-Ting were banned in 2023. In recent weeks, the IBA has clarified that their eligibility was decided based not on testosterone testing but a “separate and recognized test, whereby the specifics remain confidential.”

This lack of transparency has led critics to highlight allegations of corruption at senior levels of the organisation. The IBA is run by Russian president Umar Kremlev, operates largely in the country, and is backed by Russian energy corporation Gazprom.

At the 2023 World Championships, Khelif was only disqualified suddenly before her gold medal bout after defeating Russian opponent Azalia Amineva at the semi-final. Amineva’s unbeaten record was subsequently restored.

The IOC withdrew recognition of the IBA in 2023 over concerns around finances, governance, ethics, refereeing and judging. The body has fervently denied these allegations.

It is now fighting to regain international standing and governance over Olympic boxing – goals which look increasingly unlikely in the wake of the allegations against them.

The IBA has not run an Olympic boxing tournament since 2016, and in April 2024, a court of arbitration upheld the IOC’s decision to strip them of their status."

The inclusion of Lin and fellow Algerian boxer Imane Khelif at the games has drawn criticism after both were disqualified from last year's World Championships for failing to meet gender eligibility criteria.

The International Boxing Association (IBA), which carried out the tests in 2023, was stripped as the global governing body last year over governance and finance issues by the International Olympic Committee, which is overseeing the sport in Paris.

The Bulgarian Olympic Committee said on Friday it had voiced its concerns over the two boxers' presence at the tournament during a meeting with the IOC's medical and scientific commission on 27 July.

Khelif is also a guaranteed medallist after winning her welterweight quarter-final against Hungary's Luca Anna Hamori by unanimous decision on Saturday.

The debate over the pair's participation in the tournament erupted after the Algerian won her round-of-16 bout in 46 seconds on Thursday, when her Italian opponent Angela Carini pulled out of the fight.

Carini was hit with multiple punches in the first 30 seconds, before raising her hand and returning to her corner to withdraw from the fight, saying she had felt intense pain and was worried about her own safety.

She later apologised and said she regretted not shaking hands with Khelif after their contest.

Olympics chief Mr Bach has condemned the ""hate speech"" the fighters have received on social media.

He said: ""Let's be very clear, we are talking about women's boxing.

""We have two boxers who are born as a woman, who have been raised as a woman, who have a passport as a woman and who have competed for many years as a woman.

""This is the clear definition of a woman. There was never any doubt about them being a woman.""

Khelif has been at the centre of a Paris Olympics controversy, which escalated when the Algerian beat Angela Carini in the boxing last week. Italy’s Carini withdrew 46 into seconds their fight at 66kg, after being hit clean by Khelif once.

The Algerian fighter has since recorded another win, ensuring her a bronze medal at least, amid inaccurate claims from some corners that she is a transgender athlete. The 25-year-old has never identified as transgender or intersex, but she did fail a gender eligibility test at the 2023 World Championships, according to the IBA, leading to her disqualification.

Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting, 28, has faced similar backlash while securing a bronze medal at least in Paris, after she was disqualified from the same tournament as Khelif for failing the same test. However, the IBA – which organised the World Championships but is no longer involved with the Olympics – would not initially reveal why the boxers failed their tests.

At a press conference on Monday (5 August), the IBA, which no longer oversees Olympic boxing amid concerns about its integrity and links to Russia, finally clarified that Khelif and Lin’s test results revealed chromosomes that made them ineligible to compete in the women’s category.

Chris Roberts, the IBA’s General Secretary and CEO, told reporters: “Blood tests were taken, a gender test was taken – as it was – during the Women’s World Championship in 2022 in Istanbul. On 17 May 2022, the blood tests were taken by a lab in Istanbul. The results there were issued on 24 May. The results that were brought out were inconsistent, further to which there’s been a number of questions as to why.

“We go to the female World Championships that took place between 15 and 26 March [in 2023 in India]. On 17 March 2023, both boxers were asked to take a further blood test. That happened, and on 23 March the results came through, and it demonstrated the chromosomes that we referred to within the competition rules – that make both boxers ineligible.

“That was then further ratified by our board of directors. The decision was taken to remove both boxers from our World Championships. For [Khelif] and for Lin, clearly the technical and competition rules that apply to the IBA are different to that of the IOC.

“[It’s] difficult, because both boxers have worked extremely hard towards their own goals, and of course we find ourselves in this difficult position now. It’s never been our intention to bring any of this about [...] We’re not able to disclose the results of any test, but you can read between the lines where that sits.”

Roberts added that, after receiving contact from Algeria and Taiwan’s respective National Olympic Committees, the IBA “can’t disclose any information pertinent to either boxer”.

Umar Kremlev, the IBA’s president, then claimed that Khelif and Lin’s test results showed “very high” levels of testosterone.

Khelif is said to have lodged an appeal over her disqualification and subsequently withdrawn it. It remains unclear why the appeal was withdrawn.

Ioannis Filippatos, president of the European Boxing Confederation and a former Chair of the IBA Medical Committee, spoke next. The doctor, an obstetrician gynaecologist, suggested that the IOC’s means of determining a fighter’s sex is problematic, because it is based on the information in an athlete’s passport.

Gabriele Martelli, president of the IBA Coaches Committee, then claimed that Khelif and Lin possess an “unfair advantage”. He said: “If we lose because of an unfair advantage, we might be hurt emotionally, physically, because an advantage was used to take a medal from us. But in our sport, it is different, it is dangerous; when there is an unfair advantage, someone can die.”

Since parting ways with the IBA, the IOC has arranged the boxing at the Tokyo and Paris Olympics. For the ongoing Games, the body set up the Paris Boxing Unit to oversee the competitions.

The IBA’s legitimacy and impartiality have been called into question in recent years. The Russian-linked body has been the subject of allegations of corruption at senior levels, and it is backed by Russian energy corporation Gazprom.

What is DSD? The condition at the heart of Imane Khelif boxing gender test scandal

Imane Khelif, the Algerian boxer at the centre of the Paris Olympics’ gender row, has broken her silence, calling for an end to “bullying”.

Khelif found herself in the midst of controversy last Thursday last week after Italian fighter Angela Carini abandoned her bout with Khelif after less than a minute.

Khelif was disqualified from last year’s World Championships after failing a gender eligibility test set by the International Boxing Association (IBA), which said at the time that the 25-year-old’s “elevated levels of testosterone failed to meet the eligibility criteria” for women’s competition. She has, however, been ruled eligible for the Games by the International Olympic Committee and now advances into the second round of the women’s 66kg tournament.

Carini broke down in tears as she pulled out of the fight after just 46 seconds, having been caught twice by powerful blows from Khelif.

Khelif is now through to the women's 66kg semi-finals after beating Hungary's Anna Luca Hamori and is guaranteed to secure Algeria's first boxing medal since 2000 and their first in women's boxing. She is due to fight Thailand's Janjaem Suwannapheng on Tuesday.

In an interview with SNTV on Sunday, Khelif addressed the incident. ""I send a message to all the people of the world to uphold the Olympic principles and the Olympic Charter, to refrain from bullying all athletes, because this has effects, massive effects,"" she said in Arabic.

""It can destroy people, it can kill people's thoughts, spirit and mind. It can divide people. And because of that, I ask them to refrain from bullying.”

After their fight, Carini explained she had never been hit so hard and decided to withdraw because of the intense pain in her nose.

“I’m a mature woman,” she said. “The ring is my life. I’ve always been very instinctive. And when I feel that something isn’t right, it’s not giving up. It’s having the maturity to stop. It’s having the maturity to say: ‘OK, that’s enough’. Regardless of everything it’s OK, fine like this. I didn’t lose tonight … I only did my job as a fighter. I’m coming out with my head held high and with a broken heart.”

Carini has since apologised to Khelif and has said she would embrace her if she saw her again.

Khelif was one of two boxers allowed to compete in Paris despite being disqualified from the World Championships in Delhi.

The UN’s special rapporteur on violence against women and girls has condemned the decision to allow Imane Khelif to compete in women’s boxing at the Olympics, with MPs and JK Rowling among other critics.

International Olympic Committee (IOC) spokesperson Mark Adams said the two boxers fighting at the Olympics after being disqualified from last year’s world championships are “real people” who have been competing “for many years” and that “this is not a transgender issue”, the BBC reported.

What is DSD?

Differences in sex development – also known as DSD – are a group of about 40 rare conditions involving genes, hormones and reproductive organs, including genitals, that develop in the womb. It means a person's sex development is different from most other people's. Some people prefer to use the term intersex.

Khelif hasn't yet commented publicly about the controversy and despite discussions around DSD, there has been no indication to suggest that she has DSD, which is a rare condition affecting between 0.05 and 1 per cent of the population. It can result in outwardly female individuals having male chromosomes or anatomy.

Others could have a very rare type of DSD where they have both ovarian and testicular tissue (sometimes one ovary and one testis). Their genitals may appear female or male or could look different from either.

What is the science behind DSD?

When born, some people have a chromosome pattern other than the usual XY or XX. They may have one X chromosome (XO), or they may have an extra chromosome (XXY).

Their internal and external sex organs can be either male or female, but they may not go through full physical development at puberty. For example, a child with female sex organs may not start having periods.

How is it diagnosed?

Doctors tend to check a baby for DSD soon after birth if they are showing signs such as undescended testicles or if a baby's genitals look different. Tests including ultrasounds and blood tests can be done before a baby’s sex is registered.

Many forms of DSD do not require any medical care other than understanding the baby's development and knowing what to expect as they grow older.

Other people with DSD are sometimes only diagnosed once puberty begins and it becomes clear something is not right.

What is the controversy around athletes with DSD?

The issue has caused a lot of people to reveal their opinions on the matter. Some commentators have said it is wrong for a person who is considered biologically as strong as a man to compete against a biological woman, as it would give an unfair advantage.

Former GB swimmer Sharron Davies said: “This is a biological male fighting a female & absolutely everyone can see it, they have also failed gender screening, twice & have XY chromosomes. There is no ambiguity that the IOC do not care if a female gets seriously hurt. Or worse. I’m astonished at the weakness of the media.”

A string of MPs made similar condemnations.

Anna Turley, Labour MP for Redcar, said: “This is just not acceptable @Olympics – enough.”

And Labour MP Rosie Duffield said: “This is not ok @iocmedia #Paris2024 Listen to women.”

Jim Shannon, of the Democratic Unionist Party, also chimed in: “How in the name of sanity is this supported by the IOC? When Pierre de Coubertin said ‘all sports for all people’ he would never have intended for men fighting women to be one of those sports. Male violence on females cannot be tolerated as a spectator sport.”

On Thursday morning, Mark Adams, an IOC spokesman, said those competing in the boxing are compliant with the eligibility rules.

He said: “What I’d repeat is all the competitors comply with the competition eligibility rules and that’s as it should be. That’s how these boxers concerned have taken part in these Games, have taken part in previous world championships, have taken part in previous Olympic Games, have taken part in regional and continental competitions.

“The IOC is saddened by the abuse that the two athletes are currently receiving. The IBA’s recognition was withdrawn by the IOC in 2023 following its suspension in 2019.”

Athletes with DSD

South African runner and Olympic gold medallist Caster Semenya has a DSD called 5-alpha-reductase deficiency, which means she has the male XY chromosomes and produces higher levels of testosterone than normal for women.

This DSD can occur in people with female reproductive anatomy and genitalia, as in Semenya's case. She has previously detailed how she has internal testes and no uterus, but does have a vagina.

Semenya, who dominated women's running events between 2009 and 2019, learned at the same time as the rest of the world that she had a DSD. She was forced to take drugs such as the contraceptive pill to lower her testosterone to align with new rules that limited the level of the hormone in women's events.

Fellow runners Francine Niyonsaba of Burundi, Kenya's Margaret Nyairera Wambui and Namibia's Christine Mboma and Beatrice Masilingi have also been ruled ineligible to compete in competitions due to DSDs.

Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting is the other fighter who also had questions raised about her eligibility for the Olympics."
"Imane Khelif, Olympic boxer at center of gender dispute, calls for a gender equality debate.",https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1147483/olympic-boxer-imane-khelif-calls-for-end,"Olympic boxer Imane Khelif has called for an end to bullying in the sport, highlighting the damaging impact it has on athletes. Khelif, addressing the issue with urgency, urges the boxing community to tackle this problem and foster a supportive environment.

The IOC, through spokesman Mark Adams, reiterated the organisation's position on the International Boxing Association (IBA) and its handling of the situation, which has sparked a worldwide debate on the eligibility of the two athletes.

Olympic boxer Imane Khelif said the wave of hateful scrutiny she has faced over misconceptions about her gender “harms human dignity,” and she called for an end to bullying athletes after being greatly affected by the international backlash against her. The Algerian athlete spoke about her tumultuous Olympic experience on Sunday night in an interview with SNTV, a sports video partner of The Associated Press.

“I send a message to all the people of the world to uphold the Olympic principles and the Olympic Charter, to refrain from bullying all athletes, because this has effects, massive effects,” Khelif said in Arabic. “It can destroy people, it can kill people’s thoughts, spirit and mind. It can divide people. And because of that, I ask them to refrain from bullying.”

The victories of Khelif and fellow boxer Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan in the ring in Paris have become one of the biggest stories of the Paris Games. Both women have clinched their first Olympic medals even as they have faced online abuse based on unsubstantiated claims about their gender, drawing them into a wider divide over changing attitudes toward gender identity and regulations in sports.

The 25-year-old Khelif acknowledged the pressure and pain of enduring this ordeal while competing far from home in the most important event of her athletic career. “I am in contact with my family two days a week. I hope that they weren’t affected deeply,” she said. “They are worried about me. God willing, this crisis will culminate in a gold medal, and that would be the best response.”

The vitriol stems from claims by the International Boxing Association, which has been permanently banned from the Olympics, that both Khelif and Lin failed unspecified eligibility tests for the women’s competition at last year’s world championships. Khelif declined to answer when asked whether she had undergone tests other than doping tests, saying she didn’t want to talk about it.

She expressed gratitude to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and its president, Thomas Bach, for standing resolutely behind her while the banned former governing body of Olympic boxing stoked a furor around her participation in Paris. “I know that the Olympic Committee has done me justice, and I am happy with this remedy because it shows the truth,” she said.

She also has seen massive support at her bouts, drawing cheers when she enters the arena and crowds waving Algerian flags chanting her first name. She will fight again Tuesday in the women’s 66-kilogram semifinals at Roland Garros.

Khelif repeatedly made clear she won’t allow chatter or accusations to deter her from attempting to claim Algeria’s first Olympic gold medal in women’s boxing. “I don’t care about anyone’s opinion,” Khelif said a day after beating Anna Luca Hamori of Hungary.

“I came here for a medal, and to compete for a medal. I will certainly be competing to improve (and) be better, and God willing, I will improve, like every other athlete.” Although she is aware of the worldwide discussion about her, Khelif said she has been somewhat removed.

“Honestly, I don’t follow social media,” she said. “There is a mental health team that doesn’t let us follow social media, especially in the Olympic Games, whether me or other athletes. I’m here to compete and get a good result.” Khelif started her Olympic run last Thursday with a victory over Angela Carini of Italy, who abandoned the bout after just 46 seconds. Carini later said she regretted her decision and wished to apologize to Khelif.

That unusual ending raised the chatter around Khelif into a roar, drawing comments from the likes of former U.S. President Donald Trump, “Harry Potter” writer J.K. Rowling and others falsely claiming Khelif was a man or transgender.

The IOC repeatedly declared her and Lin qualified to participate in the Olympics, and it has decried the murky testing standards and untransparent governance of the IBA, which was banished entirely from the Olympics last year in an unprecedented punishment for a governing body.

IOC attacks IBA

Khelif and Lin Yu-Ting are at the centre of controversy, having reached the boxing semi-finals despite previous IBA disqualifications for gender eligibility. It has now emerged that the IBA, which has been repeatedly criticised by the IOC, informed Olympic organisers of its test results on Khelif in June last year. According to the IBA's June 2023 correspondence, tests carried out in India last year and in Turkey in May 2022 concluded that Khelif's DNA consisted of XY chromosomes.

Adams confirmed that the IOC had received a letter from the IBA, first reported by 3 Wire Sports, claiming that Khelif's DNA showed XY chromosomes. However, Adams dismissed these tests as illegitimate and carried out on an ad hoc basis, and criticised the leak of such sensitive information. Adams wouldn't discuss the contents of the letter, but reiterated: ""These tests are not legitimate.""

Speaking at a press conference on Sunday, Adams described the tests as ""so flawed that it's impossible to engage with them"" and defended both Khelif and Lin amid the controversy that has seen them misidentified as transgender or male. ""The whole process is flawed,"" Adams added. ""From the conception of the test, to the way the test was shared with us, to the way the tests were made public, it's so flawed that it's impossible to engage with it.""

He expressed disdain for those who leaked the private details and highlighted the harassment the athletes had faced. ""There was indeed a letter,"" he said. ""I'm not going to discuss the individual intimate details of athletes in public, which I think is quite disgraceful for those who leaked that material. Frankly, it must be terrible to be put in that position. On top of all the social media harassment these athletes have had to endure.”

The IOC originally stated on its online Olympic biographies that the disqualifications were due to elevated testosterone levels, which Adams reiterated on Friday even after those details were removed. Meanwhile, IBA president Umar Kremlev told a Russian news agency that the disqualifications were because ""it has been proven that they have XY chromosomes"" and not because of elevated testosterone levels.

Adams, however, rejected the legitimacy of the tests, saying there was ""no reason for the test"" to determine the boxers' sex. ""The test, as far as we can see, was done arbitrarily,"" he said. ""The decision that I've seen reported also relates to the competition in which one of the boxers beat a Russian boxer. I don't know if there's any truth in that, but the fact that the decision to take the test was taken on the spot there. I don't know what the purpose of the test was. We managed to get rid of sex testing in the last century.”

During the 2023 World Boxing Championships, Khelif and Lin were unexpectedly tested after suspicions were raised against them. Adams was highly critical of the IBA's actions, stating, ""I need hardly say that when we start acting on suspicion against any athlete, whatever it may be, we are going down a very bad road. He insisted that the tests had no legitimate basis and had been carried out in breach of international rules on confidentiality and data sharing.”

The IOC criticised the now-banned IBA, which claimed the boxers had failed unspecified tests to qualify for the women's competition. ""There's a whole range of reasons why we don't want to deal with it,"" Adams said. ""Partly confidentiality. Partly medical issues. Partly that there was no basis for the test in the first place. And partly that sharing this data is also very much against the rules, international rules.""

While Adams was addressing the media, Chinese Taipei's Lin Yu-Ting was facing protests from her opponent after winning a medal at the Paris Olympics. Lin had reached her semi-final with the same ease as Imane Khelif the night before. In response, her Bulgarian opponent Svetlana Staneva dramatically removed her gloves, pointed at herself and made an X with her fingers. Staneva's coach also held up a white piece of paper with the words: ""I only want to compete with women, I am XX.""

IOC President Thomas Bach underlined the IOC's position and linked the furore to a wider, politically motivated campaign by Russian interests against the IOC and the Paris Olympics. He stressed that both Khelif and Lin are women by birth, upbringing and competitive history, and condemned attempts to redefine their gender identities.

The IBA, which was stripped of its Olympic status last year after a series of controversies and is led by Moscow-born Umar Kremlev, has added fuel to the fire. The IOC's ongoing conflict with the IBA has intensified, with the IBA set to hold a press conference in Paris to present its evidence. Adams, however, reiterated that the IBA's review process lacked legitimacy and was influenced by questionable motives.

As the controversy continues to overshadow the athletes' performances, both Khelif and Lin have advanced to the medal rounds in their respective divisions, further complicating the narrative surrounding their participation. The IOC remains steadfast in its defence of the athletes in the midst of a challenging and highly polarised debate. Adams acknowledged the ongoing debate about protecting women's sport, ""not just in boxing"", but insisted that ""nobody wants to go back to the days of sex testing."""

The often overlooked issue of differences in sex development has come to the fore in the wake of a deluge of headlines around the fact two women Olympic boxers had previously failed a gender eligibility test.

Last year, Algeria’s Imane Khelif was disqualified just hours before her gold-medal bout at the women’s World Championships in New Delhi after not meeting the International Boxing Association’s (IBA) eligibility criteria, which blocks athletes with male XY chromosomes competing in women’s events.

Meanwhile, Taiwan’s double-world champion Lin Yu-ting lost her bronze medal at the same competition after she also failed to meet the criteria.

But the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has defended its decision to allow the two boxers to compete in the Paris 2024 Olympics. It comes after the IBA was stripped of its recognition by the IOC last year over governance and finance issues, with the Olympic body running the boxing competition in Paris itself, and permitting both women to participate.

The committee said: “The current aggression against these two athletes is based entirely on this arbitrary decision, which was taken without any proper procedure, especially considering that these athletes had been competing in top-level competition for many years.

“The IOC is saddened by the abuse that the two athletes are currently receiving. Every person has the right to practice sport without discrimination.”

This raises the question of what differences in sex development are – with The Independent speaking to an academic who specialises in this area to find out more.

What are the differences in sex development?

The term “differences in sex development”, or DSD, is used to refer to a wide range of different scenarios, with the NHS describing it as a “group of rare conditions involving genes, hormones and reproductive organs, including genitals” which “means a person’s sex development is different to most other people’s”.

Individuals can either have sex chromosomes generally linked with being female (XX chromosomes) or usually associated with being a man (XY chromosomes), yet have reproductive organs and genitals that may look different.

The NHS states that “a person may have a womb and may also have testicles inside their body. Sometimes the testicles might not work properly”.

It adds: “Some people with a very rare type of DSD have both ovarian and testicular tissue (sometimes one ovary and one testis). Their genitals may appear female or male or could look different from either.”

A person may have a womb and may also have testicles inside their body. Sometimes the testicles might not work properly NHS

Claus Højbjerg Gravholt, a professor of genetic endocrinology, said it is impossible to state everyone with a Y chromosome is a male and everyone with an X chromosome is a female.

Professor Højbjerg Gravholt, who is based at Aarhus University in Denmark and works with patients who have differences in sex development, added: “If I showed you pictures of my patients without any clothes on, you would say, well, these are females that I'm looking at.

“But, in fact, they actually have a Y chromosome. And so it’s really coming back to, what is sex? Is sex something you can see out of the chromosomes? No, it’s not. Is sex something that you can see depending on which hormone, estrogen, or testosterone you preferentially produce? No, it’s not. Sex is much more complicated.”

When do differences in sex development emerge?

People generally find out they have a difference in sex development around when they are born or once they become a teenager.

But Professor Højbjerg Gravholt explained the last patient he had diagnosed was a woman in her early thirties who had sought help as she could not get pregnant.

“She had a normal vagina, a normal external female appearance, but did not have a uterus, and she also produced a lot of testosterone from her two testes, which were placed at the same place as the ovaries,” he added.

Her experience demonstrates how complicated differences in sex development are, he said, explaining the patient was “devastated” when he told her that she could not get pregnant due to not having a uterus.

Does a woman with an XY chromosome have periods and can she have children?

Professor Højbjerg Gravholt explains around half of the patients he sees do not have a uterus so they can’t carry a child through a pregnancy – while the other half have a uterus, but do not produce eggs.

These women would not have periods unless they are given sex hormones, he explained, adding that he has never encountered or heard of a woman with an XY chromosome who can have children."
"Imane Khelif, Olympic boxer at center of gender dispute, calls for a gender equality debate.",https://bhaskarlive.in/paris-olympics-imane-khelif-targets-gold-asks-for-an-end-to-gender-bullying/,"New Delhi, Aug 5 (IANS) Algerian boxer Imane Khelif has called for an end to the “bullying and negative rhetoric” after she guaranteed herself an Olympic medal in the women’s 66kg category in the Paris Olympics, becoming the first woman from her country to achieve this milestone.

Khelif’s victory over Hungary’s Anna Luca Hamori has not only secured Algeria’s first boxing medal since 2000 but has also secured her place into the semi-finals, where she will face Thailand’s Janjaem Suwannapheng on Tuesday.

The Algerian has found herself at the center of a gender eligibility debate. Alongside Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-ting, Khelif has faced scrutiny and online abuse due to differing eligibility criteria set by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Boxing Association (IBA).

Both athletes were disqualified from last year’s World Championships by the IBA following unspecified eligibility tests but were cleared to compete in the Paris Olympics under IOC rules.

“I send a message to all the people of the world to uphold the Olympic principles and the Olympic Charter, to refrain from bullying all athletes, because this has effects, massive effects,” she told SNTV in Arabic. “It can destroy people, it can kill people’s thoughts, spirit, and mind. It can divide people. And because of that, I ask them to refrain from bullying.”

“I am in contact with my family two days a week. I hope that they weren’t affected deeply. They are worried about me. God willing, this crisis will culminate in a gold medal, and that would be the best response,” she added.

Khelif expressed her hope that her journey would culminate in a gold medal. She also thanked the IOC and its president, Thomas Bach, for their support, stating, “I know that the Olympic Committee has done me justice, and I am happy with this remedy because it shows the truth.”

Meanwhile, Lin Yu-ting, who will compete against Turkey’s Esra Yildiz in the women’s 57kg semifinal, has also been embroiled in the controversy. Following her unanimous decision victory over Bulgaria’s Svetlana Kamenova Staneva, Lin has faced a mix of support and criticism.

Before the official decision was announced, Staneva made a double XX gesture, referring to the female chromosome, and initially appeared to snub Lin. However, after the referee declared Lin the winner, Staneva opened the ropes for Lin, acknowledging her opponent’s success.

Lin, 28, has remained focused and grateful for the support from her country. “I know all of Taiwan’s people are standing behind me and supporting me, and I will carry this energy to the end. Even though I won this match, it doesn’t mean I can relax; I still need to work hard,” she said after victory over Svetlana.

The Taiwan Olympic Committee released a statement reaffirming Lin’s eligibility to compete, as determined by the IOC’s rules. The committee condemned the online abuse directed at Lin and called for an end to such behavior, expressing full support for the athlete.

“The delegation stands firmly by the athlete with full support and strongly condemns the malicious online abuse and personal attacks and calls for an immediate stop on those behaviours,” the statement read.
