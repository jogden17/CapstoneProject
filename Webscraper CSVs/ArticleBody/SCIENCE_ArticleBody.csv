Fossil discovery in Greenland ice sheet reveals increased risk of sea level rise.,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/greenland-ice-sheet-fossils-sea-level-rise/,"Greenland ice melt will raise sea levels by nearly a foot, study says

Greenland has melted before, and as the climate warms, it will melt again — this time leading to what scientists warn could be 20 to 25 feet of sea-level rise.

During one of the warm periods within the last 1.1 million years, the center, not just the edges, of Greenland's massive ice sheet melted away, new research has found, giving way to a dry and barren ""tundra landscape"" that was home to various insects and plant life. The findings were shared in a new paper published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

When the ice sheet initially melted, there were lower levels of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere than there are today. Now with more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, scientists say Greenland's ice sheet is more susceptible to melting than previously thought.

""Greenland has been around for 2.7 million years with its ice,"" said Paul Bierman, a scientist at the University of Vermont who co-led the new study. ""Now there's some evidence that this ice sheet is fragile.""

The researchers have been studying materials from beneath the hood of the Greenland ice sheet, the largest in the Northern hemisphere, since 2014. They examined sediment from the bottom of an ice core — dubbed GISP2 — extracted from two miles below the surface at the center of the ice sheet nearly 30 years ago.

The 1-ounce sample of sediment was filled with clues of Greenland's past. Tiny little black specks, when put under the microscope, revealed an insect eye, an Arctic poppy seed, parts of an Arctic willow, and tiny bits of soil fungus and spike moss — what Bierman referred to as a ""frozen ecosystem underneath the ice.""

According to researchers, the fossils provide ""direct confirmation"" that 90% of the ice sheet was once gone.

""Finding these fossils in the center of the ice sheet is unambiguous evidence that Greenland's ice has disappeared [in the past],"" said Bierman. ""And once you lose the center of the ice sheet, you've lost it all.""

The findings supports what's called the ""fragile Greenland"" hypothesis: that nature, outside of human influence, has caused the ice sheet to melt at least once since it formed, Bierman said.

At 656,000 square miles, the Greenland ice sheet currently covers around 80% of the island territory. To put that into perspective, it's about three times the size of Texas.

NASA, which has mapped Greenland's ice loss, says the sheet has ""rapidly declined in the last several years,"" prompting the global sea level to rise around 0.03 inches per year. Greenland's melting ice mass is now the No. 1 driver of sea level rise, according to Bierman.

""In the early years of the climate warming, it was mountain glaciers that were doing most of the melting and adding water to the ocean,"" he said. ""Now it's Greenland.""

While it could be a few thousand years before the entire Greenland mass melts, Bierman said, the consequences would be dire: hundreds of millions of people could lose their homes and businesses. Places we hold near and dear to our hearts would be lost.

""As I like to say when people ask me, why does it matter? I say think about your favorite beach. And then imagine your favorite beach with 25 feet of water on it,"" Bierman said."

Watch a colossal X-class solar flare erupt from an Earth-facing sunspot (video).,https://www.space.com/sun-two-x-class-solar-flares-august-5,"The sun showcased its immense power yet again this morning (August 5), firing off not one but two X-class flares.

X flares are the strongest solar flare class . Today's first X blast, which launched from a sunspot called AR3767, reached its peak around 9:40 a.m. EDT (1340 GMT), clocking in at X1.7 on solar scientists' flare scale. Then, less than two hours later, the sunspot AR3780 fired off an X1.1 class solar flare , which peaked at 11:27 a.m. EDT (1527 GMT).

Solar flares are often accompanied by huge eruptions of solar plasma called coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which can cause geomagnetic storms if they hit Earth. These storms can have negative consequences, such as the disruption of power grids, but they can also supercharge the auroras , making these light shows more intense and extending them to lower latitudes than usual.

Sunspot AR3767 erupted with a X1.7-class solar flare on Aug. 5, 2024. It was quickly followed by an X1.1-class flare from sunspot AR3780. NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory captured the fireworks. (Image credit: NASA/SDO and the AIA, EVE, and HMI science teams, helioviewer.org)

That's exactly what happened this past weekend, as a G3 (strong) geomagnetic storm brought the northern lights into view across parts of the U.S. West Coast .

Based on the location of AR3767, however, direct impacts from a CME (if one did indeed launch along with today's first X flare) are unlikely, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) shared on X today . Today's second flare is currently being investigated for any impacts as of this afternoon.

Wow! This #sllarstorm just got better and better for the west coast and for the southern hemisphere last night! https://t.co/7SNB0USCh7August 4, 2024

Through the middle of the week (Aug. 7), SWPC scientists forecast that the flare activity will persist from three active sunspots — AR3772, AR374 and AR3780 — as they parade across the sun from left to right, remaining visible in our view of the solar disk.

Low-end geomagnetic storms also remain possible, but that could change, depending on how strong future solar storms are, and if any send CMEs in Earth's direction."
"2 months after Starliner launched, astronauts still haven’t returned.",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/08/05/boeing-starliner-timeline-astronauts-space-issues-return/74620267007/,"June's launch marked a critical milestone for Boeing as the first Starliner flight with astronauts aboard.

But two months to the day since the launch, NASA astronauts Barry ""Butch"" Wilmore and Sunita ""Suni"" Williams still remain at the International Space Station with no return date set.

The delays in their trip back to Earth come after Boeing experienced a few launch scrubs before Starliner even made it to orbit.

Just as a slew of obstacles and mishaps delayed the launch of the Boeing Starliner time after time, so too has the return of the spacecraft's astronaut crew been postponed again and again.

It took a team of engineers about a month just to get Boeing's CST-100 Starliner prepared for its trip to the International Space Station after its initial launch date on May 6 was scrubbed at the last minute. When the capsule finally reached orbit June 5 while perched atop an Atlas V rocket built by United Launch Alliance, things were finally looking up for Boeing – in both a literal and figurative sense.

The company had for years sought to prove that its Starliner could compete with the likes of Elon Musk's SpaceX as one of two companies making routine trips to orbit on NASA’s behalf. After its first uncrewed test flight in 2019, June's launch marked a critical milestone as Starliner first flight with astronauts aboard.

NASA astronauts Barry ""Butch"" Wilmore and Sunita ""Suni"" Williams were tentatively scheduled to spend little more than a week aboard the space station once their capsule docked on June 6, a day after launching from the Kennedy Space Station in Cape Canaveral, Florida.

But two months after Starliner launched, the pair remain in orbit at the space station with no return date set.

Here's a look at the major moments of the Boeing Starliner's inaugural crewed mission, including scrubs, launch and return delays.

May 6: Starliner launch called off hours of liftoff

Years in the making, the third and final orbital flight test for Starliner was scheduled for launch until it was called off within hours of liftoff when engineers detected an anomaly on the pressure regulation valve in the liquid oxygen tank of the rocket's upper stage, according to NASA. The United Launch Alliance later said in a statement that the cancellation was ""out of an abundance of caution for the safety of the flight and pad crew.""

Days later, Wilmore and Williams return to Houston to spend extra time with their families as mission engineers work to fix the issues ailing Starliner.

NASA eyes May 17 as a potential mission launch after the United Launch Alliance initially said that the launch would not be able to take place any earlier than May 10. Mission engineers requested the extended delay to have time to replace the faulty value, NASA said.

On May 21, the team was able to replace the valve and repressurize the system, but then engineers encountered another obstacle: a small helium leak in Starliner's service module. The issue required the launch date to be pushed back once again, this time indefinitely.

June 1: Starliner prepares to launch again, scrubbed again

On June 1, The Starliner appears poised to finally take off. NASA decided to continue with the launch without repairing the helium leak, as the chemical used in spacecraft thruster systems is not combustible or toxic. However, the launch is once again scrubbed, this time minutes before liftoff due to a computer issue, NASA said on X, formerly Twitter.

The crew passes on a possible launch the next day and NASA instead eyes a launch window beginning June 5.

June 5: Starliner finally launches

On June 5, the Starliner, at long last, launches. Boeing Space shared a post on X at 11:44 a.m. confirming Starliner had reached a stable orbit and had broken away from the Atlas V rocket. From there, the craft began firing its own engines as it powered onward to the space station, NASA said.

The following day, the Starliner docks at 1:34 p.m. EDT on the forward-facing port of the space station's Harmony module. However, the night before, NASA shared an update unveiling that two more helium leaks had been discovered on the spacecraft occurring after Starliner arrived in orbit.

June 9: NASA announces astronauts will not return on date originally planned

Though Wilmore and Williams were only slated to spend a week on the space station, NASA announced on X that the Starliner and its two astronauts would likely land in the New Mexico desert no earlier than June 18. The space agency said the additional time at the space station was for the astronauts to assist with a spacewalk and to allow engineers more time to complete system checkouts of Starliner.

June 14: Astronauts return delayed again

The return is delayed a second time, with the astronauts now slated to undock from the space station no earlier than June 25, landing June 26 at the White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico, Boeing said in an update. While the spacecraft is cleared for crew emergency return scenarios, Boeing said the extra time allows the team to finalize departure planning and operations.

June 21: And again

Boeing and NASA once again delayed the return of Williams and Wilmore until July at the earliest. This time the agencies cite ""a series of planned International Space Station spacewalks while allowing mission teams time to review propulsion system data."" However, the agencies explain that the astronauts are by no means stranded in space, as supplies on the space station are plentiful and the pair can assist in station operations.

July 10: Astronauts aren't 'complaining' about being in space

Wilmore and Williams appear in a NASA telecast from the space station. During separate news conferences, Williams says, ""I'm not complaining, Butch isn't complaining that we're here for a couple extra weeks."" Meanwhile, scientists and engineers work through testing to better understand and resolve problems that occurred during Starliner's launch and flight, including some misfiring thrusters and helium leaks.

July 25: NASA, Boeing say there is still no return date

NASA and Boeing said in a press conference that the Starliner still does not yet have an official return date. However, NASA Commercial Crew Program Manager Steve Stich says, ""We're making great progress.""

Stich also shares that NASA has contingency options for returning Butch and Sunni to Earth, but right now the focus is on finishing up the tasks necessary to do so on Starliner.

August: Astronauts work at space station while planning to return home

Wilmore and Williams, both Navy test pilots before they joined NASA, were to spend their limited time at the space station testing the Starliner spacecraft and its subsystems.

With their stay indefinitely extended, the astronauts, both of whom had ventured to space twice before, have helped the space station crew with other operations while helping plan a return date when they can, NASA and Boeing have said.

Most recently, NASA and Boeing said engineers completed a hot fire test of the Starliner spacecraft’s reaction control system jets on July 27 to evaluate the spacecraft’s propulsion system. Wilmore and Williams were both seated inside the docked spacecraft during the test.

The astronauts then spent Tuesday practicing for undocking during a simulation, Boeing said in a Wednesday update.

Their return to Earth is expected to take place in August ahead of a station crew turnover. Meanwhile, while planning for that return continues into this week, NASA has indicated intentions to host a media briefing to share information about the agency’s ""return readiness review preparations.""

Once Williams and Wilmore are set to return to Earth, the astronauts will board the capsule, which will land in the American Southwest using parachutes that will slow it down to 4 mph before inflating large air bags.

Boeing Starliner timeline before 2024:Starliner has long struggled to keep up with SpaceX

Starliner mission is crucial for Boeing

A successful mission would provide NASA with a second operational spacecraft to carry astronauts to the space station as the U.S. space agency pivots to more partnerships with private industry.

As part of NASA’s commercial crew program, Boeing was awarded $4.8 billion, while its competitor, SpaceX, was awarded $3.1 billion in 2014 to develop their respective spacecraft, Florida Today reported.

But while Boeing's project has lagged behind schedule for years, racking up $1.5 billion in unplanned development costs along the way – as reported by Reuters – SpaceX has already begun reliably transporting astronauts and supplies to the space station.

Boeing's Starliner had conducted two uncrewed missions before Williams and Wilmore went into orbit aboard the Starliner – each plagued by woes and technical issues.

Dozens of software and engineering issues resulted in the failure of the first attempt in 2019 to send an uncrewed Starliner to the space station for a week. While it reached orbit, the capsule failed to reach the space station and instead returned to Earth, according to Florida Today.

The follow-up flight test in 2022 met standards of docking to the space station and successfully landed, but not without the discovery of multiple concerns as Boeing crews inspected the spacecraft later, Florida Today reported.

Needless to say, Boeing's ability to join SpaceX and earn certification from NASA for crewed rotation missions to the space station hinges on what comes next with its Starliner.

"2 months after Starliner launched, astronauts still haven’t returned.",https://www.statesman.com/story/news/nation/2024/08/05/northrop-grumman-nasa-launch-international-space-station-spacex/74672773007/,"A commercial spacecraft bearing scientific experiments and cargo for NASA is on its way to the International Space Station following a successful Sunday launch in Florida.

The resupply run is the 21st commercial services mission that the Virginia aeronautics and defense company Northrop Grumman has undertaken on behalf of the U.S. space agency. After inclement weather delayed the mission's initial planned launch on Saturday, the company's Cygnus spacecraft was able to reach orbit the next morning on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.

Cygnus then managed to reach a safe altitude Sunday afternoon and deploy its two solar arrays needed to generate energy from the overheard sun – despite missing its first burn to orient it on a correct trajectory. Northrop Grumman engineers are working on a new burn and trajectory plan so that the spacecraft can still arrive on time at the space station, NASA said Sunday in a news release.

Here's how to rewatch the launch and what to know about the resupply mission.

Watch livestream of Northrop Grumman launch

Northrop Grumman’s Cygnus spacecraft hitched a ride aboard the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket for a Sunday launch from Florida's Canaveral Space Force Station, located just south of NASA's Kennedy Space Center.

Launched at 11:02 a.m. EDT, the spacecraft is ultimately bound for the International Space Station's orbital laboratory.

The launch marked the second time SpaceX provided launch services for a Northrop Grumman Cygnus resupply mission for NASA after the first mission in January, reported Florida Today, a USA TODAY Network publication.

NASA’s provided live coverage of the launch on NASA+, NASA Television, the NASA app, the space agency's YouTube channel and the agency’s website.

Rewatch the livestream here:

When will the Northrop Grumman capsule reach the International Space Station?

Though the Cygnus spacecraft successfully separated from the Falcon 9 second stage, the craft did not preform its first burn to boost its altitude.

The issue was attributed to a slightly low pressure state, according to NASA, which said nothing indicated that the engine itself has any problem.

If the mission remains on track as expected, Cygnus should arrive early Tuesday at the International Space Station, according to NASA.

The agency announced that it will begin live coverage of the spacecraft’s arrival at 1:30 a.m. Tuesday.

The livestream should provide viewers with a sight of NASA astronauts Matthew Dominick and Jeanette Epps capturing Cygnus using the station’s robotic arm and installing it on the Earth-facing port of the station's Unity module, where the crew lives and works.

What supplies are aboard the Cygnus?

The Cygnus spacecraft is filled with nearly 8,200 pounds of supplies, hardware and other critical materials for dozens of scientific and research experiments, according to NASA.

That includes tests for water recovery technology and supplies needed for a process to produce blood and immune stem cells in microgravity. Also included in the payload are materials to study the effects of spaceflight on engineered liver tissue and microorganism DNA, NASA said.

The Cygnus will also provide the space station crew with a balloon, penny and hexnut for a new STEM demonstration on centripetal force for astronauts to record for students on Earth..

The resupply mission is crucial, NASA said, as it provides the station with tools and materials needed to conduct experiments and research that will lay the groundwork for future exploration of outer space through the agency's Artemis program. The first lunar program since the Apollo era ended in 1972, Artemis aims in the years ahead to send astronauts back to the moon to prepare for inaugural crewed expeditions to Mars.

The Cygnus spacecraft is scheduled to spend nearly six months at the space station before it departs in January, when it will burn up in the Earth's atmosphere. Cygnus also is equipped with the capability to reboost the station’s orbit if need be.

"2 months after Starliner launched, astronauts still haven’t returned.",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/08/05/meteorites-bombarded-moon-atmosphere-exosphere/74675778007/,"The moon may not have any breathable air, but that doesn't mean it has no atmosphere.

Astronomers have for decades been aware of the delicate atmosphere surrounding the moon that is so thin and fragile that it's better referred to as an exosphere. And while scientists have long been stumped as to how that exosphere has managed to hang on, one team of researchers believes they finally have an answer.

Turns out, our planet's singular natural satellite can thank the longevity of its exosphere to the space rocks that have reliably ""bombarded"" it throughout its 4.5 billion-year history, the team wrote in research published this month.

First it was massive meteorites that routinely crashed into the pock-marked moon. More recently, however, it's been smaller, dust-sized “micrometeoroids” that have been constantly colliding into the lunar surface – kicking up soil and lofting up vaporized atom particles into the air in a process the researchers call, ""impact vaporization.""

Some of those atoms are ejected into space. But, crucially, enough of them remain suspended over the moon to sustain its exosphere long enough for more meteorites to pelt the surface, according to the research.

""The (moon's) surface has been continuously bombarded by meteorites,"" lead authorer Nicole Nie, a geochemist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in a statement. ""We show that eventually, a thin atmosphere reaches a steady state because it's being continuously replenished by small impacts all over the moon.""

Starliner timeline:2 months after Starliner launched, astronauts still haven’t returned

LADEE orbiter provides data on moon's exosphere

The moon's heavily cratered surface serves as a testament to how the celestial object has become a figurative magnet for space rocks throughout its long lifespan.

But it wasn't until a NASA lunar orbiter investigated the moon in 2013 that astronomers began to suspect that the exosphere's existence depends on those space rock assaults. The team meticulously studied data from the orbiter, called the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE,) which ultimately spent seven months gathering intel about the moon's atmosphere and conditions near the surface.

Based on LADEE's discoveries, scientists have theorized that two processes could be behind shaping the lunar atmosphere: impact vaporization and “ion sputtering,"" a phenomenon in which solar wind carries energetic charged particles from the sun through space. When these particles hit the moon’s surface, they can transfer their energy to the atoms in the soil and flinging those atoms into the air.

The new analysis that Nie and her colleagues performed led them to confirm that both processes are indeed playing a role.

""During meteorite showers, you see more atoms in the atmosphere, meaning impacts have an effect,"" Nie said in a statement. ""But it also showed that when the moon is shielded from the sun, such as during an eclipse, there are also changes in the atmosphere's atoms, meaning the sun also has an impact.""

Team studies lunar soil from Apollo missions

To determine which process bears more responsibility for the moon's exosphere, the team turned to soil samples collected by astronauts in the Apollo lunar program, which came to an end in 1972.

While studying the samples, the researchers were primarily looking for two elements both known to occur on the moon: potassium and rubidium. Because both elements are easily vaporized, the team reasoned that an analysis of their isotopes – variations of the same elements – would allow them to conclude whether meteorite strikes or solar sputtering contributed more to the moon's atmosphere.

Ultimately, the team determined that the soils contained mostly heavy isotopes of both potassium and rubidium. This told them impact vaporization was the most pivotal process in vaporizing atoms and ejecting them into the moon's atmosphere.

Could other celestial bodies exhibit a similar process?

The findings, the team contends, have implications far beyond determining the moon's atmospheric origins.

In fact, it's not unthinkable that similar processes could potentially be taking place at other celestial bodies in the solar system, including asteroids and other moons, said Justin Hu, a geophysicist at Cambridge University studying lunar soils, who was not part of the study.

“Without these Apollo samples, we would not be able to get precise data and measure quantitatively to understand things in more detail,” Nie concluded. “It’s important for us to bring samples back from the moon and other planetary bodies, so we can draw clearer pictures of the solar system’s formation and evolution.”

The team's research was published Friday in the journal Science Advances.

Perseid meteor shower 2024 peaks this weekend.,https://www.space.com/perseid-meteor-shower-2024-peak,"Every August, just when many people go vacationing in the country where skies are dark, the best-known meteor shower makes its appearance: The Perseids.

This year, the Perseid meteor shower should reach its peak during the overnight hours of late Sunday night into early Monday morning (Aug. 11-12), when there is almost no moon, making the late-night sky nice and dark for shooting star spectators and counters. The first quarter moon sets around 11:20 p.m. local daylight time, leaving the sky nicely dark thereafter. Some Perseids do appear during the evening, but the shower is always better from about 11 p.m. or midnight until the dawn's early light.

Or, to put it another way, expect greater numbers of meteors to be evident during the pre-dawn hours because this is when your side of Earth turns to face the oncoming meteors more directly.

If you want more advice on how to photograph meteor showers like the Perseids, check out our how to photograph meteors and meteor showers guide and if you need imaging gear, consider our best cameras for astrophotography and best lenses for astrophotography.

Where to look

During those after-midnight hours the shower's radiant point (the point from which it appears to originate), located between the Perseus constellation and the 'W' of Cassiopeia, will be getting progressively higher in the northeast — so meteors should flash across all parts of the sky at a rate of about one every minute or two (as seen by a single observer).

That, anyway, is the prediction if your sky is good and dark. But even if you live under moderate light pollution, as unfortunately, most of us do, you can catch at least the brightest of the Perseids. They have often been described in astronomy journals as including ""many bright and fragmenting meteors"" that leave persistent trains in their wake.

The stars of the Cassiopeia and Perseus constellations.I was having a convo with someone last week, maybe Josh about all this (Image credit: TheSkyLive.com)

Earth should go through the thickest part of this ""old faithful"" of meteor showers for many hours centered around 1400 UTC on Aug. 12, which is 10 a.m. on that date Eastern Daylight Time, which is during the daytime across all of North America. So, for meteor watchers here, the night before and perhaps even after could be equally good. Fortunately, the Perseids stay active — about one-quarter their peak strength — for several days before and a day or two after their peak, and an occasional one may be seen almost anytime during the month of August.

A Perseid is one whose path, if traced backward across the sky, intersects a spot between the constellations Perseus and Cassiopeia. Other ""sporadic"" meteors traveling in random directions occur once every 5 or 10 minutes. Two much weaker showers are also active at this time of the year, the Delta Aquarids and Kappa Cygnids.

Lay back, relax, and wait

You'll need no experience to watch the Perseids. Just find a spot with a wide-open sky view and no late-night lights nearby. Bundle up warmly (it can sometimes get chilly even on summer nights), lie back on a ground pad or in a sleeping bag or even better, on a reclining lawn chair, and watch the stars. Also cover exposed parts of your body with mosquito repellent so you won't get bit.

Be patient, and give your eyes sufficient time to dark adapt. The direction to watch is not necessarily toward Perseus but wherever your sky is darkest, probably straight up.

The Perseids are the ionization trails made by little bits of debris from comet 109/P Swift-Tuttle, streaking into Earth's upper atmosphere at 37 miles (60 km) per second. The Perseids were especially dramatic in the early-to-mid 1990s surrounding the year of Swift-Tuttle's most recent return (in December 1992). Since then, however, they've reverted to normal. The comet isn't due back until August in the year 2126.

Startling occurrences

But surprises can always happen.

On the morning of Aug. 14, 2021, the Perseids displayed an unexpected outburst of meteors between 06:00 and 09:00 UT (2 to 5 a.m. EDT). The cause of this outburst is currently unknown but is probably the result of an unknown filament of comet debris produced by Swift-Tuttle as it raced through the inner solar system many centuries ago.

In an announcement on Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams Circular #5016 , the maximum zenithal hourly rate was estimated to be somewhere between 130 and 210, plus or minus 20. Amazing numbers considering that rates are normally 50% lower each preceding night after maximum but these rates are two to three times more than was seen during the expected maximum on the night of Aug. 12-13, 2021.

Four years from now ""might"" bring a truly amazing Perseid display, as some meteor experts are predicting that Earth will interact with a thick knot or clump of meteoric material shed by comet Swift-Tuttle during the 15th century, that possibly could produce a short-lived display of many hundreds of meteors per hour.

Defying predictions

Sometimes, even in years that are deemed favorable for Perseid viewing, sky watchers report seeing only a half or a third as many meteors that were predicted — and yet others report up to twice as many! It has been suggested that the stream of Perseid particles, strung out along its orbit around the sun, has a complex filamentary structure with gaps and rich spots.

Complicating the situation is the fact that some people's eyes seem better suited for meteor work than others.

Regardless of your local viewing circumstances, each year the appearance of the Perseids give many people a reason to head outside and gaze upward at the night sky. Even if you see only a few ""shooting stars,"" all it takes is catching sight of one outstandingly bright meteor to make the viewing experience worthwhile.

A final incentive is to note that next year the moon will be at a waning gibbous phase only a few days past full and will flood the sky with bright light, squelching all but the brightest Perseid streaks. So, take advantage of the favorable conditions provided to us this year.

To one and all we wish good luck and clear skies!"
Perseid meteor shower 2024 peaks this weekend.,https://www.livescience.com/space/meteoroids/the-perseid-meteor-shower-is-about-to-peak-heres-when-to-see-the-most-shooting-stars,"An outburst of Perseid meteors lights up the sky in this time-lapse image. Next week's Perseid meteor shower will be visible overnight on Aug. 11 and Aug.12.

One of the most prolific annual meteor showers of the year, the Perseids, will peak next weekend, bringing up to 75 ""shooting stars"" per hour to the sky Sunday night and early Monday (Aug. 11 to Aug. 12).

Although bright meteors are expected, the display can be significantly affected by strong moonlight. But this year, the moon will set just as strong activity begins to occur from the Perseids, according to the American Meteor Society . The best time to look will be after 1 a.m. local time on Monday, Aug. 12.

Shooting stars are caused by meteoroids . As these tiny particles enter Earth's atmosphere, they heat up and vaporize, releasing energy visible as streaks of light in the night sky. The Perseids move at a swift 37 miles per second (60 kilometers per second), and there are typically between 50 and 75 visible each hour during the peak night. That’s about one per minute, though you'll need to be as far away from light pollution as possible to see an impressive number of shooting stars.

The Perseid meteor shower is known for its fast and bright meteors, according to NASA . The meteors appear to emanate from the constellation Perseus, which is how they get their name. This constellation will rise high in the northwestern sky in the Northern Hemisphere in the hours after midnight, when the most shooting stars are expected to be seen. Also visible in this region of the sky is the Andromeda Galaxy, above Perseus, and the Pleiades, above Mars and Jupiter.

Although next weekend's peak offers the highest frequency of meteors, the Perseids are active from July 14 to Sept. 1, 2024, and ""shooting stars"" can be seen every night.

The visibility of shooting stars depends a lot on the moon's phases . Luckily, on Monday, Aug. 12, a half-lit moon will set about an hour after midnight local time across the Northern Hemisphere, meaning no strong moonlight will interfere with the peak of the Perseids this year. A clear, dark sky is required to see the meteors.

Stargazing binoculars and backyard telescopes are not recommended for seeing meteor showers, as you'll want to let your eyes take in the whole sky to search for shooting stars. However, you'll want to have your stargazing gear ready for other night sky events this year, including planetary conjunctions, supermoons and potentially a very rare comet flyby."
Perseid meteor shower 2024 peaks this weekend.,https://www.lonestarlive.com/news/2024/08/perseid-meteor-shower-2024-peak-when-is-it-and-how-to-get-the-best-view.html,"Conditions should be favorable this year to view the peak of the Perseid meteor shower, which is widely considered to be the best meteor shower of the year.

The Perseid meteor shower will reach its peak the evening of Aug. 11 to 12, with good viewing conditions for a few days on either side of the peak. Skywatchers who look up during the pre-dawn hours could see an average of 50 to 100 meteors, according to NASA.

While the moon will be 44% full on the peak evening, it will set around midnight, leaving the skies dark until dawn and providing ideal viewing conditions for meteor watching.

The Perseid meteor shower, commonly known as the Perseids, is visible annually from mid-July to late August.

The Perseids result from Earth passing through bits of ice and rock left behind by Comet Swift-Tuttle, which last passed close to Earth in 1992.

During the peak around Aug. 11-12, Earth travels through the densest and dustiest part of the comet’s debris. In years without moonlight, the meteor rate appears higher. There can also be outburst years, such as in 2016, when the rate can reach 150 to 200 meteors per hour.

A typical Perseid meteoroid moves at 37 miles per second when it hits Earth’s atmosphere. With swift and bright meteors, Perseids frequently leave long “wakes” of light and color behind them as they streak through Earth’s atmosphere, according to NASA.

The Perseids are also known for their fireballs, which originate from larger particles of cometary material and are brighter than other meteors. Fireballs are larger explosions of light and color that can persist longer than an average meteor streak.

Meteor showers are named after the constellation from which the meteors appear to emanate. From Earth’s perspective, the Perseids’ radiant appears to come approximately from the direction of the Northern Hemisphere constellation Perseus.

How to view Perseid meteor shower

The Perseids are best viewed in the Northern Hemisphere during the pre-dawn hours before the sun rises, though at times it is possible to view meteors from this shower as early as 10 p.m.

Viewing a meteor shower is easy. All you need to catch the show is darkness, somewhere comfortable to sit and a bit of patience. Binoculars and telescopes aren’t needed since you’ll want the widest view of the sky possible.

The Perseids have the bonus of occurring during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere, meaning you won’t have to bundle up when venturing out.

To best see the Perseids, go to the darkest possible location and lean back and relax. Get away from as much light pollution as possible and be sure to allow about 30 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the dark.

Although meteors can come from any direction, you’ll want to generally orient yourself to look to the north toward the Perseus constellation. Though Perseus isn’t the easiest to find, it conveniently follows the brighter and more distinctive constellation Cassiopeia across the night sky."

From views of a brightening Venus after sunset and the appearance of a beautiful crescent moon to the peak of the annual Perseid meteor shower, there is much to see this week (Aug. 5 to Aug. 11) using just your naked eyes.

A good telescope or pair of binoculars will help you see some of the night sky’s fainter objects. However, the unaided eye is enough to learn its stars and constellations , watch the moon , experience meteor showers and see satellites whizz across the night sky.

Read on to find out what you can see in the night sky this week without any equipment, from the moon close to planets and bright stars to catching the ever-changing moon phases , shooting stars and much more.

MONDAY, AUG. 5 — CRESCENT MOON AND VENUS (AFTER SUNSET)

A 2%-illuminated crescent moon will be a challenging sight after sunset, but Venus will help. (Image credit: Starry Night)

Look to the west immediately after the sun has set, and you will see Venus shining very close to a super-slim crescent moon. This will be a challenging sight since the sky will still be relatively bright as the pair sinks close to the horizon.

TUESDAY, AUG. 6 — CRESCENT MOON AND VENUS (AFTER SUNSET)

Look to the west after sunset to see a slim crescent moon and Venus. (Image credit: Starry Night)

A waxing crescent moon will shine due west after sunset. It will no longer be close to Venus, but look to the moon’s lower right, and you’ll see the sixth-largest planet in the solar system shining brightly in its new apparition as the "" Evening Star ."" Over the next few nights, the moon will get brighter as it gets further from Venus, which will climb higher into the post-sunset sky until January, growing brighter as it seeps into a later, darker twilight.

WEDNESDAY, AUG. 7 — CRESCENT MOON, VENUS AND SPICA (AFTER SUNSET)

A waxing crescent moon will be visible between Venus and the bright star Spica. (Image credit: Starry Night)

A brighter, more obvious crescent moon will tonight be positioned about halfway between Venus, to its lower right, and bright star Spica, to its upper left. One of the 20 brightest stars in the night sky, Spica is the brightest star in the constellation Virgo .

THURSDAY, AUG. 8 — CRESCENT MOON, VENUS AND SPICA (AFTER SUNSET)

Look for “Earthshine” on the waxing crescent moon as it moves between Venus and Spica. (Image credit: Starry Night)

Here's another chance to see the crescent moon dominating the post-sunset evening sky, with Venus shining stubbornly close to the western horizon. Look at the moon's dark left side. Can you make out any details? Since no sunlight shines directly on it, it should be dark, right?

The light you can see is called ""Planet-shine,"" ""Earthshine,"" or ""Da Vinci Glow."" It's sunlight shining on Earth and reflecting onto the moon. It's easiest to see in a crescent moon a few days old.

FRIDAY, AUG. 9 — SATURDAY, AUGUST 10 - CRESCENT MOON, SPICA, ANTARES AND THE MILKY WAY (AFTER SUNSET)

Visible for about two hours after sunset will be a crescent moon close to Spica. (Image credit: Starry Night)

About a quarter of the moon's Earth-facing side is now lit by the sun. Across two nights, it will appear on either side of Spica. Arcturus in the constellation Boötes will appear directly above the pair, while to the south, the Milky Way will rise after dark. However, to see the arc of our galaxy, you'll need to be well away from light pollution.

SUNDAY, AUG. 11 — MONDAY, AUG. 12: PERSEID METEORS PEAK (PRE-DAWN)

It may not be the most prolific meteor shower of the year (that distinction goes to December's Geminids and January’s Quadrantids ), but there's no better time to see shooting stars from the northern hemisphere than tonight. At its peak, the annual Perseid meteor shower can produce around 60 meteors per hour visible in the night sky. The radiant point (where the meteors will appear to emanate from) will be the constellation Perseus , which will rise in the northeastern sky around midnight.

Meteor showers can often be marred by strong moonlight, but not so the Perseids this year since the First Quarter Moon will set around midnight. Look skywards during the early hours of Monday for the best chance of shooting stars, though light pollution and the clarity of the sky will make a huge difference. If you can, get away from light pollution — at least 40 miles from a major urban area is wise — but wherever you watch from, make sure don’t have any artificial lights in your line of sight. Sit back, relax in a lawn chair, keep warm, and take regular breaks. Never look at your smartphone; its white light will ruin your eyes’ dark adaption, which takes about 20 minutes to cultivate and just a single second of white light to ruin.

The biggest meteor shower of the year is set to peak this month, just days before the first supermoon of 2024.

The Perseid meteor shower has been visible since mid-July but is expected to peak on the night of 11 August, with up to 100 ‘shooting stars’ appearing each hour until dawn.

Before the meteors disappear for another year at the end of the month, a full moon on 19 August will appear bigger and brighter in the sky alongside them as the Earth’s natural satellite approaches the closest point of its orbit.

The occurrence of a bright supermoon is typically not good for stargazing or meteor watching, however on the night of the Perseids peak the Moon will set at midnight.

The Moon setting combined with warm conditions make it an ideal opportunity to witness the celestial spectacle, with scientists from Nasa and the European Space Agency (ESA) saying the best time to see them will be the pre-dawn hours before sunrise..

“The Perseid meteor shower, which peaks in mid-August, is considered the best meteor shower of the year,” Nasa notes on its website.

“With swift and bright meteors, Perseids frequently leave long ‘wakes’ of light and colour behind them as they streak through Earth’s atmosphere.”

The US space agency said skygazers can expect between 50 to 100 meteors per hour during its peak, with no need for specialist viewing equipment like telescopes or binoculars to view them.

The ESA advises people to head to an area with minimal light pollution and to avoid looking at screens or other bright objects for half an hour to allow your eyes to adjust to the darkness.

Several observatories are expected to live stream the night sky on the night that the Perseids peak, with telescopes pointed to the section of sky from which they emerge.

The bright meteor streaks occur as the Earth passes through the tail of the Comet Swift-Tuttle, causing debris to burn up in the Earth’s atmosphere at temperatures of up to 1,650 degrees Celsius - meaning the space rocks are unlikely to reach the ground intact."
Perseid meteor shower 2024 peaks this weekend.,https://1440wrok.com/illinois-sees-the-perseid-meteor-showers-this-weekend/,"If you're interested in catching what might be 2024's best meteor shower, this weekend's peak of the Perseid meteor shower should be the one that you're looking for.

The Perseids seem to realize that there's a fan base here on Earth, so they hang around the early morning skies for pretty decent amount of time, starting in mid-July and wrapping up in early September. Shooting stars from the Perseid meteor shower can be seen the entire time, but the peak, or best viewing times, are coming up this weekend.

They just got started on July 14th (people have already been reporting on their activities), and they'll do their thing in the heavens until around the first week of September, with the absolute best viewing being on Sunday, August 11th and Monday, August 12th.

Hope you don't mind getting up a bit early for the best show.

The People Who Know About These Things Are Really, Really Into The Perseid Meteor Shower, Calling It The ""Gold Standard"" Of Meteor Showers

Many experts are saying that more than 70 shooting stars is a genuine possibility, but Space.com is of the opinion that the show could be even better than that:

The shower peaks around August 11th and 12th, when Earth travels through the densest and dustiest part of this debris. In years without moonlight, the meteor rate appears higher, and during outburst years (such as 2016), the rate can reach 150-200 meteors per hour.

Obviously, having a clear, dark, moonlight-free atmosphere makes for the best viewing, and it looks like Illinois' skies are planning on being somewhat cooperative during this year's peak of the Perseids.

Let's Get To What You Need To Know If Catching The Perseid Meteor Shower Is Something You'd Be Interested In Doing This Coming Weekend

Unless you're someone with lots of stargazing equipment at your fingertips, you should be happy to know that catching the Perseid meteor shower does not require a telescope or binoculars at all. And, because the half-lit moon will set around midnight, you won't get lunar interference with your viewing, either.

Perseid meteor shower 2024 peaks this weekend.,https://kawarthanow.com/2024/08/05/this-years-perseid-meteor-shower-peaks-on-august-11-and-12/,"Every August, stargazers look forward with excitement to the annual Perseid meteor shower. This year’s meteor shower will peak on Sunday and Monday (August 11 and 12), with 50 to 75 meteors visible per hour if you are in a dark location.

Every year from late July to early August, Earth plows through the interplanetary debris left behind by comet Swift-Tuttle when it passed close to Earth (the last time was in 1992). When the particles of debris — which can be as small as a grain of sand or as big as a pea — slam into the Earth’s atmosphere at around 210,000 kilometres per hour, they heat up to 1,650 degrees Celsius and are vaporized in a burst of heat and light, resulting in a “shooting star.”

The meteors are called the Perseids because they appear to originate from the northeast sky in the direction of the constellation of Perseus.

While the Perseid meteor shower has been active since mid-July, the Earth goes through the densest area of the comet’s debris field between 9 a.m. and noon on Monday (August 12). Because meteors aren’t visible during the daylight hours, you’ll need to watch for them instead on Sunday night or Monday night, with the best times after midnight (when the first-quarter moon has set) until before dawn.

The Peterborough Astronomical Association will be hosting a Perseid meteor shower event from 9 to 11 p.m. on Monday (August 12) at Harold Town Conservation Area (2611 Old Norwood Road, Peterborough).

The family-friendly event is free and open to the public. Although optical aids are not needed to see meteors, association members will have telescopes and binoculars set up to view other wonders of the night sky. As with being able to see the meteor shower on your own, the event is weather dependent and will be cancelled if skies are cloudy.

Tips for viewing the Perseid meteor shower

Find the darkest place you can, away from any light pollution, with as much open sky as possible. Rural areas away from city lights with few buildings or trees are the best. If you can’t get away from your city, find a park or golf course.

Lie on your back and take in as much of the night sky as possible. You don’t have to face Perseus (to the northeast) to see the meteor shower, but the more sky you can see, the better your chances.

Be prepared to stay outside for at least an hour. It takes 20 to 30 minutes for your eyes to fully adjust to the darkness, and the meteors come in spurts and lulls — so the longer you wait, the more you’ll see.

Stay awake. The Perseids are typically best between midnight and dawn, with the hours before dawn being the best time. During the peak night, the early morning of August 12th, wait until the moon sets at midnight."

The Perseid meteor shower, widely considered the best meteor shower of the year, is predicted to reach its peak on Monday, Aug. 12 or Tuesday, Aug. 13.

Christened in honor of the meteors’ radiant constellation Perseus the Hero, the Perseid shower will produce as many as 100 meteors per hour at its peak. (It’s worth noting that they actually come from a comet called 109P/Swift-Tuttle, not the constellation.)

The pre-dawn hours of Monday and Tuesday are the best time to see the Perseids around here, but if getting up early isn’t your thing, some meteors will be visible as early as 10 p.m. And if you want to get an advanced viewing, PARI — one of only two Dark Sky Parks in NC — is hosting a guided experience on Friday, Aug. 9."

The Perseid meteor shower , which is well-known for its high meteor frequency , is about to peak. Next weekend, specifically from Sunday night to early Monday morning, August 11 to 12, will be its busiest. Up to 75 meteors per hour were visible to observers during this peak period of time, as per the reports of MSN.Moonlight can affect Perseid meteor visibility even though they are usually brilliant. The moon will set this year, though, right before the Perseids are predicted to be at their most active. The American Meteor Society reports that on Monday, August 12, after one in the morning local time will be the best time to see. An hour after midnight, the half-lit moon will set, providing pristine, black skies for stargazers to enjoy.Meteoroids that penetrate Earth's atmosphere are what generate the dazzling streaks referred to as shooting stars . These tiny particles evaporate and heat up, leaving behind visible light trails. The Perseids move at a velocity of sixty kilometers per second, or 37 miles per second. During the peak, observers can typically see 50 to 75 meteors every hour, or roughly one meteor per minute.

The annual Perseid meteor shower, considered to be one of the best meteor showers of the year because of its many bright shooting stars, has started to put on its annual show and will soon be peaking.

The 2024 Perseid shower is expected to be a very good one for people willing to stay awake and do some stargazing after midnight, according to astronomy experts at EarthSky.org and Sky & Telescope. They say the moon will be in its first-quarter phase, with about 50% illumination, when the Perseid meteor shower reaches its peak activity on Aug. 12.

“The best time to watch for Perseids will be starting around midnight (when the moon will be setting) until dawn,” EarthSky says. “This shower rises to a peak gradually, then falls off rapidly. And Perseid meteors tend to strengthen in number as late night deepens into the wee hours before dawn. The shower is often best just before dawn.”

To boost your chances of seeing some shooting stars this month, the EarthSky website says skywatchers should find a dark location — as far away as possible from bright city lights and street lights — and look up after midnight on Aug. 11, Aug. 12 and Aug. 13.

The Perseid meteor shower is most active in August, generating as many as 50 to 100 meteors per hour on its peak nights in dark locations.NJ Advance Media | Canva

Plenty of shooting stars

The Perseid meteor shower can generate as many as 50 to 100 meteors per hour in dark locations, assuming skies in your viewing area are clear.

If you don’t have an opportunity to scan the sky between Aug. 11 and Aug. 13, you still have a shot at seeing some Perseid meteors on other nights or in the pre-dawn hours. This popular meteor shower started producing small numbers of shooting stars in mid-July and will continue to do so through Sept. 1.

The biggest number of meteors, however, are expected around Aug. 12 because that’s when the Earth will be moving through the largest field of debris from the tail of a comet known as Comet Swift-Tuttle. The comet zips around the sun and leaves a trail of tiny ice and rock particles, and every August our planet passes through the debris.

Even though the particles are very small, when skywatchers on Earth see some of the fragments, they look like shooting stars streaking across the sky. And some look like big, bright fireballs.

“The meteors are colorful. And they frequently leave persistent trains,” EarthSky.org says. “All of these factors make the Perseid shower perhaps the most beloved meteor shower for the Northern Hemisphere.”

This meteor shower is known as the Perseids because “the radiant — the area of the sky where the meteors seem to originate — is located near the prominent constellation of Perseus the hero when at maximum activity,” the American Meteor Society notes.

Viewing tips for Perseid meteor shower

You can see the Perseid meteors from almost anywhere, but experts say you increase your chances of getting a good view if you go to a park or open area in a rural place, away from bright lights.

You don’t need a telescope or binoculars — just your eyes. But you should give your eyes about 20 minutes to adjust to the dark when you’re looking up into the night or early morning sky.

And EarthSky’s astronomy experts say if you’re looking for the Perseids, don’t be in a rush. “Give yourself at least an hour of observing time,” they say, “because the meteors in meteor showers come in spurts and are interspersed with lulls.”

The spectacular Perseids meteor shower peaks every August, and this year the 'shooting star' display will be most obvious overnight on Sunday 11 to Monday 12 August.

Expect a dramatic display of light trails as the Earth travels through rocks and dust left by comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle. They burn up in our atmosphere leaving bright streaks in the night sky."
Perseid meteor shower 2024 peaks this weekend.,https://www.sanmarcosrecord.com/features/annual-perseid-meteor-shower-takes-skies-august-10-12,"Thanks to the efforts of Dark Skies programs sprinkled throughout the Hill Country, Central Texas has a number of prime locations for stargazing. This is good news for people hoping to make wishes on some falling stars this August during the Perseid Meteor Shower.

Regarded as one of the most reliable meteor showers in the celestial calendar, the Perseids run from July 14 to Sept. 1, with its peak hitting on the weekend of Aug. 11-12.

“The Perseids meteor shower comes from the comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle,” Alan Martinez, Texas State Astronomy student and webmaster for the University’s Astronomy Club, said. “It’s a comet in Jupiter's orbit, and every year as the comet gets closer to the sun in its orbit, it begins sublimating material off its surface.”

This summer, Martinez is studying Swift-Tuttle and was excited to share information about the comet as it traverses through the solar system, causing the annual light shower we know as the Perseids.

“Think throwing a piece of really dirty dry ice and seeing the vapor path as it's in the air,” Martinez said. “Ultimately, that material is carried toward Earth where it enters our atmosphere and results in those really cool meteors that we see.”

For the best meteor-shower viewing (and optimal wish-making), stargazers are encouraged to find a destination where the stars will be unobstructed by light pollution. This is where all of us in the Hill Country are in luck, because Central Texas is home to six of the state’s seven certified Dark Skies communities, including Bee Cave, Blanco, Dripping Springs, Fredericksburg, Horseshoe Bay and Wimberley Valley. These Dark Skies locations have passed smart-lighting ordinances in order to shield the area from encroaching light pollution. Dripping Springs was the first community in Texas — and only the sixth in the world — to become a certified Dark Sky Community. With Blanco and Wimberley joining the initiative, these towns have broadened the commitment and scope of protecting the night sky within the Hill Country.

Though Martinez will be completing his internship program in Houston at the time of the Perseids, he recommends driving out to Wimberley to view the meteor shower. “It’s an official Dark Sky community away from some of the light pollution of I-35,” Martinez said. “The absolute best times to see meteors would be between midnight and sunrise, but some should still be visible earlier in the night if you're lucky. There should be around 90 meteors per hour, which is pretty awesome.”

Additionally, with the moon phase a waxing crescent at only 41% full, that natural light will have little impact on viewing the meteors as they streak across the sky.

Other nearby meteor shower locations include Enchanted Rock State Natural Area, which is designated an International Dark Sky Park. Campers in the park can enjoy an unobstructed view of Big Sky Country. Sunday to Monday night reservations are available, and due to the date being at the start of the week, the park probably won’t be crowded. Reservations can be made online at tpwd.texas.gov/stateparks/ reservations or by calling 512-389-8900.

According to the American Meteor Society, viewers will have best results around 2 a.m., when the constellation of Perseus will be highest in the night sky. Stargazers don’t need to look directly at Perseus — or even know the constellation’s exact location in the night sky — to see the meteors.

However, for San Marcans curious to learn more about the night sky, the constellations and other exciting celestial phenomena, the Texas State Astronomy Club hosts public observatory nights every Wednesday from 7:30 - 9 p.m. during the Fall semester (if the skies are clear).

“We also got funded a brand-new telescope for our observatory dome, so hopefully it will be up and running this Fall for everyone to check out,” Martinez said. “The home telescope had been broken for the past couple years, so we had been getting by with our other — equally cook in my opinion — scopes, which we typically pull out.”

Pending clear skies, the next public observatory night will be Wednesday, Sept. 11 at 7:30 p.m. Check the organization’s website at astrotxst.org or visit its Instagram and Facebook at @astrotxst for updates. The Texas State Observatory is located on the roof of the Supple Science Building on Vista St. It is a nonprofit organization run solely by Texas State students.

The next meteor shower will be the Orionids, which are a medium- strength shower set to peak Oct. 20. In a normal year, the Orionids produce between 10-20 meteors per hour, but because the full moon occurs on the 17th of that month, the waning gibbous moon phrase will interfere with the viewing of this shower. However, the Orionids run from Sept. 26 to Nov. 22 — a rather long duration — thus giving night sky observers opportunities to catch these super-streaking meteors that occasionally produce bright fireballs. Watch for Orionid meteors on the mornings of Oct. 20 and 21, right after midnight and until dawn. The radiant centers on the Orion constellation, easily identifiable by the straight line of stars that form Orion’s belt, and is highest in the sky around 2 a.m.

"Injectable goo could fix joints without surgery, early study suggests.",https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/injectable-goo-could-fix-joints-without-surgery-early-study-suggests,"The newly developed goo is pictured here in high resolution under a microscope. Tiny fibers within the goo are shown in pink, along with a chemical called hyaluronic acid (purple) that stimulates cartilage growth.

Scientists have invented an injectable ""goo"" that can regrow cartilage in the body. For now, they've only tested it in sheep, but it could someday be used to repair joint damage in humans, the researchers say.

In particular, they hope the goo can treat damage caused by degenerative diseases, such as osteoarthritis, and sports-related injuries, including anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears.

Cartilage is a strong, flexible tissue that lines the surface of joints , such as the knees. It cushions the joints and prevents the bones within them from grinding against one another during movement. But as we age, the cartilage in our joints gradually deteriorates. It can also become damaged by injury or as a result of chronic overuse . As the cartilage wears away, people may experience joint pain and struggle to walk .

""When cartilage becomes damaged or breaks down over time, it can have a great impact on people's overall health and mobility,"" co-study author Samuel Stupp , director of Northwestern University's Simpson Querrey Institute for BioNanotechnology, said in a statement . ""The problem is that, in adult humans, cartilage does not have an inherent ability to heal.""

That's largely because cartilage doesn't have an active blood supply . As a result, surgery is often needed to repair damaged tissue.

One of the main treatments for cartilage damage is microfracture surgery . During this procedure, surgeons remove damaged cartilage and then create holes in the underlying bone. This enables blood containing specialized growth chemicals to flow into the area, which then triggers cartilage growth. However, often the cartilage that forms after this surgery — fibrocartilage — is weaker and less resistant to wear and tear than the cartilage normally found in joints, called hyaline cartilage.

Now, Stupp and his colleagues have created a type of injectable biomaterial that can regenerate the hyaline cartilage in joints. They described their invention in a study published Monday (Aug. 5) in the journal PNAS .

""Our new therapy can induce repair in a tissue that does not naturally regenerate,"" Stupp said.

Once injected into a joint, a protein within the goo recruits a chemical in the body called transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-b1), which promotes cartilage repair. The goo also contains a type of complex carbohydrate, or polysaccharide, called hyaluronic acid, which can coax stem cells into forming cartilage .

The researchers tested the goo in sheep that had a type of cartilage defect in their stifle joint — a complex joint that resembles the human knee and is found in the upper back legs of four-legged animals.

Within six months of the one-time injection being delivered, the goo triggered noticeable cartilage growth and enhanced repair in the animals' damaged joints. The new biomaterial performed better than injections of just TGF-b1, which were given to a comparison group of sheep. Importantly, the structure of the new cartilage in the sheep treated with the goo resembled that of hyaline cartilage, the team found.

With further research and development, the team hopes that the goo will produce similar results in humans.

""By regenerating hyaline cartilage, our approach should be more resistant to wear and tear [than microfracture surgery],"" Stupp said.

This could fix the ""problem of poor mobility and joint pain for the long term while also avoiding the need for joint reconstruction with large pieces of hardware,"" such as prosthetic joints, he said. The hope is that, eventually, something like the new biomaterial could be used to prevent the need for full knee-replacement surgeries."

An international research team has made a groundbreaking discovery, identifying potential signs of an intermediate-mass black hole within the IRS 13 star cluster near the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy.

This finding provides new insights into the role such black holes play in the formation of supermassive black holes and the dynamics of star clusters.

Unveiling a New Type of Black Hole Near the Galactic Center

While researching a cluster of stars in the immediate vicinity of the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) at the center of our galaxy, an international team of researchers led by PD Dr. Florian Peißker has found signs of another, intermediate-mass black hole.

Intermediate-mass black holes, which have masses between stellar-mass and supermassive black holes, are rare and challenging to detect. Despite enormous research efforts, only about ten of these intermediate-mass black holes have been found in our entire universe so far.

Scientists believe that they formed shortly after the Big Bang. By merging, they act as ‘seeds’ for supermassive black holes, suggesting that such black holes, previously rare in observations, play a critical role in forming supermassive black holes. This discovery marks a significant milestone in our understanding of black hole formation and the evolution of galaxies.

Analyzing the IRS 13 Star Cluster

The analyzed star cluster IRS 13 is located 0.1 light years from the center of our galaxy. This is very close in astronomical terms, but would still require traveling from one end of our solar system to the other twenty times to cover the distance. The researchers noticed that the stars in IRS 13 move in an unexpectedly orderly pattern.

They had actually expected the stars to be arranged randomly. Two conclusions can be drawn from this regular pattern: On the one hand, IRS 13 appears to interact with Sgr A*, which leads to the orderly motion of the stars. On the other hand, there must be something inside the cluster for it to be able to maintain its observed compact shape.

The team’s detailed analysis of IRS 13 has revealed the intricate dynamics at play within this star cluster and its interaction with the surrounding environment.

Evidence Supporting the Intermediate-Mass Black Hole

Multi-wavelength observations with the Very Large Telescope as well as the ALMA and Chandra telescopes now suggest that the reason for the compact shape of IRS 13 could be an intermediate-mass black hole located at the center of the star cluster.

This would be supported by the fact that the researchers were able to observe characteristic X-rays and ionized gas rotating at a speed of several hundred kilometers per second in a ring around the suspected location of the intermediate-mass black hole. These high-energy emissions are indicative of the presence of a black hole, as the intense gravitational pull heats the surrounding material to extreme temperatures, causing it to emit X-rays.

Another indication of the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole is the unusually high density of the star cluster, which is higher than that of any other known density of a star cluster in our Milky Way. The combination of these observational signatures provides strong evidence for the existence of the intermediate-mass black hole within IRS 13.

""This fascinating star cluster has continued to surprise the scientific community ever since it was discovered around twenty years ago. At first, it was thought to be an unusually heavy star. With the high-resolution data, however, we can now confirm the building-block composition with an intermediate-mass black hole at the center,” said Dr. Florian Peißker.

Planned observations with the James Webb Space Telescope and the Extremely Large Telescope, which is currently under construction, will provide further insights into the processes within the star cluster.

These advanced telescopes will allow scientists to gather more detailed data and confirm the presence of the intermediate-mass black hole, shedding light on the mechanisms that lead to the formation of supermassive black holes and the evolution of star clusters in the Milky Way.

Understanding the role of intermediate-mass black holes in galactic dynamics is crucial for piecing together the history of our galaxy and the universe.

Implications for Future Research

The discovery of an intermediate-mass black hole within the IRS 13 star cluster near the center of our galaxy offers a new perspective on the formation and growth of supermassive black holes.

This finding underscores the importance of multi-wavelength observations and high-resolution data in uncovering the hidden dynamics of star clusters and black holes. The IRS 13 cluster’s proximity to Sgr A* provides a unique laboratory for studying the interplay between star clusters and black holes in a highly dynamic environment.

Future research with next-generation telescopes promises to deepen our understanding of these cosmic phenomena and their role in the broader context of galaxy formation and evolution. As scientists continue to explore the mysteries of black holes, discoveries like this one will help to unravel the complex processes that shape the cosmos.

The identification of an intermediate-mass black hole within the IRS 13 star cluster signifies a major advancement in our knowledge of black holes and their role in the universe."

The moon's thin atmosphere is made by constant meteorite bombardment.,https://www.news9live.com/science/meteorite-bombardment-creates-wispy-atmosphere-on-moon-2643858,"Meteorite bombardment creates wispy atmosphere on Moon

The research is based on samples returned by the Apollo missions decades ago.

New Delhi: The Moon has a thin and wispy atmosphere, discovered by the Apollo astronauts in 1971. Researchers have now been able to determine that the lunar dust lofted by a constant rain of micrometeorites is the primary reason for the atmosphere of the Moon. The tenuous lunar atmosphere is called an exosphere, with at least 70 per cent of the gas envelop around the Moon formed because of micrometeorite impacts. The research was conducted using lunar samples returned by the Apollo missions.

The haze of atoms in the lunar atmosphere either escape into space or fall back on the surface. Previously, scientists had hypothesized two major sources of the lunar atmosphere, the constant impact by micrometeorites, and solar wind made up of energetic particles streaming out of the Sun. The researchers looked at Moon rocks exposed to the exosphere for millions of years. If the solar wind was primarily responsible for the lunar atmosphere, then it would consist of a greater proportion of lighter isotopes of potassium and rubidium. However, if the micrometeorite impacts were the primary sources of the lunar atmosphere, then there would be an even distribution of isotopes.

Patterns in the isotopes

When the Apollo samples were first returned, scientists did not have the technology necessary for differentiating between the isotopes of potassium and rubidium, technology that exists today. Examining 10 samples of lunar soil, or regolith, revealed that the lunar atmosphere was primarily formed because of micrometeorite impacts rather than solar wind.

A paper describing the findings has been published in Science Advances. One of the study authors, Timo Hopp says, “The regolith that covers the moon has been in direct exchange with its exosphere for billions of years. This has left traces that can be measured in the laboratory.” Another study author Nicolas Dauphas says, “We anticipate that this study is going to be a significant foundation on which further studies can be done on samples returned from the lunar surface by the Chang’E and Artemis missions. It is an exciting time to be working on the Moon.”"

Scientists have concluded in a recent research that continuous bombardment by tiny meteorites on the Moon's surface has helped shape the composition of the Lunar atmosphere.

Knewz.com has learned that scientists have long been searching for a conclusive theory that accounts for the formation and sustenance of the Moon's atmosphere, which is rich in atomic particles.

A team of scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the University of Chicago have been working to unravel the mysteries of the lunar atmosphere when they discovered what sustains it.

The team found that the Moon is constantly being bombarded by something they called ""micrometeorites,"" which are comparable to a grain of sand in terms of size.

These tiny meteorites vaporize themselves and minute bits from the lunar surface upon impact, as their atoms rise into the atmosphere.

While scientists previously theorized that this phenomenon, called ""impact vaporization,"" and the solar winds experienced by the satellite were what shaped the Moon's atmosphere, they were not completely sure of the relative importance of the two factors.

However, Nicole Nie, an assistant professor in MIT’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences and lead author of the research, said that their study can now provide ""a definitive answer.""

""Meteorite impact vaporization is the dominant process that creates the lunar atmosphere,"" Nie said in a statement.

""The moon is close to 4.5 billion years old, and through that time the surface has been continuously bombarded by meteorites. We show that eventually, a thin atmosphere reaches a steady state because it’s being continuously replenished by small impacts all over the moon,"" he added.

The paper based on their research called the process ""space weathering"" and wrote that a major consequence of the phenomenon ""is the production of tenuous, collisionless, gravitationally bound atmospheres (exospheres) surrounding planetary bodies such as the Moon and Mercury.""

Around 70% of the atoms present in the Moon's atmosphere can be attributed to ""impact vaporization."" BY: MEGA

To establish ""impact vaporization"" as the more significant process involved in the formation of the Moon's atmosphere, the team of scientists analyzed the soil samples brought back from the lunar surface by Apollo astronauts.

The scientists focused more on the elements potassium and rubidium—both of which are more susceptible to getting vaporized upon impact, as well as under the influence of solar winds.

""The key to their discovery lay in the way different processes affect these isotopes. Micrometeorite impacts and solar wind sputtering leave distinct isotopic fingerprints in the lunar soil. By carefully analyzing these patterns, the researchers were able to determine the dominant force shaping the Moon’s atmosphere over time,"" it has been reported.

The research concluded that impact vaporization accounts for around 70% of the atomic particles present in the Moon's atmosphere.

The latest research also underlined the significance of the Apollo missions. BY: MEGA

In addition to establishing this theory and mapping a rough history of the lunar atmosphere, the latest research – which was published in the journal Science Advances – also underlined the significance of the Apollo missions.

""Without these Apollo samples, we would not be able to get precise data and measure quantitatively to understand things in more detail. It’s important for us to bring samples back from the moon and other planetary bodies, so we can draw clearer pictures of the solar system’s formation and evolution,"" lead author Nie said, according to reports."
Scientists want to safeguard Earth’s species by cryogenically preserving them on the planet.,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/05/science/cryogenic-repository-moon-scli-intl/index.html,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

CNN —

A group of scientists has devised a plan to safeguard Earth’s species in a cryogenic biorepository on the moon.

Intended to save species in the event of a disaster on Earth, the plan makes use of craters that are permanently in shadow and therefore cold enough to allow cryogenic preservation of biological material without using electricity or liquid nitrogen, according to research from a group led by scientists at the Smithsonian, published last week.

The paper, published in the journal BioScience, draws on the successful cryopreservation of skin samples from a fish, and outlines a method for creating a biorepository that would keep samples of other species safe.

“Initially, a lunar biorepository would target the most at-risk species on Earth today, but our ultimate goal would be to cryopreserve most species on Earth,” said Mary Hagedorn, a research cryobiologist at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute (NZCBI) and lead author of the paper.

“We hope that by sharing our vision, our group can find additional partners to expand the conversation, discuss threats and opportunities and conduct the necessary research and testing to make this biorepository a reality.”

The idea of the lunar biorepository is inspired by the Global Seed Vault in Svalbard, in Norway’s Arctic, which stores more than a million seed varieties with the aim of safeguarding crop diversity.

The vault was threatened by a flood of meltwater from thawing permafrost in 2017, highlighting the dangers posed by climate change, according to the statement.

Although plant cells can be stored in Arctic conditions, animal cells must be kept even colder, at at least -320 degrees Fahrenheit or -196 degrees Celsius, to be preserved.

In order to reach the required temperatures on earth, a supply of liquid nitrogen, electricity and human staff are required.

But in the event of a global disaster, the supply of any of these three elements could be vulnerable, putting the mooted biorepository in danger.

To reduce this risk, Hagedorn and the team thought about how cryopreservation could be achieved passively, which is impossible on Earth, and alighted on the moon.

The lunar polar regions are home to craters that are in permanent shadow due to their orientation and depth, and can reach temperatures as low as -410 degrees Fahrenheit (-246 degrees Celsius).

The team then considered how to block radiation that would damage the DNA of the samples, and propose storing them underground or inside a structure with walls made from lunar rocks. Further research is needed to study the effects of radiation exposure on cryopreserved samples, as well as the effects of microgravity, according to the statement.

“We aren’t saying what if the Earth fails – if the Earth is biologically destroyed this biorepository won’t matter,” Hagedorn said in the statement.

“This is meant to help offset natural disasters and, potentially, to augment space travel. Life is precious and, as far as we know, rare in the universe. This biorepository provides another, parallel approach to conserving Earth’s precious biodiversity,” she said.

Rob Brooker, head of ecological sciences at the James Hutton Institute in Scotland, who was not involved in the research, said the paper “is an interesting and provocative article that highlights the loss of Earth’s biodiversity and the critical need to increase our efforts for nature conservation.”

“However, a major concern is that the cost and effort involved in establishing such a resource on the moon would be very substantial, and would detract from ongoing conservation efforts including delivering existing international commitments and plans to protect nature,” Brooker told CNN.

Sally Keith, a senior lecturer in Marine Biology at Lancaster University, who was not involved in the research, had similar concerns.

“The broad approach offers an interesting thought experiment and might lead to innovative technological development, however, I am hard-pressed to see its use in the urgent fight to minimise rapid biodiversity loss,” she told CNN, adding: “How many forests, coral reefs and freshwater lakes could be better conserved right now, for the cost of launching a rocket to the moon?”"

NASA made a World-Shaking Discovery: Compelling Evidence of Past Life on Mars.,https://www.yahoo.com/news/nasa-made-world-shaking-discovery-120000819.html,"In its ancient past, Mars likely contained many of the necessarily ingredients for microbial life to flourish on its surface.

Now, a new discovery by NASA’s Perseverance rover shows a trifecta of compelling evidence—including the presence of water, organic compounds, and a chemical energy source—all on one rock located in the Jezero Crater.

Although this is the best clue yet that microbial life existed on Mars, there are still other explanations that could explain this geologic display without the existence of microbes.

“Is there life on Mars” is a question that has vexed astrobiologists and David Bowie alike. While the latter imagined some macabre collection of arachnids on the Red Planet, NASA scientists are fixated on finding evidence that microbial life once flourished on the fourth rock from the Sun. So fixated, in fact, that the space agency has spent more than $5 billion getting two immensely complicated robotic rovers—Curiosity and Perseverance—onto the Martian surface with this specific microbial mission in mind.

Now, one of those rovers might’ve discovered one of the most compelling pieces of evidence for Martian microbial life. Located on an arrowhead-shaped, three-foot-long rock nicknamed “Cheyava Falls” in the Jezero Crater (the 28-mile-wide crater that Perseverance has called home for the past three years), this “piece of evidence” is actually a trifecta of data points that suggest the presence of past microbial life. The rock in question features two vertical veins of calcium sulfate that likely formed from past water, and these stripes both flank a red band of rock filled with “leopard spots.”

NASA has discovered evidence of past water on Mars before, but it’s this narrow band of rock that brings new meaning to this discovery. Using its SHERLOC (Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman & Luminescence for Organics & Chemicals) and PIXL (Planetary Instrument for X-Ray Lithochemistry) instruments, Perseverance determined the existence of organic compounds within the rock. Oh, and those “leopard spots?” Those likely indicate chemical reactions that could’ve supplied energy to ancient microbial Martians.

While each of these discoveries—the presence of water, organic compounds, and chemical reactions—would be notable even if discovered separately, NASA has never seen all three in one location, meaning the geological chemistry of Cheyava Falls is possibly our best clue yet that Mars once hosted life.

“Cheyava Falls is the most puzzling, complex, and potentially important rock yet investigated by Perseverance,” Caltech’s Ken Farley, Perseverance project scientist, said in a NASA press statement. “We have our first compelling detection of organic material, distinctive colorful spots indicative of chemical reactions that microbial life could use as an energy source, and clear evidence that water—necessary for life—once passed through the rock.”

While this site is particularly exciting, it’s far from the first Martian discovery to cause considerable microbial hype. Just earlier this year, scientists studying a 2017 soil analysis from Curiosity’s ongoing mission in Gale Crater discovered an abundance of manganese in the soil—something that usually requires the presence of oxygen and (you guessed it) microbes.

NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS

But all of these discoveries come with more than a few caveats. In Curiosity’s case, too little is known about the Mars’ oxidation process to be certain that microbes existed in Gale Crater, and this new discovery also isn’t immune from scientific scrutiny. One big head scratcher is the presence of millimeter-sized olivine crystals—a mineral that forms from magma. This may possibility explain how past volcanic activity could produce this geologic phenomena without relying on the presence of microbes at all.

“We have zapped that rock with lasers and X-rays and imaged it literally day and night from just about every angle imaginable,” Farley said in the press statement. “Scientifically, Perseverance has nothing more to give. To fully understand what really happened in that Martian river valley at Jezero Crater billions of years ago, we’d want to bring the Cheyava Falls sample back to Earth, so it can be studied with the powerful instruments available in laboratories.”

The “six-wheeled geologist” (as NASA calls it) doesn’t contain an onboard lab like its sister rover, Curiosity. But that’s actually a feature—not a flaw. NASA originally designed Perseverance to also be a sample retrieval mission, meaning that the space agency would send an additional spacecraft to retrieve samples from Perseverance and bring them back to Earth for further study.

However, with the costs of such a mission edging into the $11 billion range, bringing back samples of this Martian geologic wonder is in now question—as is the possibility of definitively understanding if there was once microbial life on Mars.

Recent advancements and discoveries have set the scientific community abuzz, particularly with NASA's Perseverance rover, which has uncovered potential signs of ancient life on Mars. This discovery has reignited intrigue about the red planet and its history. Perseverance’s goal has long been to explore Jezero Crater, which scientists believe once held water, providing the optimal environment for life to exist. The rover's exploration could help reveal critical clues about past life forms and the planet's climatic conditions over millennia.

Utilizing advanced instruments like its onboard laboratory, the rover has collected rock and soil samples, indicating the presence of minerals often associated with life. The detection of organic compounds is particularly exciting, as these are the building blocks of life as we know it. Scientists are now racing to analyze these samples back on Earth, which could help corroborate the findings of ancient microbial activity.

Meanwhile, climate change remains at the forefront of discussions globally. While many are familiar with the increasing temperatures and extreme weather events, the broader impacts of climatic shifts are increasingly alarming. Reports suggest significant alterations to ecosystems, which could lead to increased biodiversity loss. This has raised concerns not only about environmental degradation but also its effects on human health and food security.

Environmental scientists are exploring innovative solutions to combat these challenges. From developing sustainable energy sources, like solar and wind power, to utilizing new agricultural methods aimed at reducing carbon footprints, the focus is on creating resilience against climate threats. Additionally, there’s increased advocacy for policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, shaping future sustainability efforts.

On the technological front, breakthroughs abound, particularly with artificial intelligence and its applications across industries. Whether it's enhancing customer service through chatbots or optimizing supply chain logistics, AI's role is rapidly evolving and reshaping traditional practices. Companies are investing heavily to not only improve efficiency but also to gain competitive advantages.

Despite the optimism surrounding these advancements, the ethical questions arising from AI integration cannot be overlooked. Concerns related to data privacy, surveillance, and biased algorithms are drawing scrutiny from scientists, technologists, and lawmakers alike. Striking the right balance between innovation and ethical responsibility is critical as these technologies continue to develop.

Science and technology’s influence over daily life is becoming more pronounced, as evidenced during recent events where streaming services and online platforms became avenues for critical debates on governance and public policy. The recent U.S. presidential election has underscored how digital platforms can sway public opinion and engage voters, displaying their impact on democracy.

The 2024 presidential race is heating up, with candidates employing varying strategies to appeal to voters. While traditional campaigning is still prevalent, the integration of social media platforms for outreach is shaping the narrative leading to the elections. Online engagement is expected to play a substantial role, making the digital strategies of candidates pivotal.

Among these candidates, discussions about issues like climate change, healthcare, and economic recovery are central to their platforms. This focus reflects growing public concern over these topics and underscores the necessity for leaders to address them thoroughly. Each campaign has ramped up efforts to not only propose solutions but to communicate them effectively to the electorate.

Back on the global stage, tensions often seem to dominate the news. Recent events around the Ukraine crisis continue to highlight the volatile geopolitical climate. Countries are recalibrated their strategies about security and alliances, showcasing rapid changes to foreign policies. The impact on markets and economies is palpable, and nations are now examining how such discord influences their domestic and international agendas.

Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic has left lasting repercussions on global health systems, economies, and human interactions. The push toward vaccinations has been met with various responses across the globe, with some regions experiencing low uptake due to vaccination hesitancy driven by misinformation. Public health officials are now strategizing beyond immediate health responses, focusing on long-term recovery and preparedness for future health crises.

Education is also evolving, particularly with the integration of technology within classrooms. Remote learning models, accelerated by the pandemic, have opened new avenues for education but have also raised issues around equity access and the quality of remote instruction. Educational institutions are rethinking their strategies for delivering curricula effectively, aiming to bridge the gap created by disparities.

Through environmental challenges, technological advancements, and evolving educational methodologies, society stands at a crossroads—where innovation must meet ethical stewardship. The discoveries made by missions like Perseverance's provide reminders of humanity's broader quest for knowledge amid pressing global challenges and signify potential pathways for the future."

NASA made a World-Shaking Discovery: Compelling Evidence of Past Life on Mars.,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/leopard-spotted-rock-may-sign-201138455.html,"NASA's Perseverance rover discovered a rock that may hold the proof that microbial life once existed on Mars.

Over the years, NASA rovers have investigated countless rocks on Mars. In doing so, they have slowly built up a towering heap of evidence that the cold, desolate planet we see today was much more like Earth in its distant past. It was warmer, with a thicker atmosphere, and it had free-flowing water on its surface that could have supported life as we know it. One thing that has eluded these missions, though, was any definite sign that anything actually lived in that more hospitable environment.

Then, in July 2024, while exploring an ancient dry river valley called Neretva Vallis, Perseverance happened upon 'Cheyava Falls', a rock that peaked the mission team's interest.

Perseverance Finds Leopard Spotted Rock

This image, taken by the WATSON (Wide Angle Topographic Sensor for Operations and eNgineering) camera on Perseverance's SHERLOC (Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman and Luminescence for Organics and Chemicals) instrument, shows the surface of the rock nicknamed ""Cheyava Falls"" by the mission team. (NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS)

""Cheyava Falls is the most puzzling, complex, and potentially important rock yet investigated by Perseverance,"" Ken Farley, Perseverance project scientist of Caltech in Pasadena, said in a NASA press release.

NASA scientists are interested in this one particular rock because it has three distinct properties that, according to Morgan Cable, a scientist on the Perseverance team, they've never seen together on Mars before.

The first is the two long bands of light-coloured rock on either side of the above view. They are made up of calcium sulphate (gypsum) and indicate that water once flowed through the rock.

The second is the detection of organic compounds in the darker reddish band of rock by Perseverance's SHERLOC (Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman and Luminescence for Organics and Chemicals) instrument. Organic compounds are those containing carbon, an essential building-block for life as we know it. While it is possible that these compounds were the result of some geological process, if microbes did live in those sediments and later died when the planet dried up, this is the kind of evidence they would leave behind.

The third property is the tiny 'leopard spots' seen dotted throughout the layer of reddish rock. These irregularly-shaped, millimetre-sized spots are made up of lighter-coloured rock surrounded by a dark border. Perseverance's PIXL (Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry) instrument determined that the sediments in those dark borders were composed of iron and phosphate.

According to NASA, similar spots have been found on Earth where chemical reactions change a rock's colour from red to white, releasing iron and phosphate in the process. On this planet, these same chemical reactions are known to be used by living microbes to produce energy.

Each of these features, on their own, is not strong evidence of past life. However, finding all three together in the same rock makes this a much more intriguing discovery.

Perseverance Rover Finds a Rock with Leopard Spots - annotated

This annotated view of ""Cheyava Falls"" highlights one of the numerous 'leopard spots' embedded in the darker layer, which indicate chemical reactions that could have supported ancient microbial life, but also a small deposit of olivine, a mineral that forms from the crystallization of magma. (NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS)

One aspect of this find that puzzles the team, though, is the presence of olivine crystals, a type of rock that forms from cooling magma.

""On the one hand, we have our first compelling detection of organic material, distinctive colorful spots indicative of chemical reactions that microbial life could use as an energy source, and clear evidence that water — necessary for life — once passed through the rock. On the other hand, we have been unable to determine exactly how the rock formed and to what extent nearby rocks may have heated Cheyava Falls and contributed to these features,"" Farley explained.

Seeing these green crystals embedded within the rock brings up the possibility that the exciting features of Cheyava Falls may not have been produced by life. Instead, they could be the result of chemical reactions at extremely high temperatures associated with volcanic activity.

This 'selfie' image, composed of 24 different images taken by Perseverance's WATSON camera, shows the rover at Cheyava Falls, just after it drilled a sample of the rock for future investigation. (NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS)

""We have zapped that rock with lasers and X-rays and imaged it literally day and night from just about every angle imaginable,"" Farley said. ""Scientifically, Perseverance has nothing more to give. To fully understand what really happened in that Martian river valley at Jezero Crater billions of years ago, we'd want to bring the Cheyava Falls sample back to Earth, so it can be studied with the powerful instruments available in laboratories.""

To that end, Perseverance drilled a sample of Cheyava Falls, which has been secured inside the rover for now. The hope is that this, along with the rover's other samples, can be picked up by some later Mars mission and flown back to Earth for study.

NASA made a World-Shaking Discovery: Compelling Evidence of Past Life on Mars.,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/greenland-fossils-reveal-greater-sea-192719005.html,"Flowers are pictured on the island of Kulusuk (also spelled Qulusuk), in the Sermersooq municipality on the southeastern shore of Greenland (Jonathan NACKSTRAND)

In the not-too-distant past, Greenland lived up to its name.

Scientists have discovered plant and insect remains under a two-mile-deep (three km) ice core extracted from the center of the island, providing the clearest proof yet that nearly all of this vast territory was green within the past million years, when atmospheric carbon levels were much lower than today.

Their research, published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, indicates even greater potential for global sea level rise due to human-caused climate than previously thought.

The ice core, named GISP2, was drilled in 1993 and although its rock and ice had been studied extensively, nobody had thought to look for fossils in the ""till,"" or the mixed sediment at the bottom.

That's because until recently the idea that Greenland was ice-free in the recent geologic past seemed too far-fetched.

""Literally, we saw the fossils within the first hour, maybe half hour, of working on it,"" lead author Paul Bierman, a professor of environmental science at the University of Vermont, told AFP.

To their amazement, researchers found within this three-inch-layer soil willow wood, spores from spikemoss, fungi, the compound eye of an insect, and a poppy seed -- together suggesting a vibrant tundra ecosystem.

If ice at the center of the island had melted away, it almost certainly means that it was also absent across the rest of Greenland -- spelling trouble for today's fossil-fuel supercharged climate, said Bierman.

If greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels are not drastically reduced, Greenland's ice sheet could almost entirely melt over the next several centuries to a few millennia, resulting in a sea level rise of approximately 23 feet (seven meters) that would wipe away the world's coastal cities.

""Hundreds of millions of people around the world are going to lose their places to live,"" he warned.

- Checkmate for impenetrable ice-fortress theory -

The new work builds on two important recent findings. In 2016, scientists tested bedrock from the same 1993 ice core, using radioactive dating to estimate it could be no more than 1.1 million-years-old.

Their modeling also showed that if the ice was melted at the GISP2 site, then 90 percent of the rest of Greenland would have been ice-free.

But the finding was controversial because of a longstanding theory that Greenland was an impenetrable ice fortress for the past several million years.

Then in 2019, Bierman and an international team reexamined another ice core, this time extracted from the abandoned US military base, Camp Century, near the coast of Greenland in the 1960s.

They were shocked to learn it contained not just sediment but leaves and moss. More advanced dating techniques available to them helped them constrain the disappearance of that section of ice to 416,000 years ago.

The discovery of organic matter in the core from near the coast prompted Bierman to go back to the 1993 core to look for similar material -- and finding it confirmed unequivocally what scientists had previously inferred through models and calculations.

""The ice had to be gone, because otherwise there would be no plants, no insects, and no soil fungus,"" said Bierman. ""Now we know for sure that the ice was gone not just at Camp Century but at GISP2 right at the center of the ice sheet. Now we know the whole ice sheet is vulnerable to melting.""

Co-author Halley Mastro, a graduate student at the University of Vermont who studied the fossils, emphasized the need for further drilling into Greenland's ice cores to find more ancient organisms that hold important implications for our future.

""It's so obvious once you know it's there -- but if you didn't expect it to be there, and you weren't looking for these tiny little dark flecks that float a little bit differently, you would never see them,"" she told AFP.

NASA made a World-Shaking Discovery: Compelling Evidence of Past Life on Mars.,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/biggest-meteor-shower-2024-peak-133745484.html,"The Perseid meteor shower, which peaks in mid-August, is considered the best celestial spectacle of the year (Getty Images)

The biggest meteor shower of the year is set to peak this month, just days before the first supermoon of 2024.

The Perseid meteor shower has been visible since mid-July but is expected to peak on the night of 11 August, with up to 100 ‘shooting stars’ appearing each hour until dawn.

Before the meteors disappear for another year at the end of the month, a full moon on 19 August will appear bigger and brighter in the sky alongside them as the Earth’s natural satellite approaches the closest point of its orbit.

The occurrence of a bright supermoon is typically not good for stargazing or meteor watching, however on the night of the Perseids peak the Moon will set at midnight.

The Moon setting combined with warm conditions make it an ideal opportunity to witness the celestial spectacle, with scientists from Nasa and the European Space Agency (ESA) saying the best time to see them will be the pre-dawn hours before sunrise..

“The Perseid meteor shower, which peaks in mid-August, is considered the best meteor shower of the year,” Nasa notes on its website.

“With swift and bright meteors, Perseids frequently leave long ‘wakes’ of light and colour behind them as they streak through Earth’s atmosphere.”

The US space agency said skygazers can expect between 50 to 100 meteors per hour during its peak, with no need for specialist viewing equipment like telescopes or binoculars to view them.

The ESA advises people to head to an area with minimal light pollution and to avoid looking at screens or other bright objects for half an hour to allow your eyes to adjust to the darkness.

Several observatories are expected to live stream the night sky on the night that the Perseids peak, with telescopes pointed to the section of sky from which they emerge.

Radiating from the Perseus constellation in the northeastern sky of the Northern Hemisphere, which follows the more distinctive Cassiopeia constellation across the sky.

The bright meteor streaks occur as the Earth passes through the tail of the Comet Swift-Tuttle, causing debris to burn up in the Earth’s atmosphere at temperatures of up to 1,650 degrees Celsius - meaning the space rocks are unlikely to reach the ground intact."

"NASA warns of a giant building-size asteroid approaching Earth today. Be excited, not afraid.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2024/08/05/asteroid-apophis-earth/,"A massive space rock will go hurtling past Earth in a few years, zooming by 10 times faster than a bullet. This is the first time an asteroid of its size is coming close enough that people in parts of Western Europe and Africa will see it soaring across the sky like a fast-moving star, no fancy telescopes or binoculars required. Around 2 billion people will get to witness this rare event.

To be clear, the asteroid is not going to hit Earth — not in our lifetime nor our children’s lifetimes, anyway. Instead, as if the universe was making a joke, the space rock will make an eerily close flyby on Friday the 13th in April 2029.

The asteroid is named Apophis, and it will come closer to Earth than the satellites that make weather monitoring possible and about 10 times closer than the moon.

“Nature is performing this once-per-several-thousand-years experiment for us. We have to figure out how to watch,” said Richard P. Binzel, a professor of planetary science at MIT.

Apophis is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to study asteroids like never before. Getting a close-up look at Apophis will help scientists figure out how to protect our planet against an asteroid that wants to throw a punch at Earth in the future.

But missions to space take years to develop, and there are less than five years before Apophis makes its close approach to Earth.

“We’re running out of time,” said Jason Kalirai, executive for space formulation at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.

Meet Apophis

Apophis is about as wide as the Eiffel Tower is tall. Though scientists do not have pictures of the asteroid yet, they have used radar data to surmise that Apophis is roughly peanut shaped.

While the rock — which scientists believe has two lobes — is peacefully minding its business in space, that did not seem to be the case when it was discovered in June 2004 by scientists at the Kitt Peak National Observatory. Later that year, researchers calculated a 2.7 percent chance that the asteroid’s encounter with Earth in 2029 would be a violent collision, not a harmless flyby.

“If it was to encounter a populated area, it could take out a city the size of New York,” said Daniella DellaGiustina, lead scientist on a NASA mission to Apophis called OSIRIS-APEX.

Apophis made such a bad first impression on the world that it was named after the Egyptian serpentine god of darkness and chaos.

It was not until March 2021 that scientists were able to rule out an Apophis-Earth collision for at least the next 100 years. Using a 230-foot-long radio antenna in California, scientists collected the data they needed to clear Apophis’s name and remove it from NASA’s Sentry Impact Risk Table, a list of asteroids with some chance of affecting Earth in the next century.

Apophis will come within 20,000 miles of Earth — give or take a few miles. When two objects come close in space, they exert forces on each other. Just as Earth experiences tidal forces generated by the moon, Apophis will feel tidal forces generated by Earth.

While the moon’s gravitational pull causes high tides on Earth, Earth’s gravitational pull might cause mini asteroid quakes on Apophis. Apophis’s flyby will mark the first chance to view seismic activity on an asteroid.

The asteroid space chase

Now that scientists know Apophis will not collide with Earth, they have turned their attention to another problem: how to make it to the asteroid in time.

“What are we doing about Apophis? I would say not enough,” Kalirai said.

Though Apophis has been a source of fascination for two decades, no one knows what it actually looks like. Many of its basic properties remain unknown, including its mass and structure.

Recently, Earth’s planetary defense capabilities were put to the test by NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART, in which researchers at Johns Hopkins successfully smashed a spacecraft into an asteroid to change its orbit.

While researchers are proud of DART, they emphasized that Earth’s self-defense tool kit is not complete. Planetary defense is not just about throwing celestial uppercuts. Scientists need to be able to locate asteroids and study their characteristics to mount an effective response.

“Apophis is an opportunity to practice what kinds of characterization efforts could be done to better understand a particular object. Lessons from that can be applied in the future when we find an asteroid coming our way,” said Terik Daly, a planetary scientist on the DART and OSIRIS-APEX missions.

NASA’s OSIRIS-APEX mission will redirect an existing spacecraft so that it characterizes Apophis after its closest approach to Earth. The mission will study how the asteroid was affected by Earth’s gravity, using high-resolution images of Apophis’s surface.

The OSIRIS-APEX spacecraft can also use its thrusters to kick up dust on the asteroid. With this capability, scientists will learn how strong Apophis’s surface is, which will inform how to deflect it in the future if needed.

If the asteroid has a tough surface that does not break easily, an impact approach like DART might not be effective in changing its orbit.

A close inspection of asteroids can also help answer long-held questions about the solar system, including: Where did Earth’s water come from? By comparing water on Earth and asteroids, scientists can look for similarities that provide clues about how this important resource arrived on our planet billions of years ago.

But OSIRIS-APEX cannot stand alone. Since the mission’s spacecraft is already in orbit with limited fuel, it can make it to Apophis only in June, two months after the asteroid’s closest approach to Earth.

If scientists are going to fully understand Apophis and how it was affected by Earth, there need to be missions that study the asteroid before and during its closest approach.

So far, OSIRIS-APEX is the only confirmed and fully funded mission to Apophis.

‘No bucks, no Bruce Willis’

At Apophis T-5 Years, a two-day workshop to foster international collaboration on Apophis missions, scientists proposed more than 20 spacecraft and payloads combined.

“In an ideal world, we would have a fleet of missions to Apophis,” Kalirai said. But scientists have less than five years to develop, build and launch a mission.

Besides the time crunch, there is a shortage of money to fund missions to Apophis.

“No bucks, no Bruce Willis,” Binzel said.

As a result, many scientists are trying to repurpose old missions to beat the clock and go easy on the wallet.

Experts are urging NASA to study pre-flyby Apophis with the Janus spacecraft, which were meant to launch in 2023 as part of a separate mission. After delays in that mission, the spacecraft were put in storage indefinitely.

Scientists at Apophis T-5 Years described a pre-flyby encounter with Apophis as a mission in search of a spacecraft. They believe that need could be met by the Janus satellites, which are spacecraft in search of a mission.

Blue Origin, a private space company founded by Jeff Bezos, has reported that its Blue Ring spacecraft could meet Apophis three months before the flyby. The spacecraft has 13 payload slots, allowing the cost of the mission to be shared among multiple parties. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

Of all the proposals floating around, a mission developed by the European Space Agency is the closest to fruition. In an act of recycling similar to OSIRIS-APEX, the ESA’s Rapid Apophis Mission for Space Safety — Ramses — makes use of technology built for the Hera mission, which is expected to launch this year to study the aftermath of DART.

Ramses would encounter Apophis two months before its flyby and stay close to watch how it is affected by Earth’s gravity. The mission would monitor how Earth alters Apophis’s rotation, which plays a huge role in what the asteroid’s orbit will look like far into the future.

The Space Safety program board has given the ESA permission to start working on the mission. However, Ramses is not in the clear yet: The mission awaits final approval for funding by the ESA’s Council of Ministers, who will make their decision at the end of next year.

While space exploration is complicated technically, there have been many advances that make more missions possible and successful. Scientists have even sent a spacecraft to dig into an asteroid and return pieces of it to Earth. As a result, much of the technology needed to explore Apophis exists, making the bottleneck largely financial.

While there is a near-zero chance that Earth will meet an asteroid capable of causing mass extinction soon, there is a 100 percent probability that a devastating asteroid will risk striking Earth at some point.

“The question is when and whether we’re able to prevent it before that happens,” said Bruce Betts, chief scientist at the Planetary Society, which advocates for space exploration.

Unlike most natural disasters, asteroid collisions are preventable, if there are tools to keep track of space rocks and act in self-defense if needed.

Building out Earth’s planetary defense tool kit is not about fear, according to Binzel. “It’s simply about sensible responsibility.”"
"NASA warns of a giant building-size asteroid approaching Earth today. Be excited, not afraid.",https://evrimagaci.org/tpg/nasa-alerts-on-massive-2024-oc-asteroid-passing-earth-6105,"NASA Alerts On Massive 2024 OC Asteroid Passing Earth Scientists monitor twin asteroids approaching Earth, posing no immediate threat but offering research opportunities

NASA has been keeping its eyes peeled after the recent alert about two massive asteroids, 2024 OJ2 and 2024 OC, heading toward our planet. While rocketing through space may sound thrilling, these extraterrestrial visitors can cause quite the stir - and not always for the best reasons. Both asteroids are reminders of the potent cosmic forces at play just beyond our atmosphere.

The larger of the two, asteroid 2024 OC, measures about 410 feet wide, close to the size of a large building. It’s scheduled to make its closest approach to Earth on August 4, zipping by at blistering speeds of approximately 35,986 kilometers per hour (about 22,360 miles per hour). That’s fast enough to give anyone pause and evoke thoughts of disaster movie plotlines where Earth faces calamity from the skies.

NASA has been relentless with its monitoring efforts, making sure this rock doesn’t shake up life on Earth. Luckily, asteroid 2024 OC will be gliding by safely at around 7.4 million kilometers away, which is more than enough distance to prevent any catastrophic event. Still, there’s always the “what if” scenario floating around. What if it were to collide with Earth? Such impacts can be devastating, resulting not just in craters but possibly contributing to widespread destruction and loss of life depending on where these rocks land.

Then there’s 2024 OJ2, another asteroid making its approach just days before OC. This one measures about 110 feet, and though significantly smaller, it carries its own momentum at around 37,510 kilometers per hour (over 23,000 miles per hour). Like its larger counterpart, it will also safely pass Earth at roughly 4.45 million miles, so scientists seem poised for yet another harmless flyby.

Asteroids may not always be headline-grabbers weekly, but they certainly deserve attention. They are considered minor planets made from the leftover materials from the early solar system, dating back approximately 4.6 billion years. These ancient rocks orbit within the inner regions of our solar system and often act as unintended warnings of the geophysical risks we face from outer space.

NASA and many scientific organizations devote considerable resources to studying these near-Earth objects (NEOs) because they want to project their trajectories and assess any risks. Regularly, these rocks can interfere with the daily doings of Earth, as remnants have struck our planet through the ages. Some think back to the infamous Chicxulub impact, which played its role directed toward the extinction of the dinosaurs around 66 million years ago.

The characteristics of the study of asteroids, like 2024 OC and 2024 OJ2, include how frequently they zoom past us and how their movements can affect our planet over long periods. Such investigations provide valuable insight beyond just tracking potential threats; they also equip scientists with knowledge about the structure, composition, and history of these asteroids.

Asteroids don’t shoot across the skies aimlessly. They have orbits, and many are classified as potentially hazardous asteroids (PHOs) if they are larger than 140 meters and approach Earth within 7.5 million kilometers. This classification allows authorities like NASA to keep close tabs as these space rocks race through the solar system. Of course, not all asteroids are considered dangerous. Most pass by harmlessly and provide unique opportunities for scientists to gather data.

On occasions when significant asteroids approach Earth, missions may be launched to assess the situation. These entities represent more than just risks. They also provide learning opportunities, help fuel advances in planetary defense systems, and spur development for potential future missions aimed at redirecting hazardous objects.

Through diligent monitoring and research, organizations are confident we can handle any asteroid situation. And as astronomers continue to observe the cosmos, each flyby of 2024 OC and 2024 OJ2 can serve as a reminder of both the beauty and peril lurking beyond our atmosphere.

Asteroids are fascinating, yet sometimes frightening. They remind humanity of the delicate balance of existence on Earth and the vast universe surrounding us. Whether they are near misses, like 2024 OJ2, or larger threats, like 2024 OC, every observation is critical for scientific advancement and the safeguarding of our planet. Keeping the line of communication open between space agencies and the public is also pivotal as researchers work to educate everyone on the nature of these surprising visitors.

For now, it seems like we can breathe easy, at least until the next asteroid roll call. But if space rocks should become more active, we’ll be ready, armed with technology and knowledge. Isn’t it amazing to think how we can monitor the universe and stay safe all thanks to human ingenuity?"
