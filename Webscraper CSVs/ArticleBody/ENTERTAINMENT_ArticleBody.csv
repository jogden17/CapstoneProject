"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/house-of-the-dragon-end-season-4-1236095543/,"Send a raven: It’s finally been confirmed how many seasons HBO’s “House of the Dragon” will run.

During a press conference on Monday discussing the Season 2 finale of “House of the Dragon,” showrunner and co-creator Ryan Condal revealed that the “Game of Thrones” prequel will include two more seasons, and will conclude with Season 4.

Condal also confirmed that the third season is currently being written, they will be doing prep for it in the fall, with the plan to go into production in “earlyish 2025.” When asked whether Season 3 will also be eight episodes, as its second season was, Condal said: “I haven’t had discussions with HBO about it. I would just anticipate the cadence of the show, from a dramatic storytelling perspective, will continue to be the same from Season 2 on.”

“A Song of Ice and Fire” author George R.R. Martin, who is co-creator on “House of the Dragon,” has previously stated on his personal blog that he believes it would take four seasons of 10 episodes each to tell the show’s “Dance of the Dragons” story from his “Fire & Blood” book. But up until now, HBO had not confirmed how many seasons “House of the Dragon” would be.

HBO’s adaptation of Martin’s “Game of Thrones” — based on his still-not-concluded “A Song of Ice and Fire” series — ran for eight seasons from 2011-2019. Currently, the premium cable channel is in production on another “Game of Thrones” prequel, “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,” which is based on Martin’s “Tales of Dunk and Egg,” and takes place 100 years before the events of “Game of Thrones.”

Elsewhere during the Monday presser, Condal addressed why the Season 2 finale, which aired on Aug. 4, didn’t include the Battle of the Gullet, an iconic story beat from “Fire & Blood” that is the logical next point in the “House of the Dragon” plot.

“We we were trying to give the Gullet, which is arguably the most anticipated — well, I would say maybe the second-most-anticipated — action event of ‘Fire & Blood,’ trying to give it the time and the space that it deserves,” Condal said. “Obviously, as anybody that’s seen the finale, we’re building to that event. That event will happen very shortly in terms of the storytelling of ‘House of the Dragon.’

“Based on what we know now, it should be the biggest thing to date that we’ve pulled off,” Condal said. “And we just wanted to have the time, the space to do that at a level that is going to excite and satisfy the fans and in the way it’s deserved.”

The “House of the Dragon” boss says the team “also wanted to build some anticipation toward it,” further detailing why Season 2 didn’t end with the Battle of the Gullet.

“I know everybody wants this to come out every summer,” Condal said. “It’s just that the show is so complex that we’re really making multiple feature films every season. So I apologize for the wait, but I will just say if Rook’s Rest and the Red Sowing are any indication, we’re gonna pull off a hell of a win with the Battle the Gullet in the future.”

Condal also teased why Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans) — the former Hand of the King, and Alicent’s father — was seen briefly among the Season 2 finale’s last images, seemingly imprisoned — a departure from “Fire & Blood.” Condal deflected on giving specifics on what that glimpse of the character meant, saying those answers will have to wait until Season 3, adding, “We were delighted to have Rhys reenter the story, and I will just say that the Otto Hightower tale has not yet come to an end.”"
"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://deadline.com/2024/08/house-of-the-dragons-ryan-condal-confirms-drama-ending-after-four-seasons-1236031608/,"As Deadline reported in March, House of the Dragon was given a shorter season this year — two fewer than season one — as part of a long-term plan for the drama. That meant a major battle was going to be postponed until season 3, and for fans of George R.R. Martin’s books, that obviously meant the bloody Battle of the Gullet between the Blacks and Greens.

In talking with reporters Monday, Showrunner Ryan Condal didn’t straight-up address how the reduction of episodes led to a relatively low-energy finale on Sunday, or why the decision was made not to go out with a bang. But Condal did remind fans that the drama is not exactly rich with infinite time and resources to stage a battle at every turn.

“As a showrunner you are always in a position of having to balance storytelling and resources you have available to tell that story,” said Condal. “We are also starting to think about, what is the final destination of this series and where are we going? A combination of factors led to that re-balance. There is a tremendous amount of resources, construction, armor, costumes and visual affects needed to give the Gullet, which is arguably the second most anticipated action even to Fire and Blood, the time and the space it deserved. We are building to that event. It will happen very shortly in terms of storytelling. It will be the biggest thing to date we have pulled off. We want to have the time and space to do that at a level that will excite the fans.”

Condal was relatively coy about sharing key plot points from season 3 other than confirming that HOTD will run for four seasons (there was talk of either three or four) and production will resume in early 2025. He wouldn’t say how many episodes the new season will have, nor would he say whether to expect more dragons. He also wouldn’t tease what to expect from Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans), who unexpectedly appeared behind bars at the end of season two other than hinting “the tale has not yet come to an end.”

“There are so many great events that we are already writing in season 3 as it is,” he said. “This war really comes to a big head at this point in the storytelling. I mean, if you look at season 2, it’s largely a metaphor for a nuclear conflict … There’s gonna be giant moments of spectacle but real moments of surprise and character nuance that we’re very much looking forward to. Some of my favorite moments of in the book, as a reader, I’m excited to adapt as a dramatist.”

Condal once again brought up the challenge of creating a show for audience members who haven’t read Martin’s books. House of the Dragon is set 172 years before the events of Game of Thrones and tells the story of House Targaryen.

“I invite anybody to take the off season to purchase and read Fire and Blood so you can be armed with lots of information going into season 3,” said Condal, who has already begun writing season 3. “It’s a very tricky position in my seat, Sara Hess and I are custodians of this world. We have to render an exciting TV adaptation of this story, knowing there will be a percentage of the gigantic TV audience that has not read the book. We are constantly trying to serve both worlds.”"
"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/a61112068/house-of-the-dragon-season-3-release-schedule/,"The Targaryen Dynasty will continue to reign on HBO, with more House of the Dragon coming our way for at least another season. Here's what we already know about House of the Dragon season 3.

Season 1 of the Game of Thrones prequel introduced us to the Targaryen civil war of succession by framing it as a friendship breakup. By the time Arya and Sansa Stark read about the Blacks and Greens, they know that Alicent Hightower, mother of the usurper Aegon II Targaryen, and Rhaenerya Targaryen, whose father King Viserys wished her to break the proverbial glass ceiling and sit on the Iron Throne, were rivals. But once upon a time, they were loving, caring childhood friends.

It makes the story of their families and allies tear each other apart over greed and miscommunication, which would be named the ""Dance of the Dragons,"" all the more devastating. At the end of season 1, the war had just begun in earnest. With season 2 about to conclude, here's what we know about what could come next.

So is House of the Dragon coming back for season 3?

Yes yes yes!!! House of the Dragon was already renewed for season 3, just days before season 2's arrival on our TV screens. Team Black and Team Green will continue to duke it out.

Showrunner and co-creator Ryan Condal revealed in a press conference that the series will end with its fourth season and that the series will begin filming for season 3 in the beginning of 2025, according to Variety.

What would season 3 be about?

That depends on how season 2 ends, so we'll have to wait until this weekend to see. The series is based on a few chapters of House Targaryen lore in the fictional ""history book"" Fire & Ice—specifically the ones that cover the ""Dance of the Dragons"" civil war. That conflict lasted for three years... which is wild considering that the first season of House of the Dragon took place over a decade thanks to some well-placed time jumps.

Honestly, it's hard to say who will be in season 3, because characters die very quickly on this show. But it seems that the war is going to keep raging because it's basically barely begun. Since I've read parts of Fire & Ice and know what's coming, I actually don't even want to tell you which characters it's safe to get attached so. Not many make it out alive. I'll leave it at that.



When would House of the Dragon season 3 come out?

There were two years between season 1 and season 2. As a lover of television, that's not ideal. They couldn't even blame the delay on last year's SAG-AFTRA strike, because actors in the UK are in a different union. I'm not hopeful, but fingers crossed that season 3 will be released in 2025, not 2026. With the exception of Game of Thrones season 8, which came out two years after season 7, the original series came out promptly every Spring/Summer for six years. Let's aim to get back to that, pretty please!!"
"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/house-dragon-ending-canceled-season-3-4-hbo-max/,"House of the Dragon will be ending with Season 4. We also know when Season 3 will begin production.

House of the Dragon will officially be ending with Season 4. HBO has also announced that Season 3 of HotD will begin production in ""earlyish 2025,"" according to showrunner Ryan Condal.

Condal also hinted that Season 3 (and Season 3) of the show will also follow the format of Season 2 and consist of eight episodes, stating: ""I haven't had discussions with HBO about it, I would just anticipate the cadence of the show, from dramatic storytelling perspective, will continue to be the same from Season 2 on.""

The news of House of the Dragon ending was revealed during a press conference today, hours after the Season 2 Finale premiered on HBO and Max streaming. The sophomore season proved that House of the Dragon is one of the dominant TV shows in pop-culture right now – it's also proven the viability of HBO's Game of Thrones franchise as a larger universe of spinoff shows.

How Many Game of Thrones Spinoff Show Are There?

House of the Dragon takes place nearly 175 years before GoT; HBO has announced an Aegon the Conqueror series set 300 years before GoT, which would chronicle how the Targaryen Dynasty is first established in Westeros. HBO just revealed first footage of another prequel series in development, The Hedge Knight, which will be set less than 100 years before GoT and chronicle the legend of ""Dunk and Egg."" The most recent announcement was that 10,000 Ships, a series set roughly 1,000 years before the events of Game of Thrones, is still in development.

Based on George R.R. Martin's ""Fire & Blood"" book, House of the Dragon is set 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones. In Season 2 of House of the Dragon, Westeros is on the brink of a bloody civil war with the Green and Black Councils fighting for King Aegon and Queen Rhaenyra, respectively. New episodes of House of the Dragon premiere every Sunday on HBO at 9 p.m. ET.

The cast for House of the Dragon includes Matt Smith as Prince Daemon Targaryen, Olivia Cooke as Dowager Queen Alicent Hightower, Emma D'Arcy as Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen, Eve Best as Princess Rhaenys Targaryen, Steve Toussaint as Lord Corlys Velaryon, Fabien Frankel as Ser Criston Cole, Ewan Mitchell as Prince Aemond Targaryen, Tom Glynn-Carney as King Aegon II Targaryen, Sonoya Mizuno as Mysaria, and Rhys Ifans as Ser Otto Hightower.

Remember the good old days of TV, when you had enough episodes to really get to know a cast of characters, the shows could get weird and experimental, and you didn't have to wait two years for the next episode? Me neither.

""House of the Dragon"" has a structural problem. Although the show managed to win over many fans after the disastrous final season of ""Game of Throne"" with a delightful first season, its second season was disjointed, repetitive, and rather inconclusive. Despite a strong start, the show's eight-episode count ended up hurting it as many character arcs stalled for most of the season, and conversations started becoming redundant. It then concluded with a season finale that felt very much like a penultimate episode, cutting what was clearly being set up as the climax of the season and leaving the arc of this season without a culmination or conclusion, just table setting.

Those thinking the show would leave them hanging before we see such events as the Battle Above the Gods Eye need not worry though. According to Variety, HBO has confirmed that ""House of the Dragon"" season 3 will start shooting early next year, with the show ending after its fourth season as the Dance of the Dragons draws to a close."
"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://www.tvinsider.com/1139789/house-of-the-dragon-season-3-premiere-date-cast-hbo/,"[Warning: The following contains MAJOR spoilers for House of the Dragon Season 2.]

The Targaryen civil war will take place over just two more seasons of House of the Dragon. HBO and series co-creator Ryan Condal announced on August 5, the day after the Season 2 finale, that the Game of Thrones prequel will end with Season 4. They also shared the first production update on Season 3.

Based on George R.R. Martin’s Fire & Blood, House of the Dragon is set 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones and tells the story of House Targaryen. War has broken out between the two sides of the family after Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke) usurped the Iron Throne in favor of her son, Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney) at the end of Season 1 and robbing Rhaenyra (Emma D’Arcy) of her inheritance. This was followed by the death of Rhaenyra’s young son Lucerys (Elliot Grihault) at the hand of Aemond’s (Ewan Mitchell) dragon Vhagar. Season 2 revealed what happened after those tragic events, ending with the setup for one of the most intense battles from Fire & Blood, the Battle of the Gullet, in Season 3.

Here’s everything there is to know about House of the Dragon Season 3 so far.

When does House of the Dragon Season 3 come out?

Co-creator and showrunner Ryan Condal announced in an August 5 press conference that House of the Dragon Season 3 production is expected to begin in “early-ish 2025.”

The House of the Dragon Season 3 premiere date will be announced at a later time, but for an idea of when Season 3 could come out, we can look to the time gap between the first two seasons. With just under two years having passed between Seasons 1 and 2, it would be reasonable to presume that it would take around the same time for Season 3 to debut. That’s not set in (dragon) stone, however.

Production on House of the Dragon Season 2 began in April 2023 following the October 2022 finale. Production on Season 2 was not delayed by the Hollywood strikes that summer, as the scripts for the eight-episode season were completed prior to the start of the writers’ strike. Most of the actors in the series are not members of SAG-AFTRA but rather U.K. acting unions, thus allowing them to continue working. Season 2 took about six months to film, with several months of post-production work after that. Season 2 then premiered in June. Based on that, a 2026 release date for Season 3 seems likely.

How many episodes will there be in House of the Dragon Season 3?

House of the Dragon Season 2 was shortened to eight episodes following the 10-episode second season. Condal was asked about the anticipated episode count for Season 3 during the press conference, to which he replied, “I haven’t had discussions with HBO about it. I would just anticipate the cadence of the show, from dramatic storytelling perspective, will continue to be the same from Season 2 on.” The vague answer leaves room for the possibility of a return to 10 episodes.

What will happen in House of the Dragon Season 3?

The Season 2 finale ended with intense buildup to a major battle from the book, the Battle of the Gullet. Condal says to expect that battle to take place early in Season 3, in addition to explaining why it wasn’t in Season 2. He says it will be “the biggest thing to date that we’ve pulled off.”

“We we were trying to give the Gullet, which is arguably the most anticipated — well, I would say maybe the second-most-anticipated action event of ‘Fire & Blood,’ trying to give it the time and the space that it deserves,” Condal told journalists. “Obviously, as anybody that’s seen the finale, we’re building to that event. That event will happen very shortly in terms of the storytelling of House of the Dragon. Based on what we know now, it should be the biggest thing to date that we’ve pulled off, and we just wanted to have the time, the space to do that at a level that is going to excite and satisfy the fans and in the way it’s deserved.”

The Battle of the Gullet is a fight between Rhaenyra’s forces and the Aegon’s, now led by Aemond. As teased in the Season 2 finale, the battle is fought by air and sea. Dragons and their dragonriders will face off as Corlys (Steve Toussaint) leads his fleet in battle against the greens’ naval arsenal. The finale showed Tyland Lannister (Jefferson Hall) successfully recruiting an armada from Essos to Aegon’s side, led by the Triarchy Admiral Sharako Lohar (Abigail Thorn). They’ll face off in the Gullet, the stretch of water between Driftmark and Dragonstone. Blackwater Bay opens into the Gullet.

Condal says they “wanted to build” more “anticipation toward” this epic battle in Season 2. “I know everybody wants this to come out every summer,” he said. “It’s just that the show is so complex that we’re really making multiple feature films every season. So I apologize for the wait, but I will just say if Rook’s Rest and the Red Sowing are any indication, we’re gonna pull off a hell of a win with the Battle the Gullet in the future.”

HBO Gave House of the Dragon an Early Season 3 Renewal

HBO renewed House of the Dragon for Season 3 just days before the Season 2 premiere, which aired on Sunday, June 16. The early renewal came even earlier than House of the Dragon‘s Season 2 pickup in 2022. The first Game of Thrones spinoff was renewed on August 26, 2022, five days after its series premiere on August 21. Now, its Season 3 renewal comes three days before the show returns to our screens.

“George, Ryan, and the rest of our incredible executive producers, cast, and crew, have reached new heights with the phenomenal second season of House of the Dragon,” Francesca Orsi, Executive Vice President, HBO Programming, Head of HBO Drama Series and Films, said in a statement on June 13. “We are in awe of the dragon-sized effort the entire team has put into the creation of a spectacular Season 2, with a scope and scale that is only rivaled by its heart. We could not be more thrilled to continue the story of House Targaryen and watch this team burn bright again for Season 3.”

House of the Dragon Season 3 Cast

While an official cast for House of the Dragon Season 3 has not been announced, Season 2 features returning stars D’Arcy, Cooke, Glynn-Carney, Mitchell, Matt Smith, Fabien Frankel, Rhys Ifans, Eve Best, Steve Toussaint, Matthew Needham, Sonoya Mizuno, Harry Collett, Bethany Antonia, Phoebe Campbell, Phia Saban, and Jefferson Hall.

Additional cast for Season 2 includes Abubakar Salim, Gayle Rankin, Freddie Fox, Simon Russell Beale, Clinton Liberty, Jamie Kenna, Kieran Bew, Tom Bennett, Tom Taylor, and Vincent Regan. Thorn will presumably return as Sharako in Season 3 now that her forces are pledged to Aegon’s cause.

Unless she appears in flashback form or in some kind of vision as seen at Harrenhal this season, Best will not be back as Rhaenys. Her character met her tragic fate in the Battle of Rook’s Rest depicted in Season 2 Episode 4.

Showrunner and co-creator Ryan Condal broke the news during a press conference discussing the House of the Dragon season 2 finale. Season 3 is currently being written and is set to begin production in early 2025, though it still seems we'll have to wait some two years for the season premiere.

""I haven’t had discussions with HBO about it,"" Condal said, when asked if season 3 would consist of eight episodes (via Variety). ""I would just anticipate the cadence of the show, from a dramatic storytelling perspective, will continue to be the same from Season 2 on."" The question stemmed from a 2022 post on George R.R. Martin's personal blog, where he speculated that each season would need 10 episodes to adequately tell the complete story.

House of the Dragon is based on the book Fire & Blood, which tells the story of House Targaryen and takes place nearly 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones. The season 2 cast includes Matt Smith, Eve Best, Steve Toussaint, Fabien Frankel, Ewan Mitchell, Tom Glynn-Carney, Sonoya Mizuno, and Rhys Ifans.

The second season of the Game of Thrones spin-off focuses on the battle between the Blacks and the Greens, AKA the two sides of the Targaryen family – which eventually becomes the epic event known as the Dance of the Dragons.

The third season of the “Game of Thrones” prequel series is currently being written, Condal told press. The Season 2 finale just aired (and streamed on Max!) on Sunday night. Condal expects to begin production on Season 3 sometime in “early-ish” 2025.

While it was suspected that “House of the Dragon” might only last four or five seasons, this is the first time Condal has confirmed a definitive end. George R. R. Martin, who is a co-creator on “House of the Dragon,” wrote in a 2022 blog post that he expected the series would need roughly four seasons of 10 episodes each in order to fully tell the story of “Dance of the Dragons” from his book “Fire & Blood.” HBO’s drama chief Francesca Orsi also previously said she expected “House of the Dragon” would run for a minimum of four seasons. She recently (officially, it was never in doubt) picked up a third season.

At the presser, Condal was also asked what we might expect, episode-count-wise, from these subsequent seasons. All he said was to not expect too many changes to the formula.

“Without saying anything, because I haven’t had discussions with HBO about it, I would just anticipate the cadence of the show, from a dramatic storytelling perspective, will continue to be the same from Season 2 on,” Condal said.

Season 1 was 10 episodes; Season 2 had eight.

Condal did tease a bit of what he’s excited about working on for Season 3. The war is coming to a head at this very moment in the story; Condal said this just-wrapped season was “largely a metaphor for a nuclear conflict.” The best stuff is still to come, he promised.

“If Season 2 was the the arming of the sides and the Cold War, with moments of actual conflict and explosion, I think Season 3, really, you do start to see things boil over from here to the end of the war,” he said. “So as always with this show, there’s going to be giant moments of spectacle, but also real moments of surprise and character nuance that we’re very much looking forward to. And I think really, some of my favorite moments in the book are, just as a reader, that I’m excited to adapt as a dramatist are yet to come in the story.”

Condal previously said he felt Season 3 would be the biggest challenge in finding fresh storylines.

“There’s a rhythm to all this, these kinds of stories as you tell them,” Condal said. “And we’re trying to find satisfying arcs within the season structure. So, hopefully you start with a bang, and then you build to another bang through the series, but you’re really trying to arc out the characters, so that each season is a different experience for all of them. And then you leave them off all in a place where you can pick up with them next year, and then take them in a new direction, because you don’t want to end up in that place where you’re doing the same thing again and again.”

“House of the Dragon” has continued to be a major hit for HBO, with the premiere providing the biggest premiere in Max history, but only because when the first season premiered even bigger, the service was still called HBO Max."

The war is only just starting to heat up on House of the Dragon, but the end is already in sight.

On Monday, creator Ryan Condal revealed that the Game of Thrones prequel will only last four seasons. ""I think it's four,"" he told the group of journalists via a Zoom press conference the morning after the House of the Dragon season 2 finale aired.

The showrunner first answered a question about how the highly anticipated Battle of the Gullet did not occur in the season 2 finale, and whether it was originally supposed to take place this season.

""One of the things that really came into play in season 2 is what is the final destination of the series and where are we going?"" Condal said. ""And I think it was a combination of factors that led us — knowing now where we're going and we know what that end point is — to rebalance the story in such a way that we had three further great seasons of television to round out and tell this story, and we knew where we were going and we know how those things kind of break up and break out.""

He added that they ""were trying to give the Gullet, which is arguably the most anticipated — well, I would say maybe the second most anticipated action event of Fire & Blood — trying to give it the time and the space that it deserves.""

Later during the conversation, Condal was asked to clarify what he meant by ""three further great seasons of television to round out and tell this story,"" which is when he confirmed that he's planning to end the show with season 4.

As for when the prequel series will return with season 3, Condal revealed the tentative schedule. ""We will be starting prep in the fall and we should be in production again in early-ish 2025,"" he said.

Now that Rhaenyra (Emma D'Arcy) has seven adult dragons and Daemon (Matt Smith) re-pledged his loyalty and armies to her, the table has been set for the war to really ignite.

House of the Dragon co-creator and showrunner Ryan Condal has confirmed that the show will end after four seasons.

Condal made the announcement on Monday (August 5) during a press conference following the release of the show’s season two finale.

He also shared an update about the drama’s third season, revealing that it’s currently being written and will go into production in “earlyish 2025.”

When asked whether season three will have eight episodes as season two did, Condal said: “I haven’t had discussions with HBO about it. I would just anticipate the cadence of the show, from a dramatic storytelling perspective, will continue to be the same from season two on.”

The HBO show is based on Fire & Blood, the first prequel book in author George RR Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire fantasy series. It is set nearly 200 years before the events detailed in Game of Thrones and follows the story of the Targaryen civil war with King Viserys I Targaryen’s five children battling for control of the Iron Throne.

Martin, who also serves as a co-creator on the show, previously said he anticipated House of the Dragon would have at least four seasons.

“It is going to take four full seasons of 10 episodes each to do justice to the Dance of the Dragons, from start to finish,” he wrote on his personal blog in 2022.

In a January update, the bestselling author said that he had been discussing the “third and fourth seasons” with Condal and the other writers.

The House of the Dragon was officially renewed for a third season ahead of its season two debut in June.

“George, Ryan, and the rest of our incredible executive producers, cast, and crew, have reached new heights with the phenomenal second season of House of the Dragon,” said HBO programming Executive Vice President Francesca Orsi in a statement at the time.

“We are in awe of the dragon-sized effort the entire team has put into the creation of a spectacular season two, with a scope and scale that is only rivaled by its heart. We could not be more thrilled to continue the story of House Targaryen and watch this team burn bright again for season three.”

The season two finale, which was released on Sunday (August 4), has left critics and viewers disappointed.

“Eight episodes in, we’re still waiting for fiery action,” The Indendent’s Nick Hilton wrote in his two-star review of the finale. The show “is still afflicted by a glacial narrative pace. Even its characters seem gripped by ennui,” he added.

House of the Dragon is available to stream on Max in the US and on Now and Sky Atlantic in the UK."
"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://tvline.com/news/house-of-the-dragon-ending-season-4-hbo-1235311849/,"House of the Dragon will consist of four seasons total, showrunner Ryan Condal said Monday.

The executive producer confirmed the length of the fantasy series’ run during a call with reporters to discuss the events of the Season 2 finale, which aired Sunday.

HBO has not yet officially renewed the Game of Thrones prequel for Season 4, nor announced a premiere date for House of the Dragon‘s third season. During the call, Condal confirmed that the show will go start pre-production on Season 3 in fall 2024, with production beginning in earnest in “early-ish 2025.”

While Season 1 of Dragon consisted of 10 episodes, Season 2’s count dropped to eight. “I haven’t had discussions with HBO about it, I would just anticipate the cadence of the show, from dramatic storytelling perspective, will continue to be the same from Season 2 on,” Condal said.

Condal’s remarks also discussed how Episode 8 moved many pieces into place for some of the biggest fights detailed in George R.R. Martin’s book Fire & Ice, including the Greens’ attempt to break Corlys’ blockade, aka the Battle of the Gullet. But the 70-minute episode ended on footage of Alicent’s #TeamGreen and Rhaenyra’s #TeamBlack marching , riding and/or sailing to war. (Read a full recap here, and see what director Geeta Vasant Patel had to say about a key scene here.)

TVLine readers gave the episode an average grade of C+, and Season 2 overall a B-.

The Game of Thrones prequel series concludes its second season with Sunday's finale, showing both sides of the splintered Targaryen dynasty gearing up to wage war for the Iron Throne. However, before season 2 even premiered, House of the Dragon was already greenlit for a third season on HBO and Max.

""George, Ryan, and the rest of our incredible executive producers, cast, and crew, have reached new heights with the phenomenal second season of House of the Dragon,"" Francesca Orsi, Executive Vice President, HBO Programming, Head of HBO Drama Series and Films, said at the time. ""We are in awe of the dragon-sized effort the entire team has put into the creation of a spectacular season 2, with a scope and scale that is only rivaled by its heart. We could not be more thrilled to continue the story of House Targaryen and watch this team burn bright again for season 3.""

Following the season 2 finale, showrunner and co-creator Ryan Condal revealed that the series will then conclude with a fourth and final season.

Per Condal, season 3 was being written as of August 2024, with production set to begin in ""early-ish 2025."" However, he could not confirm how many episodes each season will contain.

""I haven't had discussions with HBO about it, I would just anticipate the cadence of the show, from dramatic storytelling perspective, will continue to be the same from season 2 on,"" he shared.

The upcoming seasons continue to explore the ""Dance of Dragons"" storyline, drawing from author George R.R. Martin's 2018 book Fire & Blood. The series is set nearly 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones.

It's expected that many of the season 2 stars (at least those who survive the finale) will return for the new episodes, including Matt Smith, Emma D'Arcy, Rhys Ifans, Steve Toussaint, Sonoya Mizuno, Fabien Frankel, Olivia Cooke, Graham McTavish, Matthew Needham, Harry Collett, Tom Glynn-Carney, Ewan Mitchell, Bethany Antonia, Phoebe Campbell, Phia Saban, Kurt Egyiawan, Kieran Bew, Abubakar Salim, Tom Taylor, Clinton Liberty, Tom Bennett, Ellora Torchia, Gayle Rankin, Simon Russell Beale and more.

In addition to House of the Dragon, another Game of Thrones prequel series is currently in the works. A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, based on Martin's Tales of Dunk and Egg novellas, was greenlit in early 2021.

The series will star Peter Claffey as Ser Duncan the Tall, aka ""Dunk,"" a hedge knight, and Dexter Sol Ansell as Aegon V Targaryen, aka ""Egg,"" who serves as Ser Duncan's squire in his early years. The six-episode first season is set to premiere on HBO in 2025.

House of the Dragon seasons 1 and 2 are streaming now on HBO and Max. The series will return for season 3 and 4.

"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/a61774552/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-ending-explained/,"The House of the Dragon season 2 finale may not have ended on a major death or battle, but the characters are scattered all over Westeros in a way that they haven't really been before on the Game of Thrones spin-off. It kind of feels like HotD season 3 is going to be more like old-school Thrones, with battles and side quests and tons of locations?. To help you prepare and get your bearings, let's explain everything that happened in the Season 2 finale of House of the Dragon and what it means.

Ultimately the episode was a lot of build-up for the next season. But that's actually not uncommon for Game of Thrones fans. Back in the day, as I'm sure you recall, the major events would happen in the penultimate episode (Ned Stark's death, the Red Wedding, and the Battle of the Bastards for example), and then the season's final episode would start setting the stage for what's to come. The problem with House of the Dragon, if you see it as a problem, is that nothing really happened in the penultimate episode of season 2 either. The most important thing about episode 7 was that two Targaryen bastards became dragon riders—and since they were the only two Targaryen bastards we knew anything about, it was pretty easy to figure out that they would be successful. Where's the suspense?

What exactly did they build up, and why? Let's get into it.

What was Tyland Lannister doing in Essos?

Courtesy of HBO

Team Green's ambassador was on a mission to end a trade blockade. He accomplished that by winning a mud wrestling match against a new character named Admiral Sharako Lohar. Sure! Tyland may or may not have developed a crush on Lohar in the process. Abigail Thorn, the actress who plays Lohar, is a trans woman but the character appears to use he/him pronouns. I'm curious to see how this relationship progresses. Beautiful people who could step on you? That's catnip for those Lannister lions. We all remember Jaime and Brienne, as well as Tyrion and Shae.

What's with *that* Daemon vision?

Courtesy of HBO

Before leaving Harrenhal for good, Daemon had one last witch-assisted magical vision. And... Daenerys Targaryen was there???? The Night King too???? THE HECK???? Alys Rivers showed Daemon the future, which included brief glimpses of those two characters as well as a three-eyed raven and a dead dragon. What it means, especially the raven and the dragon, are up to fan interpretation. The important thing, I think, is that Daemon now believes the same things that Rhaenyra believes because her father told her Aegon the Conquerer's dream and the prophecy. They're all just part of a larger story.

There was also, before the vision fully started, what appeared to be a green man with antlers running behind the weirwood tree. Those magical folk never appeared on Thrones. So, I'm not sure where the show is going with that. We'll have to wait and see.

Ultimately, this vision led to him bending the knee to his wife in front of all the sexist lords who wanted him to show her who's boss. It made him a feminist and a romantic. He's all in on fighting for Rhaenyra's side instead of trying to undermine her and possibly usurp her. Everybody say thank you, creepy vision! Queen Rhaenyra has her man and an army.

Did Queen Alicent try to surrender?

Courtesy of HBO

Alicent snuck out of King's Landing to visit Rhaenyra in Dragonstone. She proposed that if her old friend would allow her to get her children to safety, she would make it easy for her to seize the city and take back the Iron Throne. But Rhaenyra insists that to take the throne, she has to kill Alicent's sons (at least the ""king,"" Aegon). It's too late now. They can't sign a peace treaty. The boys can't rot in a jail cell. The only way for Rhaenyra to win back Westeros is by force. Alicent is so desperate to be done with all of this that she even asks Rhaenyra to run away with her. That doesn't happen, but speaking of:

Aegon ran away with Larys?

Courtesy of HBO

The former hand of the king and foot enthusiast proposed that he take King Aegon II to Braavos for his own safety until the war blows over. He moved money to the Iron Bank. There, Aegon would be safe from Aemond's rash actions and Rhaenyra's growing army. At the end of the episode, we see that Aegon has agreed. The two will cross the narrow sea together. How romantic! Not really. (Haha, unless...)

It's not a bad idea to get out of the city every once in a while. Ser Criston Cole, who we checked in on briefly, seems to have chilled out considerably after having spent some time away.

Why didn't anyone go on a run with Rhaena?

Courtesy of HBO

Daemon's dragon-less daughter finally found a dragon. All she had to do was walk and run in its general direction for the entire season finale. It seems like Lady Jeyne Arryn knew where Rhaena was going when she sent Rhaenyra and Daemon's toddler sons to Pentos, but didn't send anyone who knew the Vale with her. Rude! Rhaena hasn't officially claimed this dragon yet, but we have to assume that'll happen.

I'm happy for her but I'm still annoyed at how little she had to do this season. And her sister Baela, while she got to do at least one cool thing on a dragon, basically just had the same placating conversation with her cousin/fiancé Jace about how it's okay that he's a bastard over and over. Let these girlies have juicy storylines in season 3, please!!

The episode ends with multiple armies marching to fight.



The Lannister army is on the road for the Greens. The Stark army is on the road for the Blacks. The Riverland armies are ready to go. Dragon riders on both sides are suiting up. Tyland's navy is ready to meet Corlys Velaryon's navy. Anyone else start humming ""One Day More"" from Les Miserables in their head? Just me?

Oh, and Otto Hightower has been kidnapped? By whom? That's a mystery for season 3.

Courtesy of HBO

So what happens next?

War! Season 3 will likely be a lot of battles. The war rages on in the books after this point. The next big event is the Battle of the Gullet, which involves all of those ships we saw in the finale, as well as those toddlers going to Pentos. The mystery son of Alicent Hightower, Daeron Targaryen, should finally appear in season 3. Someone else will claim the Iron Throne, likely sooner rather than later. And so, so, so many more characters will die. Whomp whomp!"
"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-finale-ratings-1236096169/,"“House of the Dragon” hit a Season 2 high in viewership with Sunday’s finale, which drew 8.9 million multiplatform viewers across HBO and Max, per Warner Bros. Discovery.

That’s up 14% from the Season 2 premiere night, which garnered 7.8 million viewers. However, it is down from the audience size for the first season finale of “House of the Dragon” in 2022.

After premiering with 10 million viewers in June 2022, “House of the Dragon” Season 1 hit its peak with Episode 2, reaching 10.2 million. Exact data was not made available for Episodes 3-9, but Episode 10 closed the season with 9.3 million viewers.

Warner Bros. Discovery attributed the season opener declines to a drop in linear viewing, as fewer viewers now watch on HBO’s cable channel. But on the flip side, the conglom reports that Sunday’s “House of the Dragon” finale has now led to the biggest streaming day ever for Max, both in the U.S. and across the globe.

Popular on Variety

Overall, according to Warner Bros. Discovery, “House of the Dragon” Season 2 is averaging nearly 25 million cross platform viewers. It’s unknown whether a leak of several scenes from the Season 2 finale on TikTok may have impacted viewership — but it’s a bit apples-to-apples, as two years ago the Season 1 finale also experienced an online leak as well.

“House of the Dragon” Season 2 will be eligible for next year’s 2025 Emmys. The show’s Season 1 garned eight Emmy nods, including outstanding drama series, and won one for fantasy/sci-fi costumes.

In a press conference earlier Monday, showrunner and co-creator Ryan Condal revealed that the “Game of Thrones” prequel will include two more seasons, and will conclude with Season 4. Condal also confirmed that the third season is currently being written, they will be doing prep for it in the fall, with the plan to go into production in “earlyish 2025.”

The fantasy drama series is based on author George R.R. Martin’s book “Fire & Blood,” which details the history of House Targaryen. The returning cast includes Emma D’Arcy as Rhaenyra Targaryen, Olivia Cooke as Alicent Hightower, Matt Smith as Daemon Targaryen, Ewan Mitchell as Aemond Targaryen, Eve Best as Rhaena Targaryen, Rhys Ifans as Otto Hightower, Steve Toussaint as Corlys Velaryon, Fabien Frankel as Criston Cole and Tom Glynn-Carney as Aegon Targaryen.

New faces joining the series in Season 2 included Tom Taylor as Lord Cregan Stark, Clinton Liberty as Addam of Hull, Jamie Kenna as Ser Alfred Broome, Kieran Bew as Hugh Hammer, Tom Bennett as Ulf and Vincent Regan as Ser Rickard Thorne.

The ‘House of the Dragon’ Finale Was Anticlimactic — and That’s the Point: TV Review

We just watched 70 minutes of very good TV. It was galvanizing. In the episode’s final moments, long-gestating story lines threatened to clash with a sense of inevitability and, still, the frisson of surprise. It was all always heading right here — to this place — and yet the path House of the Dragon took made me doubt that we would ever find our way. An emotional coda boomeranged an important character back from season two’s margins, forcing her to make a hard choice between her children — a choice I don’t imagine is simple for Alicent just because some of her kids are monsters.

And it was a terrible season finale, evasive and deflating. In its final moments, I couldn’t help but obsessively check how many minutes were left. (Could they fit a battle into 15 minutes? Into nine minutes? Into two?) It was always heading right here to this place, yet the series denied its audience and its characters catharsis. War is like the horizon on House of the Dragon, receding no matter how (and how many times) you approach it. I’m so primed for battle at this point that I’m rooting against Alicent’s last-gasp plea for peace. Burn the innocents! Sink the recently rechristened Queen Who Never Was! This series’ most persistent flaw is that it is forever pulling back when it should run headlong, saving “story” for some imaginary later, taking for granted that we’ll keep tuning in. It’s so afraid of running out of gas that it never dares to floor it, which is especially damning for a show that insists its protagonists are reckless, twitchy, dangerous. We already know that the Targaryen tapestry being woven by an invisible hand in the opening credits will end up torn and tattered, the family and its dragons needlessly circling the drain of extinction. At some point, you have to show us.

It’s particularly disappointing to me because the season-two finale starts with charm enough to evoke Game of Thrones. Tyland Lannister sits uncomfortably — crisscross applesauce — before the heads of the Triarchy. Pack your bags; we’re not in Westeros anymore. The desert paradise is sunnier, looser, and more fun. Tyland proves an unformidable negotiator, trading away the Stepstones for ships to break Rhaenyra’s blockade — a deal that promises to expose King’s Landing to extortionate tariffs for years to come. But never mind, that’s a problem for future Tyland. To hire the ships of Essos, present-day Tyland must first figure out how to win over their captain, Lohar, played with whimsy by Abigail Thorn. Lohar won’t sail with a skinny man who can’t best her at mud wrestling. Why mud wrestling? Why the hell not. Tyland falls in the bog and rises to the occasion. (Is it possible that what every Game of Thrones show needs is a nested buddy comedy co-starring an obtuse Lannister and his unlikely spirit guide?)

Tyland worries that he’s paid too much for Lohar’s fleet, but if he were in the Red Keep right now, he’d know that the Greens are in existential crisis and unlikely to quibble over tax hikes. With Aegon’s dragon dead, fragile Helaena refusing to ride Dreamfyre into battle, and Dareon’s dragon hardly bigger than a hatchling, the Green Team dragon count stands at approximately one. Vhagar’s a big gal, yes, but an overstretched one.

Meanwhile, Black has six dragons — maybe seven if Daemon quits eating Alys’s poison pies long enough to extricate himself from the labyrinth of bad dreams. Plus, unbeknownst to all, Rhaena’s still scurrying the Eyrie to find a dragon to love her back.

Alicent’s children respond to the news of Rhaenyra’s surging dragon power exactly as you might predict. Aemond is so furious he rains fire on the heretofore unmentioned village of Sharp Point, then goes home to physically assault his sister. He’s in full-blown panic mode. Helaena, for her part, refuses to join the war effort with an indifference to her and her family’s survival that verges on nihilism.

And Aegon, bedridden and cockless, still holds on to the flimsy dream of power. Larys persuades him to take an all-expenses-paid trip to Essos, where the pair can wait out the war, returning to Westeros once everyone with a stronger claim on the crown is dead. Incontinent Aegon expresses some concern that the realm might not accept a dragonless dragon lord as King of the Seven Kingdoms, especially in a world yet to invent the urine catheter, but it’s equally true that Aegon has zero other allies, even among his kin.

On Dragonstone, too, they’re realizing that family isn’t to be depended upon. Instead of finding common ground in the dragonblood Jace shares with Ulf, Hugh, and Addam, he runs around the castle pouting, actually making sure the guests don’t dirty the furniture. Oafishly lovable Ulf emerges as the gang’s black sheep, lacking the skill or will to fit in with his adopted family. Which I suppose makes Hugh the peacekeeper, the one who can’t stop trying to smooth things over. Narcissistic Jace is the family’s golden boy, insisting no one is good enough to sit at his mother’s table (including himself, he fears in his heart of hearts). And then there’s Addam in the all-too-familiar role of lost child; he bites his lip at the dinner table and hangs in the background, hoping not to be noticed. They play classic roles, complicated by the fact that they need each other’s dragons more than they need each other. “All happy families are alike,” as Tolstoy wrote. “Each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” And that’s without adding dragons.

You know what would help whip this ragtag team into shape? Having something to do besides roam the halls, getting on each other’s nerves. And yet Rhaenyra needs to be convinced by the Hand of the Queen that the threat of facing seven dragons is no more powerful a deterrent to Aemond than when she only had three dragons. And you know how we know for sure that Corlys is right? Because before the episode even begins, Aemond’s already laid waste to the Crownlands seat of House Bar Emmon. He is literally undeterred. I appreciate the desire to consider all peaceful paths to victory, but at some point, if you want to sit the Iron Throne, m’lady, you’ll have to give war a chance.

In better news, things in Harrenhal are positively up-tempo. It turns out that all that was needed to shake Daemon free from his doldrums was a humongous host. Now, the king consort is running around making plans; he’s walking-and-talking like he’s in an episode of The West(eros) Wing. When Ser Alfred Broome, who recently arrived from Dragonstone on Rhaenyra’s orders, offers to betray their would-be queen to support his claim, Daemon is all smiles. Matt Smith is such a treat to watch when he’s operating in this gear, his mouth a half-smirk, his eyes atwinkle. Finally, everything is coming up Daemon.

At least for a few minutes. Soon, though, Alys returns from wherever Alys goes for episodes at a time and deems Daemon ready to see his own fate. She leads him to the Godswood, where he has visions that will feel meaningful to any Game of Thrones viewer: dead dragons, White Walkers, the certainty of demise and yet the whisper of a future. A glimpse of a clutch of dragon eggs. A naked figure bathed in golden light, surrounded by a trio of hatchlings. Life after death. Daemon sees Rhaenyra on the throne. A woman. A queen. In fact, in this vision of annihilation and redemption, Daemon hardly features at all.

The man has spent the entire season walking up to the edge of mutiny only to retreat. When Rhaenyra finally flies to Harrenhal to investigate rumors of her husband’s betrayal, Daemon makes the loudest and most heartfelt pledge to her he’s made to date. After a season of estrangement, he rousingly declares his fealty for all the Riverlords to hear, albeit in High Valyrian, a language they cannot speak or understand.

There’s a sense that it’s all finally about to pop off, though Rhaenyra’s game plan strikes me as tentative. The Blacks have seven dragons and two armies, and the strategic targets she’s identified, presumably with the help of Mysaria and the small council, are the Hightower seat of Oldtown and Lannisport, both on the opposite coast from King’s Landing. Not even loyal Baela can contain her befuddlement. What was the point of weakening the capital so terribly if you weren’t going in for the kill? Because victory will only come in one of two ways for Rhaenyra. She could fight a series of small skirmishes that end in a big battle for King’s Landing, or she could just go to King’s Landing now. Because Aemond isn’t the kind of guy to resign in the face of gradual losses. It will have to be catastrophic.

Or maybe it doesn’t have to be war at all. It’s an episode of reunions and reconciliations for Rhaenyra: first her uncle-husband, then her stepmother-friend. Alicent comes to Dragonstone with a plan for peace, one I suppose she started cooking up whilst camping. She tells Rhaenyra that Aemond is planning to fly to battle in three days. If Rhaenyra comes to the Red Keep, then Queen Helaena, who cannot bear to burn a soul, will let her in. History will call Alicent a villain, but that’s a price the dowager queen’s willing to pay for a life free from plotting. It will cost her the lives of her eldest sons, but she’s willing to pay that, too. The scene between the matriarchs is taut and tense — a real testament to only handing out speaking parts to talented actors. Alicent wants peace, for herself more than for the kingdom, but the two turn out to be inextricable.

The scene between them crescendoes into a stirring montage. The pieces aren’t just all on the board; they’re careening toward each other. Hugh, Ulf, and Addam are fitted with armor and cloaks, seduced into battle by Rhaenyra’s promise of knighthood if death doesn’t come for them first.

Corlys and Alyn, the son who hangs onto his hatred for his long-absent father, set sail side by side. They anticipate meeting the Greyjoy Navy in the Gullet, but Tyland and Lohar are navigating to the same churning stretch of the dark sea.

A downtrodden Criston, who invites his own death as a freedom from the tyranny of dragons, marches alongside Gwayne to Harrenhal, his entire life’s work rendered meaningless: “The dragons dance, and men are like dust under their feet.” Jason Lannister puts his pet lions back in their show cages and he, too, makes for Harrenhal, not not looking like a traveling circus. There they might meet Daemon, unless he’s already set out for King’s Landing. Maybe they’ll be intercepted by Stark’s Greybeards, whom we finally see crossing the Green Fork into the Riverlands.

Aegon and Larys are bound for the Free Cities, where, if Tyland’s experience is any indication, they’ll have a lot of fun and make new friends along the way.

Otto is revealed to be imprisoned somewhere, though, in truth, I kinda forgot he was missing.

And Rhaena, bless her heart, finally corners a dragon.

It’s a masterful collage that makes this vast and fantastical world feel small and combustible. One wrong move, and it will all go wrong. And maybe, in a year or two, when they finally release season three, it will, but that expertly crafted tension will have dissipated. It’s not a cliffhanger. The show never gets us close enough to peer over the edge of the cliff.

There is, though, buried in the middle of the finale a compelling twist — proof that the series can be electric when it gets the pacing right. When Daemon plugs into the Godswood’s answer to Hometree, it’s Helaena who narrates his dreamscape, letting him know the role he’s to play in things to come. Later, she’ll tell Aemond that she knows he shot their brother from the sky because she “saw” it.

Is Helaena a dreamwalker? Has she been warging this whole time? When she tells the prince regent that he’ll die at the lake at God’s Eye and that her husband will be king again, should we believe her? Because damn, Helaena, spoiler alert! The revelation that the grieving queen is more complicated and powerful than meets the eye is made slowly and all at once. I now remember, from another episode, her peering at insects in jars — peculiar but maybe prescient, too, if I had been paying her more attention. She was the first to worry about the rats. She’s frail but decisive. Earlier in the season, posed a choice between her children similar to the one Rhaenyra presents Alicent, she was quick to sacrifice the life of her son for that of her daughter. So is Helaena weak, or is she simply the only member of her family who is not obsessed with projecting strength? The show answered a question and embedded a mystery in a few deft moments.

I’d like to see Heleana’s visions happen — at least some of them. I’d like to know what it looks like for a dragon to be swallowed by a lake. Then again, at the pace this series is moving, I might just take her word for it."
"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://theplaylist.net/house-of-the-dragon-will-end-with-season-4-season-3-expected-to-shoot-early-2025-20240805/,"24 SHARES Facebook Twitter

“House Of The Dragon” season two ended last night on HBO, Sunday, August 4, and some fans were left with mixed feelings. The finale was dubbed “anticlimactic” by a Variety review—no major battles, no significant deaths— but many suggested this was the point of building anticipation. Additionally, historically, “Game Of Thrones” used the same approach; its bigger battles were in the penultimate and antepenultimate episodes, and its finales were left for brooding, licking wounds, and the more fantastic wars to come.

But regardless of some disappointment, fans are already clamoring for information about what comes next and when. Well, not only has “House of the Dragon,” showrunner and co-creator Ryan Condal teased when season three is coming (likely early 2026, given its every two years schedule), but he’s revealed that the entire series will likely end with season four. “No, I think it’s four,” he responded when asked if the fantasy drama would run five seasons.

Condal revealed that a third season is currently being written and that the plan is to go into production in “earlyish 2025.” Asked whether it would return to ten episodes again—season two had only eight—Condal said he wasn’t sure yet but did suggest the new shorter format would be the way forward.

“I haven’t had discussions with HBO about it. I would just anticipate that the cadence of the show, from a dramatic storytelling perspective, will continue to be the same from Season two on.”

In one of his personal blog posts early on, original “A Song of Ice and Fire” author George R.R. Martin, who is also co-creator of “House of the Dragon,” said four seasons would be necessary to tell the whole tale, so this length in keeping with that prediction.

Condal wouldn’t say much about what’s to come in season three, but the end of season two did tease the return of Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans) — the former Hand of the King and Alicent’s father. “We were delighted to have Rhys reenter the story, and I will just say that the Otto Hightower tale has not yet come to an end,” he said suggestively.

With an early 2025 shoot, the big and expansive third season of “House Of The Dragon” is not expected to return until early 2026—the enormity of the scale of the series means it requires much time and VFX to put together.

“I know everybody wants this to come out every summer. It’s just that the show is so complex that we’re really making multiple feature films every season,” Condal said in a press conference for the finale on Sunday night (via The Wrap), hinting at the wait to come. “So I apologize for the wait, but I will just say if Rooks Rest and the Red Sowing were good, then the team that we have together… we’re gonna pull off a hell of a win, The Battle of the Gullet.”

The showrunner even defended the finale’s mellowness in the press conference. The Battle of the Gullet was pushed to season three, and Condal suggested that’s just the nature of the logistical beast.

“One of the challenges of making television at any scale nobody has infinite time and resources,” he said via THR. “When you’re a showrunner, you’re always in the position of having to balance storytelling and the resources that you have available to tell that story. One of the things that came into play in season two is: What is the final destination of the series, and where are we going? It was a combination of factors that led us to rebalance the season knowing now where we’re going. We wanted to rebalance the story in such a way that we had three great seasons of television [after season one] to round out and tell this story. When you’re trying to mount the show, which requires a tremendous amount of resources, construction, armor, costumes, and visual effects … we are trying to give The Gullet — which is arguably the second most anticipated action event of ‘Fire and Blood’— trying to give it the time and the space that it deserves.”

“House Of The Dragon” season one debuted in August of 2022; season two premiered just shy of tune years later on June 16 of this year. Following last night’s finale, HBO launched an upcoming sizzle reel that also gave viewers at the next “Game Of Thrones” spin-off, titled “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.” While no release date was given, the teaser revealed the series will arrive sometime in 2025."
"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-finale-reaction-1235965980/,"Note: This story contains spoilers for House of the Dragon season two finale.

HBO cutting to black hasn’t annoyed this many TV fans since The Sopranos ended.

Season two of House of the Dragon led up to a great battle for control of Westeros — a war potentially fought on several fronts, with massive armies, impossibly high stakes and fire-breathing dragons galore! And to see it, you’ll just have to wait a couple years for season three, since Sunday’s finale concluded moments before the action was seemingly about to get underway (“When the most action in the season finale is mud wresting,” groused one viewer).

For fans (some of the heated and varied reactions are below), the finale felt a bit like deja vu. The first- season finale ended with a sense of “OK, now it’s war!” The second-season finale has now also ended with “OK, now it’s war!” HBO’s pre-season marketing issued dueling Green vs. Black trailers and a viral marketing stunt hanging the rival Targaryen banners at historic locations, teasing an epic civil war clash between a house divided befitting of a franchise known for its epic clashes.

But while the season’s fourth episode delivered a well-received dragon-fighting action sequence, and there were other gripping moments of action here and there, this season Rhaenyra (Emma D’Arcy) and Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke) largely hung around their respective castles enduring small council meetings, while fan-favorite Daemon (Matt Smith) was shuttled off to Harrenhal to also hang out at a castle and have meetings — plus dreams and premonitions.

The Daemon move, in particular, perplexed fans this season, as it seemed more like something a show typically does with a well-worn character five seasons into a series with 20 episodes to fill rather than something a show does with an extremely popular character during its eight-episode second season.

At the same time, fans seemed to really like what they did get in the finale — particularly, a wonderfully tense face-off between Rhaenyra and Alicent (it’s really easy to sneak back and forth between these castles!), Daemon’s prophetic vision that included a glimpse of Daenerys Targaryen from the first show, the introduction of Abigail Thorn as Sharako Lohar, and composer Ramin Djawadi’s score. “Simply too much good shit in the #HOTD finale for me to be anything but impressed,” as one viewer wrote below.

Yet the fact that the season is only eight episodes is being particularly bitterly felt. The first season was 10 episodes. Deadline previously reported “a major battle” was moved from season two to season three. Showrunner Ryan Condal has previously said the season was short in order to give it “a good opening and a good ending.” (See what he had to say about the finale on Monday.) But writer-producer Sara Hess was also quoted in EW as saying the shorter season “wasn’t really our choice.” The season was shot during the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strike, having earned an exemption as many of the actors fell under Equity union and not SAG, but that was after the season’s scripts had been completed. HBO has previously claimed the episode change was “story driven” and not the result of the extensive cost cutting that’s been seen under Warner Bros. Discovery leadership change. Fair or not, it almost feels as if “shrinkflation” — which has impacted everything from the packaging of Oreos to Huggies — has come to streaming.

Below are some of the varied reactions to the finale:

Mixed feelings about the House of the Dragon finale. On one hand it was one of my favorite episodes of the series so far. On the other hand there’s been so much tension built up throughout the season that not releasing any of it for a 2+ year wait doesn’t really work for me. — Thomas Huckleberry (@ThomasHuck100) August 5, 2024

Simply too much good shit in the #HotD finale for me to be anything but impressed.



I get if you were expecting some of the more action-filled plot beats from F&B to land here you might be disappointed. But the setup for S3 and what we got along the way was SO damn good, imo. https://t.co/EU6rmS5Pcz — Frank Bumb (@frankbumb) August 5, 2024

House of the Dragon is just a show where everything is constantly about to happen but doesn’t actually happen.



The entirety of Season 2 should have been a 3 episode arc, nothing more nothing less.



And the finale was the worst finale I’ve seen.#HBO #HouseOfTheDragon #boring — Wallin Ballin (@wallin_ballin) August 5, 2024

The series finale of House of the Dragon really just pissed me off. What tf happened to insane shit happening in the finale. Like where are the major character deaths? The plot twists? The curve balls? I’m sick of all this preparing for war shit. GO TO WAR ALREADY. Ugh — hunt 🐝 (@huuntresss) August 5, 2024

It was a great episode but it had no business being a season finale. What this finale proved was that HOTD needs 10 episodes. — JJ 😈 (@KingJordan_57) August 5, 2024

#HouseOfTheDragons2ep8 – The 2nd season finale wasn't as amazing as I had anticipated; instead, it was just another typical episode. Apart from Daemon's vision (which will give you goosebumps 🤩), this finale only set the tone for the upcoming season.

House of the Dragon season two is now streaming on Max. Catch up with THR‘s season coverage and interviews."
"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a61794039/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-ending-otto-hightower/,"At the end of House of the Dragon’s controversial season 2 finale, a montage wraps up many of the fantasy show’s leftover plot threads. Corlys Velaryon (Steve Toussaint) sets out to sea, Rhaena (Phoebe Campbell) finds yet another dragon, and the armies from the North finally begin their march. But what the hell happened to Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans)? Well, he’s sitting behind bars.

Back in episode 2, Otto decides to leave King’s Landing and meet up with his grandson, Daeron Targaryen, in Oldtown. Though he is no longer Hand of the King, he still plans to help his family in their war against Rhaenyra Targaryen (Emma D’Arcy). But he disappears. Much later, Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke) tells her brother, Gwayne (Freddie Fox), that she hasn’t received a single response to any of her letters. In fact, Otto doesn’t even appear onscreen again until a quick reveal in the finale montage.

“We find Otto in this cell somewhere, and we don’t know quite where he is or what happened to him,” showrunner Ryan Condal says in an “Inside the Episode” video that aired after the season 2 finale. Then Condal moves on to detailing the rest of the finale montage. That’s it? Where is Otto?!?

HBO Otto...is that you?!?

The mystery is much deeper when you look for answers in the show’s source material, George R.R. Martin’s Fire & Blood. Otto is a lot more useful at this point in the book. Instead of sending Tyland Lannister (Jefferson Hall) to meet with the Triarchy, Fire & Blood has Otto Hightower make the deal. So we’re already off-book on House of the Dragon. When Condal says, “We don’t know quite where he is or what happened to him,” he really means it.

There’s another possibility. In season 2, episode 7, Lord Jasper Wylde (Paul Kennedy) gives an update on the Hightowers during a council meeting. He mentions, “There is great concern that [Ormud Hightower’s] host is threatened on two fronts by armies allied with House Beesbury.” This is also canon in Fire & Blood.

As you may recall, Ser Criston Cole (Fabien Frankel) murdered Lord Lyman Beesbury when the Green Council stole the throne at the end of the first season. Lyman’s grandson, Ser Alan Beesbury, doesn’t take too kindly to the news. He and Alan Tarly (an ancestor of Game of Thrones’ Samwell Tarly) form an army to seek revenge and battle the Hightowers. With Daeron and his dragon, Tessarion, taking flight in the finale montage, a battle between the two Alans may very well be coming next. To heighten the drama between the two, it’s possible that Beesbury and Tarly captured Otto on his way to Oldtown.

It’s just a guess! But we’ll likely know for sure whenever House of the Dragon returns for season 3, hopefully ready for war."
"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://consequence.net/2024/08/house-of-the-dragon-final-season-4/,"House of the Dragon showrunner Ryan Condal has confirmed there will be two more installments of the Game of Thrones prequel, which will end with Season 4.

In a press conference discussing the fallout from the Season 2 finale, Condal also gave an update on the progress of the third season. The writing process has already begun with the intention of doing prep in the fall. Production on Season 3 will then follow in “earlyish 2025.”

“There are so many great events that we are already writing in Season 3 as it is,” Condal said. “This war really comes to a big head at this point in the storytelling. I mean, if you look at Season 2, it’s largely a metaphor for a nuclear conflict… There’s gonna be giant moments of spectacle but real moments of surprise and character nuance that we’re very much looking forward to.”

He continued by suggesting that fans of the show read Fire and Blood so they can be “armed with lots of information going into Season 3.”

As our own Liz Shannon Miller wrote in her review of the final episode of Season 2, the series is just hitting its stride, as the stable of characters “feels like it’s finally come alive.”

FIVE YEARS OUT from the final episode of Game of Thrones, and we're once again spending time in Westeros.

House of the Dragon is back for Season 2. If you thought Season 1 was intense, Season 2 is only going to get more violent and shocking. Based on the first season's finale, we know war is on the horizon. The throne of Westeros is up for grabs, and the most influential families in the land will use anything—dragons, politicking, and subterfuge—to gain power.

While much of the first season was backstory and table setting, there's no more set up necessary for Season 2. The lines are clearly drawn, blood has already been shed, and you're either Team Rhaenyra or Team Alicent.

At the end of last season, we had a major twist. As both Rhaenrya and Alicent scramble to line up allies for their vie for the throne, they send their children in their stead across Westeros. Lucerys and Aemond both appear to the Baratheons, but it's Aemond that comes away with a marriage proposal and a chance at an alliance. Lucerys leaves empty-handed on his dragon, and Aemond follows on his own. While Aemond teases his cousin and thinks it all fun and games, his dragon, Vhagar doesn't. Lucerys dies, and the fight cements the hatred between the two families; there's no turning back after that.

All to say, you'll really want to tune in to see what's next for Westeros. And so you don't get spoiled, you'll want to watch episodes as soon as you can. Here's when new episodes premiere.

Spoilers below.

Game of Thrones might have run for eight seasons, but House of the Dragon will end at four.

Showrunner Ryan Condal announced the news to reporters today, following the HotD season 2 finale. Per The Hollywood Reporter, when asked whether the prequel would continue for five seasons, Condal clarified, “No, I think it’s four.” (However, HBO has not officially announced a season 4 renewal yet.)

This aligns with what George R. R. Martin predicted, Variety points out. Back in 2022, the author, whose book Fire & Blood is the source material for this show, wrote on his blog that it would take “four full seasons of 10 episodes each to do justice to the Dance of the Dragons [the Targaryen civil war], from start to finish.” Season 2, however, comprised of eight episodes. Condal anticipates that “the cadence of the show, from a dramatic storytelling perspective, will continue to be the same from season 2 on.”

Deadline previously reported in 2023 that the creative team saw the show running for three or four seasons. At the time, Condal and Martin, who is also an executive producer, had to “take a big-picture view of the series, which follows Martin’s Fire & Blood, and figure out the overall narrative flow, including how to break up the stories season-to-season and what battles to include and when,” co-editor-in-chief Nellie Andreeva wrote at the time.

“With a portion of the plot originally intended for season 2, including a major battle, moving to season 3, I hear it is now more likely that the series would run for four seasons,” she added. This is likely referring to the Battle of the Gullet, a major battle set up in season season 2 which doesn’t end up happening in the finale. Instead, it’s been pushed off to next season, to many fans’ frustrations.

Prep for season 3 is set to begin this fall and then production is slated for “earlyish 2025,” Condal says, per Variety. With the second season ending on a bit of a lull, there will be plenty of action to beef up the series’ next two installments. Watch this space for updates.

"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://uk.news.yahoo.com/house-dragon-end-season-4-190116358.html,"HBO’s “House of the Dragon” will end after four seasons, showrunner and co-creator Ryan Condal revealed in a Monday press conference.

The third season of the “Game of Thrones” prequel series is currently being written, Condal told press. The Season 2 finale just aired (and streamed on Max!) on Sunday night. Condal expects to begin production on Season 3 sometime in “early-ish” 2025.

More from IndieWire

While it was suspected that “House of the Dragon” might only last four or five seasons, this is the first time Condal has confirmed a definitive end. George R. R. Martin, who is a co-creator on “House of the Dragon,” wrote in a 2022 blog post that he expected the series would need roughly four seasons of 10 episodes each in order to fully tell the story of “Dance of the Dragons” from his book “Fire & Blood.” HBO’s drama chief Francesca Orsi also previously said she expected “House of the Dragon” would run for a minimum of four seasons. She recently (officially, it was never in doubt) picked up a third season.

At the presser, Condal was also asked what we might expect, episode-count-wise, from these subsequent seasons. All he said was to not expect too many changes to the formula.

“Without saying anything, because I haven’t had discussions with HBO about it, I would just anticipate the cadence of the show, from a dramatic storytelling perspective, will continue to be the same from Season 2 on,” Condal said.

Season 1 was 10 episodes; Season 2 had eight.

Condal did tease a bit of what he’s excited about working on for Season 3. The war is coming to a head at this very moment in the story; Condal said this just-wrapped season was “largely a metaphor for a nuclear conflict.” The best stuff is still to come, he promised.

“If Season 2 was the the arming of the sides and the Cold War, with moments of actual conflict and explosion, I think Season 3, really, you do start to see things boil over from here to the end of the war,” he said. “So as always with this show, there’s going to be giant moments of spectacle, but also real moments of surprise and character nuance that we’re very much looking forward to. And I think really, some of my favorite moments in the book are, just as a reader, that I’m excited to adapt as a dramatist are yet to come in the story.”

Condal previously said he felt Season 3 would be the biggest challenge in finding fresh storylines.

“There’s a rhythm to all this, these kinds of stories as you tell them,” Condal said. “And we’re trying to find satisfying arcs within the season structure. So, hopefully you start with a bang, and then you build to another bang through the series, but you’re really trying to arc out the characters, so that each season is a different experience for all of them. And then you leave them off all in a place where you can pick up with them next year, and then take them in a new direction, because you don’t want to end up in that place where you’re doing the same thing again and again.”

“House of the Dragon” has continued to be a major hit for HBO, with the premiere providing the biggest premiere in Max history, but only because when the first season premiered even bigger, the service was still called HBO Max.

On X, formerly Twitter, @DiscussingFilm shared the news that House of the Dragon will come to an end after two more seasons.

Viewers aren't happy, however, and believe the show should be yanked from air now.

Following a disappointing Season Two finale, critics claimed HBO is dragging out the story.

""Season 2 finale was a massive let down lol,"" complained one viewer.

""Three season story at best. More game of thrones the better but they are milking it,"" critiqued another.

""Getting 4 seasons out of this because they dragged out season 2 to avoid the war is wild,"" slammed a third viewer.

""This season sucked. Where was the second major battle we were supposed to see? Waited two years for one good episode and for the rest to be filler and/or setup. But don't worry guys!!! The war is for sure coming next season!!"" bashed a fourth.

""My homie said even having a 3rd season would be dragging the serious out so a 4th is just beating a dead horse lol,"" another commenter wrote in part.

""2 seasons too many,"" a sixth disappointed viewer posted.

""Yeah 4 seasons is a stretch for the material. The new name for this show: House of the Dragging,"" critiqued another commenter.

""I speak for everyone when I say just cancel it now,"" commented an eighth user.

""Let it end with Season 3,"" urged another fan.

Someone else complained the show ""should be canceled"" after the Season Two finale.

MORE TO COME

House of the Dragon viewers learned there would be a third season before Season Two even aired on HBO.

Who stars in House of the Dragon? A prequel to smash-hit fantasy series Game of Thrones, House of the Dragon premiered in August 2022. The show features an ensemble cast playing characters in the fictional setting of Westeros. Let's take a look at some of the famous faces in House of the Dragon. Paddy Considine: Actor, director and screenwriter Paddy received the role of King Viserys I Targaryen in House of the Dragon and led the ensemble in sesason one. Paddy's film credits include Hot Fuzz and The World's End, while his other TV work ranges from Peaky Blinders, The Outsider and The Third Day. He is also known for his collaborations with director Shane Meadows. Matt Smith: Matt became the youngest ever actor to play Doctor Who, when he nabbed the role as a 29-year-old in 2009. Now a few years removed from the beloved BBC show, he is now playing the unpredictable Prince Daemon Targaryen in House of the Dragon. Matt also starred as Prince Philip in The Crown, receiving a Primetime Emmy award nomination for his performance. Olivia Cooke: From Oldham in Greater Manchester, Olivia Cooke has enjoyed success on both sides of the pond. She had a starring role as Emma Decody in Bates Motel from 2013 to 2017. Prior to starring as Alicent Hightower in House of the Dragon, Olivia also appeared in period drama Vanity Fair and the sci-fi film Ready Player One, which was directed by Steven Spielberg. Rhys Ifans: Before playing Ser Otto Hightower, Rhys Ifans was no stranger to blockbuster franchises. He's played Xenophilius Lovegood in Harry Potter and Marvel Comics villain Dr Curt Connors/Lizard. He portrayed Mycroft Holmes in CBS series Elementary. Rhys also starred in films such as Notting Hill, Kevin & Perry Go Large and Enduring Love. Emma D'Arcy: Before landing the role of Princess/Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen, Emma had appeared as a main cast member in Wanderlust and Truth Seekers. Their film credits include 2020's Misbehaviour opposite a cast including Keira Knightley, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Greg Kinnear, Keeley Hawes, Jessie Buckley, Phyllis Logan and Lesley Manville.

The network shared the news in June, a few weeks before the premiere.

HBO's programming and drama series chief, Francesca Orsi, made the reveal in a statement.

""We are in awe of the dragon-sized effort the entire team has put into the creation of a spectacular season two, with a scope and scale that is only rivaled by its heart,"" she said.

""We could not be more thrilled to continue the story of House Targaryen and watch this team burn bright again for season three.""

She praised George R.R. Martin, who wrote the books off which Game of Thrones and the prequel are based, as well as showrunner Ryan Condal.

House of the Dragon is set 200 years before Game of Thrones, which aired on HBO from 2011 to 2019.

The original series was based on the novel series A Song of Ice and Fire.

House of the Dragon details the fall of House Targaryen, represented in Game of Thrones by Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke), who was an integral part of the show.

HEATING UP

In addition to announcing more seasons of House of The Dragon to come, HBO has revealed plans to release another Game of Thrones prequel.

In April 2023, fans learned that a show called A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms: The Hedge Knight, was in early development.

The show is expected to follow Dunk and Egg and will be set 90 years before Game of Thrones.

HBO released a short synopsis of the show, teasing what's to come.

""A century before the events of Game of Thrones, two unlikely heroes wandered Westeros... a young, naive, but courageous knight, Ser Duncan the Tall, and his diminutive squire, Egg.

""Set in an age when the Targaryen line still holds the Iron Throne and the memory of the last dragon has not yet passed from living memory, great destinies, powerful foes, and dangerous exploiters all await these improbable and incomparable friends.""

The show will launch on Max.

Ryan Condal and Vince Gerardis, both executive producers on Game of Thrones and House of the Dragon, will return to oversee the new spinoff series.

No further details have been released at this time.

"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://www.comingsoon.net/tv/features/1822530-house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-8-recap-and-thoughts-finale,"We finally arrive at the House of the Dragon Season 2 finale, and … I’m more frustrated than elated. Save for a few brief moments here and there, HOTD Season 2 was very underwhelming.

Honestly, I’m shocked. I expected an epic payoff, a battle, a shocking twist, or some sort of wild plot development. Instead, Episode 8 felt more like a mid-season chapter than a season capper. In a show filled with dragons, armies, and the threat of war, I suppose it’s only fitting that Season 2 ends with two women sitting in a room sorting out their feelings.

Anyway, let’s discuss what happened or didn’t happen in House of the Dragon Season 2 Episode 8.

What happened in the House of the Dragon Season 2 finale?

Team Green

We open with Tyland Lannister attempting to woo the Triarchy. This somehow leads to a mud wrestling contest between our cowardly lion and a tough-as-nails woman named Lohar. Impressed by Tyland’s grit, Lohar agrees to lend him her army. Yay.

Meanwhile, Aemond nukes the village of Sharp Point off-screen because, Heaven forbid, we have any war sequences in a show about war. He’s mad, you see, that Rhaenyra won the dragon race, and because he’s a man, he massacres innocent civilians to make himself feel better. Later, the one-eyed king damn near forces his sister, the benevolent Queen Helaena, to jump atop her dragon and join him in an attack against Daemon at Harrenhal.

Helaena’s like, nah, I’m good, and Aemond’s like, “Grrrrr, okay.”

The men on this show are immature babies with no control over their passions, you see, prone to weeping at every conceivable opportunity.

Well, Alicent has had enough of this foolishness and decides to escape the situation she created in Season 1 when she was an actual character.

Meanwhile, Larys Strong convinces Aegon to flee the realm, correctly fearing that Aemond will kill him when he fully recovers. I don’t get this particular plot point. Why didn’t Aemond finish off his brother when he had the chance? Why wait until he’s healthy? He could have killed or sent others to kill Aegon anytime throughout the last few months, and no one would have batted an eye. Everyone knows he is responsible for the king’s current predicament. Finishing the job would hardly cause much debate, especially since no one seemed to like Aegon.

Anyway, Larys Strong and Aegon slip through King’s Landing’s feeble defenses — everyone appears able to sneak away whenever the plot requires — heading toward the goatfuckers in Bravos. Tune in next year for the further adventures of Aegon and Strong!

Oh, Ser Criston Cole briefly appears and spouts nonsense about all men being evil while clutching Alicent’s handkerchief. Thanks for those wise words, Criston.

Team Black

Rhaenyra has an army of dragons! Horray! But she’s still dead set against war. Boo! She must contend with her new low-born dragon riders, the noble Hammer and the unwieldy Ulf. The latter behaves like a 12-year-old hopped up on Pixie Sticks and is shocked when the higher-ups command him to act like a grown-ass man. Surely, the poorest citizens of King’s Landing know better than to put their feet on the Queen’s table or hug the prince. Does Ulf have to act like Will Ferrell’s Elf to help us understand how unprepared he is for battle?

Anyway, Corlys tells Rhaenyra to attack King’s Landing while she has the high ground. Nah, she says.

We know where this is going, HBO. Get on with it!

Later, Coryls makes the mistake of saying hi to his bastard son Alyn and gets an ass-chewing for his failure as a father. Has Corlys done anything positive on this show?

At Harrenhal, Daemon continues to fret over whether to join Rhaenyra or take King’s Landing for himself. Viewers may recall the endless assortment of dreams this fucker experienced throughout the season, none of which persuaded him to bend the knee.

Alys Rivers, the local witch, cuts to the chase and shows him Game of Thrones Season 1-6. He sees Daenerys, the White Walkers, and other brief episodes but is spared from the awful finale. This alone convinces him to fight alongside Rhaenyra, which makes us wonder why the ghosts of Harrenhal tortured us with hours and hours of nonsensical dream sequences.

Suddenly, Daemon sees Rhaenyra’s importance and casts aside all selfish ambitions to aid her, er, selfish ambitions. When the Queen the Ever Was arrives, she’s surprised to find a contrite uncle/husband willing to swear his allegiance. She forgives him — his enormous army certainly helps in that regard — but fails to acknowledge that she is now, in fact, into women now. Honestly, he’d probably dig that.

Alright, the armies are assembled. Rhaenyra has her dragons. Aemond has his motivations. Ten minutes remain in the episode, plenty of time for a thrilling battle sequence.

Ah, what’s this? Rhaenyra is summoned downstairs and is surprised to find none other than Alicent standing in her living room. Eh, for the next ten minutes, the two women engage in a lengthy conversation that serves as a heavy-handed summary of the show. Then, she drops a bomb: Aemond is heading to the Riverlands, leaving King’s Landing vulnerable. She tells Rhaenyra that she will order the guards to lay down their weapons, allowing “The Pretender” to take the throne without violence. (Boo!) In exchange, she wants to leave with Helaena and live in peace somewhere. She also expects Rhaenyra to end this pointless war.

Rhaenyra’s like, nah, I want Aegon’s head. “A son for a son,” she says, likely having just watched Avatar: The Way of Water. Alicent must put her money where her mouth is and make the sacrifice.

Sure, she says.

It’s a fine scene, well acted and written, but good lord, it’s the final episode of the season! This quiet conversation would work as a nice counterbalance to a more action-oriented season. Alas, aside from Rook’s Rest, Season 2 spent too long tip-toeing along the edges of battle and refused to dive into the central conflict. We’ve endured a thousand of these quiet conversations without payoff and must now wait two years to see these two great houses go at it on the battlefield.

Even then, I suspect the showrunners will delay the violence for as long as humanly possible to ensure this series stretches to six, seven, or eight seasons. Sometimes I hate TV.

We also get awkward moments of Lady Rhaena chasing after a dragon near the Eyrie. Was she running for weeks on end in a dress?

House of the Dragon Season 2 Episode 8 thoughts

Well, that’s it. That’s the House of the Dragon Season 2 finale. Maybe it wouldn’t be so frustrating if I could binge-watch the whole thing in one sitting. As it stands, this was a tremendous letdown, explicitly considering the length of time we were forced to wait. I don’t mind the occasional filler episode, but Season 2 felt like nothing but filler episodes sprinkled with a few critical character beats.

I don’t tune in to Game of Thrones for massive CGI battles. I want political intrigue, captivating character development, and intellectual drama packed with shocking twists and turns. For all its luscious dialogue and well-rounded characters, HOTD: S2 felt like an incredibly long wind-up to a battle we have yet to see.

That would be fine if the behind-the-scenes drama amounted to anything substantial. Rhaenyra’s pleas for peace grew increasingly redundant, as did Alicent’s non-stop moping and Daemon’s endless supernatural dealings. Aemond spent too long on the sidelines, Corlys accomplished nothing, and Criston morphed from a pathetic ex-boyfriend to a slightly less pathetic ex-boyfriend who no longer believes in anything. Supporting characters like Jace were given little to do, while a subplot involving the citizens of King’s Landing rising up against their rulers seems to have vanished entirely.

In short, this storyline did not require an eight-episode arc.

On a positive note, the acting remains top-notch. Emma D’Arcy, Olivia Cooke, and Matt Smith were terrific in their respective roles. Production values were likewise impressive, specifically the dragons. You could see the massive budget on screen at all times. Dialogue was also solid. I rarely found myself smirking at a line or clunky piece of exposition. For all its storytelling flaws, HOTD remains a cut above most shows from a production standpoint — you genuinely feel emersed in Westeros.

Yes, I will tune in for Season 3. Look, I’m too invested in the story, characters, and universe to turn away now. Season 2 felt like a long, arduous walk up a mountain. Hopefully, Season 3 will reach its peak and lead to the ultimate payoff. I still believe, even if my faith is shaken."
"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://uk.news.yahoo.com/house-dragon-end-season-4-210400270.html,"House of the Dragon may have only just aired its second season, but it seems the story is only half-told, as the show will conclude in its fourth season.

The HBO show serves as a prequel to Game of Thrones, and it follows various members of the Targaryen family as they rule the Seven Kingdoms. The series is based on George RR Martin’s Fire & Blood.

Though its second season recently concluded, showrunner and co-creator Ryan Condal revealed during a press conference that work on the follow-up would get underway soon. It will be the penultimate season in a four-season run (via Variety).

Condal, who created the show alongside Martin, also spoke about the conclusion of the second season in more depth, with some fans left disappointed that the Battle of the Gullet wasn’t shown in the finale.

“We were trying to give the Gullet, which is arguably the most anticipated — well, I would say maybe the second-most-anticipated — action event of Fire & Blood, trying to give it the time and the space that it deserves,” explained Condal.

“Obviously, as anybody that’s seen the finale, we’re building to that event. That event will happen very shortly in terms of the storytelling of House of the Dragon. Based on what we know now, it should be the biggest thing to date that we’ve pulled off.

“And we just wanted to have the time, the space to do that at a level that is going to excite and satisfy the fans and in the way it’s deserved. I know everybody wants this to come out every summer.

“It’s just that the show is so complex that we’re really making multiple feature films every season. So I apologise for the wait, but I will just say if Rook’s Rest and The Red Sowing are any indication, we’re gonna pull off a hell of a win with the Battle the Gullet in the future.”

Game of Thrones seasons 1-8 are available on DVD and Blu-ray. House of the Dragon airs on HBO and Max in the US, and on Sky Atlantic and NOW in the UK.

"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://people.com/house-of-the-dragon-season-3-everything-to-know-8671102,"The bloody battle of who will lay claim to the Iron Throne isn't over yet — because House of the Dragon is officially returning for a third season.

The Game of Thrones prequel series was renewed for a third installment just days before the premiere of its second season in June 2024. And if the viewership ratings indicate anything — approximately 7.8 million viewers tuned in to the season 2 premiere, according to Deadline — it's that fans want to see more Targaryen family drama.

House of the Dragon is set about 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones and follows the rise and fall of a powerful family known (and feared) for their dragons and tendency towards madness. It was co-created by Ryan Condal and George R.R. Martin, who wrote the fantasy novel series Game of Thrones is based on.

While season 1 introduced viewers to the Targaryen family and season 2 saw a few dragon battles, Condal admitted during an ""Inside the Episode"" special after the finale that season 3 will focus on ""total war.""

""While this season was very much about the fits and starts of an early medieval war, season 3 is clearly going to be about total war,"" he revealed.

From a surprising reunion in the season 2 finale to the bloody battles to come, here's everything we know about House of the Dragon season 3 so far.

When will House of the Dragon season 3 be released?

Following the end of the second season on Aug. 4, 2024, a premiere date for House of the Dragon's third season has yet to be announced. Showrunners have also not disclosed how many episodes fans can expect. (Season 1 contained 10 episodes, while season 2 only ran for eight.)

How did House of the Dragon season 2 end?

The season 2 finale saw another surprising reunion between Rhaenyra and Alicent, this time with Alicent sneaking into Dragonstone and offering her former friend a way to win the war. The two devise a plan for Rhaenyra to ultimately sit on the Iron Throne and Alicent tearfully agrees to Rhaenyra's one request: Aegon's head.

However, the episode's final moments show the Greens marching to Harrenhall, where Daemon and his army reside; new dragon riders for the Blacks preparing for battle; and Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney) escaping King's Landing with Larys (Matthew Needham) — seemingly throwing a wrench in Alicent and Rhaenyra's tentative plans.



The episode also included a full-circle moment to Game of Thrones with Daemon learning his fate, true purpose — and the darkness to come — in a vision. During the sequence, Daemon was guided by the three-eyed raven and saw the White Walkers, the end of the dragons and Daenerys Targaryen's (Emilia Clarke) rise over 200 years later. The vision ended with Rhaenyra sitting on the Iron Throne. When Rhaenyra later visited Harrenhal to determine Daemon's intentions, he bent the knee and warned her: ""Winter is coming"" — a line very familiar to Game of Thrones fans.



Which cast members are returning for House of the Dragon season 3?

While returning cast members haven't been confirmed, fans are hopeful that current stars Emma D'Arcy (Rhaenyra Targaryen), Olivia Cooke (Alicent Hightower) and Matt Smith (Daemon Targaryen) will reprise their roles.

During a June 2024 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, D'Arcy admitted that they felt ""kind of lonely"" filming the second season. Panicked fans were quick to speculate that they were leaving the show, but D'Arcy was only referring to shooting fewer scenes with their castmates Smith and Cooke.

“It really makes you know what you lost, I suppose — every time we do get to work [together], it’s a great privilege,"" D'Arcy said. ""So much of us making the first series, well for me, was falling in love with them — with Matt, with Liv, with other members of the cast — so anytime you get joy in that is a treat.”

The actor continued, “But shows have to move on, I think that’s what keeps it exciting, and there are different gravitational pulls this season for [Rhaenyra].”



What has the House of the Dragon cast and crew said about season 3?

Though details about the third season are few and far between, a few of the House of the Dragon cast members have shared their thoughts on continuing to expand the Game of Thrones universe.

“I know what to expect now, whereas last time, that was mad,” Cooke told Elle in a June 2024 interview. “There was a pressure [in] doing a new offshoot of the Game of Thrones world, and really desperately wanting it to be well-received because we’d worked so hard on it.”

Showrunner Condal told Entertainment Weekly in May 2024 that writers had already started crafting a third season because they had to plan in advance in order to release a new House of the Dragon season every other year. Even with the confirmation of season 3, deciding when to end the series is still up for debate.

""You certainly don't want to rush to get to an end, but you also don't want to overstay your welcome,"" he said. ""You want to find this very satisfying place to go out that ties up enough loose ends and leaves others intentionally open because, as we know, this history marches on for another 150 years to Daenerys.""

"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/house-of-the-dragon-4-seasons,"House of the Dragon is attempting to tell the entire Targaryen history spelled out in George R. R. Martin’s book Fire & Blood. But unlike its predecessor, Game of Thrones, the endpoint is already known. With that in mind, House of the Dragon is being deliberate with its pacing, and an end for the show was announced only hours after Season 2 ended. House of the Dragon fans may be disappointed by the show’s brevity, but this decision should help it avoid Game of Thrones’ worst mistake.

According to Variety, House of the Dragon showrunner Ryan Condal confirmed that the series will end after Season 4, and production of Season 3 will begin next year. It may be half as many seasons as Game of Thrones, but four seasons would actually match early predictions. After the release of Season 1, George R. R. Martin posted on his blog that “it is going to take four full seasons of 10 episodes each to do justice to the Dance of the Dragons, from start to finish.”

The fight for the crown between Rhaenyra and Aegon will only last another two seasons of (probably) eight episodes. HBO

It doesn’t look like Martin will quite get his full wish. While House of the Dragon Season 1 contained 10 episodes, Season 2 only had eight, and Condal revealed this will most likely be the norm going forward. “I haven’t had discussions with HBO about it, I would just anticipate the cadence of the show, from a dramatic storytelling perspective, will continue to be the same from Season 2 on,” he said.

Although the ending is now on the horizon, House of the Dragon has a more immediate concern: the Battle of the Gullet. It seemed like Season 2 was building to the monumental naval battle that would break the blockade Rhaenyra, Corlys, and the Blacks set up to starve the Greens out of King’s Landing, but the season finale ended mere moments before the battle was supposed to begin.

“That event will happen very shortly in terms of the storytelling of House of the Dragon,” Condal said. “Based on what we know now, it should be the biggest thing to date that we’ve pulled off, and we just wanted to have the time, the space to do that at a level that is going to excite and satisfy the fans and in the way it’s deserved.”‌

Condal will definitely have that time. If House of the Dragon Season 3 begins production in early 2025, it’s unlikely we’ll see this battle until late 2025 or early 2026. Condal insists the wait will be worth it. “I apologize for the wait, but I will just say if Rook’s Rest and the Red Sowing are any indication, we’re gonna pull off a hell of a win with the Battle the Gullet in the future,” he said.

With only two seasons left, will House of the Dragon be able to stick the landing? While Game of Thrones infamously ran out of source material and fumbled the endings of its biggest storylines, House of the Dragon has a completed book to use as a guide. “I do know now where we're going to end this particular story,” Ryan Condal told Inverse ahead of Season 2. “We have a good plan and we know the roadmap and how to get there.”

So while we’ll be saying goodbye to these Targaryens sooner rather than later, there’s still plenty to get excited about. Season 3 will hit the ground running with one of the most highly anticipated events in the entire story, and the Thrones-verse will continue expanding with more spinoffs like 2025’s A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms. House of the Dragon may only run for four seasons, but we’ll be staying in Westeros for a long time to come.

Condal says the forthcoming third season is being written, with a debut expected in “earlyish 2025.”

The show was renewed for season 3 in June, ahead of the debut of its sophomore frame.

There are also plenty of lingering questions about where House of the Dragon will go next. But the show may have already reached its halfway point.

Condal was asked by The Hollywood Reporter if the series would run for five seasons as previously mentioned. In response, Condal said ""I think it's four [seasons]."" He also explained why the Season 2 finale ended without showing the Battle of the Gullet.

""When you're a showrunner, you're always in the position of having to balance storytelling and the resources that you have available to tell that story,"" noted Condal. ""When you're trying to mount the show, which requires a tremendous amount of resources, construction, armor, costumes, visual effects… we are trying to give The Gullet--which is arguably the second most anticipated action event of Fire & Blood--trying to give it the time and the space that it deserves.""

He went on to ""apologize for the wait"" before adding that ""We're going to pull off a hell of a win with The Battle of the Gullet.""

According to Condal, House of the Dragon Season 3 will begin filming next year, and it will likely be eight episodes long."
"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://www.tvinsider.com/1146698/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-finale-ending-explained-rhaenyra-alicent/,"[Warning: The following contains MAJOR spoilers for the House of the Dragon Season 2 finale, “The Queen Who Ever Was.”]

George R.R. Martin’s Fire & Blood is filled with epic battles, but only one of them was seen in House of the Dragon‘s second season, which came as a shock to viewers. The Season 2 finale ended with the stage being set for the next conflict, the Battle of the Gullet, and even though showrunner Ryan Condal promises that this deadly showdown will take place “early” in House of the Dragon Season 3, fans are still disappointed by what they feel is a lack of meat in Season 2’s plot.

Geeta Vasant Patel, the director of the House of the Dragon Season 2 finale, tells TV Insider that the finale didn’t go to war because this season was focused on Rhaenyra (Emma D’Arcy) and Alicent (Olivia Cooke). Condal and writer/executive producer Sara Hess’ decision to save the Battle of the Gullet for Season 3 was “brave,” according to Patel. But she knew when she got the finale script that bringing this story to life was a “tall order.”

The season ends with four shots of Rhaenyra and Alicent — two shot in profile and made to look like the queens were looking at each other, and two symbolizing where their actions have led them. Rhaenyra’s final shot comes first, showing her surrounded by scrolls containing decades of Targaryen history, and then the season ends with Alicent looking out on the horizon at Dragonstone surrounded by the open air. Bringing Rhaenyra and Alicent’s storylines to a satisfying emotional climax was the main goal of Patel’s directing in this episode (Patel also directed Season 2 Episode 3 — the episode with Rhaenyra and Alicent’s first secret meeting — as well as Season 1 Episode 8).

“When I got the script, obviously those shots weren’t scripted. I had to figure out how to interpret the script and design the last shots, and it was a tall order because I knew that some people might be expecting a big war, the escalation of Episode 7,” Patel explains. “And yet Ryan Condal and Sara Hess had taken such a brave route in making this about two people and about the dramaturgy and going back to the root of storytelling and not giving in to something that maybe would’ve just been easy as a season finale.”

“They took the very difficult and yet artful route,” she continues, “so I felt like we needed to find something that would make people feel, and that’s really our job as directors. I think the season finale needed to make us feel, and that’s universal to whether it’s an action sequence or it’s a dramatic conversation that feels like an action sequence, something that you come away with kind of throttled a bit.”

Rhaenyra and Alicent’s final scene was all about shifting the burden of leadership from Alicent to Rhaenyra. In Season 1, we saw Alicent take the reins and place Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney) on the Iron Throne out of her misinterpretation of Viserys’ (Paddy Considine) final words. Alicent assumed her work would continue with Aegon on the throne, but Aemond’s (Ewan Mitchell) rise to Prince Regent took away any ounce of political power she had left. Alicent took control of the board at the end of Season 1, and Rhaenyra spent most of Season 2 trying to take it over herself while avoiding bloodshed. She succeeded in wresting control of the board, but the cost of keeping it will be paid in blood.

“As I listened to Ryan and Sara talk about the end of the episode, they really wanted the burden from Alicent to now be on Rhaenyra’s shoulders. That was the design that they had coming up to that moment,” Patel says. “It obviously was an earned moment. That scene was not going to work in isolation. It was about all the work that came before it, so as I thought about the transfer of burden, I started feeling like, OK, if I was Rhaenyra, I’m caught in this spiderweb. There’s nothing I can do. I’ve tried every way out and nothing has worked. I was sitting in the library when we were shooting one day, and I saw the scrolls and I just kept thinking, OK, well, I can’t introduce a spiderweb because literally there’s no theme that we would connect it to — because we’re always trying to repeat themes — but then the scrolls might create a spiderweb.”

The design for those final shoots “took all season” for Patel to figure out. “I had so many ideas, and none of them felt like they were the right thing,” she reveals. Once they figured out that Alicent’s final shot would close the season, and once they figured out how to get it filmed, they had just seconds to get the perfect shot.

“Our backs were against a mountain and Alicent wasn’t quite small enough, and also the sun was moving, and you only have one shot. It’s not like you can do multiple takes, and you only have two seconds. So everything had to be lined up and Olivia’s out there. We got it, and everybody was up cheering,” she says.

Visual effects helped complete the last two shots, which Patel hopes evoked emotion in viewers. The shots are up for interpretation. For Patel, they were about Rhaenyra being trapped in this war and Alicent breaking free, but also that they’ll each be defined by this thing that’s much bigger than them. The characters being so small in the shots is meant to be like “David and Goliath,” Patel explains. They “wanted [the shots] to contrast so that you feel the relationship between these two protagonists and these sisters, these lovers in a way.”

Patel says that Rhaenyra and Alicent’s dynamic is “absolutely” the love story at the center of House of the Dragon. “Come with me,” Alicent begged Rhaenyra in their last secret meeting. Rhaenyra admitted she wanted to go, but the call to duty was too great. Another way to interpret their final shots is that Rhaenyra is shrouded in history, almost being crushed beneath the weight of it, and Alicent is left with nothing and without the person she wants with her most.

Alicent’s “David and Goliath moment,” Patel says, shows “all this open space. What are you going to do with it? Are you going to be comfortable? It’s like the girl who has to keep dating people, like can’t be single. Is she going to be able to handle the space? Can you live without Rhaenyra? Can you live without just being in people’s shadows and doing what they say? Can you be alone with your voice?”

D’Arcy and Cooke had a rehearsal for their final scene, but Patel says they didn’t need much directing at all. “I think a good director stays out of their way,” she says. Her job in that rehearsal was to watch what the actors brought out of each other and figure out the framing that would highlight it best.

“The one thing I did focus on as a team is, where’s the turning point? That shift is when Alicent says, ‘I will give you my son.’ For me, it was really important that that was not a light moment. That was not an easy moment for all of us,” Patel explains. “Even if Aegon is doing the worst things possible, Alicent is giving up her son. It’s that simple. It is a huge sacrifice. And so we talked about how that moment needed to be not just earned through all the scenes before it, but in that scene, we needed to feel that.”

“There were a few things I noticed when they rehearsed the scene,” Patel explains, noting that Condal and Hess were there for the rehearsal as well. “We realized that the silence between them, there was a placement of that silence that felt so chilling. And so we decided to keep that silence. When we shot it, there was a moment where there’s an answer that needs to come, and we took our time with it, and it all came from [D’Arcy and Cooke]. They try different things and we see what feels like it’s the most powerful, and then on the day of shooting, it’s really just all them. Catherine Goldschmidt, the cinematographer, and I will move cameras when we think there’s a shift happening that we could underscore. Sometimes we go in close, like when Rhaenyra says, ‘You need to sacrifice something, you need to do something.'”

Patel says that this line calls back to what Condal wrote in the Season 2 premiere. “He wrote that duty is sacrifice. And so here we are at the end of the season, and duty is sacrifice,” the director notes. “We needed to make sure that was ringing. So we went in close for those moments. We stayed there in those moments. The craft is to not step in when you don’t need to step in. Cinematically, I try to just dance with them.”

There was a major shift in tone between Rhaenyra and Alicent’s two scenes together this season. The first, which ended Episode 3, saw Rhaenyra discover Alicent was wrong about Viserys’ last words. This first scene, with its lighting that mimicked the first Rhaenyra and Alicent sept scene from Season 1 Episode 2, was meant to make you think that these two could come back together because of the “deja vu” it invoked. “It’s so beautiful, how could it go wrong?” Patel teases. But of course, it does go very wrong. Alicent digs her heels in further to her plan because correcting her mistake is too daunting of a task. But this comes full circle in the finale, when Alicent changes course and begs Rhaenyra to do what she must to end the war even if that means killing her son.

The one through-line between the secret meetings of Season 2, according to Patel, is how Rhaenyra and Alicent revert to their childlike selves when they’re together. Rhaenyra and Alicent’s love for each other is perhaps deeper and more “primal” than any other bond in their lives."
"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://tvline.com/recaps/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-finale-recap-episode-8-1235311098/,"If you spent House of the Dragon’s Season 2 waiting to see Rhaenyra’s invasion of King’s Landing… you’ve got a bit more waiting ahead of you.

The HBO series’ season-ender, which aired Sunday, puts all of the pieces in place for one of the franchise’s huge battle episodes. Tentative alliances are forged. Dragonriders are armored. Mud wrestling is mud-wrestled. And in the finale’s final moments, everyone and their mom gears up for a massive fight. But those dragon’s aren’t dancing again until Season 3.

Which is not to say that nothing major (like, MAJOR major) takes place. Read on for Episode 8’s highlights, then make sure to check out what director Geeta Vasant Patel had to say about helming the season’s final ep.

EVERYONE LOVES A LANNISTER LOOKING DUMB | Tyland Lannister meets with the Triarchy, as Aemond suggested in a previous episode, but the pirates are not into forging an alliance. “It seems you need us more than we need you,” one says. “Give us the Stepstones,” another suggests, and they’ll set up a little toll, no big deal, easy peasy. “You’ll drive up the price off basic goods,” Lannister shoots back. “It is better than starving, surely,” the pirate replies. And eventually, Lannister begrudgingly agrees: The Triarchy’s armada, under the command of #TeamGreen, will break up the Sea Snake’s blockade. Oh, and the pirates’ commander has to accompany the mission, or the sailors won’t follow orders.

When Tyland meets the commander, Lohar, he refuses to sail with “a man who cannot best me.” At what, you wonder? Mud wrestling, it turns out! Tyland takes a beating but winds up winning the match, which impresses Lohar. That night at dinner, Lohar formally agrees to sail at Lannister’s side. And, as a parting gift, he wants Tyland to impregnate his wives. “How… many wives do you have?” Lannister wonders shakily. (Editor’s note: We’re using male pronouns for Lohar because that’s how the character is referred to in the episode.)

IS AEGON THELMA, OR LOUISE? | Larys shows up in Aegon’s room and asks the invalid king to “steel yourself” because he’s got bad news: Rhaeynra has three new dragonriders, and Aemond’s anger over learning of this development caused him to have Vhagar burn an entire town to the ground. Bottom line: They’ve gotta leave King’s Landing ASAP.

“So what was the f—king point in all this, then?” Aegon wonders wearily. Larys spells it out plainly: “The prince regent is going to kill you. You were in danger before, and now, he is thwarted, and he is angry. There is no telling what he will do.”

Aegon sees it differently: He’ll return to the Iron Throne and have Aemond taken prisoner when he comes back. Cool idea, bro, Larys says, but what happens when Rhaenyra arrives with her seven dragons? The Master of Whispers draws closer to the king’s bed as he says that he’s been squirreling away Harrenhal’s gold in the Iron Bank in Braavos: “We can live, well, and remain until what is coming has passed.” Larys paints a picture of a future in which Rhaenyra and Aemond destroy each other, paving the way for Aegon to make a triumphant return, beloved by the people. All Aegon can focus on, though, is his bodily ruin… until Larys hits the royal’s sweet spot by musing about the honorifics that the smallfolk may use when he comes home. Pretty soon, Aegon is dreaming along with him. “Aegon the Realm’s Delight,” the injured king says, awed.

Elsewhere in the Red Keep, Alicent raises an idea to Helaena in a quiet moment: “What would you think about leaving this place?” All the queen can say is “Where would I go?” before Aemond strides into the room and commands that his sister ride Dreamfyre into battle. She doesn’t want to. He doesn’t care. He tries to yank her out the door and to what he perceives as her duty, but Alicent intervenes. They argue, and it ends with him asking whether she truly wants their side to prevail. “Not like this,” she says. Then she beats a path to Grand Maester Orwyle, whom she asks for passage and discretion.

DAEMON STARTS TO SING THE SONG OF ICE AND FIRE | Ser Alfred Broome arrives at Harrenhal as an emissary from Rhaenyra, but he’s also there to hint to Daemon that he should be the one going for the Iron Throne. “Rhaenyra’s intentions are good, but what we need in this moment is a king,” Broome weasels. Daemon chuckles, but says nothing more. Hmm…

That night, Daemon wakes to find Alys sitting on the edge of his bed. “Do you never sleep, witch?” he wonders. “I’m going to the godswood,” she replies. He follows her out, and they talk about how he’s much more open to the world of omens and such than he was when he first arrived at Harrenhal. “Do you wish, then, to learn what is given to you?” she says, suddenly very serious. “All your life, you’ve sought to command your own fate. But today you are ready.” She has him put his hand on the face in the weirwood tree, where blood (or the tree’s red sap) flows over his arm. Instantly, he has a vision that moves through several images familiar to Game of Thrones viewers: the three-eyed crow, the Night King, Daenerys’ dragon eggs, and Daenerys herself, nude and flanked by baby dragons in the aftermath of Khal Drogo’s funeral pyre. (Because the shot is from behind Dany, we don’t see her face.)

After Daemon sees Rhaenyra wearing her crown while sitting the Iron Throne, everything goes black except for Helaena, who suddenly appears behind him. “It’s all a story, and you are but one part in it,” she says. “You know your part. You know what you must do.”

YASS, QUEEN | Then, suddenly, the action shifts to King’s Landing. It appears that Helaena was an active participant in the vision we just witnessed; when we see her on a balcony at the Red Keep, she’s clearly just said her piece to Daemon.

Aemond advances, ready to use the soft sell this time. He says Alicent doesn’t understand their “truer call” as dragonriders and tells her to join him at Harrenhal, where “we will lay waste to Daemon and his army.” She looks at him like he’s a caterpillar she can’t quite classify. “And if I refuse, will you burn me as you did Ageon?” she asks. He’s very agitated, saying that her lies are treason, but she doesn’t budge. “Aegon will be king again,” she says, clearly and calmly. “He’s yet to see victory. He sits on a wooden throne. And you? You’ll be dead. You are swallowed up in a god’s eye, and you are never seen again.” When he threatens to have her killed, her demeanor stays the same. “It wouldn’t change anything,” she says, matter-of-fact, and walks away.

DRAGON FAMILY DINNER | At Dragonstone, Ulf runs afoul of Jace by a) putting his feet up on the painted table, b) ruffling the prince’s hair, c) acting like there’s no difference between them. Hugh intervenes, making apologies for his fellow dragonseed, but Jace still threatens to have the barfly hanged if his “sloth” gets in the way of #TeamBlack’s victory.

Balea finds Jace pouting and lovingly tells him to stop sulking. “Do you believe you are the first noble heir who was not sired by his noble father?” she wonders. “Such is the way of the world.” Claim your greatness, dude, she advises.

At dinner, Rhaenyra salutes Hugh, Addam and Ulf and makes it clear that what they’re doing is a big deal — and comes with a certain level of fealty and responsibility. “Serve me well, and I will make you knights of the realm,” she promises. Ulf, of course, acts a fool. But the queen ignores it in order to make clear that they’re all flying out in two days’ time to “subdue” Oldtown and Lannisport in order to force Aemond to surrender.

“You wish for us to kill innocents?” Baela asks, scandalized, and Hugh looks like he’s right there with her. Jace says it can’t be helped. “We must break the will of our enemy,” Rhaenyra adds. Soon after, Rhaenyra gets word that Ser Simon Strong is letting her know that Daemon’s raised his army, but treachery may be afoot. “I will not allow it,” she says.

COLE KEEPS IT REAL | Let’s take a little break from silver-haired drama… for some brunette drama. Somewhere on the road to probable death — aka on the march to fight — Gwayne finds out about Alicent and Ser Criston and holds a sword to his head. All Criston can do is confess that the former queen has been his “beacon” for a large part of his life and lament that “desire for women has brought me grief after grief.” See, he’s feeling some kind of way after witnessing mythical beasts lay waste to the world. “Dragons dance, and men are like dust under their feet,” he says, despondent. “We march now toward our annihilation. To die will be a kind of relief, don ‘t you think?” Quite the rallying speech, no?

DRAGON MOM AND DRAGON DAD REUNITE | OK, back to Rhaenyra and Daemon. She flies Syrax to Harrenhal, where Ser Simon is very concerned that treachery is afoot. They enter the great hall, where a huge number of men are gathered; all of them eye her, then look up at Syrax, perched on the open ruins of the ceiling. Daemon’s entry, however, causes a different reaction. The men fall in line as he passes, immediately standing at attention. He winds up standing directly in front of his wife. (Slash niece. #NeverForget)

They make small talk, and he preens that the men are “sworn to me, and not a moment too soon.” She steps back a bit and raises her voice: “And to whom are you sworn?” The rubber has hit the road, Daemon, my friend! He switches to High Valyrian as he whispers to her about what his vision showed him. “The war is just the beginning. Winter is coming, with darkness and doom,” he says. The realm’s only hope is a leader to unite it… “and my brother chose you,” he says in English, kneeling before her and bowing his head.

As she looks kinda shocked, he goes on. “You are the true queen, Rhaenyra, first of her name, protector of the realm. I am meant to serve you, and all of these with me, until death or the end of our story.” Well, that is NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. The queen’s face says something similar, only in a more dignified, royal, high cheekboned way. Anyway, all of the men, including the treasonous Ser Alfred, kneel behind Daemon. Rhaenyra grabs his hand and, in High Valyrian, says, “Leave me again at your peril.” It’s not said jokingly. “I could not. I have tried,” he replies in High Valyrian. Then, in English, he adds, “my queen.”

Then he addresses the men, getting them all riled up. “We fight for our queen!” Daemon shouts, and there’s a lot of testosteroney yelling from the crow. Rhaenyra’s face, as she watches it all, is hard to read.

‘I WILL CONTINUE AS I BEGAN: ALONE’ | Alyn answers Corlys’ summons in the shipyard for what turns into the world’s worst father-son convo. Papa Velaryon gives the younger man some advice about how to be a better first mate, but it lands badly. “You want to help me? Is this the help you offer after all these years? A reminder to be grateful?” Alyn wonders. Corlys tries to end the conversation there, but the band-aid has been ripped asunder, buddy boy, and Alyn says his pops is going to LISTEN. “Do you know what it was like for us, to grow up fatherless?” he asks. “Do you know what hunger does to a boy? What grief does, or shame?” He’s angry that Corlys ignored him for as long as his heirs lived, and is only paying attention to his other two sons now because everyone else is gone. “I am an honorable man, and I will serve you because I must. But if it is all the same, I will decline any offers of help,” Alyn spits. “If I survive this war, I will continue as I began: alone.” Ouch. And, deserved.

QUEEN CHAT, TAKE TWO | That night, there’s a knock at the doors to Rhaenyra’s bedroom. She’s led to her outer chambers, where she’s shocked to see Alicent standing there. “I had to see you,” Alicent says, quickly adding that only the guard who accompanied her knows she is there. Rhaenyra dismisses her guards but is wary as her former best friend starts talking about how she’s resented Rhaenyra for knowing what she wanted from a young age, while Alicent “didn’t know what I wanted, only what was expected of me.” As she monologues, she mentions having a lover — causing Rhaenyra to scoff about how the high and mighty have fallen — and Alicent quickly reminds her that she’s had lovers, too. “Yes, but you alone make virtue your banner,” the black queen responds.

Moving on! Alicent’s time in the woods has given her clarity, she continues, and now she knows what she wants: To live, not to rule, and “to be free of all of this endless plotting and striving.” Specifically, she wants to take Helaena and little Jaehaera and live the rest of their lives, incognito and in peace. Rhaenyra laughs, because NOW Alicent wants to get out of the game that she basically set in motion? “I did only what I thought your father wanted,” Alicent says, but Rhaenyra’s not inclined for softness or forgiveness: “Did you come here thinking you’d be absolved?” she asks incredulously.

There’s more talk about how Viserys never stopped loving Aemma, but then they get down to the details of Alicent’s plan. When Aemond flies to meet Cole in the Riverlands, she says, Helaena will be the ruling authority in King’s Landing. Alicent will have her have the guards put down their weapons and open the gates. “We will shed no blood,” she says. “You will enter as a conqueror” and then end the fighting. But she’s barely finished when Rhaenyra laughs even harder… but do I detect a little bit of consideration under her mocking tone?

“What of Aegon?” Rhaenrya asks, growing incensed as Alicent explains that, given his maiming, she thinks she can get him to bend the knee. This is a bridge too far, and Rhaenyra is tearful but resolute as she points out that this is a fantasy scenario: “If I am to take the throne, I must put an end to the opposition. I must take Aegon’s head, and I must do it for all to see. You know this. However you may try to evade it, you know this.” Eventually, it comes down to Rhaeynra demanding to know whether Alicent is willing to send Aegon to his death in order to end the war. “Will you shrink from what you set out to do, or will you see it through and make your sacrifice? A son for a son,” Rhaenyra says. Alicent thinks deeply, cries, and then gives a tiny nod: She’s in.

The plan: Rhaenyra lets Alicent go, to set things in motion, then Rhaenyra will fly to the Red Keep in three days’ time. “History will paint you a villain,” Rhaenyra warns her. “Let them think what they must,” Alicent replies. She waxes a bit about living and dying free, then throws up a hail mary: Will Rhaenyra come with her? The black queen says her path was “decided for me long ago,” so that’s a no. Then Rhaenyra bids her go, and Alicent does.

JACKPOT! | Remember how Rhaena is on her own little dragon walkabout? Well, she’s not doing well, roaming the moors and nearly dying of hunger and thirst. But then she sees what she’s been seeking: a dragon circling in the distance. And eventually, she comes face to face with it. It screams at her.

READY FOR BATTLE | And then all that’s left is to watch everyone get ready for even more war. Hugh, Ulf and Addam don their dragonriding leathers and prepare to fly. Corlys and Alyn ride in a boat. Daemon surveys his troops. Alicent walks. Rhaenyra mulls. Otto — oh hey, Otto! — appears for the first time since he left King’s Landing, and he appears to be a prisoner held in some kind of cell or cage. Finally, Larys and Aegon ride in the back of a poultry cart, making their clandestine escape from the capital.

"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://ca.news.yahoo.com/house-dragon-end-season-4-190116358.html,"HBO’s “House of the Dragon” will end after four seasons, showrunner and co-creator Ryan Condal revealed in a Monday press conference.

The third season of the “Game of Thrones” prequel series is currently being written, Condal told press. The Season 2 finale just aired (and streamed on Max!) on Sunday night. Condal expects to begin production on Season 3 sometime in “early-ish” 2025.

More from IndieWire

While it was suspected that “House of the Dragon” might only last four or five seasons, this is the first time Condal has confirmed a definitive end. George R. R. Martin, who is a co-creator on “House of the Dragon,” wrote in a 2022 blog post that he expected the series would need roughly four seasons of 10 episodes each in order to fully tell the story of “Dance of the Dragons” from his book “Fire & Blood.” HBO’s drama chief Francesca Orsi also previously said she expected “House of the Dragon” would run for a minimum of four seasons. She recently (officially, it was never in doubt) picked up a third season.

At the presser, Condal was also asked what we might expect, episode-count-wise, from these subsequent seasons. All he said was to not expect too many changes to the formula.

“Without saying anything, because I haven’t had discussions with HBO about it, I would just anticipate the cadence of the show, from a dramatic storytelling perspective, will continue to be the same from Season 2 on,” Condal said.

Season 1 was 10 episodes; Season 2 had eight.

Condal did tease a bit of what he’s excited about working on for Season 3. The war is coming to a head at this very moment in the story; Condal said this just-wrapped season was “largely a metaphor for a nuclear conflict.” The best stuff is still to come, he promised.

“If Season 2 was the the arming of the sides and the Cold War, with moments of actual conflict and explosion, I think Season 3, really, you do start to see things boil over from here to the end of the war,” he said. “So as always with this show, there’s going to be giant moments of spectacle, but also real moments of surprise and character nuance that we’re very much looking forward to. And I think really, some of my favorite moments in the book are, just as a reader, that I’m excited to adapt as a dramatist are yet to come in the story.”

Condal previously said he felt Season 3 would be the biggest challenge in finding fresh storylines.

“There’s a rhythm to all this, these kinds of stories as you tell them,” Condal said. “And we’re trying to find satisfying arcs within the season structure. So, hopefully you start with a bang, and then you build to another bang through the series, but you’re really trying to arc out the characters, so that each season is a different experience for all of them. And then you leave them off all in a place where you can pick up with them next year, and then take them in a new direction, because you don’t want to end up in that place where you’re doing the same thing again and again.”

“House of the Dragon” has continued to be a major hit for HBO, with the premiere providing the biggest premiere in Max history, but only because when the first season premiered even bigger, the service was still called HBO Max.

"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/house-dragon-creator-says-show-182441326.html,"The House of the Dragon co-creator and showrunner took some questions from the press on Monday following a second season finale that had some fans feeling short-changed.

In a virtual press conference moderated by journalist Joanna Robinson, showrunner Ryan Condal was asked about the eight-episode second season ending right before a highly anticipated battle sequence, the decision to include a surprise Daenerys Targaryen (played by Emilia Clarke in Game of Thrones) cameo, and more.

More from The Hollywood Reporter

In one bit of news, Condal confirmed that the series will very likely conclude with season four (“No, I think it’s four,” he said when asked if the fantasy drama will run five seasons). And he noted the rest of the story’s plan was mapped out after the first season. He also said season three will go into production early next year. In addition, the next season will likely also consist of eight episodes.

About the finale and the decision to push the The Battle of the Gullet to season three, Condal gave a lengthy reply, but it seemed to come down to resource management.

“One of the challenges of making television at any scale [is] nobody has infinite time and resources,” he said. “When you’re as a showrunner, you’re always in the position of having to balance storytelling and the resources that you have available to tell that story. One of the things that came into play in season two is: What is the final destination of the series and where are we going? It was a combination of factors that led us to rebalance the season knowing now where we’re going. We wanted to rebalance the story in such a way that we had three great seasons of television [after season one] to round out and tell this story. When you’re trying to mount the show, which requires a tremendous amount of resources, construction, armor, costumes, visual effects … we are trying to give The Gullet — which is arguably the second most anticipated action event of Fire & Blood — trying to give it the time and the space that it deserves.”

He continued, “We are building to that event that will happen very shortly in terms of the storytelling, and it should be the biggest thing to date that we’ve we’ve pulled off. We just wanted to have the time and the space to do that at a level that is going to excite and satisfy the fans in the way it’s deserved. We also wanted to build some anticipation toward it. So I apologize for the wait, but … with the team that we have together, we’re going to pull off a hell of a win with The Battle of the Gullet.”

Another question was about the decision to have Daemon Targaryen (Matt Smith) see a vision of Daenerys Targaryen in the finale and why not, say, Jon Snow (played by Kit Harington in GoT)? Does this confirm Daenerys was the fabled “Prince That Was Promised”? And, why are there so many nods to Game of Thrones?

“House of the Dragon is a prequel to a famous story, one of the biggest, if not the biggest, television story of all time,” he said. “There needs to be some interconnectivity. And because so many years have passed, there are really no characters that would be alive from from our time period that exists in the the subsequent series. So we were always looking for this interconnectivity between the two. And the story of the Targaryen dynasty … which is the height of Targaryen power, in terms of this Shakespearean tragedy we’re experiencing in the Dance of the Dragons, the dying of the dragons, we don’t know how exactly the events will play out in this history. But we do know at the end it, there are no dragons left in the world until they’re reborn to Daenerys … The thing we are very interested in as storytellers is the idea of how prophecy and these messianic ideals that we always see in stories like this — in Harry Potter, in Star Wars — [there is a] ‘Chosen One’ who is going to save us from everything. The Light Bringer, the Prince Who Was Promise, how those ideas are interpreted in George’s world — which we all know from his storytelling that he has taken us through to date — that these things are very rarely black and white, and one thing or the other, and often can be cautionary tales for how ideas like this are interpreted by people in power.”

He continued, “Remember that Game of Thrones, A Song of Ice and Fire, House of the Dragon in many ways, are warnings about the perils of power and people in power and absolute power … [and the reason there was no Jon Snow was] the connectivity for us is specifically in and around the dragons … The connectedness between this family and the family to come … We know who Daenerys is watching that image, but Daemon has no idea — that could be his future daughter with Rhaenyra … So for that reason, I think it was important that it was Daenerys the image. We are not trying to make any kind of specific interpretation of a prophecy that has yet to be revealed by its author. That is George’s space to tell that story.”

For the book readers, Condal was asked whether Rhaena (Phoebe Campbell) has assumed the character of Nettles’ storyline from George R.R. Martin’s Fire & Blood book.

“I think that’s a ‘please stay tuned and keep watching the story,'” he said. “I will say we love Rhaena as a character and we’ve we’ve really done a lot of legwork to set her up from the beginning as somebody in this Targaryen household who does not have a dragon and we see how powerful an idea it is … we’ve seen how with Aemond’s character, somebody that grows up in a family, even at the time of peace, when you don’t have a dragon, how it changes how you’re identified even within the family and how how desperate Rhaena is for that sort of self identification as a dragon rider and is willing to go to fairly dangerous lengths to try to see that realized … We’re providing the television version of one objective truth of this history and anybody who reads the book is free to interpret it however they want to, but there is a there are a lot of paths to interpretation through this and I think the the Rhaena story, as we’re seeing it unfold, is potentially one of those interesting interpretations that we have to offer and I would just say that we don’t do any of this stuff lightly.”

"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://www.avclub.com/house-of-the-dragon-to-end-season-4,"House Of The Dragon to actually end when it runs out of book House Of The Dragon will begin production on the third season in 2025

House Of The Dragon will officially end in its fourth season, showrunner Ryan Condal confirmed at a press conference on Monday. This news won’t come as much of a surprise to those in the know; author and executive producer George R.R. Martin wrote in 2022 that “It is going to take four full seasons of 10 episodes each to do justice to the Dance of the Dragons, from start to finish.” The second season concluded on Sunday with eight episodes, so HBO is cutting it a little close on Martin’s timeline, but it sounds like the production is going into the back half with a clear vision for how to execute the story outlined in Martin’s book Fire & Blood.

Per Deadline, the third season is set to begin production in 2025. Condal said he hadn’t had discussions about the episode order with HBO, but “would just anticipate the cadence of the show, from a dramatic storytelling perspective, will continue to be the same from season two on.” Though some fans felt the finale was anticlimactic (In her recap for The A.V. Club, Kayleigh Dray called it “the televisual equivalent of cooking an epic 12-course banquet and then only letting people look at the showstopper dessert”), Condal stressed that the season was building up to major events like the highly anticipated Battle of the Gullet. That battle in particular would be “the biggest thing to date we have pulled off,” and the team wanted “to have the time and space to do that at a level that will excite the fans,” he explained.

“There are so many great events that we are already writing in season 3 as it is,” Condal said (via Deadline). “This war really comes to a big head at this point in the storytelling. I mean, if you look at season two, it’s largely a metaphor for a nuclear conflict … There’s gonna be giant moments of spectacle but real moments of surprise and character nuance that we’re very much looking forward to. Some of my favorite moments [in] the book, as a reader, I’m excited to adapt as a dramatist.”

House Of The Dragon is still doing well for itself, with the finale “The Queen That Never Was” racking in a season-high audience of 8.9 million viewers across HBO and Max, per The Wrap. That’s up 14% from the second season premiere, but down a bit from the first season finale, which netted 9.3 million viewers. Overall, the second season reportedly averaged 25 million cross-platform viewers.

The drop off may be down to the fact that it’s a long time to wait in between seasons—as is the wont of late-stage Peak TV. Four may not be very many seasons in total, but at the rate that these episodes are written and produced, House Of The Dragon won’t conclude until at least 2028. “I know everybody wants this to come out every summer,” Condal acknowledged at the press conference (per Variety). “It’s just that the show is so complex that we’re really making multiple feature films every season. So I apologize for the wait, but I will just say if Rook’s Rest and the Red Sowing are any indication, we’re gonna pull off a hell of a win with the Battle the Gullet in the future.”"
"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://www.thewrap.com/house-of-the-dragon-how-many-seasons/,"On the heels of its Season 2 finale, “House of the Dragon” fans can expect another two seasons from the “Game of Thrones” spin-off series.

While the “GoT” prequel series has only been renewed for a third installment thus far, showrunner Ryan Condal noted in a Monday press conference that the team is aiming for four seasons total for “House of the Dragon.”

Writing is already underway on Season 3, according to Condal, and is slated to begin production in early 2025 after prep starts this fall. Though Condal said he hasn’t had discussions with HBO about the episode count for Season 3, he said he would “anticipate the cadence of the show, from a dramatic storytelling perspective, will continue to be the same from Season 2 on.”

After the Season 2 finale left off with Team Black and Team Green’s newly built up armies preparing for battle — namely, the Battle of the Gullet, which Condal said the team delayed until the next installment to give the moment its time in the sun — Condal confirmed the war will come to a “big head” in Season 3.

“If Season 2 was the arming of the sides and the Cold War with moments of actual conflict and explosion, I think [in] Season 3, you do start to see things boil over from here to the kind of the end of the war,” Condal said.

He also teased that Season 3 will include both “giant moments of spectacle” as well as “real moments of surprise and and character nuance,” which will come in “equal measure.”

“If it’s all just dragons fighting dragons, we would get bored and bankrupt very quickly,” Condal said. “You have to have both in equal measure and make the character moments count, so that [when the] dragons do fight — and they will fight again — you care about the dragons and the people riding them.”

With several new dragons introduced in Season 2 — including a sneak peek of Prince Daeron Targaryen’s dragon, Tessarion, in the finale — the showrunner teased that “there are more dragons that exist in this world that we have maybe mentioned, but haven’t necessarily seen.”

The Season 2 finale also left off on a cliffhanger with Rhaenyra (Emma D’Arcy) considering an offer from Alicent (Olivia Cooke) to take the Iron Throne peacefully while Aemond (Ewan Mitchell) is away. Looking to Season 3, Rhaenyra must decide whether to trust Alicent, while Alicent is confronted with immediate guilt for consenting to Aegon’s death, should Rhaenyra take up the offer.

“We’re leaving the season with these two women who … went into that scene with one interpretation of things have come out with a radically different interpretation,” Condal said. “We wanted to end with the thought of, ‘What are they going to do next?’ ‘Where has the world left them?’”

"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-finale-recap-1235965882/,"[This story contains major spoilers from the House of the Dragon season two finale.]

House of the Dragon ended its second season much like the beasts at the heart of the tale: up in the air.

In its finale, the HBO drama based on George R.R. Martin‘s Fire & Blood closed out on an ambiguous note, with strengthened and strained alliances alike, not to mention brutal betrayals. Those anticipating a climactic battle between the Blacks and the Greens were likely disappointed to see the swords and dragons largely sheathed and grounded, even as the closing moments promised plenty of violence in the third season still to come. (See what creator Ryan Condal had to say about the finale.)

Written and directed by series veterans Sara Hess and Geeta Vasant Patel, respectively, House of the Dragon finished up season two in a less outwardly violent but still brutal mirroring of its premiere. Where Queen Helaena (Phia Saban) was forced to choose which of her two children should lose their life in the season opener, it’s now Queen Regent Alicent (Olivia Cooke) who must make a similar decision. Before, it was Daemon Targaryen (Matt Smith) who set the death of Helaena’s young son into motion. Now, it’s Rhaenyra (Emma D’Arcy) herself, who previously condemned her husband’s actions, that knows such actions are required for her to win the throne and restore some measure of peace to the realm.

The final moments of the season boil down to a tense standoff between Rhaenyra and Alicent, echoing their earlier meeting in King’s Landing. For the finale, it’s Alicent who comes to Rhaenyra, visiting her childhood friend-turned-adult enemy at Dragonstone. Tired of her son Aemond’s (Ewan Mitchell) violent tendencies and convinced of Rhaenyra’s worthiness, Alicent offers a deal: come to King’s Landing in three days while Aemond is away at war, and the city will promptly bend the knee. All Alicent wants in exchange is safety for herself, Helaena and her grandchild — and safety for her son, the horribly scarred King Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney).

That last request causes Rhaenyra to balk at the pitch. She says there’s no way she can secure King’s Landing and restore order to the Seven Kingdoms without claiming Aegon’s head, putting an end once and for all to the false king. So Rhaenyra becomes the one making the offer: Alicent can get everything she wants from her initial deal, but must sacrifice Aegon. Grief-stricken but certain in her course, Alicent agrees. It’s a far cry from the outwardly gruesome “Blood and Cheese” event, but Rhaenyra and Alicent’s deal nonetheless calls back to that terrible choice, a rubicon of sorts. Now, the rival Targaryen forces once again march toward one another, their conflict fully unresolved heading out of season two.

As for where things stand, the finale ends with a montage showcasing a variety of different factions. For Team Green, Aemond’s forces are on the move in a variety of fashions, including Jason Lannister (Jefferson Hall) and his bannermen marching through the Riverlands, while Jason’s twin brother Tyland (also portrayed by Hall) sails home from Essos with the pirate Sharako Lohar (Abigail Thorn) as an ally. Team Black has their own forces in both regions. Whether it’s the bannermen of House Tully, the Starks and their northmen marching down through the Twins, or Corlys Velaryon (Steve Toussaint) and his bastard son Alyn (Abubakar Salim) leading their fleet out to sea. In terms of dragons, the sides are not quite evenly matched, as Rhaenyra’s dragonseeds have taken root with three new dragons of their own, up against Prince Regent Aemond’s formidable but lonely mount Vhagar. Even in the Eyrie, there’s Rhaena Velaryon (Phoebe Campbell), dragonless for all her life, though now confronting the possibility of claiming one in the countryside.

The two armies are fairly well-matched. But there’s a significant difference on the leadership level, heavily favoring Rhaenyra. Not only has she won Alicent over to her side, and not only is King Aegon unseated (and last seen fleeing King’s Landing in secret), Rhaenyra has also conquered her deadliest rival of all: Daemon. The prince spent almost all of season two in Harrenhal, experiencing psychedelic visions pointing toward his greater role in the prophetic A Song of Ice and Fire. In the finale, Daemon sees visions of the White Walker threat, and even sees a brief glimpse of Daenerys Targaryen (played by Emilia Clarke in Game of Thrones) and the birth of her three dragons. On the other side of these visions, Daemon no longer covets the throne for himself, swearing his full support for Rhaenyra’s bid.

With new dragons and new loyalties under her belt, Queen Rhaenyra’s victorious return to King’s Landing feels all-but certain when season three returns, however many moons from now. But this is the Game of Thrones franchise we’re talking about here and, as a certain bastard once said, “If you think this story has a happy ending, you haven’t been paying attention.”

Condal says the forthcoming third season is being written, with a debut expected in “earlyish 2025.”

The show was renewed for season 3 in June, ahead of the debut of its sophomore frame.

Based on author George R.R. Martin‘s Fire & Blood, the series is set 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones and centers on House Targaryen. The HBO Original drama series includes Matt Smith, Olivia Cooke, Rhys Ifans, Emma D’Arcy, Steve Toussaint and Eve Best.

Spoilers below.

Game of Thrones might have run for eight seasons, but House of the Dragon will end at four.

Showrunner Ryan Condal announced the news to reporters today, following the HotD season 2 finale. Per The Hollywood Reporter, when asked whether the prequel would continue for five seasons, Condal clarified, “No, I think it’s four.” (However, HBO has not officially announced a season 4 renewal yet.)

This aligns with what George R. R. Martin predicted, Variety points out. Back in 2022, the author, whose book Fire & Blood is the source material for this show, wrote on his blog that it would take “four full seasons of 10 episodes each to do justice to the Dance of the Dragons [the Targaryen civil war], from start to finish.” Season 2, however, comprised of eight episodes. Condal anticipates that “the cadence of the show, from a dramatic storytelling perspective, will continue to be the same from season 2 on.”

Deadline previously reported in 2023 that the creative team saw the show running for three or four seasons. At the time, Condal and Martin, who is also an executive producer, had to “take a big-picture view of the series, which follows Martin’s Fire & Blood, and figure out the overall narrative flow, including how to break up the stories season-to-season and what battles to include and when,” co-editor-in-chief Nellie Andreeva wrote at the time.

“With a portion of the plot originally intended for season 2, including a major battle, moving to season 3, I hear it is now more likely that the series would run for four seasons,” she added. This is likely referring to the Battle of the Gullet, a major battle set up in season season 2 which doesn’t end up happening in the finale. Instead, it’s been pushed off to next season, to many fans’ frustrations.

Prep for season 3 is set to begin this fall and then production is slated for “earlyish 2025,” Condal says, per Variety. With the second season ending on a bit of a lull, there will be plenty of action to beef up the series’ next two installments. Watch this space for updates.

While some viewers were expecting it to be an epic battle, instead we got an episode full of scheming, plotting, and shocking reveals to tee up Season 3.

House of the Dragon Season 2 Ending Explained

From the very first episode of House of the Dragon the series has centered on Alicent (Olivia Cooke) and Rhaenyra (Emma D'arcy), the two young women whose fates have been entangled with the throne since their girlhood. So, it makes sense that as Season 2 comes to an end we once again see them reunite as Alicent comes to Rhaenyra with an offer: Let her, Helaena (Phia Saban), and Jaehaera (Lulu Barker) leave the kingdom after they hand over the Red Keep to Rhaenyra. This is one of the most emotionally charged moments of the series and once again shifts what we know of Alicent and Rhaenyra.

As Alicent walks through Dragonstone, now a free woman, the Dragon Seeds prepare for war, fitted with their new armor and ready to step onto their dragons. We see the Green army moving into the Riverlands, with Cole (Fabien Frankel) and Aemond (Ewan Mitchell) ready to meet them. The Northmen finally reach the Twins, heading to support Rhaenyra's claim as Daemon (Matt Smith) readies his army to do the same, then there's the Triarchy ships headed towards Corlys and his men, including his son Alyn (Abubakar Salim), ready to battle. Rhaena finally catches up with the wild dragon she's been hunting near the Eyrie and Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans) wakes in a prison cell. Then it's revealed that Larys did convince Aegon to leave, meaning he will survive the apparent taking of King's Landing. All of that means one thing: War is coming to House of the Dragon Season 3 and it's going to be a brutal and bloody battle no matter what deal Alicent and Rhaenyra may have made to close out Season 2.

What Does That Daenerys Flash Forward Mean for House of the Dragon?

In a really surprising moment, Alys Rivers (Gayle Rankin) shows Daemon the future, including a ton of clips from Game of Thrones. In a glimpse of Daenerys Targaryen (Emila Clarke) and her three dragon eggs, she also shows him the war to come against the White Walkers, and the truth of their battle: that the most important thing is that they fight together now and hope that their kin can help save Westeros in the future. It's this vision that cements his loyalty to his wife / niece Rhaenyra, as he realizes that she is the rightful heir, and he doesn't really want any of that Song of Ice and Fire smoke. It's really interesting to see Daemon finally believe the prophecy, as when Rhaenyra referenced it last season he choked her and denied that dreams or prophecies are real. Now that he's lived through the magical nightmare of Haranhall and has connected with Alys, it's clear he understands and believes in the prophecy.

How Much Did the House of the Dragon Season 2 Change the Book?

Throughout the season we've seen the creative team take some really big swings that have added extra context to the fictional history the show is based on, Fire & Blood. The finale continues that trend with the reveal that Alicent went to Rhaenyra and pleaded for her life, agreeing to help the Black faction take King's Landing because she's finally realized that she made a mistake in putting her son Aegon on the throne. It's a massive moment and the show knows it as Rhaenyra comments on the fact Alicent will be remembered as a cold queen, hungry for power, which is exactly how she's portrayed in Fire & Blood.

We also get confirmation that Rhaena has hunted down the wild dragon known as Sheepstealer, taking on at least part of the story of fan fave character Nettles . Some other changes in the finale include Tyland Lannister getting the Triarchy on board rather than Otto Hightower, and the reveal that the leader of the Triarchy is a woman rather than a man. All of these changes make sense in the context of the book, as the entire idea is that you're hearing from multiple unreliable narrators whose own personal leanings impact the version of history that they tell. So here we're getting another version of that history, by seeing what actually happened in the time the book is set.

How the House of the Dragon Season 2 Finale Sets Up Season 3

If we're honest, it's basically all-set up. That's not to say the episode doesn't deliver, as it's another fantastic character-forward entry into the series that tells us a lot about each of the major players going into the war ahead. But with that said, the episode also leads almost directly into the battle to come but stops just before any of that action begins. We see each side preparing for war, as mentioned above we get that huge Alicent reveal, we see that Larys and Aegon did make it out of the Red Keep, and we see Aemond preparing for war. There's also the small matter of Daemon (Matt Smith) finally pledging his allegiance and armies to Rhaenyra, setting up the epic battle to come. It'll likely be a huge surprise to both book readers and TV viewers that the show takes us right up to the edge rather than showing us any of the action.

Warning! From here on out we're getting deep into book spoilers for things that haven't happened in the series yet, so if you don't want to know what happens next turn away now!

What Can We Expect From House of the Dragon Season 3?

The simple answer here is action! If you were frustrated by the shockingly action-free finale, then you'll be satisfied to know that next season is going to be nothing but battles, death, violence, betrayal, and war as the Dance of the Dragons truly begins. There are two things that we'll be seeing once the show returns with the most obvious one being Rhaenyra and Daemon riding their dragons to take King’s Landing. It'll likely be a quick but brutal takeover, especially now that we know that Alicent made a deal to save her own life along with her daughter Helaena and granddaughter Jaehaera in exchange for making sure King's Landing is ready for the taking.

The other big moment that book readers were expecting to see before the season ended was the Battle of the Gullet, so you can expect that to play a large part in the early episodes of Season 3. The epic battle features those newly helmed dragon seeds who come to the aid of Jace as he faces down the Triarchy ships that Tyland Lanister managed to secure for the Green faction. You'll be seeing some seriously tragic losses during that battle if it sticks to the books.

We can also expect the arrival of a couple of major new players in Alicent's son Daeron and his dragon Tessarion. From what we saw of Otto's fate it's unlikely that he made it to Oldtown where Daeron was being raised, and even if he did he's clearly no longer there. Perhaps we could see the new Targaryen arrive looking for his father figure or to help try to defend his brother's claim to the Throne in the face of Rhaenyra's inevitable attack.

Of course we know the series hasn't been afraid to chop and change what we know from the books so we'll have to wait and see just what the third season has to offer and how it chooses to adapt these epic moments in Game of Thrones history.

"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://sg.news.yahoo.com/house-dragon-s2-ending-explained-202500003.html,"The House of the Dragon season 2 finale may not have ended on a major death or battle, but the characters are scattered all over Westeros in a way that they haven't really been before on the Game of Thrones spin-off. It kind of feels like HotD season 3 is going to be more like old-school Thrones, with battles and side quests and tons of locations?. To help you prepare and get your bearings, let's explain everything that happened in the Season 2 finale of House of the Dragon and what it means.

Ultimately the episode was a lot of build-up for the next season. But that's actually not uncommon for Game of Thrones fans. Back in the day, as I'm sure you recall, the major events would happen in the penultimate episode (Ned Stark's death, the Red Wedding, and the Battle of the Bastards for example), and then the season's final episode would start setting the stage for what's to come. The problem with House of the Dragon, if you see it as a problem, is that nothing really happened in the penultimate episode of season 2 either. The most important thing about episode 7 was that two Targaryen bastards became dragon riders—and since they were the only two Targaryen bastards we knew anything about, it was pretty easy to figure out that they would be successful. Where's the suspense?

What exactly did they build up, and why? Let's get into it.

What was Tyland Lannister doing in Essos?

Courtesy of HBO

Team Green's ambassador was on a mission to end a trade blockade. He accomplished that by winning a mud wrestling match against a new character named Admiral Sharako Lohar. Sure! Tyland may or may not have developed a crush on Lohar in the process. Abigail Thorn, the actress who plays Lohar, is a trans woman but the character appears to use he/him pronouns. I'm curious to see how this relationship progresses. Beautiful people who could step on you? That's catnip for those Lannister lions. We all remember Jaime and Brienne, as well as Tyrion and Shae.

What's with *that* Daemon vision?

Courtesy of HBO

Before leaving Harrenhal for good, Daemon had one last witch-assisted magical vision. And... Daenerys Targaryen was there???? The Night King too???? THE HECK???? Alys Rivers showed Daemon the future, which included brief glimpses of those two characters as well as a three-eyed raven and a dead dragon. What it means, especially the raven and the dragon, are up to fan interpretation. The important thing, I think, is that Daemon now believes in Aegon the Conquerer's dream and the prophecy. These future events he saw were foretold, and are the reason that House Targaryen claims divine sovereignty in Westeros.

There was also, before the vision fully started, what appeared to be a green man with antlers running behind the weirwood tree. Those magical folk never appeared on Thrones. So, I'm not sure where the show is going with that. We'll have to wait and see.

Ultimately, this vision led to him bending the knee to his wife in front of all the sexist lords who wanted him to show her who's boss. It made him a feminist and a romantic. He's all in on fighting for Rhaenyra's side instead of trying to undermine her and possibly usurp her. Everybody say thank you, creepy vision! Queen Rhaenyra has her man and an army.

Did Queen Alicent try to surrender?

Courtesy of HBO

Alicent snuck out of King's Landing to visit Rhaenyra in Dragonstone. She proposed that if her old friend would allow her to get her children to safety, she would make it easy for her to seize the city and take back the Iron Throne. But Rhaenyra insists that to take the throne, she has to kill Alicent's sons (at least the ""king,"" Aegon). It's too late now. They can't sign a peace treaty. The boys can't rot in a jail cell. The only way for Rhaenyra to win back Westeros is by force. Alicent is so desperate to be done with all of this that she even asks Rhaenyra to run away with her. That doesn't happen, but speaking of:

Aegon ran away with Larys?

Courtesy of HBO

The former hand of the king and foot enthusiast proposed that he take King Aegon II to Braavos for his own safety until the war blows over. He moved money to the Iron Bank. There, Aegon would be safe from Aemond's rash actions and Rhaenyra's growing army. At the end of the episode, we see that Aegon has agreed. The two will cross the narrow sea together. How romantic! Not really. (Haha, unless...)

It's not a bad idea to get out of the city every once in a while. Ser Criston Cole, who we checked in on briefly, seems to have chilled out considerably after having spent some time away.

Why didn't anyone go on a run with Rhaena?

Courtesy of HBO

Daemon's dragon-less daughter finally found a dragon. All she had to do was walk and run in its general direction for the entire season finale. It seems like Lady Jeyne Arryn knew where Rhaena was going when she sent Rhaenyra and Daemon's toddler sons to Pentos, but didn't send anyone who knew the Vale with her. Rude! Rhaena hasn't officially claimed this dragon yet, but we have to assume that'll happen.

I'm happy for her but I'm still annoyed at how little she had to do this season. And her sister Baela, while she got to do at least one cool thing on a dragon, basically just had the same placating conversation with her cousin/fiancé Jace about how it's okay that he's a bastard over and over. Let these girlies have juicy storylines in season 3, please!!

The episode ends with multiple armies marching to fight.



The Lannister army is on the road for the Greens. The Stark army is on the road for the Blacks. The Riverland armies are ready to go. Dragon riders on both sides are suiting up. Tyland's navy is ready to meet Corlys Velaryon's navy. Anyone else start humming ""One Day More"" from Les Miserables in their head? Just me?

Oh, and Otto Hightower has been kidnapped? By whom? That's a mystery for season 3.

Courtesy of HBO

So what happens next?

War! Season 3 will likely be a lot of battles. The war rages on in the books after this point. The next big event is the Battle of the Gullet, which involves all of those ships we saw in the finale, as well as those toddlers going to Pentos. The mystery son of Alicent Hightower, Daeron Targaryen, should finally appear in season 3. Someone else will claim the Iron Throne, likely sooner rather than later. And so, so, so many more characters will die. Whomp whomp!

In a new themed spot, Hugh Jackman appears in his full superhero costume, reclining on a sofa, before he protests, “No, no, no, what the hell am I even doing?”

Ryan Reynolds then scoots into frame in character, explaining, “You’re explaining to Bachelor Nation how our movie is the perfect date movie, while holding this,” before sniffing a rose.

“I’m not doing either of those,” Jackman says, standing.

“Yes you are because you are a confident, powerful person and 18-49 year-old women are a super-important demo to us, no cap.”

Jackman turns around, and Reynolds then addresses the Nation, signaling the cameraman to zoom in on Jackman’s super-butt without him knowing.

Meanwhile, Deadpool explains, “Our movie has everything you love: You can really ZOOM IN on complex relationship dynamics. There’s ample amounts of cheeky humor, and I’m not gonna lie, it was quite a payday for us.”

Turns out, Wolverine was only there because Deadpool promised him a chance to meet the newest Bachelorette, Jenn Tran — but DP was lying.

Reynolds posted the spot to social media, captioning it with, “Can I steal HUGH for a second,” mirroring the oft-repeated phrase from the romance reality show.

House of the Dragon has closed its doors for the season, but there’s a lot more dragon dancing to come. When that might be still remains to be seen — almost two full years passed between the end of season one in 2022 and the start of the sophomore season. Even if season three comes quicker than that, though, it’ll be a long time to wait to see the conclusion of the season-two finale’s tantalizing cliffhanger ending and everything else that happens next to this crazy, incestuous family and their fiery, bloody civil war.

Luckily, if you don’t want to wait, you’ve just got to consult the history books. House of the Dragon is based on Fire and Blood, author George R. R. Martin’s faux history of the Targaryen dynasty. (The events are also detailed in The World of Ice and Fire.) We’ve already done a full overview that spoils the entire story as it happens in those books, but what, specifically, can we expect for House of the Dragon’s third season? The show has already made some notable changes from the source material, but we can still use them as a guide for season three.

Assuming that House of the Dragon will have four seasons — which hasn’t been confirmed but feels about right given the rate it’s moving through the story — it’s not too hard to guess which major events show watchers can look forward to. It’s entirely possible (likely, even) that the show will pace itself in such a way that not all of these will be the subject of their own episode. Some might get folded into others as side plots for timing or budgetary purposes; there are enough battles in the Dance to bankrupt even HBO’s VFX and extras budget, so not every week can be an epic extravaganza. Some things we expected to happen in season three might get punted to season four — especially if House of the Dragon ends up being five seasons and they need to stretch out the story. But, with all that said, here’s an attempt to predict the major events we can expect to see in season three. (There are spoilers from here on out, obviously!)

A Huge Naval Battle and the Season’s First Major Death

Season two’s closing montage sets up what should be an incredible action set piece to open the third season, when many of the moving parts that the finale set in motion come crashing together in the Narrow Sea. Tyland Lannister’s newly forged alliance with the Triarchy, a trio of powerful cities in Essos, gives the Greens the naval power they need to attempt to break the Velaryon blockade that’s crippling King’s Landing and turning the smallfolk against them. The Blacks only get a heads-up this is happening because Rhaenyra’s two youngest sons that she had with Daemon, Aegon the Younger and Viserys, are en route to Pentos when they cross paths with the oncoming armada. In the books, Aegon manages to escape on his dragon, Stormcloud, to Dragonstone and alert his mother, while Viserys is captured by the Triarchy and presumed dead. In the show, however, both Aegon and Stormcloud appear to be much younger, so unless they’re aged up considerably between seasons, it might not go down this way.

The Battle of the Gullet, as it’s known, is the first major test for new Dragonseeds Hugh, Ulf, and Addam, and they’re put to great use against the Triarchy’s fleet. The Velaryon fleet, including Alyn of Hull, also fights valiantly, and they’re able to beat the Triarchy and prevent them from taking any further part in the war. However, it’s not without cost. Corlys Velaryon’s ancestral seat of High Tide is burned along with many of the riches within. Worse still, Jacaerys, riding on Vermax, flies too low and his dragon crashes into the sea — possibly because it was struck by an arrow. Jace is then killed by crossbow fire, an ignominious end to the young, ambitious prince. Many book readers expected House of the Dragon’s second season to end with this epic battle, though that turned out not to be the case — perhaps because they didn’t want to conclude two seasons in a row with one of Rhaenyra’s sons getting killed.

Meet Daeron (Finally!)

Daeron Targaryen, Alicent Hightower’s only son who seemingly doesn’t suck, will finally enter the story. He was barely mentioned in season one, leading some book readers to wonder if he’d been written out of the adaptation, but some conversations in season two made it clear he still has a part to play.

Daeron and his dragon, Tessarion, make their big entry into the war at the Battle of the Honeywine, where he saves the head of House Hightower, Otto’s nephew Ormund Hightower. We might not see this exact battle in the show, as Ormund isn’t yet a known character on HotD. Ormund will have more to do down the line, so the show might cast a new actor to play him. Otto, meanwhile, was last heard of traveling to Oldtown upon being fired as Hand of the King, which could potentially mean he’ll be around to interact with Daeron and pick up some of the plot. However, a glimpse of Otto in the finale suggests he’s been imprisoned, either on the road or secretly by Aemond, which could make that a moot point. In any case, Ser Daeron the Daring, as he’s known, will be a factor in the war to come. His biggest moments, however, might not be until season four.

King’s Landing Changes Hands

Against all odds, Daemon Targaryen managed to rally the Riverlands behind him, and by extension Queen Rhaenyra. Prince Aemond correctly views this as a threat, so he gets on Vhagar and has Criston Cole and his army mount an attack on Harrenhal. They arrive to find it abandoned, as Harrenhal is wont to be. That’s because the Blacks knew the attack was coming and instead had Daemon’s host go around the Greens, avoiding them entirely. In the show, they know this because Alicent came to Dragonstone in the finale to switch sides and offer help to Rhaenyra. This turn does not happen in the books, and the implications for Alicent and Rhaenyra’s relationship going forward could potentially lead to some developments that book readers don’t see coming.

There are some battles near Harrenhal that we probably won’t see because they’re not too important, aside from maybe getting a chance to check in on the Black-allied North’s slow progress south. The real significance of Aemond’s assault on Harrenhal is that King’s Landing is undefended, with Alicent laying out a red carpet for the Blacks in the show’s version of events. So Rhaenyra and Daemon hop on their dragons and fly to King’s Landing, with Mysaria and the Velaryon fleet behind them, taking the capital of the Seven Kingdoms without much effort. Aegon, injured as he is, already fled the city with Larys Strong in the season-two finale; in the books, his only surviving heir, Princess Jaehaera, makes it out too. (He had another son in the books, Maelor, who isn’t in the show.) Alicent, who is seemingly on the Blacks’ side in this adaptation, stays in King’s Landing, as does Helaena. Tyland Lannister is horribly tortured when he won’t give up the location of gold he’s hidden as Master of Coin, and Rhaenyra has Otto Hightower executed.

The Blacks also gain the allegiance of Dalton Greyjoy, the lord of the Iron Islands known as the Red Kraken. He spends the war raiding the Westerlands and the Reach on behalf of Rhaenyra, so it’s possible he could appear in season three if House of the Dragon has room for another new character. It would also not be a shock if he’s omitted or he has only a minor role.

Criston Cole Gets Owned

Having been outsmarted, Aemond and Criston need a new strategy. Aemond pulls a Daemon and opts to hang out in the Riverlands hoping somebody will come fight him and his giant dragon while he lays waste to the countryside. He’ll also become very, very close with Alys Rivers, eventually impregnating the seer. Meanwhile, Criston and his army march south. Before getting too far, he’s beset by a massive Black army made up of Rivermen. Criston challenges the army’s leaders to single combat but they say “nah” and, instead, Criston’s peppered with arrows and dies like a chump before his army is slaughtered in a “battle” known as Butcher’s Ball. In the book, a Riverlord named Roderick Dustin leads the army, but it’s possible he could be swapped for a character viewers already know, like season-two breakout Oscar Tully.

Hopefully Not All of Nettles’s Plot

In the books, there’s a fourth Dragonseed in addition to Addam, Hugh, and Ulf. Nettles is a commoner who manages to tame a wild dragon, known as Sheepstealer. Nettles is not in House of the Dragon, as the season-two finale essentially confirmed that it’s instead Rhaena Targaryen who will be riding a wild dragon.

Giving Rhaena Nettles’s plot makes sense on a lot of levels; it means we might get to see Rhaena and Sheepstealer in action at the Battle of the Gullet, and there’s some fun stuff that happens for her at the end of the war. However, there’s one big thing that hopefully doesn’t happen in the show as a result of this change. In the book, Daemon falls in love with Nettles — a betrayal that drives yet another wedge in his relationship with Rhaenyra. Targaryens love incest, but this seems unlikely even for House of the Dragon. What could happen is that Daemon develops a renewed bond with his daughter, echoing that brief moment when he was a good dad back in season one, and this shifts his priorities away from backing Rhaenyra. That’s just conjecture, though, as the end of season two makes it seem like Daemon is much more devoted to Rhaenyra after having his Weirwood vision of The Song of Ice and Fire, a show-only invention.

The New Dragonriders Switch Sides

With the notable exception of Rhaenyra losing two more sons (remember, she thinks Viserys is dead), the war has been going pretty great for the Blacks so far. That changes when two of the Dragonseeds change sides. If you guessed that Ulf might become a problem for Rhaenyra, congratulations, you were right.

The Greens are determined to take back King’s Landing, so Daeron, Ormund (assuming he’s in the show), and the Hightower army march toward the realm’s capital. They’re on a roll, easily defeating any Blacks they encounter until they reach the town of Tumbleton. Rhaenyra sends Hugh and Ulf to defend Tumbleton, which is right on the border of the Crownlands, only for them to get intimidated because the Green host is significantly larger than the Black forces. As we already started to see in the season-two finale, Ulf has some authority issues, so this seems reasonable to expect from him, though Hugh seems like a pretty decent guy — if he also switches sides, season three will need to spend some time laying the groundwork for that.

Tumbelton falls, the Blacks lose two dragons, but perhaps even worse, the betrayal makes Rhaenyra question the loyalty of her other new dragonriders. Although Corlys Velaryon vouches for him, Rhaenyra orders that Addam be arrested as a precaution. Corlys tips off his son, allowing Addam and Seasmoke to escape, and is arrested for doing so. (Addam and Seasmoke will be back later, but probably not this season.) Given that Sheepstealer’s rider is Rhaena, her niece/stepdaughter, rather than a commoner like Nettles, Rhaenyra might have a different reaction. In the book, Daemon is sleeping with Nettles and tells her to escape, further putting a wedge between Rhaenyra and her husband and leaving the Blacks with even fewer dragons.

This is one possible stopping point for season three, but two other events in the Dance could also make sense.

Now Dragonstone Changes Hands

Where has the injured Aegon been since fleeing King’s Landing and leaving it undefended against Rhaenyra? Well, turns out that Dragonstone is pretty undefended now, too. Larys smuggles the king to Dragonstone and hides out in secret until Aegon’s dragon, Sunfyre, which had been recovering from his own grievous injuries at Rook’s Rest, joins them. (In the season-two finale, Aegon says his dragon is dead; either he’s mistaken or the show is making a major change. More likely Aegon is just assuming the worst.) Aegon, Sunfyre, and a meager force are able to take Dragonstone without much of a fight. Only Baela and her dragon, Moondancer, are there to oppose him, but Aegon and Sunfrye kill the dragon and take Baela hostage. Aegon does take another L, though, as in the fighting, he’s forced to jump from his dragon’s back and he breaks both his legs. Rhaenyra, it’s important to note, has no idea that Dragonstone has fallen.

This would be a fitting place for the season to end, too, with the Blacks and the Greens having switched places in addition to having switched some dragons. But there’s one more possible season-three finale …

An Epic Dragon Duel

Things are going pretty badly for Rhaneyra after a strong start to the season. In the books, she’s also furious with Daemon because he wouldn’t arrest Nettles as she’d ordered. Feeling adrift and like he has nothing left to lose, Daemon flies to Harrenhal and challenges Aemond to single combat atop their dragons. The show will almost certainly change the specifics of this, as Rhaneyra has less reason to be suspicious of Rhaena compared to Nettles, and hopefully Daemon won’t have taken his daughter as a lover. Perhaps the show version of Daemon won’t be on the outs with Rhanerya at all, but will instead be driven to go to Harrenhal because of the prophecy he saw when he touched the Weirwood in the season-two finale.

In any case, Daemon, riding Caraxes, takes on Aemond and Vhagar. It’s an epic battle high in the sky above a lake neighboring Harrenhal called the God’s Eye. The dragons lock claws and plummet toward the water only for Daemon to leap off his dragon onto Aemond and plunge his Valaryian steel sword into the prince’s remaining eye just before they all crash into the lake. Aemond and Vhagar die under the water — fulfilling Heleana’s prophecy in the season-two finale that he’s “swallowed up in the God’s Eye” and never seen again. Caraxes manages to crawl out and into the bowels of Harrenhal before succumbing to his injuries. Daemon’s remains are never found.

What About Season Four?

That’s a lot of action to pack into one season, and in all likelihood, the Battle Above the God’s Eye will probably not be the season-three finale — if for no other reason than House of the Dragon might want to start the next season with more members of the cast alive and able to do press, especially Matt Smith, one of the bigger names on the show. More likely is the finale ending with the taking of Dragonstone or the fallout of Ulf’s and Hugh’s betrayals.

But, even if season three does manage to cover all of this, there’s still plenty of action left in the Dance of Dragons to fill out the fourth season. The Storming of the Dragonpit! The Second Battle of Tumbleton! The Hour of the Wolf! Many more major character deaths! It’s all coming — we’ll just wait until the next finale to spoil it in detail."
"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://ca.news.yahoo.com/house-dragon-showrunner-confirms-series-191446209.html,"House of the Dragon showrunner confirms when series will end as well as season 3 release schedule

House of the Dragon co-creator and showrunner Ryan Condal has confirmed that the show will end after four seasons.

Condal made the announcement on Monday (August 5) during a press conference following the release of the show’s season two finale.

He also shared an update about the drama’s third season, revealing that it’s currently being written and will go into production in “earlyish 2025.”

When asked whether season three will have eight episodes as season two did, Condal said: “I haven’t had discussions with HBO about it. I would just anticipate the cadence of the show, from a dramatic storytelling perspective, will continue to be the same from season two on.”

The HBO show is based on Fire & Blood, the first prequel book in author George RR Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire fantasy series. It is set nearly 200 years before the events detailed in Game of Thrones and follows the story of the Targaryen civil war with King Viserys I Targaryen’s five children battling for control of the Iron Throne.

Martin, who also serves as a co-creator on the show, previously said he anticipated House of the Dragon would have at least four seasons.

“It is going to take four full seasons of 10 episodes each to do justice to the Dance of the Dragons, from start to finish,” he wrote on his personal blog in 2022.

In a January update, the bestselling author said that he had been discussing the “third and fourth seasons” with Condal and the other writers.

The House of the Dragon was officially renewed for a third season ahead of its season two debut in June.

“George, Ryan, and the rest of our incredible executive producers, cast, and crew, have reached new heights with the phenomenal second season of House of the Dragon,” said HBO programming Executive Vice President Francesca Orsi in a statement at the time.

“We are in awe of the dragon-sized effort the entire team has put into the creation of a spectacular season two, with a scope and scale that is only rivaled by its heart. We could not be more thrilled to continue the story of House Targaryen and watch this team burn bright again for season three.”

The season two finale, which was released on Sunday (August 4), has left critics and viewers disappointed.

“Eight episodes in, we’re still waiting for fiery action,” The Indendent’s Nick Hilton wrote in his two-star review of the finale. The show “is still afflicted by a glacial narrative pace. Even its characters seem gripped by ennui,” he added.

House of the Dragon is available to stream on Max in the US and on Now and Sky Atlantic in the UK."

During a press conference on Monday regarding the season 2 finale of its Game of Thrones prequel series House of the Dragon, showrunner/co-creator Ryan Condal says the show will end after a fourth season.

Condal says the forthcoming third season is being written, with a debut expected in “earlyish 2025.”

The show was renewed for season 3 in June, ahead of the debut of its sophomore frame.

Based on author George R.R. Martin‘s Fire & Blood, the series is set 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones and centers on House Targaryen. The HBO Original drama series includes Matt Smith, Olivia Cooke, Rhys Ifans, Emma D’Arcy, Steve Toussaint and Eve Best.

During a press conference discussing the Season 2 finale of House of the Dragon, showrunner and co-creator Ryan Condal shared that there are only two seasons left.

Condal also confirmed that Season 3 of the series is currently being written, and it will start shooting in early 2025.

Condal said: “I haven’t had discussions with HBO about it. I would just anticipate the cadence of the show, from a dramatic storytelling perspective, will continue to be the same from Season 2 on.”

Game of Thrones author George R.R. Martin, who is co-creator on House of the Dragon, previously said on his blog that it would take four seasons of 10 episodes each to tell the show, and now that’s been confirmed.

When talking about the Season 2 finale and where the series is heading with the Battle of the Gullet.

Condal said: “We were trying to give the Gullet, which is arguably the most anticipated — well, I would say maybe the second-most-anticipated — action event of ‘Fire & Blood,’ trying to give it the time and the space that it deserves.

“Obviously, as anybody that’s seen the finale, we’re building to that event. That event will happen very shortly in terms of the storytelling of ‘House of the Dragon.’

He added: “Based on what we know now, it should be the biggest thing to date that we’ve pulled off, and we just wanted to have the time, the space to do that at a level that is going to excite and satisfy the fans and in the way it’s deserved.”

They are looking to build up the anticipation for the event, which is why Season 2 didn’t end with the Battle of the Gullet.

Condal said: “I know everybody wants this to come out every summer. It’s just that the show is so complex that we’re really making multiple feature films every season.

“So I apologize for the wait, but I will just say if Rook’s Rest and the Red Sowing are any indication, we’re gonna pull off a hell of a win with the Battle the Gullet in the future.”

Game of Thrones fans have some exciting story elements to look forward to, and it sounds like Season 3 will focus on the Battle of the Gullet, which is the bloodiest sea battle in the history of Westeros.

House of the Dragon‘s Season 2 finale Sunday brought all of its major characters right up to the brink of a legendary battle — but didn’t cross over into actual fighting — and showrunner Ryan Condal explained that decision in a call with reporters Monday.

More from TVLine

Episode 8 moved many pieces into place for some of the biggest fights detailed in George R.R. Martin’s book Fire & Ice, including the Greens’ attempt to break Corlys’ blockade, aka the Battle of the Gullet. But the 70-minute episode ended on footage of Alicent’s #TeamGreen and Rhaenyra’s #TeamBlack marching , riding and/or sailing to war. (Read a full recap here, and see what director Geeta Vasant Patel had to say about a key scene here.)

The finale polarized fans. TVLine readers gave the episode an average grade of C+, and Season 2 overall a B-.

Condal said that while he understood why the show’s choice to wait for the Gullet might rankle viewers, it wasn’t made lightly — and he promised that the payoff in Season 3 would be worth it.

“When you’re trying to mount this show, which requires a tremendous amount of resources — construction, armor, costumes, visual effects — we were trying to give the Gullet, which is arguably the most anticipated — well, maybe the second most anticipated action event of Fire & Blood — trying to give it the time and the space that it deserves,” he said.

House of the Dragon's second season came to its conclusion on Monday, 5 August. (HBO/Sky)

House of the Dragon's second season has come to an end, but the episode left a few viewers wanting after it ended on what they felt was an ""anticlimactic"" note.

The show has always been about the slow burn, recounting George RR Martin's Dance of the Dragons with purpose so that it does not rush through the narrative. For many this type of storytelling works, but for some viewers it was frustrating that the war between the Targaryen family is yet to be in full swing.

Before we elaborate on how and why, be warned that this article contains spoilers for the season finale.

What, how, and why?

House of the Dragon ended with the Targaryen family on the brink of war, but with war only on the horizon. (Sky)

House of the Dragon's season 2 finale ends with Rhaenyra Targaryen (Emma D'Arcy) coming face to face with her old friend now rival Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke) pleading with her to make peace. Alicent says that she will give Rhaenyra her birthright without challenge in exchange for an escape alongside her daughter Helaena.

Rhaenyra says that she wants what is fair, a son for a son after Aemond (Ewan Mitchell) killed her son Lucerys in season 1. In the end, Alicent agreed to let Rhaenyra kill her eldest Aegon (Tom Glynne-Carney) in order to take her rightful place as queen, but viewers then learn that not only are the soldiers on both sides of the war marching towards war but Aegon has escaped.

The episode ends with Rhaenyra and Alicent contemplating their deal, with the tragedy being that it won't ever come to pass because it is too late, and war is coming.

But several viewers weren't too pleased with the finale, with some using social media to air their grievances about the episode with others.

Rhaenyra and Alicent make a deal for the former to take the Iron Throne without a fight, however Alicent's efforts are in vain because her son Aegon has escape King's Landing and forces on both sides are preparing for battle. (Sky)

One viewer wrote how they were disappointed with ""this amazing build up and now we have to wait 2 years for Season 3"", while another said: ""Well, that was probably one of the most underwhelming season finales I’ve ever watched.""

Some viewers claimed that the finale felt like a prelude to the next season, with one writing: ""Did I just watch a 70 minute trailer for Season 3?"" and another person similarly claimed: ""we all just watched a 66 minute trailer for S3"".

And another said: ""When the screen went black on tonight’s episode of #HouseOfTheDragon I let out a loud “I know you f**king lying”. Anticlimactic is an understatement.""

What else happened on House of the Dragon?

House of the Dragon also saw Matt Smith's Daemon have a vision of the Targaryen family's future, and Daenerys Targayen's place in it. (Sky)

One aspect of the finale that viewers were delighted by was the inclusion of Daenerys Targaryen, played by Emilia Clarke in the flagship show. The character was shown to Daemon Targaryen (Matt Smith) in a vision of the future, which shared Aegon the Conqueror's dream of the Prince Who Was Promised.

In the vision Daemon saw the Night King and the Whitewalkers, and also showed Daenerys with her three dragons which some viewers took to mean that she is the Prince Who Was Promised foretold in George RR Martin's books, and not Jon Snow as the TV show suggested.

In their excitement, one person wrote: ""SO DANY IS IN FACT, THE PRINCE THAT WAS PROMISED??? Now I’m mad about season 8, all over again"".

Another person said: ""DAENERYS IN THE PROPHECY OF ICE AND FIRE!!! SHE IS THE PRINCE THAT WAS PROMISED!!!"", while one viewer also wrote: ""FROM RHAENYRA’S BLOOD COMES THE PRINCESS THAT WAS PROMISED AND HERS IS THE SONG OF ICE AND FIRE — ALL HAIL QUEEN DAENERYS STORMBORN!""

"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a61754749/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-ending-explained/,"Much like Blood and Cheese sneaking into the Red Keep, a villain slipped into HBO’s stronghold. On Tuesday night, roughly thirty minutes of House of the Dragon’s season 2 finale leaked online. The footage didn’t contain the entire episode, but the leak was enough for fans to piece together all that they needed to know. There’s no big battle to end the season—and no more shocking deaths.

Viewers who were ready to see the bloodiest moments in the Targaryen civil war will likely find themselves disappointed, because season 2 ends in the same place it began. It’s very reminiscent of The Bear season 3’s “To Be Continued” finale. By delaying any sort of resolution, House of the Dragon’s audience is left with what feels more like a penultimate episode than a satisfying conclusion to another chapter in the story. Ironically, the fantasy series known for heartbreaking deaths is now reluctant to kill anyone. House of the Dragon is a different story—and it’s one that requires its power players to stick around until the dramatic conclusion. But that might not occur until the season 4 finale or beyond, depending on how long HBO plans to stretch this series out. That’s likely 2028, folks!

I’ll pick up on this thought later on in my recap—but first, let’s break down what went down in season 2’s lackluster finale.

HBO Poor Tom.

Team Green’s Mad Scramble

At the end of episode 7, Ulf (Tom Bennett) flies his new dragon over King’s Landing and jostles all the townsfolk like the New York City earthquake. Aemond (Ewan Mitchell) realizes that having the largest dragon is a bit less impressive when it’s one dragon versus six, and now he’s freaking out. To raise his own dragon army, he approaches his sister, Helaena (Phia Saban). She doesn’t want to fight, but Aemond asserts that it’s her duty to protect their family’s kingdom. In response, Helaena spills some major spoilers for the future of the series. She tells Aemond that he will die at the God’s Eye while his brother, Aegon II (Tom Glynn-Carney), sits on a wooden throne. In a fit of anger, Aemond burns an entire town in the Crownlands.

Meanwhile, Ser Criston Cole (Fabien Frankel) and Gwayne Hightower (Freddie Fox) are marching to Harrenhal. Daemon (Matt Smith) rides a dragon, but Cole’s grounded army does not. So...it can’t go too well. Plus, he warned the Prince Regent that they’re still shell-shocked and outnumbered from the Battle of Rook’s Rest. Aemond sent them anyway.

As Cole sniffs Alicent’s (Olivia Cooke) handkerchief and muses about how swords will solve everything now, Gwayne threatens to send him to the Wall for sleeping with his sister. “Do not think I have no shame in me, sir,” Cole tells him. “Desire for women has brought me grief after grief.” Then nihilism sets in. “The dragons dance and men are like dust under their feet....We march now to our annihilation. To die will be a kind of relief, don’t you think?” Dark!

Tyland Lannister (Jefferson Hall) is also sent on a suicide mission. He desperately pleads with the Triarchy to help them defeat Corlys’s (Steve Toussaint) blockade in exchange for the Stepstones. Sharako Lohar (Abigail Thorn), a Triarchy admiral, will only sail for Team Green if Tyland can best them in mud wrestling. “Let the Sea Snake rue the day we meet again,” Lohar says after they tussle around in the muck.

Back at King’s Landing, Larys (Matthew Needham) is fearful for the king’s life. He believes that Aemond will kill Aegon II if he stays. So he’s saved enough of the crown’s money in Bravos for them to escape to the East and regroup. It takes very little convincing for the king to abandon his kingdom. Flee now, glory later. Forget the fact that he looks like a burnt raisin that’s been collecting dust and hair from under the kitchen stove! Right now all Aegon II can think about is how his penis was scorched from his body. I wish I were joking.

HBO Ulf! Ulf! Ulf!

HBO Should Just Call This Show House of Ulf

Ulf is the surprise sleeper addition to House of the Dragon season 2. The Flea Bottom bastard just went from a glorified extra to a member of Rhaenyra’s special dragonriders. He has his feet up on the Black council’s table at Dragonstone in the finale, pushing for knighthood—and proving himself a dangerous new piece on the chessboard. This is like giving the town drunk a nuclear bomb and hoping he’s a responsible guy. Jace (Harry Collett) meets them and continues to fume like a popcorn kernel ready to pop. Call me crazy, but I love it. I just wish it had all happened five episodes ago.

HBO This magic tree has saved my life.





Daemon’s Forced Redemption Dream

Though Ser Criston Cole quickly earned the fans’ vitriol in the first couple episodes, Daemon’s purgatory at Harrenhal was easily the most criticized stall tactic in season 2. Did we really need eight episodes of ghostly cameos and disturbing incest nightmares? Daemon doesn’t even apologize for his actions in the finale. Instead, he bends the knee to Rhaenyra (Emma D’Arcy) after experiencing a vision from a magical tree. Yes, you read that correctly. Alys Rivers (Gayle Rankin) and her weirwood tree show him a montage of Rhaenyra sitting on the Iron Throne, followed by images of a White Walker, Bloodraven, and even Daenerys with her baby dragons. Heleana appears in the vision as well, telling Daemon, “It’s all a story.”

The experience is revelatory for Daemon. He couldn’t possibly comprehend what he just saw, but he somehow understands it with perfect clarity. “The world is not what we thought it was,” he says. “The war is just the beginning. Winter is coming.” It’s a confusing 180-degree turn for Daemon. The King Consort seemed steadfast in his quest to spurn his niece-wife and seek glory last episode. Alfred Broome (Jamie Kenna) just told him that Westeros needed a king in this moment—and he seemed to enjoy his friend’s misogynistic support. But one confounding psychedelic experience later and Daemon is a changed man.

“The realm’s only hope is a leader who can unite it, and my brother chose you,” Daemon tells Rhaenyra. “I am meant to serve you until death or the end of our story.” I can hear mega fans amending their wedding nuptials as we speak. “Leave me again, at your peril,” she responds. “I could not,” he concedes, quipping that he’s already tried and failed. And with that, Daemon's redemption is complete. It’s as if HBO declared, “You’re not allowed to hate him, because he’s sticking around!”

HBO Corlys isn’t walking away from the finale unscathed (emotionally).

Corlys’s Regret

It’s okay if you turn your back on Corlys this episode (though hopefully only briefly). After the Sea Snake informs Alyn (Abubakar Salim) that it’s time to set sail for war, he adds that he wants to “set out on good terms with his first mate.” For Corlys, good terms apparently means that it’s time for his son’s end-of-season review. He tells Alyn that he needs to be more vocal with his men, because they find him distant. “You cannot lead if you don’t inspire,” he says.

“Is this the help you offer after all these years?” Alyn asks. “A reminder to be grateful?” He reprimands his father for leaving him and his brother Addam as poor, hungry bastards. “Do you know what it was like for us to grow up fatherless? Do you know what hunger does to a boy? What grief does, or shame?” I love Corlys, but let Alyn cook! “Now you remember I live? I am an honorable man, and I will serve you because I must. But if it is all the same, I will decline any offers of help. If I survive this war, I will continue as I began. Alone.” Damn. Good speech, but rough for Corlys.

HBO Time for war! Again.

Rhaenyra Is Triumphant (For Now)

Back at Dragonstone, Rhaenyra has another ruined relationship to patch up. Alicent is here. She wants to renegotiate surrender now that King Aegon II is a dried-out pickle and Aemond is a warmongering time bomb. She would even go so far as to open the gates of King’s Landing for Rhaenyra to sneak in and reclaim the throne. Rhaenyra tells her that she cannot be “absolved” so easily. You’re surrendering now? It doesn’t work like that. “Wander in the wilderness,” Rhaenyra says. Enjoy those new Hokas! Alicent forgets that if Rhaenyra sits on the Iron Throne, she will need to kill Aegon II. That’s where we’re at here. Alicent defends her son, hoping that he will listen to reason. But Rhaenyra will not spare his life. He is the usurper. He cannot live if she rules. So the two former childhood friends remain at a standstill. It is time for war, as it has been since season 1’s finale.

In a closing montage, we see Otto (Rhys Ifans) in some sort of jail, Daeron’s dragon Tessarion flying over the Hightower army, the Lannisters on their march to God knows where, Rhaena (Phoebe Campbell) making contact with Sheepstealer, Aegon II and Larys hiding in a cart bound for the East, and Corlys finally setting out to sea on his big boat. He names the ship “The Queen Who Never Was” after his late wife, which is a nice gesture but extremely ominous. Finally, Rhaenyra announces to her new dragonriders that they’re flying out to war in two days. (That’s two more years for us, people.)

Theo Whiteman // HBO After that finale, I may need to step outside as well.

So...What’s Next?

Looking back at all the decisions House of the Dragon has made so far, it’s surprising how many times the series has painted itself into a corner. Don’t get me wrong—I’m not a Fire & Blood stickler. I genuinely enjoy House of the Dragon; that’s why I write about it every week. But George R.R. Martin’s mind is crazy. Love him or hate him, he’s a compelling storyteller and world builder. He took hundreds of years of European history and added so many dragons and ice zombies that Jon Snow is now a household name. But even the best changes to Martin’s source material have dug House of the Dragon into a hole.

Despite Alicent and Rhaenyra’s expanded history—or how with each new little wrinkle to their relationship, it’s increasingly clear that they shouldn't kill each other—they must go to war, simply because that’s what happens next in the book. Daemon sits in Harrenhal purgatory for an entire season because there’s nothing for him to do until the rest of the story catches up. So we’re left waiting for the story to truly begin. HBO can fill the time by unnecessarily answering Fire & Blood’s mysteries with allusions to Game of Thrones’ “A Song of Ice and Fire” prophecy, but every Thrones fan already knows how disappointing threats like “Winter is coming” were in the controversial series finale.

At the same time, maybe season 3 will deliver the goods. It’s possible that every episode from here on out is as good as Vemithor’s rampage. But I’m not sure. I can’t put my hand on a magical tree and see that future."
"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a61792617/house-of-dragon-season-2-ending/,"After eight episodes of tension building and plot developments teetering on the edge of glorious action, House of the Dragon's season two finale flamed out harder than Aegon and Sunfyre in Aemond's wake. At least, that's how the fans feel.



Viewers descended on Twitter/X moments after the finale aired and their reactions were more alarming than the image of Aegon's member bursting like a sausage on a spit.



""This season of House of The Dragon was the worst season in the whole GOT universe, including season eight of GOT,"" wrote one disgruntled fan, who arguably went a little too far (it was hardly the Fall of Daenerys-level bad).

They added: ""Why not give us a real season finale? Seemed like every episode you thought 'next week will be the one' and 'the one' won't come for another two years.""



HBO

Their dissatisfaction was echoed by another, who wrote:



""Might have been the worst season finale I have ever seen. House of Dragon had one compelling episode this whole season. In hindsight, this show sucks.""



With the exception of the 'Blood and Cheese' storyline coming to fruition and Rhaenys' (Eve best) epic demise in episode four, HotD's second outing charted a much slower path compared to anything fans of the Game of Thrones franchise are used to. It was also far less punctuated with dramatic moments than its already steadily paced season debut.



While Game of Thrones offered a balance of shock and world-building, House of the Dragon's focal point is clearly the latter, with its focus on interpersonal relationships leading to a more intimate viewing experience.

This is especially true of season two and, actually, we're not mad at it. In fact, we'd even go as far as to say we like having something that isn't a carbon copy of the parent show.

HBO

For the most part, its arresting moments don't come from gore and violent game-play. They come from the intense longing for reconciliation beneath Alicent (Olivia Cooke) and Rhaenyra's (Emma D'Arcy) snippy conversations, they are in the subjugation of Daemon (Matt Smith) to his queen and the trepidation felt watching Helaena (Phia Saban) refuse Aemond's demands, knowing how his sinister mind works.

It's a tight vice that squeezes with every conversation, decision, look and averted gaze. The problem is that this is war and as deliciously compelling as this quiet tension is, eventually the high stakes need to erupt into bouts of dragonfire and swordplay.

Lucerys' (Elliot Grihault) death at the end of season one felt as though it were going to propel the show into a bloody war. It did not. That anticipation grew with the squelching sound of the infant Jaehaerys' (Jude Rock) head being lopped off early on in season two, but the show failed to sustain the natural, explosive repercussions and the evolution of war throughout.



To make matters worse, HotD left fans on the most anti-climactic cliffhanger, with the Blacks and Greens and all their sworn houses marching off to a war we already know is coming, thus sapping all the anticipation from what's to come, while also making us ask 'Will it ever?'

HBO

Sadly this could be indicative of a larger problem for the show. Is there enough story to plot out over several seasons? Or would House of the Dragon have benefited from a shorter, succinct run?

Unlike Game of Thrones, which is based on George RR Martin's extensive saga of five published books (and two more planned), House of the Dragon's Targaryen civil war is covered from start to finish in one book, Fire & Blood. The novel is also billed as a 'history' book, which means not only is there less material to build on, but there's also less of a floor plan to work with.



Showrunner Ryan Condal has deviated from the source material at times: Aegon and Helaena have two children instead of three, Lohar (Abigail Thorn) has gone from pirate king on page to pirate queen, Rhaenyra and Mysaria (Sonoya Mizuno) kiss on screen but not in the book. But the creator has, for the most part, remained loyal to the text.

However, if it's already thinner in comparison to GOT, is it possible it's already been stretched past capacity?

Sky





There was a lot to intrigue viewers watching Aemond slink so effortlessly and callously into the position of Prince Regent and as adrift as Daemon's Harrenhal arc felt from the main plot, it all came full circle when he publicly bent the knee to Rhaenyra because of course someone as proud and selfish as Daemon would need more of a reason to follow than 'I love you' – and now it makes sense.

But season two's even slower plotting has us questioning if these episodes aren't just padding between larger anchor points we've yet to get to.

We're not ready to chuck the baby out with the bathwater just yet. We thoroughly believe there is more gripping story that needs not be squeezed out of HotD. Rather it will flow like the river of blood we're all anticipating. Yet we can't help but wonder whether or not season three ought to be House of the Dragon's last, lest it actually go the way of Game of Thrones season eight.

House of the Dragon season 1 and 2 are available to stream on in the US on HBO and , and and NOW.

"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://www.joblo.com/house-of-the-dragon-season-4-end/,"The second season of House of the Dragon wrapped up on Sunday, bringing the Game of Thrones prequel series to its halfway point. That’s right, series showrunner Ryan Condal has confirmed that House of the Dragon will likely end with season 4.

In a virtual press conference moderated by journalist Joanna Robinson (via THR), Condal was asked if House of the Dragon would run five seasons. “ No, I think it’s four, ” he said. The showrunner also said that season three will start shooting early next year. As with the second season, the third is also expected to consist of eight episodes. Based on George R.R. Martin’s Fire & Blood, House of the Dragon is set 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones and tells the story of House Targaryen. You can check out a review of the second season from our own Alex Maidy right here.

Related A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms has begun shooting with five new additions to the cast

The second season finale has come under fire from fans, who were annoyed that the episode came to an end seemingly before a massive battle was set to begin. Condal defended the move, citing resource management. “ One of the challenges of making television at any scale [is] nobody has infinite time and resources, ” Condal explained. “ When you’re a showrunner, you’re always in the position of having to balance storytelling and the resources that you have available to tell that story. One of the things that came into play in season two is: What is the final destination of the series and where are we going? It was a combination of factors that led us to rebalance the season knowing now where we’re going. We wanted to rebalance the story in such a way that we had three great seasons of television [after season one] to round out and tell this story. When you’re trying to mount the show, which requires a tremendous amount of resources, construction, armor, costumes, visual effects … we are trying to give The Gullet — which is arguably the second most anticipated action event of Fire & Blood — trying to give it the time and the space that it deserves. “

Condal continued, “ We are building to that event that will happen very shortly in terms of the storytelling, and it should be the biggest thing to date that we’ve we’ve pulled off. We just wanted to have the time and the space to do that at a level that is going to excite and satisfy the fans in the way it’s deserved. We also wanted to build some anticipation toward it. So I apologize for the wait, but … with the team that we have together, we’re going to pull off a hell of a win with The Battle of the Gullet. “

The next Game of Thrones prequel series is already shooting, with A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms expected to launch in late 2025, How do you feel about House of the Dragon coming to an end with season 4?"
"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/2024/08/04/house-dragon-season-two-episode-eight-finale/,"For all their time-jumping and digressions, the first two seasons of “House of the Dragon” have been pretty straightforward. The series, a less-sprawling offshoot of “Game of Thrones,” is about who will end up on the Iron Throne — and what they’re willing to do to get there. We’ve focused on two main characters, Rhaenyra and Alicent, and all the people who have helped or hindered them on their paths to ruling (or ruling by proxy).

The second season’s eighth and final episode holds some surprising reversals. Daemon has a new dream vision: He sees the prophesied Winter is Coming highlight reel, which profoundly transforms his worldview. After her time in the woods, Alicent also undergoes a transformation — one that prompts her to visit Rhaenyra and offer her a surprising path to a bloodless transfer of power if her former bestie will trust her. Sneaky Larys convinces a recovering Aegon to flee King’s Landing with him, and the pair head to Essos to wait out whatever’s coming.

The finale ends with a stirring, but very frustrating montage of all the characters as the war is about to begin — or about to be subverted. It’s a dramatic setup for a delayed climax, but pushing the anticipated battles and round two of Dragonmania to a future date probably left a lot of viewers screaming at their screens when the episode cut to credits. Even the changing tapestry of the opening credits seemed to promise, “Dragons, dragons, dragons!”

Let’s recap how we got to this to-be-continued ending:

Team Daemon

Now that Daemon has amassed the Riverlands army he wanted, he’s hosting troops in a suddenly very crowded Harrenhal. Ser Alfred Broome from Rhaenyra’s council shows up to check on him, but before Daemon can even detail his plan to march on King’s Landing, Broome has betrayed Rhaenyra, saying he and lots of other lords would never join the Hightowers, but they’d be thrilled to have a third-party candidate such as Daemon on the ballot. A bemused Daemon says he never took Broome for a turncoat. But he doesn’t turn down the suggestion, either. Unbeknownst to both of them, sweet Ser Simon is watching.

Later, Daemon awakens to find Alys sitting on his bed and follows her outside to the Godswood tree. Daemon was a closed fist (so, a fist?) when he arrived, she says, but now he understands that the world will not be governed. He touches the bleeding tree and has an extended freakout vision of the future that includes the three-eyed raven, the death of a dragon, Rhaenyra on the Iron Throne, a blonde man drowning, three dragon eggs and a very notable woman who will one day be called the Mother of Dragons (we only see Daenerys and her baby dragons from the back).

Ser Simon sends a raven to Rhaenyra telling her what’s happening with Broome and Daemon, and she rushes over on dragonback to confront her husband. She arrives to find Harrenhal bustling like a farmers market at peak kale season. Everyone stops to watch. Daemon approaches her, surprised, and gives her an update: He has an army, and they are sworn to him. Rhaenyra asks, “And to whom are you sworn?” And then … a Harrenhal miracle! Daemon tells Rhaenyra in High Valyrian that the world isn’t what they thought, and that winter is coming. “You sound like my father,” she says.

Daemon, suddenly spiritual, says their only hope is a leader to unite them, and that leader is Rhaenyra. He kneels, and as the music swells, Rhaenyra takes his hand and says, “Leave me again at your peril,” which is a great line, even for Rhaenyra. Daemon is in the pocket with his response: “I cannot. I have tried, my queen.” Daemon rallies the troops to fight for their queen, and all is right for a few moments, a rarity in Westeros.

New faces

We haven’t seen much of Tyland Lannister, the brother of Hightower councilmember Jason, until now. He’s sent to Essos to entreat the Triarchy to help break the Corlys-led sea blockade. They will, but they have a few conditions: They want possession of the Stepstones islands if victorious, and Tyland will have to travel with Admiral Lohar, commander of their fleet. Lohar, it turns out, is a formidable and hilarious woman, the type of character this show desperately needs. When she shows up, she tells Tyland she won’t sail with him unless he can best her. At what? Glad you asked: mud wrestling.

The fight ends with Tyland landing a few blows that impress Lohar. At dinner later, she tells Tyland she finds him handsome and wants him to have sex and make babies … with her wives. Where has Lohar been all season? At the end of the episode, we see them sailing together toward the blockade and hopefully lots more screen time in season three.

Team Alicent, Aegon and Aemond

Things are grim at the Red Keep. Off-screen, Aemond and his dragon Vhagar have killed thousands when they burned down a town called Sharp Point. We learn about this as Larys and Grandmaester Flash Orwyle are tending to Aegon, who is strong enough now to call his brother some very bad words. Larys warns Aegon he’s in danger, not just from the war but from Aemond, and suggests that they abscond with the money he siphoned from Harrenhal.

Alicent, returned from her camping retreat, visits Helaena and asks if she wants to leave this place where they’re both so unhappy. Aemond interrupts, demanding that Helaena help the kingdom by riding her dragon, Dreamfyre. Heleana doesn’t want to hurt or burn anybody, but Aemond grabs her roughly by the arm and demands that she comply. Alicent gets involved, trying to make him feel guilty about Sharp Point and accusing him of trying to corrupt his sister

Later, Aemond tries again to goad Helaena into dragonriding, specifically, riding to Harrenhal and laying waste to Daemon and his army. Helaena asks if he’ll burn her the way he burned Aegon if she refuses. Aemond denies this, but Helaena says she has seen that and a lot more, predicting that Aegon will be king again and Aemond will be dead. “You were swallowed up in the God’s Eye and you were never seen again,” she tells him.

In case you’re wondering what’s going on with Ser Criston Cole (nobody was wondering that), he’s sad and lonely, crying over the queen’s handkerchief. Her brother, Gwayne, has figured out that the two were having sex, and he’s mad about it, but they don’t fight because Cole is too mopey, complaining that women are the ruin of him and he’s ready to go into battle and die.

Back at the castle, Alicent consults with Orwyle, asking if he can help her with some discreet travel arrangements. Let’s put a pin in that — it’s important.

Team Rhaenyra

At Dragonstone, new dragonriders Ulf, Hugh and Addam are getting accustomed to castle life. Ulf, in particular, is an annoyance to Jace; he freely gives the prince hugs and puts his feet on the table. At dinner, Rhaenyra tells them how important they are to the war effort and implores them to take their training seriously. In two days, she says, they’ll be striking down armies in Oldtown and Lannisport.

Rhaenyra consults with Corlys, who suggests they strike fast since they now have the dragon advantage. Corlys, meanwhile, is getting ready to head out to sea on his vessel, which he has re-christened The Queen Who Never Was. He says everything he does now is for Rhaenys. But all is not well with Corlys: He’s still hiding the fact that Addam is his son and when he tries to advise his other son, Alyn, on being a good sea leader, Alyn blows up at him for being an absent father.

Rhaena, still wandering the hills outside The Eyrie in search of a dragon, spends the whole episode becoming increasingly hungry and thirsty. When she finally encounters one, we don’t get to see if she claims and rides it; that’s punted to Season 3.

Rhaenyra is struggling with the idea of attacking civilians when she gets an unexpected visit: Alicent. The pair have a long conversation in which Alicent reveals she no longer wants to be queen. Rhaenyra says it’s too late for Alicent to wash her hands of this mess. That’s when Alicent proposes a bold idea: While Aemond is away fighting, Helaena will be in charge at King’s Landing. Alicent says Rhaenyra can swoop in and take the throne with no bloodshed. Rhaenyra says that Aegon will still be an issue. “I must take Aegon’s head,” she says, “and I have to do it for all to see.” Alicent, conflicted, takes a few moments, but decides she’s fine with that. Alicent asks Rhaenyra to come away with her, but Rhaenyra says her place is at Dragonstone and tells Alicent to go.

The network announced today that season 3 will be filmed shortly for 2025, followed by a quick ending.

Last night season 2 ended with a whimper despite all the dragons breathing heavy and promising to wreck Westeros.

“House of the Dragon” has had anemic ratings and reviews all this season. It’s averaged 1.2 million viewers a week on HBO, which has stopped sending out ratings reports.

The show simply has no traction. I’m surprised they’re actually doing a third and fourth season. They could have stopped last night and no one would have noticed. Instead of a big cliff hanger, the episode just fizzled.

There are many problems with the “Game of Thrones” spin off. It’s almost impossible to follow, and nothing happens. Unlike “Thrones,” there are no relationships, no sex, nothing compelling. The dragons are more interesting than the people.

HBO has plans for more “Thrones” spin offs. But they’re expensive, and without huge numbers, they can’t be done.

Not a surprise.

Meanwhile, HBO came roaring back today with 6 second teasers for “The White Lotus,” “The Last of Us,” and “Sex and the City.” They’re all hits, Time to get back on track!"
"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://www.polygon.com/24212021/house-of-the-dragon-season-3-release-date-cast-news,"House of the Dragon’s second season has come to an end by filling the chess board with pieces and meticulously moving each one into position. While that didn’t make for the most explosive season finale in Game of Thrones history, it should shape up for a fantastic third season.

To give you a preview of the events to come, here’s everything we know about House of the Dragon season 3, which HBO has already greenlit.

Is House of the Dragon season 3 happening?

It’s definitely happening, and the announcement was made before season 2 even premiered. On top of that, creators Ryan Condal and George R.R. Martin have talked about keeping the show to a tight four(ish) seasons, and the show remains one of HBO’s most popular programs, so you can likely expect at least one more after season 3 as well.

When will House of the Dragon season 3 release?

While we don’t know anything official, it seems reasonable to expect House of the Dragon season 3 will arrive sometime in 2026. The gap between season 1 and season 2 was about two years, which would certainly suggest that we could see a similar gap between seasons 2 and 3. On top of that, HBO is supposed to release the new Game of Thrones spinoff A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms in late 2025, which should fill that year’s allotment of Westeros content.

Supporting this theory, creator and showrunner Ryan Condal said in a press conference after the season 2 finale that he and the writers are finishing up the scripts for season 3 right now. After that, Condal says, the team will start pre-production this fall, with full production beginning likely in spring 2025. This would also put the show on track for a summer 2026 release date.

What will House of the Dragon season 3 be about?

Without going into the book spoilers, House of the Dragon’s season 2-ending montage certainly gave us some big clues about the future of the series. For instance, we know that Daemon is back on Team Rhaenyra for real now, and we know that the pair of them — along with their newly anointed dragon riders — are setting off for King’s Landing in the hopes of taking it quickly via overwhelming force. Meanwhile, Team Green is all over the map. Alicent is committing treason, Aegon is hiding away with Larys, and Aemond is setting fire to anything in site. All of this while every non-Targaryen house in Westeros prepares for open war.

In other words, we’ve got the makings of a very exciting season 3.

Should I read the book House of the Dragon is based on in the meantime?

Sure, why not! On the one hand, reading the Dance of Dragons chapters in Fire & Blood will help you understand the broad strokes that House of the Dragon is going to hit pretty well. On the other, it also won’t give you too many spoilers, because the show is adding incredible amounts of detail to events the book only sketches out briefly. In other words, the book is basically like watching an extended trailer for the rest of the show, which — depending on your preferences — can be a great way to kill time between seasons.

What will the next Game of Thrones spinoff series be about?

The next HBO series set in Westeros will be A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, which follows the thrilling adventures of young Aegon V Targaryen, better known as Egg, and his trusted knight Ser Duncan the Tall. The series is based on several short stories from Martin which are a little bit closer to young adult fantasy than the rest of Game of Thrones, giving them a slightly lighter and more fun vibe.

The series is due out sometime in 2025, and HBO released the first short teaser after the House of the Dragon season 2 finale as part of a larger HBO 2025 sizzle reel.

Will Winds of Winter come out before House of the Dragon season 3?

Almost certainly not. And even if I did believe it might, I’d never jinx it by saying so out loud. For now, I’m going to continue to operate under the assumption that The Winds of Winter will probably not come out until hell freezes over, or the New York Jets (or much less likely, the Giants) win the Super Bowl, and so should you."

It took an entire season, but rogue king consort Daemon's (Matt Smith) extended trip (pun absolutely intended) at Harrenhal finally paid off in a big way in the House of the Dragon season 2 finale.

Not only did Queen Helaena (Phia Saban) appear to Daemon in his latest vision — which now confirms that she is a dragon dreamer, a very rare Targaryen with mystical, prophetic powers — to remind him of his place in this war and deflate his ego, motivating him to finally put an end to his temper tantrum power grab and return to his wife/niece/queen Rhaenyra's (Emma D'Arcy) side. He also saw the same prophecy that Aegon the Conqueror experienced ... including the arrival of his future descendant and Game of Thrones favorite, the one and only Daenerys Targaryen.

The vision (and the camera) only showed Daenerys from the back (Thrones alum Emilia Clarke's face is never seen, so it's hard to call this a true cameo), but it's the exact scene from the Thrones season 1 finale when she emerged from the fire with three hatched dragons. Daemon's vision also included seeing White Walkers marching in the North among other major Thrones moments, as well as important foreshadowing for what's potentially to come in House of the Dragon.

Below, season 2 finale director Geeta Vasant Patel explains to Entertainment Weekly how she — and the show — pulled off that major Thrones moment, and so much more.

ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Seeing Daenerys in Daemon's vision is such an exciting moment for the show as the most overt Game of Thrones connection yet. What was your reaction when you learned that was coming in your episode?

GEETA VASANT PATEL: I was excited because it's a moment where Daemon understands the future of what's to come, and that House of the Dragon connects to Game of Thrones. It was thrilling for me, as someone who's also a fan of the world of Game of Thrones, so it was very exciting to be able to connect the two time spaces.

Did you shoot any new footage for that vision montage?

Yes. All of that was footage that I shot. The way that the vision, as we call it, started I got the script, and [co-creator] Ryan [Condal] sat down with me and went through the beats that needed to be in that vision. Then he communicated what that vision should be... and what that vision was supposed to convey to Daemon, and that it was a moment that would convince Daemon to look outside of himself and help him realize that he's part of a bigger picture and, for the first time, perhaps convince Daemon to do what's for the better good of the world rather than what's good for himself and his ego.

That vision was important in that it actually had to make an argument without words. And the other thing that Ryan really wanted for that vision was he wanted it to be fragmented. He didn't want it to be linear, so I took the marching orders, sat down with a storyboard artist, and started trying to create this amorphous, fragmented, and yet powerful vision that would tell Daemon what he needed to do next. I found it to be an incredible challenge. I was so thrilled to be trusted with it. I knew that it was going to be difficult, and once I put the storyboards together, I showed it to Ryan, and we are both just super excited about it.

Since you shot new footage, was some of it CG or a stand-in, or was Emilia asked to make a cameo? How exactly did you pull that off?

I don't know about some of those things, because they were above my pay grade. The big thing that was exciting about the vision is that we had this gigantic soundstage, and the stage had different pieces of the vision set up on it, so it was like you had these mini shoots happening. We had the White Walkers, we had Daemon walking through the dead corpses that was supposed to signify the end of dragons, we had the Daenerys section where you have the dragons coming back, we had the eggs, we had the weirwood tree, so it was just amazing to walk onto that set. I thought production did such a great job of organizing how we were going to shoot everything very quickly.

This was one of those moments where you really feel the beauty of cinema. I put together these storyboards, then the storyboards goes to all the departments, so you've got costumes, you've got casting, you've got Jim Clay, our production designer, basically creating everything off of these storyboards. For example, I was saying, ""These roots to the tree, let's make them look like umbilical cords, as if this is your history, this is where you came from, Daemon."" Jim Clay brought it to life, and then they went to visual effects where they brought the roots to life so that they were palpating like an umbilical cord. All the different areas of filmmaking came together for that vision, and it truly was a vision. Lastly, of course, Catherine Goldschmidt, our brilliant cinematographer, made it all come together through light and shape.

This was one of the most rewarding and challenging moments of my career in television. When I got this vision on the script, it was pretty much bullet points of these visuals, and then it was a collaboration between Ryan and me and Sara Hess, our writer of the episode and executive producer, so it was just awesome to be able to take things one step further and sort of write the transitions of all these moments. I've never been able to do something like that with my job in television, and I'm quite honored that I had the opportunity. I loved every minute of it.

The finale ends with another big montage, setting the table for what's to come in season 3. There's a lot packed in there — it's almost like you had two entire, additional episodes crammed into the finale with both the vision montage and the ending montage. What was it like filming all those ending scenes?

That montage was quite daunting, to be honest, because I read the script and immediately recognized that there were so many beats in this montage and that it would be long. I was concerned that it would feel boring if executed incorrectly. Montages are very tricky, in my mind, because they can easily be long music videos that have nothing to say. I knew that Ryan and Sara had envisioned this montage to be thrilling, edge of your seat, and to culminate at the moment where Aegon [Tom Glynn-Carney] has escaped King's Landing. What's great about the way that they had built this montage was that there was a story beat that allowed the montage to move the suspense further — if you took the montage out of the episode, it wouldn't work because there was something vital in that montage that we needed for the story. We just need to work on the pacing and the connection of all the pieces.

Each of those pieces, of course, were shot in different locations, different countries, and a collaboration with visual effects. It's an exciting thing to be working with the troops marching. It's just something that makes your heart race, because it's iconic of Game of Thrones, House of the Dragon, and George R.R. Martin's world. It's easy for me to get lost in that. Catherine Goldschmidt, the DP, worked really hard to make sure that every frame that we shot had some connective tissue that was leading us to Aegon leaving and him countering the forward progression of this war.

Because if you go back, Rhaenyra and Alicent [Olivia Cooke] had this scene together where Rhaenyra says to Alicent, ""You've never given anything up. You've never sacrificed anything,"" and that's the theme of this season, in my mind. Ryan Condal had [previously] written something to the effect of, ""You must sacrifice for duty,"" and so I took that in the season finale and tried to embed it into as much of our filmmaking as possible to echo and bookend the beginning of this series. In this moment, Rhaenyra challenges Alicent to do just that: Make her sacrifice. And she does. She gives up her son.

So now we think, ""These two women are friends. They're going to collaborate. We're going to stop the war."" And then the montage culminates with Aegon having left. Everything could possibly be spoiled, because the one thing that Alicent gave up is, of course, no longer going to be valid. Will Rhaenyra believe Alicent if Alicent tells her, ""I didn't know [Aegon was leaving]?""

There was a quick shot of Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans) looking like a captive in the montage, whom we hadn't seen in a while this season. What was it like adding in that shocking reveal?

It was fun. I am a fan in that moment, because first of all, I love working with Rhys. He's such a brilliant actor. I wish I had lines with him, but I also don't know where he is, so it's exciting for me too.

We also finally see a quick shot of Rhaena (Phoebe Campbell) finding and facing off against the wild dragon. What was it like directing that moment?

That was beautiful to direct, because when I first got the script, I saw all these scenes of Rhaena chasing the dragon and looking for the dragon, and I had to figure out how to make sure it was visually distinct each time we saw her. Ryan and I put our heads together and were trying to figure out how to bring it into the montage when she found the dragon, and yet we wanted to make sure that it didn't step on the foot of the Aegon leaving moment, so that was a really interesting part of structuring the Rhaena beats throughout the episode.

We shot it in Wales and in the U.K. I remember it took a long time to find a location that was exactly right. It had all this texture and different levels of light, and then, of course, the day that we were shooting there was torrential downpour, and you couldn't see anything. [Laughs] We all had really expensive waterproof clothing, and it turned out nothing was waterproof that we had bought. We were all soaked to the bone, but it was one of my favorite days of shooting in my career. There's something beautiful about everyone just letting go and being in this pouring rain. I mean, we had so many technical issues. Cameras weren't working. It was just exactly what I thought it was going to be like when I got this job three years ago. I thought we were going to be up on a mountain, so it was quite romantic to me. When Phoebe ran up that hill and saw the dragon, it was perfect. It felt exactly right.

I also found myself putting myself into Rhaena's shoes quite a bit. I'd worked so hard to work on this show. I had a really hard time getting into this profession, and I had a hard time staying in this profession. All I wanted was to work on this show — at the time, it was Game of Thrones, and I spent seven years trying to get the experience and check all the boxes to even be qualified for the show. Along the way, so many people laughed and said, ""There's no way this is going to happen. You know this is not possible,"" and I kept going because I wanted to do it so badly, and it finally happened and it was magical for me.

So when Rhaena was running, that's exactly the story that I shared with the crew. When I was trying to explain the tone and the feeling, I said, ""It's that thing everyone's telling you that you don't deserve and you can't do, and you'll never get there, it'll never happen, and you run as if your life is counting on it. You run with everything you have, and it happens.""

Just one more Daenerys question, and I promise that's it: You previously said that the dragon eggs we saw in the other episode you directed this season were the same ones Daenerys gets in Game of Thrones. But then Ryan Condal later said that the eggs are not the same ones she ends up hatching. What did you think of his clarification?

I don't really know. I think it's just fun to speculate that. What if they are? What if they're not? I have no idea. That's all in Ryan's head. Only Ryan holds the keys to that.

"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://www.techradar.com/streaming/hbo-max/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-ending-explained,"Full spoilers follow for House of the Dragon season 2's final episode and 'Fire and Blood', the book it's based on.

House of the Dragon season 2's finale is out now – and, while it doesn't have the shock factor of its predecessor's final episode, it's an engrossing watch that sets up plenty of fascinating story beats heading into its third season.

With the dust settling on another season of suspense-filled politicking, familial backstabbing, fiery action, and the occasional spooky moment, we suspect you have many burning questions about House of the Dragon's latest chapter. Below, I'll aim to answer them as best as I can, without spoiling any significant plot points for what's to come in the Game of Thrones prequel show's next outing.

This is your final warning: major spoilers follow for House of the Dragon season 2 episode 8 on Max (US), Sky/Now TV (UK), and Binge/Foxtel (Australia). Proceed at your own risk.

House of the Dragon season 2 ending explained: who is the current ruler of the Seven Kingdoms?

Aemond continues to temporarily reign supreme in House of the Dragon (Image credit: Theo Whiteman/HBO)

Currently, no one. Well, technically it's Prince Regent Aemond Targaryen. He's ruled in his brother Aegon Targaryen II's stead while the latter recovers from his life-altering injuries – injuries inflicted by Aemond and his dragon Vhagar in season 2 episode 4, remember – so I suppose he's still lauding it over the Seven Kingdoms as season 2 ends.

But the winds of change are approaching King's Landing. In the season 2 finale, Alicent Hightower secretly travels to Dragonstone to seek an audience with Rhaenyra Targaryen to put an end to the growing Targaryen Civil War. It's an enthralling role-reversal of what happened in episode 3, which saw Rhaenyra infiltrate the Red Keep to convince Alicent to do likewise, only for the latter to rebuff the former's pleas.

Anyway, after a lengthy tête-à-tête, it seems nailed on that Rhaenyra will finally become Queen of the Seven Kingdoms before season 2 ends. Not only does she have more dragons (and dragonriders) at her disposal to forcefully take the throne, but Alicent also tells her she won't actually need to. The reason? Aemond and Vhagar are about to leave King's Landing to join Ser Criston Cole's army in the Riverlands, thereby leaving the Iron Throne unguarded. All Rhaenyra has to do is wait three days for Aemond to depart and then rock up to King's Landing to take what is rightfully hers.

Alicent's secret meeting with Rhaenyra in the season 2 finale mirrors this similarly covert encounter in episode 3 (Image credit: Ollie Upton/HBO)

Alicent won't stand in her way, either, with the Queen Dowager – who's tired of being a political prisoner with no authority – revealing that she plans to leave King's Landing, with her daughter Halaena and the latter's youngest child Jaehaera in tow, for pastures unknown.

But there's a slight wrinkle in Alicent's seemingly sound plan. Her son Aegon II is still alive and, while he continues to breathe, he won't relinquish control of the Iron Throne without a fight. Rhaenyra knows this, so she tells Alicent that the only way that she can assume the throne is if Aegon is unceremoniously bumped off. Reminding Alicent of Lucerys' tragic death at Aemon and Vhagar's hands in the season 1 finale, Rhaenyra convinces a reluctant and emotionally torn Alicent that Aegon must die if this plan is to succeed.

With a verbal agreement reached by Westeros' two most powerful women, Alicent leaves her former bestie and, before departing Dragonstone, somberly looks out onto a sunset from one of the island's many cliff faces. Meanwhile, Rhaenyra raises a wry smile to herself as she looks out of one of Dragonstone's sunlit windows; her long-held ambition to finally (and rightfully) rule Westeros appearing to be in her grasp.

House of the Dragon season 2 ending explained: what happens to Alicent and Helaena?

Helaena, her mother, and her youngest child will have fled King's Landing by the start of season 3 (Image credit: Ollie Upton/HBO)

As I mentioned above, the pair plan to discreetly flee the Red Keep after Aemond departs for the Riverlands, although whether they'll succeed in that endeavor is up for debate.

It's highly likely that Alicent, Helaena, and Jaehaera will escape, though, despite what happens in 'Fire and Blood'. In acclaimed author George R.R. Martin's source material, Helaena is actually taken captive by Rhaenyra after she storms the Red Keep and seizes the Iron Throne. Alicent, meanwhile, is allowed to live as she was Rhaenyra's former best friend, not to mention she's also the second wife of Rhaenyra's father King Viserys I, and, by virtue of Alicent's marriage to Rhaenyra's dad, Rhaenyra's stepmother. Man, talk about a tricky relationship to navigate before the duo's proper falling out.

But I digress. It appears that House of the Dragon, aka one of the best Max shows, will deviate somewhat from what happens in 'Fire and Blood', then, if Alicent and Helaena are allowed to vanish into the night. Martin's literary works doen't explicitly say where Alicent goes after Rhaenyra takes King's Landing by force, either, so I can't comment on where she and Helaena will find their next place to call home. If I had to guess, I imagine they'll head for Oldtown, the seat of House Hightower.

House of the Dragon season 2 ending explained: where are Aegon and Larys going?

Unfortunately for Alicent, her plan may not be wholly successful after all. Indeed, while she agrees to let Rhaenyra take Aegon II's life before ascending the Iron Throne, Alicent doesn't know that Aegon II has also fled the Red Keep. He's coaxed into leaving for Essos by Larys Strong; the latter telling the disfigured Aegon II that, while he lives, he's a threat to his spiteful brother Aemond's reign as Prince Regent – and Aemond won't think twice about finishing the job and killin Aegon II if he presents a threat to Aemond's own desire to rule.

Manipulating the situation further, Larys strokes Aegon II's ego by suggesting that the pair leave for Essos and, once Rhaenyra and Aemond's bloody war is over, Aegon II can triumphantly return to unite the small folk, overthrow whoever the victor is, and take back his position as Westeros' ruler. It's the planting of this ambition-laced seed that convinces Aegon II to flee with Larys; the duo being seen covertly riding in a horse-drawn carriage in season 2 episode 8's final montage.

House of the Dragon season 2 ending explained: what does Daemon see in his Harrenhal Godswood vision?

It looks like Daemon is finally prepared to play second fiddle to Rhaenyra (Image credit: Ollie Upton/HBO)

Before Alicent privately meets with Rhaenyra, the latter has another headache to contend with as she tries to fulfil her ambition of sitting on the Iron Throne. Daemon Targaryen, her hot-headed uncle and husband, who she banished after the blood-curling events seen in season 2 episode 1, has earned the trust of many of the Riverlands' Houses. With a substantial army at his beck and call, not to mention his own dragon Caraxes, Daemon has the strength to make a play for the throne himself. When word reaches Rhaenyra through Ser Simon Strong, she and Addam of Hull ride to Harrenhal (where Daemon is based) to find out if he's still on her side, or if he'll become the third, unpredictable player in the Targaryen Civil War.

As it happens, Rhaenyra has nothing to worry about. Daemon recommits his fealty to Westeros' one true Queen, with his thousands-strong army doing likewise. Well, apart form Ser Alfred Broome, one of Rhaenyra's council members, who skulks off to whereabouts unknown after failing to convince Daemon to usurp Rhaenyra and lead the assault on King's Landing instead.

So, what brought about Daemon's change of heart? It's all down to the Weirwood tree vision he had after he was taken to Harrenhal's Godswood by the Seer known as Alys Rivers. Placing his hand on the tree's bloody trunk, Daemon has sizzle reel-like visions of events yet to play out in Westeros, some of which are clear references to what happens in Game of Thrones' eight seasons (see if you agree with our best Game of Thrones seasons ranked piece while you're here). Here's a quick rundown of everything he sees:

A young Targaryen person, complete with a big birthmark on their left cheek, sitting on a white wooden throne whose arm rests are wrapped around theirs. This might be a reference to Brynden Rivers, who is believed to be the Three-Eyed Raven that passes this mantle onto Bran Stark in Game of Thrones season 6

The Three-Eyed Raven. A clear nod to the aforementioned duo

The Night King and his undead army of White Walkers, as seen through the eyes of a Dire wolf

Numerous dead dragons and countless deceased soldiers on a battlefield. A reference to the Dance of the Dragons and/or the White Walker-based events seen in Game of Thrones seasons 7 and 8

Daemon drowning, which is an obvious nod to his death in 'Fire and Blood'

Three dragon eggs surrounded by fire, and then a naked woman sitting on a scorched patch of earth with three baby dragons on her shoulders. A clear reference to Daenerys Targaryen and her dragon children Drogon, Viserion, and Rhaegal

Rhaenyra sitting on the Iron Throne

Helaena, a Seer like Alys, suddenly appearing and telling Daemon: ""It's all a story, and you are but one part of it. You know your part""

Clearly, all of the above is enough to prove to Daemon that he'll never sit on the throne himself, and his role is to be Rhaenyra's staunchest ally. Let's hope he doesn't deviate from his mission in season 3 and beyond.

House of the Dragon season 2 ending explained: which dragon does Rhaena find in the Vale?

Rhaena should have tamed Sheepstealer by the time we see her again in season 3 (Image credit: HBO)

That'll be Sheepstealer, one of two dragons that, until the season 2 finale, we were yet to see in House of the Dragon. The only one who hasn't been brought to life on the screen now is Dreamfyre, Helaena's fire-breathing winged beast.

Incidentally, Rhaena's successful quest to find Sheepstealer retcons a fan-favorite character's story from 'Fire and Blood'. In the source material, a girl who simply goes by the nickname 'Nettles', a lowborn individual like Hugh Hammer and Ulf the White, tames Sheepstealer and becomes another of Rhaenyra's new dragonriders.

With Rhaena locating Sheepstealer and potentially forming a bond with it – season 2 episode 8 ends without a resolution to this subplot – we won't see 'Nettles' make her debut in House of the Dragon on Max, aka one of the world's best streaming services. It appears, then, that either the character of 'Nettles' has been folded into Rhaena's character arc, or Martin and fellow co-showrunner Ryan Condal are now suggesting that Rhaena is 'Nettles', which would alter a big part of House of the Dragon's literary lore.

House of the Dragon season 2 ending explained: is there a mid- or post-credits scene?

We didn't have Ser Criston turning into a nihilist on our season 2 bingo card (Image credit: Theo Whiteman/HBO)

Nope. House of the Dragon season 2 ends without a mid-credits scene or post-credits stinger. That was the case in season 1, too, and all eight seasons of Game of Thrones, so I wasn't expecting a mid- or post-credits sequence.

House of the Dragon season 2 ending explained: is a third season in development?

I wonder if Corlys will continue to be awarded the 'worst father of the year' award in future seasons... (Image credit: Ollie Upton/HBO)

Yes. As I alluded to in the early parts of this piece, a third season is already in development. House of the Dragon season 3 was confirmed by HBO on June 13, just three days before season 2 premiered worldwide.

How long we'll have to wait for season 3 to arrive is unclear. Speaking to TechRadar ahead of House of the Dragon season 2's release in early June, Condal told me that he and his fellow scribes were ""writing season three right now"", but wouldn't elaborate on how much script work had been completed.

My prediction is that season 3's screenplays will be penned before 2024 ends ahead of a 2025 production start date. If all goes well – and it should, providing there are no issues that shut down production, like the 2023 Hollywood strikes – I firmly believe that we'll see House of the Dragon's third chapter sometime in 2026.

House of the Dragon season 2 ending explained: what happens now?

That would be spoiling way too much, dear reader! If you really want to know, you can read 'Fire and Blood' and/or look for spoiler-filled details online.

For now, all I'll say is that Rhaenyra seems primed to finally sit on the Iron Throne, and that there should be some large-scale battles (much bigger than The Battle of Rook's Rest that formed part of season 2 episode 4, FYI) to look forward to. Hey, episode 8's pre-credits montage wouldn't have featured so much armies-on-the-move footage if it wasn't leading to something significant. Oh, and let's not forget that there'll be plenty more uneasy alliances, betrayals, shockingly gruesome incidents, and other high-fantasy melodrama to enjoy in season 3. And now the long wait for its arrival begins...

"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://www.thewrap.com/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-8-ending-explained/,"Note: The following story contains spoilers from “House of the Dragon” Season 2 Episode 8.

“House of the Dragon” Season 2 came to a close with an unexpected plea for peace that arrived just a bit too late.

The jam-packed finale saw forces being mustered across Westeros to begin the journey to converge on King’s Landing for a fight for the throne. Much of the season saw both Team Black and Team Green vying for alliances and now the board is set for a bloody war to come in Season 3.

Aemond (Ewan Mitchell) grew increasingly erratic knowing that Rhaenyra (Emma D’Arcy) just loaded her roster with three new dragonriders, and set to burning random towns across the kingdom. Alicent (Olivia Cooke) had enough and spent the episode gathering the courage to sneak into Dragonstone to speak with her old friend and pitch peace.

Meanwhile, Daemon’s (Matt Smith) season-long vision quest at Harrenhal wrapped up with allusions to “Game of Thrones” and him finally bending the knee in earnest to Rhaenyra.

Here’s everything you need to know about the “House of the Dragon” Season 2 finale.

How did “House of the Dragon” Season 2 end?

The realm has been at war for the entirety of “House of the Dragon” Season 2, but things reached a new intensity by the finale’s conclusion. Skirmishes like The Battle of the Burning Mill and The Battle at Rook’s Rest have only intensified both side’s need to muster a larger fighting force. It’s that increased bloodshed and chaos that prompted Alicent to sneak off to Dragonstone to make her plea to Rhaenyra.

Mirroring Rhaenyra’s own secret trip to King’s Landing in Episode 3, Alicent shocks her old friend and pitches a way to end the Dance. It seems her nature walk in Episode 7 — not to mention seeing Aemond grow erratic to the point of burning towns — has finally pushed her to the breaking point.

Her plan was almost as straightforward as it comes: Aemond was set to rally with Criston Cole (Fabian Frankel) in the Riverlands to take Harrenhal from Daemon (Matt Smith), and when that happens Helaena (Phia Saban) and Alicent would be calling the shots in King’s Landing — the perfect time to ensure that Rhaenyra can stroll up and claim the throne unhindered and hopefully end the war.

Rhaenyra was open to the idea but knows it won’t work unless she can “put an end to the opposition.” She told Alicent the only way she’ll be accepted as ruler is if she kills Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney) — which might be a mercy if you ask the king. She also still wants her son for a son debt paid for Luke’s death in Season 1.

After a long, teary moment Alicent silently nods in agreement that Aegon will die. Rhaenyra comments that Alicent is “much changed,” which the dowager queen ignores and says to fly to King’s Landing in three days or to just kill her there and be done with it.

“I cast myself at the mercy of a friend who once loved me,” she tells Rhaenyra.

“History will paint you a villain. A cold queen grasping at power and then defeated,” Rhaenyra responded possibly in a meta sense as this conversation never happens in “Fire & Blood,” and Alicent’s character in general is written as much harsher in the book histories.

“Let them think what they must,” Alicent said, almost as her own wink to book fans familiar with the character. “I am at last myself, with no ambition greater than to walk where I please and breath the open air. To die unremarked or noticed, and be free.”

She’s then allowed to leave Dragonstone with her deal in place — a sacrificed son and throne for a realm at peace — unknowing that Westeros is on the razor’s edge. The final montage showed the many armies that have been gathered throughout the season: Daemon in the Riverlands, the Starks from the North, the Lannisters from the West, the Triarchy from across the Narrow Sea, and the Hightowers — with their own dragon and dragonrider in tow — all converging on King’s Landing. All this is happening while Aegon and Larys Strong (Matthew Needham) are sneaking out of the capital together. The montage also opened up a new mystery with Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans), who was briefly seen sitting in a jail cell, which would explain his absence since he departed for Oldtown. And of course, Rhaena (Phoebe Campbell) finally found Sheepstealer. But will she claim the dragon for herself?

For now, Alicent has made her play for peace. But the season ends with a near promise that it’s too little too late.

Daemon sees the Ice and Fire Prophecy

Aside from the ending itself, the other major talking point of the finale is likely Daemon actually seeing the Ice and Fire prophecy that obsessed Viserys for much of his life.

Alys (Gayle Rankin) takes him to the godswoods in Harrenhal and has him place his hand on the weirwood tree there. He’s instantly given what is likely the last of his season-long vision quest and it’s a doozy. It’s been no secret that the Ice and Fire prophecy is just the story we see play out in “Game of Thrones,” but these quick cuts give us glimpses of a future we already know.

He sees a shot of Daenerys Targaryen (though we don’t see Emilia Clarke’s face) sitting with her three newly hatched dragons, which is the final shot from Season 1 of “Game of Thrones.” Daemon also sees the Night King and white walkers emerging from the woods.

He also sees images of the red comet that streaks across the sky during the Season 2 premiere of “Game of Thrones.” The meaning of the comet has been debated by fans for years: Was it heralding the return of dragons to the world, was it signifying that magic had finally gained a foothold, or maybe it was the Lord of Light signifying the Prince Who Was Promised prophecy was at hand?

“In the streets, they call it the Red Messenger,” Varys tells Tyrion in “A Clash of Kings.” “They say it comes as a herald before a king, to warn of fire and blood to follow.”

Needless to say, the vision prompts Daemon to stop vying for the crown himself and bend the knee to Rhaenyra thanks to his misinterpretations of Dany being her on the throne. Ooops.

Who are The Triarchy?

A not insignificant portion of the finale was dedicated to Tyland Lannister’s (Jefferson Hall) attempts to convince The Triarchy to join Team Green and help break the blockade at The Gullet. He mostly wins the affection and admiration of one of their leaders Sharako Lohar (Abigail Thorn) thanks to his tenacity in a mud wrestling pit. But who are The Triarchy and why are they familiar?

The Triarchy is an alliance of three Free Cities across the Narrow Sea: Lys, Myr, and Tyrosh. In the first season, Corlys (Steve Toussaint) and Daemon fought tirelessly with the Triarchy in the War for the Stepstones. They also confronted one of the major players for the group called The Crabfeeder. Daemon killed him in the first season.

After losing the Stepstones, they regrouped years later in an alliance with Dorne and have since been harrying the region. Tyland’s plea for an alliance in the finale came at the price of once again offering up the Stepstones to the group.

Who was that blue dragon?

The final montage of the episode includes a shot of men carrying Hightower banners and then a blue dragon flying overhead on their way to King’s Landing. That blue dragon is Tessarion and his rider is the missing fourth child of Viserys and Alicent — Daeron Targaryen.

After not appearing at all in the first season aside his siblings Aegon, Aemond and Helaena, many book readers were wondering if Daeron might have been omitted from the show despite having a part to play in the later war. Thankfully, we learned early this season that Daeron was studying in Oldtown with his Hightower family and bonding with his growing dragon Tessarion.

It seems he’s finally getting up off the bench officially in Season 3, though no actor has been cast yet in the role.

HBO Sunday nights are something of a cultural phenomenon, with the network dropping fan favorites like The Last of Us and The White Lotus during this time slot to help cure those good ol’ Sunday scaries. And in this regard, perhaps no TV show has been as influential as Game of Thrones, which saw disgruntled fans live-reacting its eighth and final season in real time, leaving an endless pit of Twitter memes and online discourse in its wake. Now, it seems its spinoff, House of the Dragon, is following suit.

Despite its first season garnering near-universal acclaim back in 2022, many viewers believe that House of the Dragon has struggled to recapture the same magic as its predecessor in its sophomore run—and a lot of that criticism stems from its finale, “The Queen Who Ever Was.”

Warning! Spoilers ahead for all episodes of House of the Dragon season 2.

So, about that House of the Dragon season 2 finale …

Could this have been an email? Well, fans certainly seem to think so, because last night’s House of the Dragon episode offered a whole lot of setup … only for nothing to pay off, really. Bafflingly enough, season 2, episode 8 currently sits at a 47% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a score of 6.6 on IMBd—one of the lowest-rated season finales in franchise history. You can guess which one snagged the number one spot.

We all watched a 70 minute trailer for season 3 of House of the dragons #HouseOfTheDragons2ep8 #HouseOfTheDragon pic.twitter.com/ql6sPstDdf — Thoughts Of A Viewer (@WeTalkingtv) August 5, 2024

So is it really that bad? Picking up immediately after the events of episode 7, the episode kicks things off by hanging out with Tyland Lannister (Jefferson Hall), an ambassador sent by Prince Regent Aemond (Ewan Mitchell) to Essos to gain the favor of The Triarchy and raise swords for Team Green. It’s an odd way to get things going, and ends in Tyland mud-wresting Commander Sharako Lohar (Abigail Thorn) and being … invited to an orgy, I guess? Ultimately, we see Lohar and Tyland sailing off to war, presumably to break the blockade that’s leaving the commonfolk of King’s Landing hungry—and furious.

Back at Dragonstone, Rhaenyra (Emma D’Arcy) trains her new riders: Hugh Hammer (Kieran Bew), Addam of Hull (Clinton Liberty), and Ulf the White (Tom Bennett), the latter of whom has a serious ego problem. This doesn’t exactly fly well with Rhaenyra and her son Jacaerys (Harry Collett). While they’re not quite ready to take to the skies, back at the Red Keep, word is spreading of The Black Queen’s new dragons. Aemond, fully aware of the disadvantage this gives him, tries to recruit his sister Helaena (Phia Saban) to ride Dreamfyre into battle, but my girl’s a lover, not a fighter.

Meanwhile, after who knows how many “I see dead people” hallucinations, Daemon (Matt Smith) has a real “come to Jesus” moment at Harrenhal thanks to Alys Rivers (Gayle Rankin). The witch gives him the ability to look into the future, not unlike Luke going into the dark side cave on Dagobah in The Empire Strikes Back. It’s a cautionary tale warning for Daemon to get his s*** together and accept his destiny, which is by Rhaenyra’s side. His lofty ambitions to betray his wife and become king will only backfire if this prophecy is anything to go by. Rhaenyra Ubers over to the Riverlands to ensure her husband’s loyalty, and it’s here that he finally rouses his troops to war—“No mercy!” They kiss and make up.

And where do we find our fave queen dowager? Alicent (Olivia Cooke), reeling in the aftershocks of anti-feminism, decides to pull an Uno reverse card and sail to Dragonstone. Here, she makes a deal: Rhaenyra can fly to King’s Landing and reclaim the Iron Throne by killing Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney). All she wishes in return is to “leave it all behind.” You see, Alicent has had a change in heart and doesn’t want to rule. Instead, she wants to honor her late husband by seeing his chosen successor wear the crown. But is it too little, too late? In the end, we don’t see any fighting. All season, the dominoes have been set to fall, but the “Dance of the Dragons” is still, much to some viewers’ disappointment, very much on the brink.

Suffice it to say, House of the Dragon season 2 has left fans with more questions than answers, as nothing was really resolved. Does Rhaena (Phoebe Campbell) claim Sheepstealer? Are we seriously going to have to wait two years to see Ser Criston Cole (Fabien Frankel) take to the battlefield in season 3? And what of Rhaenyra’s role in the Song of Ice and Fire prophecy?

What’s in store for House of the Dragon season 3?

Although we don’t have an official release window yet, it’s safe to assume that the third season of House of the Dragon will land on HBO and Max sometime in 2026. This means that we’ll just have to wait patiently to see how things pan out—and if all this setup was worth it. We now know that the series will end with season 4, so expectations are even higher for the penultimate batch of episodes to deliver.

I feel like this has been the year of prestige series going into defense mode (i.e. House of the Dragon, The Boys) after some truly impressive debuts, setting up future storylines in a scramble for ensured studio survival. Is this a side effect of the 2023 Hollywood strikes? Or simply the result of an ever-shifting TV landscape? It’s hard to say, but I feel like showrunners Ryan Condal and Miguel Sapochnik really have to bring their A-game in House of the Dragon season 3.

Personally, I don’t mind slower, more methodical storytelling. However, I think this approach is best reserved for later seasons. House of the Dragon really jumped the gun by giving audiences a lot to keep up with in season 1, from Rhaenyra being named Viserys’ (Paddy Considine) heir to her eventual fallout with Alicent and that, ahem, killer season finale, which ended with Rhaenyra vowing to take “a son for a son.” Of course, the show does have George R.R. Martin’s Fire & Blood to use as a reference point, and maybe its sluggish pacing is simply a byproduct of adapting the novel. Either way, it’s still wildly entertaining, but in comparison, it’s not nearly as action-packed as season 1.

In the end, House of the Dragon is a masterclass in TV writing despite its shortcomings. Even in its slower moments, it’s still a captivating look into this vast world, and its characters are troubled, messy, and complex enough to be compelling in their own right—so maybe it’s for the best that we wait until season 3 to see more battle and bloodshed. We’ve certainly met some interesting new faces this season, who will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in what’s to come. All I hope is that what’s next to come is the very thing we’ve been waiting for: the Dance of the Dragons and all-out war.

"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://www.theringer.com/house-of-the-dragon/2024/8/4/24213362/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-8-finale-recap,"Exactly two months ago, before the start of Season 2 of House of the Dragon, I predicted that this season of television would resemble Game of Thrones at its best. Season 2 would have more battles, a larger cast of characters, and a smoother timeline than Season 1—all of which would allow the prequel to level up closer to the monocultural phenomenon that was peak Thrones.

That prediction proved mostly correct. Dragon Season 2 was a true television triumph, with three particular highlights: Rhaenyra’s surreptitious conversation with Alicent in the Grand Sept, the battle at Rook’s Rest, and the Red Sowing. It even followed Thrones’ general tradition of following up spectacle-laden penultimate episodes with more muted finales.

But in Dragon’s case, that quieter finale proved to be more of a letdown than a compelling capstone. Episode 8 didn’t take away from the season’s earlier splendor, but Dragon Season 2 ends with a whimper, not a bang.

The finale’s problems start with an overarching structural issue: Season 2 was only eight episodes long, instead of extending to the 10 hours of Season 1. This was a bad omen from the beginning—shortening seasons has harmed Thrones properties before—especially because it was an executive decision rather than a creative one. Writer Sara Hess told Entertainment Weekly in May, “It wasn’t really our choice.”

The result was an abrupt end that blunted a season’s worth of momentum toward a battle. Consider the closing moments, as Westeros prepares for further, larger-scale war. In a vacuum, this is a strong montage: Rhaenyra’s new dragonriders are fitted for armor; the Hightowers, Starks, and Lannisters all lead marching armies (the recognizable house themes for the Starks and Lannisters blend into the montage score, which is a nice touch), while the Velaryons and Triarchy contribute new ships to the cause; and two new dragons—Tessarion, with the Hightowers, and Sheepstealer, in the Vale—appear for the first time.

This montage sets the scene—but that’s the goal of a midseason episode, not the conclusion of a season before a long break. “We must strike while we have the advantage and end this war,” Rhaenyra tells her new dragonriders in Episode 8. “You will fly in two days’ time.”

But for audiences, that wait will be more like two years’ time, if Dragon is gone as long between Seasons 2 and 3 as it was between Seasons 1 and 2. That’s to be expected, given the amount of CGI required to animate this dragon-heavy show. (In the meantime, the next Thrones spinoff, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, is slated to reach screens in 2025.)

Dragon spends almost all season previewing the coming melee in the Riverlands. Characters on both sides of the war stress the strategic importance of Harrenhal, then recruit allies to converge on the area—but that promise receives no payoff within the season. In Season 2, as Rhaenyra says, “blood has been shed, cities burned,” but not at the scale teased by the show.

Or, put another way: Season 1 ended with a continent on the brink of war, and Season 2 ends with … a continent on the brink of more war. But returns diminish when every season ending rhymes with the last one.

I won’t go as far as Aegon in this episode and ask, “What was the fucking point of all this?” but I will label this ending an unfulfilling cliff-hanger. The delay is reminiscent of a sore spot from the Thrones books, as George R.R. Martin needed to move the so-called battles of fire (in Meereen) and ice (outside Winterfell) from the fifth book to the still-unpublished sixth because he’d run out of space in the former.

Moreover, although the season finale included some touching moments, it also suffered from a bizarre distribution of screen time. The episode devotes excessive attention to Tyland Lannister’s recruitment of the Triarchy (four scenes in the finale) and Rhaena’s run through the Vale in search of a dragon (four more scenes).

This focus on more peripheral characters comes at the expense of regulars such as Otto Hightower (now mysteriously imprisoned) and Criston Cole, who doesn’t appear at all in Episode 7 and receives just one scene in Episode 8. (At least Dragon puts that brief time to good use: Criston aptly summarizes the themes of the show when he muses, “The dragons dance, and men are like dust under their feet.”)

The finale does give plenty of attention to Daemon, as his Alys-induced hallucinations reach their zenith with a trip to Harrenhal’s godswood. But here, the episode’s largest potential problem emerges. Daemon sees a number of images in this vision: a three-eyed raven, a dragon corpse, Rhaenyra seated on the Iron Throne. But most relevant to viewers is a series of familiar sights and sounds: a White Walker leading the army of the dead, eggs in a fire, and distant descendent Daenerys Targaryen hatching three dragons. Daemon even says, “Winter is coming” in High Valyrian when Rhaenyra arrives at Harrenhal.

This montage goes beyond sly Easter eggs and rings alarm bells for two main reasons. First, the overt reminders of Walkers and Daenerys connect Dragon to some of the worst, most reviled parts of Thrones (the Walkers’ underwhelming demise and Daenerys’s turn in “The Bells”).

While attempts to rehabilitate down moments in a franchise, if that’s what Dragon showrunner Ryan Condal is trying to do, can succeed—Avengers: Endgame successfully incorporates Thor: The Dark World—this choice carries immense risk. We don’t want all Thrones stories to end up like modern Star Wars content, stuck explaining the “how” in The Rise of Skywalker’s infamous “somehow, Palpatine returned.”

I wonder if, in seeming to make the prequel so subordinate to the original Thrones, Dragon’s writers are underestimating the appeal of their own show. In my view, Dragon is sufficiently strong enough on its own that it doesn’t need to tightly grab onto Thrones’ coattails to generate audience excitement. But these sorts of connections to Thrones have been built into Dragon ever since the introduction of Aegon the Conqueror’s prophecy in the pilot—when the creators didn’t know their show would become a smash hit and therefore might have felt more of a need for such explicit links.

The second issue with this sequence is that it—along with other moments from the finale—raises the broader question of whether the characters in this story have free will. “All your life, you have sought to command your own fate,” Alys tells Daemon before showing him this weirwood vision. But is the converse true: that fate commands Daemon?

Another exchange in this episode seems to affirm this theory. When Helaena reveals she knows that Aemond burned Aegon at Rook’s Rest, then prophesies the prince regent’s death, Aemond seethes, “I could have you killed.” But Helaena, unmoved, responds, “It wouldn’t change anything.”

That’s a different sort of predestination from the kind other characters express in this episode. When Rhaenyra tells Alicent, “My part is here, whether I will or no. It was decided for me long ago,” she is almost wistfully reflecting on how she’s long felt forced on her path to the Iron Throne because of her birth. That dynamic can make for a strong arc, full of tricky choices about whether to pursue desires (Criston and a trip to Essos?) or duty. But if nobody’s choices matter because the story’s ultimate outcome is already locked in, then the individual and narrative dramas lose much of their luster.

If this review of the Season 2 finale seems excessively harsh, that’s perhaps because the rest of the season raised Dragon’s bar so high. Without the additional weight of Season 1’s time jumps and throat-clearing, and with a more consistent cast and tighter timeline, Season 2 had a higher ceiling and floor; it presented spectacular set pieces, executed shocking moments from the source text, and added some new adaptive flavors of its own. Even this finale is a fine episode of television by itself; it’s only in comparison to its recent predecessors, and in its placement as a season conclusion, that the episode disappoints relative to expectations.

And through two seasons now, House of the Dragon is mapping the rough trajectory of Thrones, which followed a thrilling Season 1 with a more expansive Season 2, complete with intriguing new characters (such as Davos and Melisandre on the one hand and Ulf and Alys on the other), new places, and new drama. After Season 2, of course, Thrones ratcheted up its quality even more, leading to a tremendous run in Seasons 3 and 4.

It remains to be seen whether Dragon will keep charting that course, but the glass-half-full view of an ending with too much buildup and not enough action is that the climax has to come eventually. From that perspective, Season 3 might be even more like Thrones at its best.

Although the episode, titled 'The Queen Who Ever Was', keeps it light on the action and dragon fighting (we’re sure they’re saving that for season 3) there were a lot of moving parts on both sides Team Green and Team Black to keep up with, that all lead to yet another cliffhanger, leaving us absolutely desperate for the next installment.

So, what just happened in the season 2 finale? And how does it set up House of the Dragon season 3? Well, we already know that the next season is on its way , and from what happened this season we expect the third installment to be packed with war as Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen edges her way to the Iron Throne. But the season 2 finale plays a major part in what is to come, as in just one episode we saw alliances change, armies claimed, and yet another dragon tamed, which will all have major effects when swords are drawn next season.

But before we get into how this episode really sets the show up for war, let's dive into everything that happened. We’ll start with a recap of the episode and then get into the final details later. Are you ready? Let’s go.

Warning, major spoilers for House of the Dragon season 2 episode 8 follow, so make sure you are all caught up before reading on.

What happened in the House of the Dragon season 2 finale?

(Image credit: HBO)

The episode opens in true Game of Thrones franchise style, with a bunch of characters we haven't met before. In search of further swords for his Prince regent Aemond Targaryen, a member of the small council Ser Tyland Lannister ventured to another kingdom named Essos and through proving his worth by fighting a female captain, he managed to convince them to lend The Greens their armies in return for The Step Stones.

Things were just as bleak at Kings Landing as Larys Strong tried to convince a heavily wounded King Aegon to run away with him before Aemond kills him. Aegon first refuses but later in the episode, we see him feeling in a carriage with Larys. At the other side of the castle, Alicent is comforting a melancholy Helaena until Aemond walks in fresh from using Vhagar to burn down a small town for no apparent reason, and tries to convince Helaena to mount her dragon Dreamfyre and fight for him. She refuses, despite him trying again later, and tells him that she has seen he is going to die. This dispute leads Alicent to seek passage to Dragonstone, which leads to a shocking revelation later in the episode.

Over at Dragonstone, the dragonseeds are getting used to living as a highborn, but Ulf’s common manners grate on Rhaenyra’s son Jace, who confronts him about his behavior. Rhaenyra calms things down by promising to make the dragonseeds knights if they succeed in their mission - to learn their dragons and prepare to take down Vhagar. But the meeting is cut short when Rhaenyra is called to Harrenhal over fears that Daemon may seek to betray her.

Still at Harrenhal, Daemon is further building his army but one night visits a blood-soaked tree in the Godswood. There he experiences a vivid vision where he sees the prophecy of The Song of Ice and Fire, AKA the whole plot of Game of Thrones. The vision ends with Rhaenyra sitting on the throne. So then when Rhaenyra lands at Harrenhal and sees the vast army her husband has built, he bends the knee as he knows now from the vision, that she is the one who must rule.

As for some of the series’ side characters, Lord Corlys is preparing to send his fleet from The Step Stones but in trying to help his bastard son Alyn of Hull, he angers him and it is finally confirmed that he is Alyn’s father. The only time we see Ser Criston Cole in this episode is in the woods where Alicent’s brother confronts him after he is caught smelling her embossed handkerchief, but Criston’s proclaimed devotion to Alicent forces her brother to lower his sword. And, in the Vale, Rheana almost catches her death roaming the hills looking for the wild dragon we think is Sheepstealer, until she finally finds him.

Towards the end of the episode, Alicent shockingly shows up at Dragonstone in the middle of the night, unarmed and in desperate need of help from Rhaenyra, and agrees to forfeit her sons in return for her and her daughter’s safety. The finale ends with the dragonseeds suiting up for war, whilst the Hightower fleet alongside Daeron Targaryen's dragon, the Lannister's army, and the Stark’s troops all march on towards Harrenhal where Daemon is waiting. Tyland Lannister's new fleet and the Seasnake’s ships both make their way by sea. It is official, war is coming.

What happened between Alicent and Rhaenyra?

(Image credit: HBO)

Although the finale didn't end in a blaze of dragon fire like we may have expected, the ending between Alicent and Rhaenyra still holds a lot of importance and is a satisfying conclusion to a heartbreaking friendship that has spanned over two seasons now. From what happened in season 2 episode 7 when Alicent walked into the lake , symbolizing her washing away her duties and responsibilities, it was clear we were going to see a big change in the Dowager Queen. But no one could have expected her risking her life and showing up to Rhaenyra’s house in the night begging for help.

In an emotional scene, Alicent confesses to her once best friend that she was wrong and has been controlled by those around her for so long now. She explains how she was blinded by resentment for Rhaenyra’s freedom, but now she has seen the light and wants no part in the upcoming war. In a bid to try and save her children, Alicent suggests that when Aemond next leaves the castle, she and Helaena will let Rhaenyra and her army in to claim the throne, and that Aegon will not be a problem as he still lies sick in bed.

However, Rhaenyra demands Aegon’s head as the people will not accept her as a conqueror if her opposition still lives. In a shocking twist, Alicent nods her head and silently agrees to the murder of her son in return for her and Helaena’s safety. At the end of the episode, we see Alicent walking away with her hood up, presumably readying herself to say goodbye to her sons and start a new life with her daughter.

Where is Otto Hightower?

(Image credit: HBO)

In a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it moment at the very end of the episode, we see a flash of Alicent’s father and past The Hand of the King Otto Hightower in a jail cell. Otto served as hand to King Viserys and then King Aegon, but his controlling nature led Aegon to dismiss him. We never saw Otto again but presumed he was back at Oldtown where the Hightowers reside. It is clear now Otto was actually jailed, presumably, by Aegon. However, with Aegon gunning for the throne and expressing his wish for Otto to be his hand, we may see Alicent’s father be set free next season to once again make moves for the Greens.

Who is on Team Green and Team Black now?

(Image credit: HBO)

Now, with that spliced final scene with each army riding out, it is a little confusing and hard to remember who exactly is fighting for who. But don't panic, we’re going to go through it right here.

Out of the armies marching out at the end, the dragon riding dragonseeds, the Stark army from The North, the Seasnake AKA Lord Corlys’ fleet from The Step Stones, and Daemon’s army at Harrenhaal are all Team Black and will be fighting for Rhaenyra. Whereas, the Hightower army alongside Alicent’s son Daeron Targaryen and his dragon, the Lannister's army, and Tyland Lannister's new fleet are all Team Green on Aegon and Aemond’s side.

As for the main members, Team Black consists of Rhaenyra, Daemon, Jace, Baela, Rheana, Lord Corlys, Hugh Hammer, Addam of Hull, and Ulf. Team Green includes Aemond, Aegon, Ser Criston Cole, and Gwayne Hightower to name a few. For the full rundown, see our guide on Greens vs Blacks explained .

Who has which dragons now?

(Image credit: HBO)

Over the last few episodes we have met quite a few new dragons, and two more even showed up during the finale. So to put any of your dragon-related questions to bed, here is a list of every dragon alive in House of The Dragon right now, and who they belong to.

Team Green:

Vhagar - Aemond Targaryen

Dreamfyre - Helaena Targaryen

Tessarion - Daeron Targaryen

Team Black:

Syrax - Rhaenyra Targaryen

Caraxes - Daemon Targaryen

Vermax - Jacaerys Velaryon

Tyraxes - Joffrey Velaryon

Moondancer - Baela Targaryen

Seasmoke - Addam of Hull

Vermithor - Hugh Hammer

Silverwing - Ulf White

Sheepstealer - Rheana Targaryen (presumably)

It is important to note that Aegon’s dragon Sunfyre is now deceased and Joffrey’s dragon is too small to ride. For the full rundown, see our list of every dragon in House of the Dragon.

What does Daemon's vision mean for the series?

(Image credit: HBO)

Probably one of the most exciting parts of the finale has to be Daemon’s vision. In the middle of the night, Daemon is awakened by Alys Rivers and led to a tree in the courtyard of Harrenhal. When Daemon puts his hand on the tree, which is covered in blood and resembles Blood and Fire author, George R.R. Martin, he experiences an out-of-body experience where he sees that winter is coming as A Song of Ice and Fire plays out in front of him. In a mix of quick blink-and-you'll-miss-them scenes, Daemon witnesses a horrific war resulting in many deaths of humans and dragons, a three-eyed raven, the ice king, and the birth of a new dragon queen rising from the ashes with three dragon eggs (hi there, Daenerys). The vision ends with Rhaenyra sitting on the throne and Helaena telling him he now knows what he has to do.

So what does this all mean? Well, The Song of Ice and Fire comes from Aegon the First himself, who believed that a long winter would come and end the world. This ties House of the Dragon and the main series Game of Thrones together, as GOT plays out the prophecy and joins Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen (Ice and Fire) together to save The Realm from The Ice King. Daemon practically sees key points from GOT play out in front of his very eyes from the Mother of Dragons, Daenerys, rising from the flames with three new dragons after dragons had died out long before, to the rise of The Ice King.

How does the finale set up season 3?

(Image credit: HBO)

Well, pretty much all House of the Dragon season 2 episode 8 does is set itself up for season 3, where we will no doubt finally see the war of the Dance of the Dragons come to fruition. At the end of the episode, we see multiple armies setting off to war, presumably Harrenhaal where Daemon is waiting with his troops from the Riverlands. So, in season 3 we expect to see war break out between these men. However, in terms of dragons, it looks like Team Green’s beasts will take flight toward King's Landing so that Rhaenyra may claim the Iron Throne with the help of her new ally Alicent who stated at the end of the finale that she is willing to allow her son Aegon to die on order for Rhaenyra to become Queen and her and her daughter Helaena to go free. However, Aegon is currently en route with Lord Larys Strong to go into hiding, so that may prove an issue for the rightful Queen.

But that's not to say we won't see some dragon fights in season 3, as there is still the issue of Vhagar, who is set to fly to Harrenhal with his rider Aemond, so we are guessing Rhaenyra's new band of dragons will be waiting for the biggest beast in the Realm to return, or maybe they will take their winged war out onto the battlefield.

In terms of new faces and new storylines, we are yet to meet Alicent’s other son Daeron Targaryen. But as we saw at the end of episode 8, although we never actually saw his face, he is making his way on his dragon Tessarion, flying to war with the Hightower army. As for our new friends from Essos, they were promised The Step Stones, so it will be interesting to see how far they go in trying to claim what already belongs to Lord Corlys. Other than that we are looking forward to seeing how this war plays out, and who will end up on top.

Well, that's all for season 2, and what a ride it has been. Now we look forward to House of the Dragon season 3, which unfortunately at this time does not yet have a release date.

“House of the Dragon” hit a Season 2 high in viewership with Sunday’s finale, which drew 8.9 million multiplatform viewers across HBO and Max, per Warner Bros. Discovery.

That’s up 14% from the Season 2 premiere night, which garnered 7.8 million viewers. However, it is down from the audience size for the first season finale of “House of the Dragon” in 2022.

More from Variety

After premiering with 10 million viewers in June 2022, “House of the Dragon” Season 1 hit its peak with Episode 2, reaching 10.2 million. Exact data was not made available for Episodes 3-9, but Episode 10 closed the season with 9.3 million viewers.

Warner Bros. Discovery attributed the season opener declines to a drop in linear viewing, as fewer viewers now watch on HBO’s cable channel. But on the flip side, the conglom reports that Sunday’s “House of the Dragon” finale has now led to the biggest streaming day ever for Max, both in the U.S. and across the globe.

Overall, according to Warner Bros. Discovery, “House of the Dragon” Season 2 is averaging nearly 25 million cross platform viewers. It’s unknown whether a leak of several scenes from the Season 2 finale on TikTok may have impacted viewership — but it’s a bit apples-to-apples, as two years ago the Season 1 finale also experienced an online leak as well.

“House of the Dragon” Season 2 will be eligible for next year’s 2025 Emmys. The show’s Season 1 garned eight Emmy nods, including outstanding drama series, and won one for fantasy/sci-fi costumes.

In a press conference earlier Monday, showrunner and co-creator Ryan Condal revealed that the “Game of Thrones” prequel will include two more seasons, and will conclude with Season 4. Condal also confirmed that the third season is currently being written, they will be doing prep for it in the fall, with the plan to go into production in “earlyish 2025.”

The fantasy drama series is based on author George R.R. Martin’s book “Fire & Blood,” which details the history of House Targaryen. The returning cast includes Emma D’Arcy as Rhaenyra Targaryen, Olivia Cooke as Alicent Hightower, Matt Smith as Daemon Targaryen, Ewan Mitchell as Aemond Targaryen, Eve Best as Rhaena Targaryen, Rhys Ifans as Otto Hightower, Steve Toussaint as Corlys Velaryon, Fabien Frankel as Criston Cole and Tom Glynn-Carney as Aegon Targaryen.

New faces joining the series in Season 2 included Tom Taylor as Lord Cregan Stark, Clinton Liberty as Addam of Hull, Jamie Kenna as Ser Alfred Broome, Kieran Bew as Hugh Hammer, Tom Bennett as Ulf and Vincent Regan as Ser Rickard Thorne.

It was quite the dramatic end for the latest episode too as several scenes were leaked online before the air date. However, now it has finally been released and we know just what the impact those dragonseeds will have on the world of Westeros.

The announcement that the fantasy hit was coming back for season 3 was made back in June, and there have been some teases already about what to expect. So if you're keen to know what's next for one of the best TV shows on screen today, then you're in the right place. Below we've got the lowdown on the House of the Dragon season 3 release date, cast, plot, as well as some exclusive insight from the creators.

Beware though, we will be getting into big spoilers for the House of the Dragon season 2 finale below. Read our House of the Dragon season 2 ending explained for more details.

House of the Dragon season 3 doesn't currently have a release date. Work has already started on the stories and scripts, but it seems logical to assume we'll have a big gap before we see new episodes.

The scale of the Game of Thrones prequel is huge, which means it takes a long time to film. Between season 1 and season 2, there was a gap of two years. If we follow a similar pattern with season 3, it seems likely we'll get it at some point in 2026. We'd expect a summer release too, to match the previous two seasons.

We will have some more Thrones before then though – A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms is currently filming, and we've even had a first-look image.

Is House of the Dragon season 3 the final season?

(Image credit: HBO)

The short answer is we don't yet know. Nothing has been renewed beyond season 3 yet, but the showrunners have previously shared their hopes for around 3-4 seasons to tell this story in its entirety. Based on where we are currently in relation to 'Fire and Blood', we're actually a fair amount through.

Although, while we won't get into book spoilers, there are some huge battles on the way. Given the pace of the show so far, our best bet is that we've got two more seasons to get to the end of this story. Watch this space.

House of the Dragon season 3 cast

(Image credit: HBO)

Unlike season 1, the House of the Dragon cast stayed pretty stable throughout the second season. There were some big causalities, mind - including Eve Best's Rhaenys and some of the younger Targaryens (thanks to Blood and Cheese, need we say more?)

House of the Dragon season 3 plot

(Image credit: HBO)

The season 2 finale of House of the Dragon set up some very key plot points to resolve when it returns. The main narrative thread was all leading to the big battle on the way across Westeros. From where we leave things, Rhaenyra has the clear advantage thanks to her dragonseeds. This means, that after Daemon bent the knee, she has seven dragons (potentially eight if Rhaena manages to secure Sheepstealer).

Her fighters are preparing to make the approach on King's Landing where Alicent has told them that they'll be allowed in to take control of the city. However, we're not totally sure that it will all go as smoothly as that... In the final moments we see Aegon and Larys heading out of the city, Helaena all but agreeing to mount her dragon, and the Tyland Lannister's new fleet on their way.

Aemond and Vhagar have their eye on Harrenhal too, and we know better than to bet against Vhagar...

Is there a House of the Dragon season 3 trailer?

There's no trailer yet for House of the Dragon season 3 as filming has yet to begin. We don't expect we'll see one for a while yet either. Keep this page handy for when we do though.

"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://uk.news.yahoo.com/house-dragon-viewers-making-same-094555523.html,"House of the Dragon viewers are making same complaint about ‘insulting’ season 2 finale

House of the Dragon viewers have been left severely unimpressed with the season two finale.

The HBO series’s divisive second season, which The Independentsaid took “all the wrong lessons from Game of Thrones’s terrible ending” drew to a close on Sunday (4 August) with a final episode that’s been branded “disappointing” and “underwhelming”.

Despite the episode featuring notable character reunions, viewers are complaining that it didn’t feel climactic – and instead focused on setting up what looks to be a more action-packed third season.

In addition to this, fans were hoping there would be a battle of some kind, especially after an exciting end to the previous instalment that appeared to put the wheels in motion for a epic showdown.

The frustration has been heightened due to the fact there was a two-year wait in between the first and second season – and that season two had its episode count slashed from 10 to eight.

One fan wrote: “Dear House of the Dragon, taking *two years* between seasons is bad enough, but it is an insult to then deliver a truncated season (eight eps instead of 10 like the first season) which then doesn’t significantly advances the story and ends on a f***ing cliffhanger.”

Another added: “The season finale of House of the Dragon was not very climactic. Basically sets everything up as a cliffhanger for the next season (in two years lol).”

After watching the finale, another person chimed in: “Fans were expecting a great battle in the finale after the ending to episode seven – why didn’t you give it to them?”

While sharing a complaint about the way the season ended, an additional viewer suggested the episode should have been longer

“Just finished House of the Dragon. I enjoyed it but was pissed it ended where it did – give me another half an hour or more.”

The “weak” finale was also branded “one of the worst season finales I’ve seen in a while” by one particular fan, calling it “the worst episode of the season”.

House of the Dragon will return for a third season on HBO in 2025."
"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-ending-explained,"This season on House of the Dragon, we endured the horrors of Blood and Cheese, witnessed the pivotal battle of Rook's Rest, and welcomed new dragonriders following the fiery Red Sowing. Now, we come to the finale, and the results are... a tad underwhelming.

Don't get me wrong, the Season 2 finale is by no means a bad episode of House of the Dragon. That emotional reunion between Rhaenyra (Emma D'Arcy) and Alicent (Olivia Cooke) alone is worth heaps and heaps of praise. Plus, there are plenty of juicy lore tidbits that hint at big things ahead for the show.

Unfortunately, in terms of ending Season 2 with a bang, this finale fails to deliver. It plays more like a mid-season episode or a ""next-on"" trailer for Season 3 than a satisfying conclusion to Season 2.

It doesn't help that the most exciting footage from the finale's trailer, including marching armies, naval action, and our first glimpse at Prince Daeron's dragon Tessarion, have very little bearing on the finale itself. They're the definition of trailer fodder, and while they may have set expectations for an action-filled finale, the reality — like much of House of the Dragon Season 2 — is a much slower, more dialogue-driven affair. Quite a bit of it lands, while other parts drag the momentum of what should have been a more propulsive episode of TV.

Still, it's clear from this finale that House of the Dragon is maneuvering itself into place for several key battles in the future. (But would any of them have worked better as closers to Season 2? Absolutely.) From new political alliances to mysterious visions, let's break down what happens in House of the Dragon's Season 2 finale — and what it could mean for the future.

Tyland Lannister has the worst time of his life in Essos.

Tyland Lannister (Jefferson Hall) is no stranger to bullying. Remember his short-lived beef with baby Jaehaerys in Season 2's first episode, when the two dueled over his precious Small Council ball? But House of the Dragon's Season 2 finale takes Tyland's tough times up a notch with a visit to Essos, where he hopes to secure an alliance with the Triarchy on Aemond's (Ewan Mitchell) orders.

Members of the Triarchy — representing the Free Cities of Lys, Tyrosh, and Myr — dog walk Tyland during their negotiations. They get him to cede the Stepstones to them in exchange for their naval support. It's certainly not the tradeoff Tyland would have wanted, but at least the Triarchy's fleet can go break up the Velaryon blockade in the Gullet now, right? Right?

Not so fast! First, Tyland has to prove himself to Lysene commander Sharako Lohar (Abigail Thorn). His trials — or really, Lysene hazing — include mud wrestling and singing for Lohar's entertainment. Don't worry, though: Lohar takes a real liking to Tyland, enough to ask him to impregnate his own wives and pledge his navy to King's Landing.

""To the Gullet on the morrow!"" Lohar crows to his men. Unfortunately, the ""morrow"" for these characters is looking more like 2026 (or whenever Season 3 comes out) for us, as we don't see any naval clashing this episode.

Tensions rise on Dragonstone and Driftmark.

Speaking of the Gullet, let's pop over to Dragonstone and Driftmark, where war is in the air. (But when is it not?)

On Driftmark, Corlys Velaryon (Steve Toussaint) is ready to join the blockade on his mended warship the Sea Snake, which he's renamed the Queen Who Never Was in honor of Princess Rhaenys (Eve Best). Joining him is his first mate and bastard son Alyn of Hull (Abubakar Salim). Yet Alyn remains unenthused about his promotion.

In one of the finale's best scenes, he breaks his characteristically stoic countenance to give Corlys a heartbreaking dressing-down. He details the struggles he and his brother Addam (Clinton Liberty) faced in their youth, especially when compared to the cushy life of Corlys's trueborn son Laenor. The fact that Corlys only turned to Alyn once his legitimate heirs were dead is also not lost on Alyn, who spurns any further help or favor from his father as they head off to war.

Bastard tensions linger in Dragonstone as well. Freshly minted dragonrider Ulf the White (Tom Bennett) is a little too comfortable in his new role. He's putting his feet up on Dragonstone's famed Painted Table, ordering servants around, poking at Jacaerys' (Harry Collett) illegitimacy — in short, he's acting like he's king of the castle. Last I checked, that was still Rhaenyra, Ulf! His fellow new dragonriders Addam and Hugh Hammer (Kieran Bew) are far more respectful of Rhaenyra, but Ulf's attitude already spells trouble for the next stages of Rhaenyra's plan.

What is that plan, exactly? Well, now that Rhaenyra has far more dragons at her disposal than Aemond, she plans to face him head-on and take the Iron Throne. However, an attack on King's Landing would kill thousands of innocents, sowing discord and fear across Westeros instead of uniting the realm. This tension between striking for victory and risking needless murder is the dilemma Rhaenyra has been facing all season. It's why she didn't retaliate further after Jaehaerys's death, and why she waited so long to unleash a dragon in combat.

Now she has all the firepower needed to end the war — but does she have the cruel streak to do it?

Aemond has a temper tantrum, and Alicent and Helaena want no part of it.

As Team Black rejoices in their three new dragonriders, Aemond is in shambles. He takes Vhagar on a joyride, with a little side helping of death and destruction along the way. The victims of Aemond's rage? The entire town of Sharp Point, burned to a crisp, with no thought for the people who live within. (Or how the realm will react when they find out of this slaughter.)

Aemond's next step to rally his dragonriders does not go according to plan. He turns to Helaena (Phia Saban), ordering her to fly Dreamfyre into battle. But as Rhaenyra said earlier in the episode, Helaena has no taste for dragonriding. She refuses to burn people, and Alicent doesn't want the best and most gentle member of her family to face any more pain.

Not even threats from Aemond can change Helaena's mind. Instead, she hits him with a one-two punch courtesy of her prescient dreaming ability. First, she tells him that she knows he burned Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney) at Rook's Rest. Then, she delivers a knockout in the form of a prophecy: Aegon will be king again in the future, while Aemond will die. ""You are swallowed up in the Gods Eye,"" she tells him, referring to the large lake besides Harrenhal.

Helaena's words are consistent with Aegon and Aemond's fates in George R.R. Martin's Fire & Blood, so unless House of the Dragon makes some surprising moves, Helaena just told us exactly what will happen in the show's next seasons. If Aemond wants to survive, maybe he should heed his sister's spoiler warning — although as she says when he threatens to kill her, it wouldn't change anything.

Daemon has one last Harrenhal vision — of Daenerys Targaryen herself.

Matt Smith in ""House of the Dragon."" Credit: Ollie Upton/HBO

Helaena's dreaming powers are working overtime in this finale, as she also appears in a weirwood vision Daemon (Matt Smith) has at Harrenhal. But unlike Daemon's other visions, which he experienced involuntarily, this is a vision he chooses.

Witch Alys Rivers (Gayle Rankin) guides him to Harrenhal's weirwood tree in the middle of the night, telling him how being at Harrenhal has opened him up, and how he's realized he can't simply bend the world to his will. Now, she offers him the choice to see the omens the world wishes to give him. He accepts, and launches into the last — and trippiest — of his Season 2 visions.

Here, he sees visions of war and doom, including the White Walkers leading an army of death. He also sees a pale-haired man (Joshua Ben-Tovim) sitting in a weirwood tree. A birthmark on his face morphs into a three-eyed raven, implying that this man is Brynden Rivers, aka Bloodraven. A Targaryen bastard and former Commander of the Night's Watch, Brynden is most known to Game of Thrones fans as the Three-Eyed Raven, Bran's greenseer mentor.

But by far the buzziest Game of Thrones reference in Daemon's vision is the appearance of none other than Daenerys Targaryen herself, just after the birth of her three dragons. Her presence here proves that House Targaryen will persevere and stand against the threat of the Long Night, even if Daemon is unaware of the decades of tragedy that will befall his House between now and her birth.

One last vision of Rhaenyra on the Iron Throne and a helpful nudge from Helaena push Daemon to do what he should have done from the beginning of the war: bend the knee to Rhaenyra. The choice is a product of all the ghostly visits that came before this, in which young Rhaenyra (Milly Alcock), Laena Velaryon (Nanna Blondell), and Viserys (Paddy Considine) forced him to question his desire for the crown. Now, knowing that Westeros needs someone to unite the realm in the face of death and destruction, Daemon is more than ready to stand behind Rhaenyra. I'm sure Willem Blackwood (Jack Parry-Jones) and the members of House Bracken who suffered at his hands would have loved for this decision to come sooner, but better late than never!

Alicent comes to Rhaenyra with a game-changing proposal.

There are no big battles in House of the Dragon's Season 2 finale, but this final confrontation between Rhaenyra and Alicent cuts deeper than any knife.

After a season of being belittled and pushed to the side, Alicent has finally realized the folly in the order that she fought so hard to uphold for all of her life. She never knew anything but the duty Otto (Rhys Ifans) and the realm forced upon her — what would she have chosen to do had she been able to live her life any differently? She attempts to make a bold new choice now, meeting Rhaenyra on Dragonstone to propose a deal that could end the war.

At first, Rhaenyra doesn't want to hear it, rightfully pointing out Alicent's hypocrisy. Alicent slandered Rhaenyra's virtue, then later chose to take a lover when it suited her. Alicent kickstarted the war by crowning Aegon and turned down Rhaenyra's attempt to sue for peace. Now she wants to do the same?

However, Alicent's proposal is too good for Rhaenyra to turn down outright. When Aemond flies to Harrenhal, Alicent says, she will surrender King's Landing to Rhaenyra. All she asks is that she and Helaena are able to go free. Rhaenyra accepts, on one condition: Alicent must surrender Aegon to Rhaenyra. Only his death will truly secure her claim to the throne.

What follows is a heartbreaking silence as Alicent weighs her own life, Helaena's life, and the future of the realm against the life of her eldest son. She tearfully nods, unable to even voice the agreement. The choice comes as somewhat of a surprise to Rhaenyra. ""History will paint you a villain,"" she tells Alicent. Yet Alicent doesn't care, hoping to truly live as herself for the first time since her youth.

The entire scene is a full circle moment for Rhaenyra and Alicent, who may have agreed on a course of action but who may also never be farther apart in terms of their relationship to power and their places in this war. Alicent is at peace with giving up any of the power she thought she once held: Gone are her signature dark green wardrobe and any symbols of the Faith of the Seven. Instead, she wears a new, lighter shade of blue, consistent with the idea of rebirth we saw when she swam in a lake in episode 7. In a nice detail, we also see her nervously biting her nails, just as young Alicent (Emily Carey) did in the first few episodes of House of the Dragon, suggesting that Alicent has reverted in some ways to her younger self.

Meanwhile, Rhaenyra remains squarely focused on taking the Iron Throne, with her insistence that Alicent choose Aegon's fate acting as the ultimate power play. It also calls to mind Jaehaerys's murder, especially with the brutal return of the line, ""a son for a son."" And while Alicent gladly relinquishes her spot in the history books, even asking Rhaenyra to come with her, Rhaenyra remains firmly on the warpath. ""Whether I will it or no,"" she tells Alicent. The line suggests a reversal between the two: Now it's Rhaenyra who's given up choice, while Alicent is choosing to walk away.

Still, despite all their differences, there's a warmth between the two as they part ways, proof of the love they've always had for one another. Unfortunately, given the other many moving pieces at play here, it's quite likely this duo's plan towards peace will fall apart right at the start of Season 3.

The board is set. The pieces are moving. We just have to wait until Season 3.

The first problem with Alicent's plan? Aegon is no longer in King's Landing. Larys Strong (Matthew Needham) is smuggling him to Braavos, so there's no way she can give him up to Rhaenyra. There's no way Rhaenyra sees Aegon's departure as anything but a betrayal from Alicent, so consider that alliance toastier than one of Vermithor's Red Sowing victims come Season 3.

Aegon and Larys's road trip reveal is just one of many that comes in the montage that closes out House of the Dragon Season 2. We also see various armies marching towards the Riverlands for battle: the Hightower host rides with Daeron and his dragon Tessarion from Oldtown, the Winter Wolves cross the Twins on their way south, and the Lannisters are now within eyeshot of Harrenhal. On the naval side of things, Tyland and Lohar sail towards the Gullet — presumably to break the blockade ""on the morrow"" — while Corlys and Alyn ride out to join the fight. Oh, and Otto's in jail! And Rhaena (Phoebe Campbell) has found the wild dragon in the Vale! And the new dragonriders are suiting up for the first time!

It's a jam-packed montage that certainly teases big things to come in Season 3, but as an ending, it feels overstuffed and underdeveloped. Why couldn't Rhaena have gone on her dragon camping trip in episode 7, right after she left on her quest? Why aren't we getting any action concerning the blockade, especially since that's a confrontation that's been teased since the very first episode of Season 2? Why do none of these arcs feel fully completed?

Only Daemon's return to Rhaenyra and Rhaenyra's relationship with Alicent feel like they've reached their natural conclusion this season, and the finale chooses to focus on the latter as its final image. Just as it's been doing since the very start of Season 2, House of the Dragon places Rhaenyra and Alicent in parallel. We see similar shots of them both from behind. Rhaenyra is framed by the shelves holding the many historical scrolls and family records of House Targaryen, while Alicent stands on a cliff edge at Dragonstone, watching the sun rise. One is now forever held within the framework of her House and its great history, while the other hopes for freedom.

Of course, that could all change on the morrow. (Or in Season 3.)

It was more like setting things in motion for the bigger things that are going to happen in Season 3.

Episode 7 of 'House of the Dragon' climaxed with a scene featuring Alicent Hightower and Rhaenyra Targaryen, quite in tables-have-turned-manner. The Dowager Queen offered a hand of piece to Rhaenyra, accepting her as the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. You would say 'too late. Alicent', and so did Rhaenyra. Wearing a cloak of 'freedom', Alicent remained adamant about her request. She asked Rhaenyra to come to the King's Landing and claim the throne, without any protest from anyone there. But, does this mean that there will be no war? Why did Alicent try to stop the war now after knowing very well that it can't be undone? Does Alicent really mean no harm to Rhaenyra?

A poetic ending

The fans have to first understand the relevance of this scene, gorgeously structured between the two strong women in the realm during the time. The ending of Season 2 with a scene like this also once again cements the fact that the story, and 'House of the Dragon' was, and is, always about Alicent and Rhaenyra, who they were and who they have become. It is almost like a poetic ending to the season, of course, drawing direct parallel to the previous scene in the season when Rhaenyra goes to the Red Keep to meet with Alicent, and requests her to find a way to stop the war and minimize the bloodshed. Rhaenyra and Alicent in 'House of the Dragon' Season 2 (Photo: JioCinema)

Rhaenyra's power knows no bounds right now with the maximum number of dragons and dragonriders by her side. More are going to add up, if we consider Rhaena's foreshadowing scene with the wild dragon, the Sheepsteeler, who's yet to be claimed. The Queen Who Was Promised is ready to strike first, albeit knowing that her journey to the Iron Throne from here, would lead to a lot of bloodshed and losing one's own. The journey, the sacrifices, the bloodshed, and what is going to happen at the end of it all - is something that Alicent can also foresee now.

Understanding Alicent Hightower

She was never a foolish queen. Even when she wasn't a queen, just Rhaenyra's best friend, scrolling through the castle, enjoying books, poetry, and her freedom, she could always identify power and figure out its importance. She was, of course, jealous of Rhaenyra being the promised queen of the seven kingdoms, but not in a vicious manner. The time, however, changed the course for both. And now, while Rhaenyra has freedom, Alicent feels shackled by the same power of politics that she once desired in the beginning. The emotions are not all gone, though.

The ending makes Alicent beg Rhaenyra to spare her and her daughter, Helaena, who has played no active part in either conspiring or participating in the war. While Rhaenyra laughs at the idea, deep down, even she knows that Alicent has come from an honest heart, where she's ready to accept the fate of her sons - Aemond and Aegon - who will both have to be killed if Rhaenyra has to take over the Iron Throne. For the lady in green now, it took time, hell a lot of it, and we don't even know if it makes any sense now, but the realisation has finally come. It is clear to her that Aemond is far too arrogant and corrupt to take a U-turn now. Having Vhagar, the largest dragon in the universe, has only added to her malicious intents and triggered his vigour to decimate everything in the war. Alicent also doesn't find Aegon, the current King, fit to rule further. He has been wounded gravely, and can hardly manage to sit on the throne, let alone rule the seven kingdoms.

The trade of emotions that's taking place now

The only thing sane and undamaged is Helaena, and her other sons, who we haven't been told much about yet. If Alicent has to sacrifice her two sons to protect whatever little she is left with, she would take that chance. The last scene was her taking that chance. But, what about Rhaenyra? Has she re-stablished her trust in Alicent?

advertisement

Now, that's a question to be answered in Season 3. However, knowing that things certainly never fall in place the way they are promised and discussed in 'House of the Dragon', it will be a rookie mistake to imagine the end would be as easy as Alicent describes it in her promise to Rhaenyra. Her promise depends on two things: False king Aegon's death, and Prince Aemond's defeat in the war. And how will that happen?

Of course, Alicent doesn't know it yet, and she will have to pay a big price for being unaware of it, but Aegon has already fled King's Landing, as was shown towards the end of episode 7. After a meticulous and quite a 'whisper-y' conversation with Larys Strong, Aegon decided it was best for him to go in hiding right now, and come back after the war, when Aemond and Rhaenyra have sorted out their businesses, and there's peace in the realm. As he was told by Larys, he would be regarded as 'Aegon, the peacemaker', and in the false king's own words, 'Aegon, the Realm's Delight'.

But, when did things go as planned?

Rhaenyra will not be able to have her 'son for a son' revenge if Aegon is still alive when she takes over the throne. Where will that land Alicent, then? Daemon and Rhaenyra in 'House of the Dragon' Season 2 (Photo: JioCinema)

The ultimate ending to Season 2 also showed Otto Hightower living in what looked like a cage, or a prison. Now, that's strange. He was banished from the court, and ripped off of his duties as the 'Hand of the King' by his own grandson, King Aegon, when he chose Ser Criston Cole over him for the position. But, he was never meant to be imprisoned. Season 3 will have the return of Otto Hightower in the story, but not without revealing what actually happened to him, and who caught him this badly.

As per the Book of Ice and Fire by George RR Martin, Rhaenyra does become the Queen, and sits on the Iron Throne, but not without going through tons of battle. The biggest among them being the Battle of Gullet where her ships, led by Lord Corlys and his bastard son, Alyn of Hull, fight against The Triarchy's warships, led by Admiral Lohar, and Tyland Lannister. Helaena in 'House of the Dragon' Season 2 (Photo: JioCinema)

More battles, more losses

Another battle that will probably, and hopefully, be seen in Season 3 is the Battle Above God's Eye, between Daemon and Aemond. Daemon has already had a glimpse of the same in his vision, at the Godswood in Harrenhal, where he sees his dragon, Cyrax, and himself, drowning in water. In fact, Helaena, interestingly established as someone who can see the future clearly in her visions, warns Aemond against the same battle. She tells him that he ""has been swallowed by God's eye"" and ""is never to be found again"".

Season 3 will definitely have more on-field action than the war room scenes. It will also see many of our main characters bidding their final adieu, may or may not include Aemond and Daemon. There's still a lot to make sense and Season 3 will give more answers. It is the beginning of the 'Dance of Dragons' and it will be bloody, dirty, and rhythmic."
"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://time.com/7007125/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-finale-review/,"Warning: This post contains spoilers for the Season 2 finale of House of the Dragon.

The end of a season in the Song of Ice and Fire universe comes with certain expectations. Game of Thrones set the bar high with a debut outing that culminated in the execution of its apparent hero, Ned Stark; the secession of the North; the death of Khal Drogo; and the birth of Daenerys’ dragons. In subsequent seasons, the final episode or two consistently delivered battles, bloodshed, shocking reversals of fortune. House of the Dragon carried on that tradition in a Season 1 finale that opened in the immediate aftermath of King Viserys’ death, as Aegon II ascended a contested Iron Throne, the Green and Black factions rallied their respective allies, and Aemond’s dragon Vhagar killed Rhaenyra’s son Lucerys and Lucerys’ dragon Arrax.

Sunday’s Season 2 finale was different. There was no grand, CGI-heavy battle sequence; combat fans had to content themselves, this season, with the Battle of Rook's Rest. Neither were there any major character deaths. I had predicted we would see Aemond, now the Greens’ regent, cross swords with his elder doppelganger, Daemon. (Never heed my hunches. I haven’t even read the books!) But I’m happy to have been wrong. Because, as talky as it was, this finale served up some of the best plot twists, character beats, and new faces the series has given us to date.

Any Thrones fan who enjoyed the rapport between Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth must be psyched about the new dynamic duo of Tyland Lannister and Admiral Lohar, a fearsome Triarchy commander who is played by a female actor, Abigail Thorn, but who uses male pronouns and has a bevy of wives. First we see the Lannister golden boy mud-wrestle his way into Lohar’s good graces. “Have you ever eaten the flesh of your enemies?” the admiral demands. Lord Tyland is relieved to discover he’s just kidding. But Lohar is dead serious when he announces: “I wish to have children by you.” “You… you want me to…,” Tyland stammers. “Indeed,” Lohar replies. “I want you to f-ck my wives.” OK, then! “How many wives do you have?” asks the visibly nervous Lannister. We may not learn the answer before Season 3, but one thing is sure: Dragon has been hurting for some Thrones-level oddballs, and this new Lohar-Tyland buddy comedy is among the most entertaining developments we’ve seen.

Turning to more dramatic storylines, I can’t tell you how thrilled I was to see Daemon—inspired by a bloody vision bestowed upon him by his own personal witchy, proto-feminist spirit guide, Alys Rivers—rethink his plan to betray Rhaenyra and seek the Iron Throne for himself. For one thing, the twist represents what might be the first truly effective deployment of the Song of Ice and Fire prophecy we’ve seen in Dragon. Daemon suddenly understands how pathetically minor his own personal ambitions are when dragon warfare puts the entire future of humanity—a future that looks very much like a supercut of Thrones highlights—at stake. (If only J. Robert Oppenheimer had had an Alys Rivers.) Daemon has always been a wildcard, but this season had him veering toward a particularly unsurprising, male-chauvinist form of villainy. By bending the knee to Rhaenyra, he not only evolves into a more complex character, but also subverts Dragon’s tiresome habit of making it sucks to be a woman the moral of every story.

Daemon’s redemption was hardly the only breathtaking bit of character development. If there was one area in which the finale, written by Sara Hess and directed by Geeta Vasant Patel, most excelled, it was in one-on-one exchanges. We got a long-awaited confrontation between Alyn of Hull and Lord Corlys, who still refuses to openly acknowledge the sons he sired out of wedlock in an otherwise frank conversation with Rhaenyra. “Do you know what hunger does to a boy? What grief does? Or shame?” Alyn demands of his absent father. We got Rhaenyra asking Mysaria “Who pays the price?” of war. We got bratty Jacaerys absolutely losing it over barroom braggart turned dragonrider Ulf’s coarse manners. And who didn’t love watching the once-meek Helaena assure her awful brother, Aemond, now desperate to have her ride her own dragon into battle with the Blacks, that he would never be king. “And you? You will be dead.”

Of course, no tête-à-tête hit harder than Alicent’s climactic appeal to Rhaenyra. Fresh off last week’s head-clearing walkabout and free swim, it’s a contrite Alicent who arrives at Dragonstone ready to, as she puts it, “cast myself on the mercy of a friend who once loved me.” Indeed, she says all the right things—that she was wrong to resent Rhaenyra’s freedom and to put her “faith in my husband, my father, my lover.” (Rhaenyra’s mock shock at the revelation that prim and proper Alicent had taken a lover is pretty delectable.) What’s more, Alicent assures her childhood playmate, “I do not wish to rule. I wish to live.” To that end, she’s here to tip off Rhaenyra that Aemond will soon depart for the Riverlands, leaving Helaena in charge of King’s Landing. With Alicent ordering the Kingsguard to stand down, “You will enter as a conqueror.”

Considering how horrified she has been by the carnage thus far, a bloodless transfer of power would seem to be Rhaenyra’s ideal resolution to the Dance of the Dragons. Yet she’s not immediately buying what Alicent is selling. “It’s too late,” she says, reminding her old friend: “Blood has been shed. Cities burned. Armies march. And you want to wash your hands of what you set in motion?” Rhaenyra insists that she can’t genuinely win without killing Aegon. “Choose,” she commands. “A son for a son.” When Alicent mumbles something about persuading Aegon to bend the knee, Rhaenyra forces the issue. There is obviously a pragmatic aspect to making the deal contingent on the king’s death. In reality, though, a broken Aegon doesn’t pose much of a threat. Even Rhaenyra is open about the fact that what she really needs, to accept Alicent as an ally, is for her to experience the pain Rhaenyra felt at the loss of Lucerys (not to mention the mother Alicent replaced). So the price of a peaceful end to the war is yet another Targaryen head. And after some hesitation Alicent is, in return for the freedom to live a quiet life with Helaena, willing to pay it.

The scene works on so many levels. The dialogue is layered, drawing on a whole lifetime’s worth of affection and enmity between the show’s richest characters. Emma D’Arcy and Olivia Cooke are so well cast—and so well matched—as the righteous, weary, scornful Rhaenyra and the brittle Alicent, who has slowly come to realize that everything she once believed was wrong. As Rhaenyra watches Alicent beg, there are hints of empathy; her face softens. But the scene never devolves into the fan service of, well, two literal queens coming together to maximize their joint slay. As Rhaenyra understands, that would be too easy, too glib. She and Alicent may need each other, but they've also hurt each other too much to do anything but part ways once the plan is executed.

As she sends Alicent home, the episode closes on a montage of armies and navies and dragons and dragonriders gearing up, setting sail, and marching towards the battlefields—many, presumably, to die in what is shaping up to be a feint to put Rhaenyra on the throne. I have a feeling that this resolution will be received by viewers who crave dragon fire and a body count—both of which seem to be on the horizon for Season 3—as anticlimactic. But as far as I’m concerned, House of the Dragon gave us something better this week, something that separates George R.R. Martin’s franchise, at its most sophisticated and compelling, from so many other fantasy shows. Anyone with a big-enough budget can produce cool-looking digital violence. It’s the characters and their regrets and the evolution of their relationships that give this Targaryen civil war its stakes.

After the dramatic end of season 2 that left the audience gasping for more, the makers have announced the third season of the hit American drama series House of the Dragon, made by George R. R. Martin and Ryan Condal for HBO. Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp Additionally, several scenes from the recent episode were leaked online prior to its air date, making for a very dramatic conclusion. However, now that it has been finally released, we are aware of how those dragonseeds will affect the world of Westeros.

The fantasy hit's return for season 3 was announced in June, and there have already been some hints about what to expect. You've come to the right place if you want to know what comes next for one of today's best television shows. The release date, cast, and plot of House of the Dragon season 3 are all detailed below, as are exclusive insights from the show's creators.

House of the Dragon season 3: Release date (exp.)

House of the Dragon season 3 right now doesn't have a release date. The stories and scripts have already been written, so it makes sense to assume that we won't see any new episodes for a while. The Game of Thrones prequel is huge, so filming it takes a long time.

There was a two-year gap between the first and second seasons. It appears likely that we will receive season 3 sometime in 2026 if we calculate a similar pattern. In keeping with the previous two seasons, we anticipate a summer release as well.

Is House of the Dragon season 3 the finale season?

There is no answer to that yet. The showrunners have previously expressed their hopes that this story will be told in its entirety over the course of three to four seasons, but nothing has been renewed beyond season 3. We're actually about halfway through ""Fire and Blood"" based on where we are right now.

Despite the fact that we will not indulge into any book spoilers, significant conflicts are on the way. Given the speed of the show up to this point, our smartest choice is that we have two additional seasons to get to the furthest limit of this story.

House of the Dragon Season 3: Cast

The House of the Dragon cast remained pretty stable all through the second season, which was not the case with the first season. Eve Best's Rhaenys and some of the younger Targaryens were among the major casualties, thanks to Blood and Cheese. All of this means that we know who might appear in the third season pretty well. See our complete list of predictions below.

• Matt Smith as Daemon Targaryen

• Matthew Needham as Lord Larys Strong

• Steve Toussaint as Lord Corlys Velaryon

• Sonoya Mizuno as Mysaria

• Phia Saban as Helaena Targaryen

• Harry Collett as Jacaerys Velaryon

• Abubakar Salim as Alyn of Hull

• Clinton Liberty as Addam of Hull

• Bethany Antonia as Baela Targaryen

• Phoebe Campbell as Rhaena Targaryen

• Kieran Bew as Hugh Hammer

• Jefferson Hall as Jason/Tyland Lannister

• Emma D'Arcy as Rhaenyra Targaryen

• Olivia Cooke as Alicent Hightower

• Tom Glynn-Carney as Aegon Targaryen

• Ewan Mitchell as Aemond Targaryen

• Fabien Frankel as Ser Criston Cole

• Rhys Ifans as Ser Otto Hightower

• Gayle Rankin as Alys Rivers

• Freddie Fox as Gwayne Hightower

• Tom Bennett as Ulf White

• Simon Russell Beale as Simon Strong.

House of the Dragon season 3: Plot

House of the Dragon's season 2 finale set up some crucial plot points that will be resolved when it returns. The main plot was all pointing to the big battle that would take place as they travelled through Westeros. Rhaenyra clearly has the benefit from where we stand because of her dragonseeds. This implies that after Daemon bowed the knee, she has seven dragons (possibly eight assuming Rhaena figures out how to get Sheepstealer).

Her fighters are getting ready to approach King's Landing, where Alicent has assured them that they will be permitted entry to take over the city. However, we aren't entirely certain that everything will go off without a hitch... Aegon and Larys leave the city in the final moments, and the Tyland Lannister's new fleet and Helaena almost agree to mount their dragon. We know better than to bet against Vhagar because both Aemond and Vhagar have their eye on Harrenhal.

Is there a House of the Dragon season 3 trailer released?

House of the Dragon Season 3 has not yet begun filming, so there is no trailer available. Additionally, we do not anticipate seeing one for some time."

There is more to see from Team Black and Team Green.

The ""Game of Thrones"" prequel series ""House of the Dragon"" will return for a third season, despite what USA TODAY TV critic Kelly Lawler called an anti-climactic finale.

The HBO series, now streaming on Max and based on George R.R. Martin's ""Fire & Blood"" book, ended its second season on Sunday. The latest season, which premiered June 16, followed the ongoing fight for the Iron Throne of Westeros and was ""uneven but often rousing.""

Some fans were disappointed after what was seen as an abrupt and uneventful conclusion to the second season. But viewers should expect an action-packed third season, which is likely to kick off with a bang when it finally premieres.

What will the plot of 'House of the Dragon' Season 3 be?

Fans anxious to see what happens next in ""House of the Dragon"" can read Martin's ""Fire & Blood,"" which includes the entire storyline of the series.

But those let down by the lack of major battles in the Season 2 finale can take comfort in the fact that based on the book, a highly anticipated one should come early in Season 3, perhaps as soon as the first or second episode. Part of the reason some fans were disappointed by the finale is many expected this battle, plus one other major event from the book that's coming up soon, to occur in Season 2.

During a featurette that aired after Sunday's finale, showrunner Ryan Condal teased that while Season 2 was about the ""fits and starts"" of war, Season 3 will be ""about total war.""

'Could've been an email': House of the Dragon finale leaves fans wanting more

'House of the Dragon' renewed for Season 3

Despite fan disappointment with the Season 2 finale, the series isn't going anywhere, as ""House of the Dragon"" was renewed for Season 3 ahead of the Season 2 premiere.

""George, Ryan, and the rest of our incredible executive producers, cast, and crew, have reached new heights with the phenomenal second season of 'House of the Dragon,'"" said HBO programming Executive Vice President Francesca Orsi in a statement. ""We are in awe of the dragon-sized effort the entire team has put into the creation of a spectacular season two, with a scope and scale that is only rivaled by its heart. We could not be more thrilled to continue the story of House Targaryen and watch this team burn bright again for season three.""

The series is led by Martin as co-creator and executive producer with co-creator, showrunner and executive producer Ryan Condal.

When does 'House of the Dragon' Season 3 premiere on HBO?

""House of the Dragon"" Season 3 has not yet received a premiere date on HBO.

But on Monday, according to Variety, Condal confirmed that the season will go into production in early 2025. After the long wait between Season 1 and Season 2, fans shouldn't expect to see Season 3 before 2026. Season 2 began production in April 2023 and premiered in June 2024, so based on that timeline, Season 3 could be eying a return around summer 2026.

In the meantime, another ""Game of Thrones"" prequel series, ""A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"" will air on HBO in 2025. Based on Martin's ""Tales of Dunk and Egg,"" it follows the adventures of a knight named Ser Duncan the Tall and Prince Aegon Targaryen. A brief teaser for the show was released on Sunday.

How many seasons will 'House of the Dragon' last?

In a press conference on Monday, Condal addressed how many seasons ""House of the Dragon"" will last. ""I think it's four,"" he said, according to Entertainment Weekly.

Martin previously said he expects ""House of the Dragon"" to last at least four seasons.

""It is going to take four full seasons of 10 episodes each to do justice to the Dance of the Dragons, from start to finish,"" the author wrote on his blog in 2022. In January, Martin also said he had been discussing the ""third and fourth seasons"" with Condal and the show's writers.

In a 2023 interview with Deadline, Orsi said the series will likely not have ""any less than four"" seasons and teased that there ""could be more.""

Will there be any new characters in 'House of the Dragon' Season 3?

For book readers, one of the biggest questions throughout Season 2 was when, or if, the show would introduce Nettles.

In ""Fire & Blood,"" Nettles is a major fan-favorite character who comes into play during the ""dragonseed"" storyline, in which numerous new dragonriders come forward. Described in the book as a ""small brown girl"" who grew up homeless, she was nowhere to be found in Season 2. The events of Sunday's finale strongly suggested that Nettles has been cut from the show, with aspects of her storyline given to Daemon's daughter Rhaena instead.

One character expected to be introduced in Season 3, though, is Alicent's other son Daeron. He has remained off screen for the entire series but was mentioned in Season 2, and his dragon Tessarion could be seen at the end of the finale, suggesting his proper introduction is imminent. No casting for Daeron has been announced.

But, in just one episode, the series managed to deliver plenty of teases for season 3, including a bunch of new(ish) characters right at the beginning. But with so much going on, you might now be wondering: who were those people with Tyland Lannister at the start of the episode, and what relevance do they have to the series? Well, don't worry, as we are here to answer those questions.

Warning: major spoilers for House of the Dragon season 2 episode 8 follow, so make sure you are all caught up before reading on.

The final episode of season 2 kicked off in a rather strange way, with a small council member in an unfamiliar place with a bunch of people we had never seen before.

In search of further swords for his prince regent Aemond Targaryen’s growing army and to break up the Velaryon blockade in the Gullet, Ser Tyland Lannister travels to Essos where he meets members of The Triarchy and tries to convince them to fight for Team Green. However, leading members of the Triarchy demanded control of the Stepstones in exchange for their fleets. Lannister tells them that this may not be possible as The Stepstones need to be under the control of The Realm for trade and import needs, plus they belong to Lord Corlys Velaryon. But, faced with the idea of going back to King’s Landing empty-handed, Lannister agrees.

However, there is another catch. If Lannister wants to take the Free Cities' fleets back with him to war, he must first prove his worth to the Admiral, a woman, who states she ""will not sail with a man who cannot best me."" And so, in a hazing-type situation, Lannister fights Commander Sharako Lohar in the mud and looks to be losing until he delivers one final blow. Afterward, the new friends celebrate over food and drink, and Lohar even offers one of her wives to Lannister. And that is the last we see of them, until they set sail at the end of the finale, off to war.

As interesting as this new alliance is, you may have been a bit confused at the beginning of the finale, thinking 'Have I missed an episode here?'. But this new group is much more than just a side quest for Lannister – in fact, we have actually heard of the Triarchy before, and, based on the book, they could play a pivotal role in the next season.

What is the Triarchy?

(Image credit: HBO / Sky)

The Triarchy is an alliance between three out of nine of the Free Cities; Lys, Myr, and Tyrosh, which are located in the continent of Essos. The Free Cities are independent city-states separate from Westeros and out of the control of the Realm, but they often trade with the Seven Kingdoms.

If you cast your mind back to House of the Dragon season 1, you will remember that we have actually heard of the Triarchy before when Lord Corlys told the Small Council of the newly founded alliance who were causing havoc in The Stepstones. Things got really bad, though, when the Triarchy’s Admiral – known as the Crabfeeder – took over the port and murdered anyone who stepped foot there. Corlys decided to fight back in a long and struggling war with the help of Daemon Targaryen, who later killed the Crabfeeder.

But the fight wasn't over. As the Triarchy appointed new admirals, they continued to fight for The Stepstones right up until season 2. When Corlys returned successfully to Dragonstone, he informed Rhaenyra that his Velaryon fleet had secured the Stepstones once again and had left a full garrison behind to deter the Triarchy. And that was the last we heard of them, until now.

What role will The Triarchy and Admiral Lohar have in season 3?

(Image credit: HBO)

Since this is the first time the Triarchy has had any notable screentime, aside from the Crabfeeder’s reign in season 1, we can presume that the alliance will play a bigger role in House of the Dragon season 3. At the end of House of the Dragon season 2, we see the fleet heading out presumably to war to break the blockades in the Gullet and Riverlands, so as soon as season 3 picks up we can expect to see some Triarchy vs Velaryon action.

In George R.R. Martin’s Fire and Blood, however, the Triarchy actually meets with Otto Hightower rather than Lannister, but the alliance still heads out to war for Team Green all the same. In Martin’s work, they meet a few familiar faces en route and even end up at Dragonstone, but we won’t spoil any of that for you here. But, as we know from season 1, The Triarchy does not favor Corlys or Daemon, so they will no doubt wreak havoc on Team Black in the name of revenge as well as alliance.

As for Lohar, the commander is actually male in the books, but never received any physical description and is only mentioned a handful of times. With this, it will be interesting to see what part Lohar plays in House of the Dragon season 3, and if she will be as fearsome as some of the Triarchy’s past commanders.

Season 2 of House of the Dragon ended not with the long-awaited Battle of the Gullet but with a montage that left viewers with more questions than answers. Who took Otto Hightower prisoner? Did Rhaena mount Sheepstealer? Seriously, where is Daeron?!

And what about that conference between Rhaenyra and Alicent? Will both sides stick to their promise? How will it impact the Dance of Dragons going forward? Plus, after an entire season of watching Daemon have weird dreams in a House of Horrors, did House of the Dragon just retcon Daenerys' role on Game of Thrones?

Read More: The House of the Dragon Season 2 Finale Gave Us Something Better Than a Big Battle

Here are all the questions we hope that House of the Dragon answers—and where the show may be headed—in Season 3.

Where is Otto Hightower being held?

Rhys Ifans as Otto Hightower in House of the Dragon Ollie Upton—HBO

Otto (Rhys Ifans) has been out of reach since Episode 3 of Season 2. He was cast out of the castle after Prince Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney) dismissed his grandfather, preferring to name Criston Cole as (Fabien Frankel) his hand. When Aegon’s scheming brother, Aemond (Ewan Mitchell), took over as ruler of King's Landing, Aemond realized that Otto is the best tactical mind in King’s Landing—and that Cole is a bit of a idiot. So he summoned his grandfather back.

But the summons—and Alicent’s letters to her father—went unanswered.

In a montage in the season finale, we finally learn why Otto's been ghosting his nephew. In a blink-and-you-miss-it moment, House of the Dragon revealed that Otto Hightower is being held prisoner by...someone...somewhere. It's unclear who would capture Otto and why.

If Rhaenyra (Emma D'Arcy) had nabbed him, she surely would have mentioned it. Whoever has Otto, this is a major departure from the books, in which he was still playing mastermind on the King's Council around this time.

When will we see the Battle of the Gullet?

Harry Collett as Jace and Emmy D'Arcy as Rhaenyra in House of the Dragon Season 2, Episode 5 Theo Whiteman—HBO

Many fans thought the Season 2 finale would feature the Battle of the Gullet, one of the major conflicts in the Dance of Dragons. All of the pieces are in place: During the battle, Team Green, with the help of the Triarchy, tries to break the Sea Snake's blockade. Dragons arrive. Losses are heavy.

But we'll have to wait another season to see this epic battle—unless Rhaenyra and Alicent's handshake deal means the show is completely reshuffling the order of events as laid out in George R.R. Martin's book Fire & Blood. But more about their secret conference later...

Did Rhaena mount Sheepstealer?

Phoebe Campbell as Rhaena Targaryen in House of the Dragon HBO

As many predicted, Rhaena (Phoebe Campbell) abandoned her wards to seek out the wild dragon in the Vale who has been leaving crispy sheep bones in his wake. (So much for Rhaena treating Rhaenyra's children like her own.) In one of the final images of the season, Rhaena stumbles upon the dragon nibbling on some yummy mutton snacks, but she doesn't actually interact with him. Will she be able to ride the dragon? It's important to remember that she has failed to bond with other beasts despite her heritage.

Where is Daeron?

Olivia Cooke as Alicent and Freddie Fox as Gwayne in House of the Dragon Ollie Upton—HBO

Stop teasing us, House of the Dragon! Alicent’s youngest son Daeron (and, crucially, his dragon) were mysteriously missing from the series for two full seasons. This absence has sent book readers into a bit of a tizzy considering the important role he’ll likely play in seasons to come.

But in the last few episodes of Season 2, just about everyone on Team Green can’t stop talking about Daeron. When counting up their dragons, a member of the King’s Council mentions to Prince Regent Aemond Targaryen that his young brother Daeron’s dragon is growing nicely and will be ready to battle soon.

In another scene, Alicent (Olivia Cooke) asks her brother Gwayne (Freddie Fox) about Daeron. Daeron has, apparently, been growing up away from King’s Landing in Oldtown. Gwayne assures her that Daeron—unlike Alicent’s other two sons—is kind. It’s a poignant moment for Alicent, who is horrified by the behavior of her elder sons, though it can’t be easy to learn that the one son you did not raise is the only one who isn’t a homicidal monster.

Anyway, Daeron sounds like a pretty cool guy who also apparently features in the romantic fantasies of the ladies in Oldtown. Both book and show fans alike are all now really psyched to meet Daeron. We even got a glimpse of Daeron’s dragon Tessarion in the final episode of Season 2—but no look at Daeron himself! The agony!

They better cast someone ridiculously charming in this role. I hear Glen Powell can play young.

Did Tyland Lannister just father a bunch of pirate babies?

Jefferson Hall and Milly Alcock in House of the Dragon Ollie Upton—HBO

In one of the stranger—and most fun—plot lines of the season finale, Tyland Lannister (Jefferson Hall) brokers a deal with the pirates of the Triarchy. In exchange for joining Team Green, the pirates will get to rule the Stepstones (and levy a tax on whatever goods come through there). In order to seal the deal, Tyland has to mud wrestle with the leader of the fleet, Lohar (Abigail Thorn).

Later that night, Lohar makes a proposal: ""You are a handsome man and you have proven your worth and virility. I wish to have children by you,"" and then goes on to clarify, ""I want you to f-ck my wives.""

""How many wives do you have?"" Tyland asks. So, yeah, Tyland may have slept with the pirate's entire harem. And there may be a brood of illegitimate Lannister kids running around Essos now. This is especially hilarious because, as you may recall, Tyland is much shier and more skittish than his boisterous identical twin, Jason.

Will we ever see Dreamfyre?

Ewan Mitchell as Aemond and Phia Saban as Helaena in House of the Dragon Ollie Upton—HBO

Helaena's dragon Dreamfyre got a shout out in the final episode of Season 2. Aemond demands that Helaena (Phia Saban) ride into battle with him. Ultimately, Helaena rebuffs him—and fans' hopes of finally seeing Dreamfyre onscreen were dashed. All we know is that she's blue and silver and probably very pretty.

Will Aegon be able to rule again?

Tom Glynn-Carney as Aegon and Matthew Needham as Larys in House of the Dragon Liam Daniel—HBO

Aemond’s scheme to keep his brother drugged with milk of the poppy and unable to make any kingly proclamations worked for a few episodes. But Larys Strong (Matthew Needham) caught on to Aemond’s scheme and has been quietly working to help Aegon—who Larys can manipulate much more easily—recover from his grievous dragon fire wounds.

Read More: Who Lived and Who Died After That Massive House of the Dragon Battle

And Aegon made, frankly, a remarkable recovery in the nick of time. Larys proposes to Aegon in the season finale that he smuggle the king out of King's Landing before Aemond has a chance to commit fratricide. We see them leaving in secret. Will Aegon make it back to King's Landing? And does the fact that he'll be gone when Rhaenyra shows up to take the city scuttle her deal with Alicent—a son for a son?

Has Maelor officially been written off the show?

Matthew Needham and Tom Glynn-Carney in House of the Dragon Ollie Upton—HBO

Has Aegon and Helaena's younger son Maelor been written off the show? During the book's version of the Blood and Cheese incident, Aemond's would-be murderers ask Helaena which son she would prefer for them to murder: his elder son Jaeherys or his younger son Maelor. Helaena picks Maelor only for the killers to cut off Jaeherys' head instead. Apparently Helaena is so traumatized by Blood and Cheese that she can't even look at Maelor. (Yes, it was even worse in the books than it was on the show.)

Read More: Breaking Down That Brutal Death in House of the Dragon‘s Season 2 Premiere

Some fans speculated that Maelor would be born later in the show. But House of the Dragon quickly dispelled that notion in the Season 2 finale when Aegon informed Larys that his ""cock is destroyed."" Guess he is not siring any more heirs. Sorry, Maelor.

What was Alys Rivers' motivation?

Gayle Rankin as Alys Rivers in House of the Dragon Liam Daniel—HBO

Look, I'm not saying isolating Matt Smith, one of the best actors on this show, from all the other main characters in a haunted castle so he can lose his mind was a waste of time this season. I would never suggest that. I sat patiently through Dany in Meereen on Game of Thrones. I can handle a season of Daemon doing Macbeth-core.

Read More: Unpacking Daemon’s Very Weird Dream From House of the Dragon

But I have some follow-up questions. Alys Rivers (Gayle Rankin) just spent the entire season drugging Daemon and creeping him out. Ultimately, her goal seemed to be to transform Daemon from a potential usurper into a loyal servant to his wife, Rhaenyra. Dreams about his brother Viserys (Paddy Considine) and, ultimately, visions of Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) and the White Walkers convinced him that he needed to support Rhaenyra.

OK, but why? Is Alys loyal to Rhaenyra because she thinks she is the rightful ruler? Was this a women-helping-other-women situation? Did she just think Daemon was a bit of a tool who needed fixing? Did her owl tell her to do it? We may never know.

Was Daenerys the Prince That Was Promised after all?

Emilia Clarke as Daenerys on Game of Thrones HBO

Not to harp on Game of Thrones years after it ended, but the show never really answered the question of who, exactly, was the Prince That Was Promised. That's fine—prophecies rarely come true the way you would expect in George R.R. Martin's books...except that House of the Dragon is completely obsessed with this particular prophecy. It's literally Rhaenyra's justification for murder—and now Daemon's justification too.

During his Weirwood tree vision, Daemon sees the future, including the White Walker threat and—presumably—the only Targaryen who can stop them: Dany with her three baby dragons.

I'm sure George R.R. Martin will have something to say about this on his blog shortly.

Is Rhaenyra turning into a cult leader?

Emma D’Arcy as Rhaenyra Targaryen in House of the Dragon Theo Whiteman—HBO

Speaking of dragon ladies who drink their own Kool-aid, Rhaenyra started using cult leader language way too quickly in the penultimate episode of Season 2 when she discovered that Addam of Hull (Clinton Liberty) could ride a dragon. She justified risking the lives of dozens of silver-haired common folk in hopes of finding a couple of dragonriders by proclaiming it was the will of the gods.

This can be dangerous logic: Remember, her father, King Viserys I, ultimately jumpstarted this battle for the Iron Throne in part because he was obsessed with the Prince That Was Promised prophecy and the notion that the gods had entrusted him and his heirs with protecting Westeros from some great threat.

(Of course, we as viewers know the Prince That Was Promised prophecy doesn’t fully come true. A Lannister, not a Targaryen, rules the Seven Kingdoms when Jon Snow’s army confronts the White Walker threat. And it’s a Stark, not a Targaryen, who ultimately ends the war by killing the Night King.)

What will be the fallout of the Rhaenyra-Mysaria kiss?

Emma D’Arcy and Sonoya Mizuno in House of the Dragon Theo Whiteman—HBO

One of the bigger surprises of the season was Rhaenyra sharing a kiss with her advisor (and husband Daemon's ex-lover) Mysaria. Sonoya Mizuno, who plays Mysaria, has said in interviews that D'Arcy improved the kiss. So it's not that surprising that we haven't seen an immediate fallout from the kiss in the final episodes of Season 2. But will the writers address it in Season 3? Are we in for a throuple with the return of Daemon from Dragonstone?

What’s up with the Starks?

The North—or at least 10,000 of their most, umm, mature soldiers—marched to help Queen Rhaenyra. It took them all of Season 2 to march south from the Wall. Will we see Cregan Stark (Tom Taylor) next season? Will he and Jacerys bro out again?

Who will Corlys name as his heir?

Corlys’ two legitimate sons have come up in the world. Alyn (Abubakar Salim) saved Corlys’ life in Season 1 and has since become the commander of his fleet. Addam, meanwhile, is now a dragonrider.

But Corlys (Steve Toussaint) has been hesitant to acknowledge one son, let alone two. And so far Addam is playing along. When Rhaenyra confronts Addam about his parentage, he does not reveal that he’s the bastard son of her own Hand.

Alyn, meanwhile, spurns his father's overtures. In the finale, Alyn recalls watching Corlys with his legitimate son Laenor (John Macmillan), bundled in furs, while Alyn and Addam struggled to survive the winter. He resents the fact that Corlys is showing an interest in him only now that his two legitimate children have died.

Still, Corlys has been in need of an heir ever since Laenor (to Corlys’ knowledge) died. Alyn, his elder bastard son, has declared himself “of salt and sea,” and seems the obvious choice, if Corlys can win him over.

Will Alicent hold up her end of the deal with Rhaenyra?

Olivia Cooke as Alicent on house of the Dragon Theo Whiteman—HBO

This is the big question. The conversation between Alicent and Rhaenyra in which Alicent agrees to open the gates of King's Landing for her old friend without a struggle is a show invention. Alicent also, stunningly, consents to Rhaenyra beheading Aegon, to cement her claim to the Iron Throne: ""A son for a son.""

Will Alicent keep her promise? What happens when Rhaenyra arrives and Aegon is already gone from King's Landing? Will she demand another head instead? And will Rhaenyra, in turn, indeed let Alicent, Helaena, and Jaehaera wander off into the woods to live in peace? That all seems too simple considering we have many episodes of dragon fighting left in this show.

That was it?

No battles. No deaths. Just a whole lot of talking, hedging, visions, meaningful glances and (of all things) mud wrestling.

That's what fans have to contend with in the finale of HBO's ""House of the Dragon,"" (now streaming on Max), which wrapped up an uneven but often rousing second season of the ""Game of Thrones"" prequel series. This year, the characters fighting for the Iron Throne of Westeros spent a lot of time puttering around, but also delivered a really good dragon fight and even a surprising death. But if fans expected the current war to reach a crescendo in the eighth and final episode, they would have been sorely disappointed with what transpired – or rather, with what didn't.

The episode seemed more like a penultimate installment than a big finale, ending on a ""to be continued"" note on a par with some other disappointing finales this year, including FX's ""The Bear"" Season 3 and Netflix's ""3 Body Problem."" All the pieces are in place on the board, but no one wants to play yet.

The finale featured incremental developments in various plot threads and character arcs. Tyland Lannister (Jefferson Hall) gets the Free Cities on Aemond's (Ewan Mitchell) side to break Corlys' (Steve Toussaint) blockade of King's Landing. Daemon (Matt Smith) has a magic vision and finally comes back to Rhaenyra (Emma D'Arcy), with his army of river men. Rhaenyra gets the bastard dragon riders ready for battle. Larys (Matthew Needham) convinces the injured Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney) to flee Westeros and the wrath of the ambitious and unhinged Aemond. Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans) is stuck in somebody's prison. Rhaena (Phoebe Campbell) finds the wild dragon. Alicent (Olivia Cooke) gives up on her sons and offers Rhaenyra the throne. Ser Criston (Fabien Frankel) appears to throw in the towel, too.

'House of the Dragon' Season 3is coming: What we know so far

Perhaps the biggest development is that Daemon abandons the idea of making a play for the Iron Throne himself, a reversal of where the story seemed to be heading this season for the bratty man-child. It would have been preferable for Daemon to achieve this massive character development in more earned ways besides some deus ex machina visions about the white walkers, who won't be a part of this story for three centuries. But at least he's back in Rhaenyra's fold, and now she has seven dragons, one land army, one navy and potentially an eighth wild dragon out in the Vale. She seems unstoppable, no? Yet there would be little point to continuing the show if she could win the war in one fell swoop. Something has to give in Season 3.

Maybe that something is Helaena (Phia Saban), who has been predicting the future all season. She shows up in Daemon's Harrenhal visions and is called upon by her brother Aemond to ride her dragon, one of the oldest and largest, into battle for Team Green. But she's a gentle soul who is adamantly against it.

We don't know which of the armies, dragons and navies will prove the strongest, as the episode ends with a montage of its main characters merely on the precipice of battle. It's certainly a stirring scene – did anyone else catch ""The Rains of Castamere"" playing as the Lannister force marched into battle? – but it leaves us wanting. There was so much potential this year! The midseason Rook's Rest scuffle was such a good battle scene. Would it have been so hard to give us just a little bit more?

TV shows can certainly end seasons with cliffhangers in masterful ways; ""Thrones"" did it many times during its eight-year run. But while the ""Dragon"" finale had a lot of worthy moments, its ending was frustrating, not tantalizing. It doesn't leave you wanting more; instead, you're annoyed that you put in eight hours watching only to be delivered an anticlimax.

We'll have to wait quite a long time to find out if Season 3 delivers enough to make it all worthwhile."
"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/house-of-the-dragon-finale-daenerys-cameo-dragons-1236094274/,"SPOILER ALERT: This interview contains spoilers for HBO’s “House of the Dragon” Season 2 finale, titled “The Queen Who Ever Was,” now streaming on Max.

Rather than a destructive battle to end Season 2, “House of the Dragon” closes with a fiery exchange of words between Rhaenyra Targaryen (Emma D’Arcy) and Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke) that will leave you on the edge of your seats as much as any dragon duel would.

Instead of beginning in Westeros, the Season 2 finale kicks off in Essos, the sandy, pirate-filled continent off to the east. Tyland Lannister (Jefferson Hall) is there to negotiate with the Triarchy to support the Greens in exchange for the Stepstones islands. Sharako Lohar (Abigail Thorn) agrees to lead the naval fleet, after she beats Tyland in a mud wrestling fight, and they set sail to break the blockade around King’s Landing.

In the city, Prince Regent Aemond Targaryen (Ewan Mitchell) returns from burning down an entire town with his dragon Vhagar. His sister Helaena Targaryen (Phia Saban) and mother Alicent are appalled at what he’s done, and even more so when he demands Helaena take flight on her dragon Dreamfyre to aid in the war. Alicent stands up for her daughter, who reveals that she knows Aemond severely burned their brother King Aegon II Targaryen (Tom Glynn-Carney) during the Battle of Rook’s Rest.

Popular on Variety

And Aegon is not doing well. He can barely walk, he’s depressed and he can’t pee without urine running down his leg. His master of whisperers, Larys Strong (Matthew Needham), suggests they flee to Braavos and live off their remaining gold, so that Aegon can triumphantly return and rise from the ashes later on. Miles away — but like Aegon after Rook’s Rest — Ser Criston Cole (Fabien Frankel) is also a broken man. He’s shell-shocked after narrowly surviving a dragon attack, and believes that his army is marching toward fiery annihilation. Alicent’s brother Gwayne Hightower (Freddie Fox) knows that Criston has been breaking his Kingsguard vows by sleeping with his sister, and Criston admits his desire for women has brought him nothing but grief.

Throughout this season, Daemon Targaryen (Matt Smith) has had some creepy, cameo-filled visions while in Harrenhal, but this episode features the most surprising ones. The witch Alys Rivers (Gayle Rankin) brings Daemon to a weirwood tree, where he has visions of the upcoming “Game of Thrones” future. He sees Brynden Rivers — better known as the Three-Eyed Raven, later played by Max von Sydow — White Walkers from beyond the Wall and a glimpse of Emilia Clarke’s Daenerys Targaryen with her three baby dragons. Daemon also sees himself drowning, Rhaenyra sitting on the Iron Throne, a dead dragon and a pile of corpses. The vision ends with Helaena staring back at him, telling him he must play his part in the grand Westeros story. Back in King’s Landing, Helaena simultaneously snaps out of her vision when she’s interrupted by Aemond. She tells him of his impending doom from being swallowed up by the Gods Eye and that Aegon will be king again.

The vision scares Daemon enough that he’s convinced he must bend the knee to Rhaenyra, and pledge his army and support to the Blacks. Finally, in Dragonstone, Alicent pays Rhaenyra a secret visit during which she begs her to end the war. After Aemond fired her from the small council, Alicent has come to her senses, and she’s done with scheming and plotting. She tells Rhaenyra the Black forces can conquer King’s Landing in three days while Aemond is away at war with Criston. She even says that Rhaenyra can kill Aegon to fully take power. The two share a tense, tearful reunion, but it’s unclear whether Alicent will keep her word — and if Rhaenyra completely trusts her.

Before we can see the outcome of their conversation, the Green and Black forces prepare for all-out war. The Lannisters join the Greens, the Triarchy ships face the Velaryon fleet and Starks march south to join the fight. Larys and Aegon also sneak away from King’s Landing in a wagon, and we see Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans) locked away in a dungeon somewhere. Plus, there are two more dragons in play: Daemon’s daughter Rhaena Targaryen (Phoebe Campbell) discovers a lost dragon named Sheepstealer, and the large blue dragon Tessarion flies over the Green army. Tessarion belongs to Daeron Targaryen, Alicent’s son who has yet to appear on the show but has been away in Oldtown the whole time. It seems like Season 3 will finally introduce this missing Targaryen, and we’ll get even more dragon-tastic battles.

In an interview with Variety, Geeta Vasant Patel — who also directed Episode 3 from this season — explains creating Daemon’s cameo-filled vision, shooting Rhaenyra and Alicent’s emotional conversation, introducing the two new dragons and much more.

A lot of fans were expecting a big battle episode since this is the season finale, but this was much more about intense conversations and shifting alliances. How did this episode fit the mold of what you were expecting to do for the finale?

I honestly didn’t know what to expect. I didn’t know if it would be a battle or something else. I probably expected a battle, just as a fan. Then when I read the script, I was pleasantly surprised and happy, because I think we put too much on battles. I think what’s really interesting about this episode is that it’s about relationships. It’s the dialogue, the twists and turns, the relationship between Daemon and Rhaenyra, and Rhaenyra and Alicent. For me, it was quite thrilling to focus on the dramaturgy. I love that. I was excited to dig deep with this. I definitely felt the challenge if people are expecting a big battle, how is this going to compete with it? But having done Episode 8 from Season 1, I knew that if we executed the script it would be grand.

You also directed Episode 3 from this season, which had the secret conversation between Rhaenyra and Alicent in the church. How did you want their scene together in the end of the finale to build upon that previous episode?

We made sure that the scenes between them in Episodes 3 and 8 had an organic storytelling to them, and that there was a rising action between the two of them. We were constantly going back and forth, tweaking this and that — so that those two scenes had a really direct relationship.

We shot that scene at the end of Episode 8 pretty much at the end of the production season. There were two things that were really important: We wanted it to feel like Rhaenyra and Alicent were children again, because that is what that scene was really about. Olivia and Emma did a really great job of bringing that juvenile, fearful, innocent aspect to the scene, where they wrestled between what they know they’re supposed to do and what they’re feeling that’s irrational. The other thing is we wanted to make sure that the scene in Episode 3 was on their minds. They’re like a divorced couple that still loves each other. When you see an ex, it’s almost as if that fight you had, or what they did to you, is fresh in your mind and just happened five minutes ago. We wanted it to be that razor’s edge feeling when we entered this scene between the two of them. They really pushed and pulled each other in a way that I wasn’t sure how they were going to end it.

After their conversation, it seems like there’s still some doubt about whether Alicent is telling the truth to Rhaenyra, or if Rhaenyra fully believes her. How do you interpret that scene and where they leave things?

The actors keep their interpretations very close. That’s the beauty of them coming into the scene in that way. They’re not giving away something that they themselves as characters may not know yet. When we shot it, the most important thing was to know where the shift was in the scene, and that was when Rhaenyra says, “A son for a son.” She’s saying that because she previously says, “You’ve never sacrificed anything, Alicent. You want all this stuff, but you want your cake and to eat it, too.” When I was studying that scene, the first thing I did was I went to the bookend of it, which is Episode 1. The very first scene that Ryan Condal wrote was a voiceover about how we have to sacrifice for duty. If we’re going to treat this like a film, that is the theme of this entire film. This scene needed to focus on that.

There is a moment where Rhaenyra says, “OK, you’re gonna have to sacrifice. If you want something, give up your son.” I think that moment is real and true. When Alicent says, “Yes, you can have my son,” she is giving up her son. The surprise is in the montage later when Aegon has escaped. What’s going to happen now? When Rhaenyra finds out that Aegon left, is she going to interpret that as something that was pre-planned? Is she going to blame Alicent? What does that mean for Alicent?

We meet two brand new dragons in this episode, when Tessarion swoops down over the army and Rhaena comes face to face with Sheepstealer. All the dragons have such distinct looks and feels, how did you create these two introductions?

For the shot you’re talking about where the dragon came up across the people and swooped down, that was just a shot in my head when I read the script. There was something scary but also introductory about it. We have an extraordinary visual effects department that creates each of the dragons’ looks and sounds and feels. They each have personalities. It’s almost like these are actors we’re going to work with. I knew that this dragon needed to bring Rhaena to open eyes — just complete, “Oh my gosh, I’m looking at a dragon!” This was her dream, and she’s the only one who didn’t have a dragon. It was a very big moment for her.

I would kind of equate it as when I first got this show. It had been my dream for eight years. I remember when I got the job, it was just this overwhelming feeling because I wanted it for so long. It wasn’t a coincidence that I got it, I pushed so hard. I related to Rhaena in that moment. You want something so bad and everyone’s telling you that you can’t get it. The shot that I saw immediately in my head with that scene was the big, wide shot of the dragon and little Rhaena. That was David and Goliath.

There are some surprising “Game of Thrones” cameos with Daemon’s vision where he sees Daenerys, the Night King and the Three-Eyed Raven. When you read the script for that scene, how did you go about making the look for this vision?

I was so honored that I would get to be part of executing that. When I received the script, all these beats of the visuals were listed, but there was space for direction. You have to figure out how all those things are going to flow together. You see Daenerys, but how do you see her? Do you see her face? What is she doing? I thought the dragons coming out of her in shadow would be really interesting because it’s not about Daenerys, it’s about the story of history. We’re in Daemon’s point of view, so that vision had to tell the story to Daemon of the history of his people and that Rhaenyra needed to be on the throne. It’s very tempting to be like, “Let’s show Daenerys! Let’s zoom in on this!” But that’s not what it’s about. In fact, Daemon doesn’t know who she is. It has to make Daemon understand that he has to bend the knee to Rhaenyra willingly.

The cameos are great nostalgia and fan-service, but they also serve a storytelling purpose for Daemon. How did you balance those two things?

I was very focused on, “If this is going to be in this vision, what purpose does it play? What part of the story is it telling? How much do we need to tell the story? Let’s not think at all about the fact that this is a fan favorite.” That was really what I tried to do in putting together the storyboards for this, and then executing those. That’s why you don’t see a lot of extra stuff. There could have been, but that’s not the point. If we don’t focus on the point of the story, it just becomes a montage that has no meaning.

Daemon also sees himself drowning in his vision, and right after that scene we see Helaena tell Aemond that he will be swallowed up by the Gods Eye. Fans of the book know what that moment is foreshadowing — but what can you say about shooting that scene? Will we see that vision play out in Season 3?

I can get in trouble if I reveal anything. I will say that when we shot that scene, it was amazing. We had a huge stage, and created these stations. Each station was a moment of that vision. For the drowning, I had wanted a tank, but we didn’t have enough money for an actual tank with water. When I got the storyboards done, somebody in the meeting was like, “What if it’s dragon’s blood instead of water? That’s amazing!”

So we darkened the water into blood, and we ended up shooting it dry for wet — there’s no water actually. It’s just Matt Smith hanging from a rig with fans blowing on him so it looks like he’s underwater. It was really amazing executing all those moments. The roots of the tree that start the whole sequence of the vision, those were built and then brought to life as visual effects. I really wanted it to feel like an umbilical cord. They brought that to life so they were gooey and alive.

When you shot the Night King moment, was it the same costume from “Game of Thrones” just laying around in storage somewhere?

They told me, but I don’t remember. I have the worst memory! I think they did have some left over from “Game of Thrones,” I’m almost positive. It was exciting to shoot that, too. The actor who played the Night King — and he was not the actual Night King, he just played one of them — he was so great. He knew how to move like them. Everybody came down to the set that day to watch us shoot it. Most people who work on this show are fans of “Game of Thrones,” so everybody was lined up watching us do these takes.

We also see Otto Hightower locked up in a dungeon somewhere. Where is he?

I was asked to shoot that scene. I want to know where he is, too. I don’t know! Those guys talk about a lot of things in the writers’ room, and then they don’t tell us. They don’t tell any of us! They don’t tell the actors, either. I don’t think it’s fair.

"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://ew.com/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-ending-explained-where-war-goes-from-here-8687671,"Warning: This article contains spoilers from the House of the Dragon season 2 finale.

House of the Dragon season 1 largely served as set up for the main power players within the Targaryen civil war and the various characters in their orbit. Season 2 was... similar. Fans did not hesitate to show their true feelings through memes and TikToks every time Matt Smith's Prince Daemon had yet another screen time-eating hallucinatory trip at Harrenhal. And though we got the largest dragon dogfight on a Game of Thrones series to date, the violent Battle of Rook's Rest in episode 4, the series wove in multiple other figures involved in the conflict, from Corlys Velaryon's surprise bastards, Alyn (Abubakar Salim) and Addam of Hull (Clinton Liberty), to the ""dragonseeds"" who now mount some of the riderless dragons in Queen Rhaenyra's stable.

If you're hoping to see more action on House of the Dragon, the season 2 finale sets up the pins so that season 3 can start knocking them down right at the jump. We just now have to wait awhile, if the series continues its pattern of releasing one season every two years. At the very least, we now know what's next on the docket, based on how this season concludes.

Note: The following analysis will only acknowledge the book, George R.R. Martin's Fire & Blood, to give added context to scenes in the season 2 finale. All other book spoilers will be left out.

Dragons by the numbers

Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen (Emma D'Arcy) addresses her court of dragonriders on 'House of the Dragon' season 2. Ollie Upton/HBO

Before we dig into where we're going, let's take stock of where we are now.

After the Sowing of the Seeds, the event in which many Targaryen bastards of the smallfolk died trying to become dragonriders for Rhaenyra (Emma D'Arcy), the Black Queen now presides over seven adult dragons: Daemon rides Caraxes, Prince Jacaerys (Harry Collett) rides Vermax, Lady Baela (Bethany Antonia) rides Moondancer, Addam of Hull rides Seasmoke, Hugh (Kieran Bew) rides Vermithor, Ulf (Tom Bennett) rides Silverwing, and Rhaenyra herself rides Syrax.

The queen's youngest sons, Joffrey and Aegon, also have dragons, Stormcloud and Tyraxes, but both children and their steeds are too young to wage battle. Still, the Blacks definitely have the advantage.

On Team Green, King Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney) mentions that his dragon Sunfyre is dead, which is a slight change from the book — though we'll hopefully see how true that assertion is later on. And despite her brother's best attempts at persuasion and threats, Queen Helaena (Phia Saban) refuses to ride her dragon Dreamfyre into battle. Aemond (Ewan Mitchell), the acting prince regent, may have the largest dragon in the world, Vhagar, but even that she-beast cannot overpower all seven of Rhaenyra's dragons should they launch a joint assault.

So the Greens need a new strategy fast — and they have one.

The Battle of the Gullet

Steve Toussaint's Lord Corlys Velaryon on 'House of the Dragon' season 2. Ollie Upton/HBO

Without wading too deeply into book spoilers to preserve the experience for show-only viewers, the Battle of the Gullet is the next major scrimmage that plays out. This is assuming House of the Dragon maintains the timeline of Fire & Blood, but all signs point to that happening.

Ser Tyland Lannister (Jefferson Hall) travels to Essos to secure a pact with the Triarchy's forces. The Greens need to disperse the blockade that the Velaryon fleet maintains around the Gullet, the stretch of water that's crucial to trade going in and out of King's Landing. They need the Triarchy to do so. Tyland is able to achieve an alliance after a playful tussle in the mud with their head commander, Sharako Lohar (Abigail Thorn), and now Sharako is leading the other commanders in their ships towards the Gullet.

Nettles

Lady Rhaena Targaryen (Phoebe Campbell) on 'House of the Dragon' season 2. HBO

Of the characters who play a big part in the Battle of the Gullet in the book, a young woman named Nettles is among them. She's described as a brown-skinned, foul-mouthed orphan girl who joins Team Black as another of Rhaenyra's dragonriders. Instead of bonding with a dragon like the others, she finds a wild one by the name of Sheepstealer and feeds the beast a sheep carcass every day until it becomes accustomed to her.

Nettles has not been mentioned in the show thus far, and yet Lady Rhaena (Phoebe Campbell) seems to be getting her big story points. Having fled the convoy that departed the Eyrie for Essos, Rhaena hopelessly wanders the endless fields of the Vale in search of food and water. She eventually sees a dragon soaring in the sky and tracks it down to its resting place. Rhaena tried, failed, and nearly lost her life the last time she tried to bond with a dragon. The show seems to suggest that she will have better luck this time.

An attack on King's Landing

Emma D'Arcy's Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen on 'House of the Dragon' season 2. MAX

In another moment engineered for the show that doesn't contradict anything in the historical record documented in Fire & Blood, Alicent (Olivia Cooke) travels in secret to meet with Rhaenyra on Dragonstone. Desperate to end the war bloodshed and abscond into obscurity, the dowager queen tells her former childhood friend that Aemond is taking Vhagar and his forces to claim Harrenhal from Daemon. When he does that, Alicent proposes that Rhaenyra swoop in to conquer King's Landing, which Alicent and Queen Helaena will happily allow her to do.

Alicent offers this in good faith, even though she knows it means Rhaenyra must now behead her son Aegon for usurping the Iron Throne in the first place. She urges Rhaenyra to come to King's Landing in three days time to see whether she's lying for herself, which leads to the obvious wrinkle in this plan.

Even if Alicent and Helaena were to roll out the red carpet for Rhaenyra, Aegon will not be there. Lord Larys Strong (Matthew Needham) quietly flees King's Landing undercover with the now-maimed Aegon. Not only will this likely be a problem should Rhaenyra call for his head, but it means one of the most strategic players in the game of thrones is in sole possession of the king that the Greens are fighting so hard for.

Always listen to Helaena

Prince Aemond (Ewan Mitchell) approaches Queen Helaena (Phia Saban) on 'House of the Dragon' season 2. Ollie Upton/HBO

For whatever reason, very few members of Team Green actually listen to Helaena, even though the queen's track record for predicting terrible events before the season 2 finale was a clean four for four. Episode 8 now confirms in a very direct way that Helaena is a dragon dreamer, the rare breed of Targaryen with the mystical power of prophetic visions. She's essentially the Bran Stark of House of the Dragon, so adept in her abilities that she appears to Daemon in the midst of his weirwood tree vision, telling him to take a backseat and play his part in the story being told.

Helaena goes on to give Aemond quite the foreboding psychic reading: he will soon be swallowed by the Gods Eye and never seen again. The Gods Eye is the famous lake located in the Riverlands. The cursed castle of Harrenhal sits at its northern tip. Alys Rivers (Gayle Rankin), the other mystical woman on House of the Dragon, gave Daemon a very similar fortune. While standing before the weirwood tree at night during the Rogue Prince's first stay at Harrenhal, the witch bluntly informs Daemon, ""You will die in this place.""

Aemond and Daemon's arcs have long run parallel to each other. ""They're both the second son,"" Mitchell previously explained to Entertainment Weekly. ""They're both princes who stand to inherit nothing. They recognize that what they want in life and the reputation they want ultimately have to be built by them. It's the duty of the second son to fight the war, and so maybe if those two characters were to enter a room together, I'm sure that any household appliance will become a deadly weapon."" The question is, when will this inevitable collision happen? (Again, no book spoilers.)

And thirdly, amid Helaena's prophetic declarations to Aemond, she says something about her other brother. Aegon, she says, will be king again, but that he sits a wooden throne. Given how irreparably injured he is, a wooden wheelchair seems like a good bet. But then there's the vision Daemon received of Rhaenyra seated on the Iron Throne, suggesting she will be the queen, not Aegon. Helaena was involved in that prophesy, as well. So which one is right? All we'll say is, Helaena always seems to be spot on with her visions. These apparently conflicting predictions don't feel like an error.

What's going on with Otto?

Rhys Ifans as Otto Hightower on 'House of the Dragon' season 2. Ollie Upton/HBO

Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans) is not having a great year. His spoiled grandson fired him as Hand of the King, after which he vowed to travel to Oldtown, the seat of House Hightower and be with his other grandson Daeron. (More on that in a bit.) However, after remaining absent for the vast majority of the season, Otto pops up one more time in a very brief scene: he's crouched on the floor of some kind of jail cell. He looks up, disoriented. Someone holding a candle light approaches his cell off screen. Whatever happened to Otto here is not mentioned in Fire & Blood in this timeline, so it's anyone's guess.

Daeron leads the charge

Daeron rides Tessarion in the 'House of the Dragon' season 2 finale. MAX

Until this season of House of the Dragon, you might not have known that Alicent has four children instead of three, assuming you didn't read Martin's book. Aside from Aegon, Aemond, and Helaena, there's also Daeron Targaryen. He's mentioned for the first time directly in episode 2, ""Rhaenyra the Cruel."" From there on, we learn he's a young 16-year-old who's been warding with the head of House Hightower in Oldtown, Lord Ormund.

Described as ""stalwart,"" ""clever,"" ""kind,"" and equally skilled at the lute and sword, Daeron rides the dragon Tessarion, who can be spotted in the final moments of the season 2 finale flying overhead as the Hightower army begins their march. Daeron is a character fans have been watching out for, given how season 1 didn't even acknowledge him. By all accounts, he will finally make his introduction in season 3, adding his dragon to the ranks of the Greens.

While it might have been an underwhelming episode for most fans (as per reactions on social media), it did have a lot to offer. One major thing that the last episode did was to set stage for House of the dragon season 3. So as the current season comes to and end, here's a look at a few things that happened in the end and also what to expect from the third season.

House of the Dragon season 2 Episode 8 finale ending explained - Some key points to know

Following King's Landing's collapse, Rhaenyra imprisons Helaena and Alicent. Tragically, Helaena ends her own life, leaving Alicent a prisoner in King's Landing.

When Aemond Targaryen sees Rhaenyra's new dragonriders, he flees Dragonstone and unleashes his wrath on the nearby Sharp Point, setting the city and its defenseless citizens on fire.

The last scenes show Aegon and Larys leaving the city, Helaena practically accepting to ride her dragon, and the Tyland Lannisters' new fleet making their way there.

A blue dragon soars overhead on its journey to King's Landing, followed by a scene of soldiers holding Hightower banners in the episode's concluding clip. Tessarion, the blue dragon, is ridden by Daeron Targaryen, Viserys and Alicent's fourth child, who is currently missing.

Team Black and Team Green fought for alliances for a large portion of the season, and now the stage is set for a brutal conflict in Season 3.



What will happen in House of the Dragon season 3?

Several armies are seen leaving for battle at the close of the episode, most likely from Harrenhaal, where Daemon and his Riverlands soldiers are waiting. Thus, as per Gamesradar, there is anticipation that these men will go to battle in season three. On the other hand, it appears like Team Green's dragons will fly in the direction of King's Landing. But Aegon is currently traveling with Lord Larys Strong to hide, thus that could be a problem for the legitimate Queen. (More battles incoming).

"‘House of the Dragon’ to End With Season 4, Season 3 to End.",https://nypost.com/2024/08/04/entertainment/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-finale-daenerys-returns/,"Spoilers ahead for the Season 2 finale of “House of the Dragon.”

Khaleesi is back.

In the Season 2 finale of “House of the Dragon,” there’s an unexpected cameo from a major “Game of Thrones” character: Daenerys Targaryen.

Well, sort of.

6 Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) appears in the “House of the Dragon” Season 2 finale, sort of. helen sloan

Daenerys was born around 200 years after the events of this show. And, Emilia Clarke didn’t return. So, how did Daenerys appear without the actress, during the era of her ancestors?

Here’s what happens.

All season long, Daemon Targaryen (Matt Smith) has been having wild dreams / visions.

In the Season 2 finale, he has a vision that includes seeing the White Walkers, the Three-Eyed Raven, Daenerys’ three dragon eggs and Daenerys herself at the end of “Game of Thrones” Season 1 (where she’s naked, emerging from fire unburnt, with her three newly born baby dragons crawling on her).

Her back is to the camera, so if it was really Clarke, they’d show her face. Nevertheless, it’s unquestionably Daenerys that Daemon is seeing in his vision.

She will be born over a hundred years in the future, but at least one of her ancestors is already seeing her.

6 Daemon sees Daenerys during the famous “Game of Thrones” Season 1 scene when she’s nude and unburnt from fire, and her baby dragons are born. HBO

In the vision, Daemon also sees himself submerged into a large body of water, he glimpses his niece/wife Rhaenyra (Emma D’Arcy) sitting on the Iron Throne, and he sees Rhaenyra’s half-sister, Helaena Targaryen (Phia Saban), who tells him, “It’s all a story and you’re but one part in it. You know your part. You know what you must do.”

This vision helps Daemon – who has been waffling all season in his support of Rhaenyra – re-affirm that he supports her as the rightful Queen of Westeros.

“House of the Dragon” is about a civil war between Rhaenyra and her half-brother, Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney), who usurped her throne.

Season 2 ends with Aegon escaping the city in a covered wagon – he got horribly injured earlier in the season by his brother, Aemond (Ewan Mitchell). Aemond has ruled in his place while he’s recovered.

Aegon gets persuaded that he should go lie low while Aemond and Rhaenyra fight. Then, after the dust has settled, he can return to rule as “Aegon the victorious.”

Meanwhile, Aemond unsuccessfully tries to get his sister, Helaena, to fly her dragon and support him in war.

Helaena, who is a Dreamer (someone who has prophetic dreams and visions), tells him, “Aegon will be king again. He has yet to see victory. He sits on a wooden throne. And you. You’ll be dead. You are swallowed up in the Gods Eye and you are never seen again.”

The Gods Eye is a large lake in the Riverlands.

In the final shots of the Season 2 finale, Aemond and Rhaenyra’s respective armies are shown marching, preparing to go to war against each other.

Rhaenyra has three more dragon riders: Addam (Clinton Liberty), Ulf (Tom Bennett) and Hugh (Kieran Bew), who are also shown suiting up with armor.

And, Aegon and Aemond’s mom, Alicent (Olivia Cooke) secretly visits Rhaenyra to tell her that she’d leave the city gates open so that Rhaenyra can come in as a “conqueror” without spilling blood, and take the Iron Throne, after Aemond goes off to fight.

6 Daemon also re-affirms his support for Rhaenyra at the end of “House of the Dragon” Season 2. Ollie Upton/HBO

Season 2 has been a mixed bag. The dragon battle in which Aemond burned Aegon was the high point.

But the show spent too much time spinning its wheels around Daemon’s dream sequences, which felt like they were just stalling and benching him.

It also slowed down the plot after that battle, but it didn’t have good character development in place of plot.

For instance, Hugh is still barely a fleshed out character. We spent a little time with him, but most of what we know about his personality is, “he has a worried wife.”

The show is still struggling to flesh out its large cast of characters – Helaena could be intriguing, but at the moment, the show hasn’t given her depth. She’s barely a character. She appears on-screen for 30 seconds every few episodes to say something cryptic or ominous before vanishing from the story again.

6 Daenerys Targaryen makes a surprise cameo in the “House of the Dragon” Season 2 finale.

Rhaena (Phoebe Campbell), who seems to claim a large dragon this episode, could also be an interesting and sympathetic character for the audience to follow – maybe we’d like her as much as Arya or Sansa Stark in “GoT.” But, it’s hard to feel that way about Rhaena when she gets so much less screen time and development than the Stark sisters. Similar to Helaena, she appears on-screen for 30 seconds every handful of episodes.

For all of its faults, “Game of Thrones” juggled its large cast well, and made every character feel like they had depth and personality. “House of the Dragon” struggled to do that in Season 2. It had a lot of dramatic deaths, but they lacked emotional impact, since we hardly knew some of these people.

The show is oddly paced; it’s slow-walking this war, but it’s not using its time wisely, to fully develop many of these characters.

“House of the Dragon” has been renewed for Season 3, but a premiere date has not been announced."
Zac Efron is ‘happy and healthy’ after recovering from swimming.,https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2024-08-05/zac-efron-hospitalized-ibiza-swimming-pool-accident,"Zac Efron has come up for air after a report that he was hospitalized after an accident while swimming in Ibiza.

Zac Efron has weighed in after a Friday incident in a swimming pool in Ibiza, Spain, that saw him taken to a hospital .

The actor shared a photo on his Instagram story Sunday showing himself shirtless in the sunshine, lifting weights on a pink yoga ball. “happy and healthy– thanks for the well wishes,” the text said.

On Friday, the “Iron Claw” actor was taken to the hospital as a precaution after sustaining a “minor swimming injury” while staying at a villa in Ibiza, TMZ reported. The actor, 36, was found in the swimming pool by two employees at the villa who pulled him out of the water, according to the outlet. An Efron spokesperson declined to give further details.

Representatives for Efron did not immediately respond to The Times’ request for comment Monday.

The “High School Musical” alum was seen the night before the incident in a video posted on TikTok, onstage with DJ Martin Garrix at a hotel nightclub. He’s been here and there around Europe in recent weeks, according to paparazzi photos.

His travels also included attending the opening ceremony at the 2024 Paris Olympics. Later, he posted an Instagram story saying he was “so incredibly proud” of U.S. gymnast Simone Biles, who won three gold medals and one silver at this year’s games.

It was a full-circle moment after Efron famously surprised a then-teen Biles on the “Today” show during the 2016 Rio Olympics.

The show kept the actor hidden backstage at the International Interview Center for several hours , until he and host Hoda Kotb watched Biles compete in the floor exercise and win the gold medal. While Efron remained off-camera for a bit in what he described as “a closet,” the whole U.S. team was brought into the room. Kotb reminded Biles of a previous interview where she had joked that she would need a defibrillator if a certain celebrity showed up.

“Stop,” a shocked Biles replied. “If you bring him out, I think I’m gonna pass out. Stop.”

Television Commentary: NBC’s Olympic obsession with celebrities is a little cringe The Summer Games in Paris have been a star-studded affair. But for The Times’ most avid Olympic watchers, NBC’s focus on celebrities has been largely an annoying distraction.

When Efron appeared, the room erupted in screams. Laurie Hernandez was the first to hug him, followed by Biles, Aly Raisman and Madison Kocian. The group took selfies and exchanged kisses, with the 5-foot-8 Efron lifting the 4-foot-8 Biles onto his hip.

“Just call me Mrs. Efron already Zac Efron,” Biles wrote in a 2016 Facebook post.

Efron recently appeared with Nicole Kidman and Joey King in the Netflix original film “A Family Affair.” The romantic dramedy follows Brooke Harwood, played by Kidman, who begins a relationship with younger actor Chris Cole, played by Efron. Complicating the situation: Cole works for Hardwood’s daughter Zara, played by King.

The “17 Again” actor is also set to star in the upcoming Disney reboot of the 1987 comedy “3 Men and a Baby,” currently in pre-production. His is the only name attached so far to a cast that will go where Tom Selleck, Steve Guttenberg, Ted Danson and a whole lot of diapers went previously.

What else do we know?

Efron — who has had a busy year, also including the films Ricky Stanicky and The Iron Claw — has been vacationing in Europe. Leading up to his swimming incident, he appeared onstage with DJ Martin Garrix at his performance at the Ushuaïa Ibiza Hotel and Beach Club. A TikTok video showed Efron dancing along as the audience cheered.

It’s been 10 years since Efron was hospitalized after another accident: In November 2013, he was running through his house in socks and slipped. He hit his face on a granite fountain, shattering his jaw, and was knocked unconscious. Efron opened up about the 2013 accident to Men’s Health in 2022, saying when he came to, his chinbone was hanging off his face. Efron said he looks different because in the aftermath of the injury, other facial muscles had to compensate for the muscles that were still recovering.

In June, amid the release of A Family Affair on Netflix, there was online chatter about Efron’s appearance. Pointing to that film as well as his massive transformation to play a wrestler in The Iron Claw, people speculated online that he had undergone plastic surgery on his jaw.

Efron told the Hollywood Reporter in December, when The Iron Claw was released, that his physical transformation for that film was “jarring,” even to him.

“In the best way possible, I did not look anything like me,” he said. However, he’s also said that what the internet thinks of him and his appearance isn’t something he pays that much mind to.

“If I valued what other people thought of me to the extent that they may think I do, I definitely wouldn’t be able to do this work,” he told Men’s Health in 2022."

Zac Efron is on the mend after he was reportedly pulled out of a swimming pool and subsequently hospitalized. The 36-year-old actor took to his Instagram Stories on Sunday, August 4, to share a workout photo of himself, proving to fans that he’s recovering.

“Happy and healthy,” Zac wrote across a snap of himself lifting weights. “Thanks for the well wishes.”

Over the weekend, TMZ reported that the High School Musical star was taken to a hospital in Spain after a “minor swimming incident” at an Ibiza villa, a rep for Zac told the outlet. Sources claimed that Zac was discovered inside the pool by two workers, and they pulled him out of the water.

It’s still unclear what led to the brief scare, but he was released from the hospital hours later.

This isn’t the first time that the A Family Affair star was hospitalized. In 2013, Zac shattered his jaw after slipping and falling at home, and landing on his face. He had to have his mouth wired shut as a result.

Following the accident, social media trolls speculated that Zac underwent plastic surgery, which he noted was “funny” during an interview with Entertainment Tonight in 2022.

“I don’t really read the internet, so, I don’t really give a f**k,” the Greatest Showman actor said. “It was funny. It sucks. I almost died, but we’re good.”

Zac also spoke to Men’s Health that year about his facial changes, noting that he needed physical therapy to recover. The masseter muscles in his face augmented over time, causing his face to look different.

“The masseters just grew. They just got really, really big,” he explained to the publication in 2022. As for how he dealt with the gossip about his appearance, Zac pointed out, “If I valued what other people thought of me to the extent that they may think I do,” he adds, “I definitely wouldn’t be able to do this work.”

Aside from Zac’s recent health scare, he’s been an avid supporter of Team USA at the Olympics. Last week, he congratulated Simone Biles on her accomplishments.

Hollywood actor Zac Efron was discharged from a Spanish hospital on August 4 after a pool incident in Ibiza.

Zac Efron admitted to a hospital after a pool incident in Ibiza

The charismatic actor was admitted for hospital treatment on August 3 but was quickly discharged the following morning. A spokesperson shared that a “minor swimming incident” had occurred in a Spanish villa where Efron had been staying. Sources reported that the 36-year-old actor was “found inside the swimming pool by two people working at the villa,” who “pulled him out of the water.”

The cause of Efron´s incident has not been revealed but after his discharge, he posted a photo of himself on Instagram, lifting barbells on an exercise ball. He wrote in the caption; “Happy and healthy, thanks for the well wishes,” as he posed shirtless while working out, appearing perfectly fit.

This summer, Efron has been spotted travelling across Europe and was recently seen thriving in the Ibiza party culture, as he lit up the stage with the iconic DJ Martin Garrix at Ushuaïa.

Zac Efron takes a Spanish holiday after filming A Family Affair

Work hard, play hard may be Zac Efron´s motto, as before embarking on the exotic summer trip, he gave a strong performance in a Netflix rom-com A Family Affair, co-starring with Nicole Kidman. An unlikely and striking pair, the two played the roles of Chris and Brooke, an odd couple brought together by chance.

In the 2024 film, Zac Efron took on the role of a hilariously vain movie star, who after constant fights with his assistant Zara, encounters her mother, Brooke; the two find themselves forming a strange but special connection after a couple of tequila shots.

A comedy that pokes fun at age and gender standards, the movie reflects on mother-and-daughter relationships and unlikely, wild romances. “There´s a lot of hysterical laughing that´s cut off. We had a blast,” said Efron to the Press about filming A Family Affair.

Directed by Richard LaGravenese, A Family Affair is now available on streaming platforms."

The update left his fans extremely worried. The ‘High School Musical’ actor is now doing fine, as he took to Instagram and shared a photograph in which he could be seen lifting weights while lying on top of an exercise ball.

“Happy and healthy,” he captioned the post.

Zac also thanked everyone for their well wishes.

As per ‘People’ magazine, on August 2, Zac was staying at a villa in Ibiza when he had a “minor swimming incident” while using the pool. He was taken to the hospital for precautionary measures and was released the next morning.

Last week, days before the mishap, Zac was spotted onstage with DJ Martin Garrix during his performance at the Ushuaia Ibiza Hotel and Beach Club in the Spanish city.

In a video captured by the “Animals” musician’s fans on social media, Zac could be seen walking onstage during one of Garrix’s songs and dancing alongside him, to plenty of cheers from the crowd.

The actor has had a busy year thus far, having appeared in The Iron Claw, Ricky Stanicky and most recently, his romcom alongside Nicole Kidman and Joey King, A Family Affair.

In June, Zac and co-star Kidman, interacted with People about their NSFW comedy — and revealed that before it was called A Family Affair, it had a different, much raunchier name.

“Somehow, that didn’t make it onto the Netflix title,” she joked, while Efron added that the eye-catching title made him strongly consider taking on the project.

“That made the script stay at the top of the pile,” Efron said. “It’s like, what on Earth could this be about?”

“I jumped. I think we both kind of did. We jumped at it,” Efron said of his and Kidman’s enthusiasm to work together again, after they previously co-starred in 2013’s The Paperboy.

“It was like, this is perfect. What better way to reconnect? And we get to have fun.”"

Elaborating on his adventures, he noted: ""A new part of the world, trying the food, meeting the people, finding out as much about their culture as possible."" He concluded by extolling the virtues of travel, saying: ""It is a great way to live, and it opens your eyes to something much bigger than Hollywood, it can all feel very small if you're stuck in LA and I was stuck there for quite a few years.""

Zac, who has been touring Europe in recent months, previously suffered a horrific accident that shattered his jaw. In 2022, the Hollywood star opened up to Men's Health for their October cover story about how he shattered his jaw while running in his house with socks on. The actor disclosed that he slipped and hit the corner of a fountain before passing out, stating his ""chin bone"" was 'hanging off' his face.

While recuperating from the injury, Zac's facial muscles became ""really big"", leading him to work with a physical therapist. He added: ""The masseters just grew. They just got really, really big."" The masseter is the muscle in your face and jaw and is one of the primary muscles of chewing.

Before Zac addressed the whispers of him having gone under the knife, gossip had already taken flight about potential plastic surgery. The beloved thespian squashed these cosmetic whispers during a chinwag with Entertainment Tonight, revealing his obliviousness to the speculation until his mum dropped the bombshell. ""My mom told me. I never really read the internet, so, I don't really care,"" said Zac, shrugging off the tittle-tattle. ""It was funny. It sucks. I almost died, but we're good,"" he elaborated."

What else do we know?

Efron — who has had a busy year, including with the films Ricky Stanicky And The Iron Claw — is vacationing in Europe. In the run-up to his swimming incident, he appeared on stage with DJ Martin Garrix during his performance at the Ushuaïa Ibiza Hotel and Beach Club. A TikTok video showed Efron dancing as the crowd cheered.

It’s been 10 years since Efron was hospitalized after another accident: In November 2013, he was running through his house in his socks when he slipped and hit his face on a granite fountain, fracturing his jaw and knocking him unconscious. Efron candidly spoke to Men’s Health in 2022 about the 2013 accident, saying that when he woke up, his chin bone was hanging off his face. Efron said he looks different because the injury caused other facial muscles to compensate for those still in the process of healing.

In June, amid the release of A family affair on Netflix, Efron’s appearance was talked about online. Pointing to that film and his huge transformation to play a wrestler in The iron claw, People speculated online that he had plastic surgery on his jaw.

Efron told the Hollywood Reporter in december, when The Iron Claw was released, that his physical transformation for that film was “shocking” even to him.

“In the best possible way, I looked nothing like myself,” he said. However, he has also said that what the internet thinks of him and his appearance is not something he pays much attention to.

“If I cared as much about what other people thought of me as they do, I absolutely would not be able to do this job,” he told Men’s Health in 2022."

Ben Affleck is holding back on filing for divorce to ‘protect her’.,https://pagesix.com/2024/08/05/celebrity-news/jennifer-lopez-humiliated-amid-ben-affleck-split/,"Jennifer Lopez is “furious” and “humiliated” over her split from Ben Affleck, says a source, who tells Page Six that the “Gone Girl” star is holding off on filing for divorce to spare her more embarrassment.

“She’s furious,” says the source. “He has humiliated her. He was the one who initiated getting back together.”

The “Jenny from the Block” chart-topper and Affleck rekindled their relationship in July 2021, following Lopez’s split from her former fiancé, Alex Rodriguez, in April 2021.

Lopez, 55, and Affleck, 51, previously dated from 2002 to 2004 after infamously starring together in the movie “Gigli.”

“He’s humiliated her because she made a big deal that he’s the love of her life,” explains the source. “They just had two weddings two years ago. This is some kind of a record, they’re not young kids.”

The pair eloped in Las Vegas in July 2022, and had another wedding celebration at Affleck’s home in Riceboro, Georgia, the next month.

Lopez’s album, “This Is Me…Now,” and the accompanying Amazon Prime documentary, “The Greatest Love Story Never Told,” co-starring Affleck, was inspired by their relationship.

“She is a romantic,” says our source.

6 The pair had two weddings in 2022, and Lopez made an album and film about their relationship.

6 The couple had blended their families. MEGA

We hear that the “Hustlers” star is also upset because the couple’s respective children are involved.

“There are five kids involved in this,” says the source. “She knew they were going to blend families. She has not fully accepted it is over.”

Lopez has twins — Max and Emme, 16 — from her previous marriage to Marc Anthony, while Affleck shares Violet, 18, Fin, 17, and Samuel, 12, from his previous marriage to Jennifer Garner.

We hear Lopez is particularly close with Violet.

We’re told Affleck — who just purchased a $20.5 million Pacific Palisades, Calif., home after his marital residence with Lopez was put on the market for $68 million — is holding off filing for divorce in order to avoid humiliating her further, says another source.

“He’s very protective of her,” says the source.

According to TMZ, Affleck and Lopez are no longer speaking — which is reportedly slowing down the divorce process.

Insiders told the outlet that the “Love Don’t Cost a Thing” singer and “The Town” actor have not hired divorce lawyers, and instead are having their business managers hash out the details.

Ben Affleck is holding back on filing for divorce to ‘protect her’.,https://nypost.com/2024/08/05/us-news/the-double-haters-will-decide-the-presidential-election-even-with-biden-out/,"Kamala Harris’ emergence as the Democrats’ presidential nominee seems to have upset the pre-Harris narrative that the race would be decided by the “double haters” — voters who disliked Donald Trump and Joe Biden.

Not so fast.

That group is smaller than it was but still holds the key to the outcome.

Before Biden’s decision to drop out, the number of double haters was the highest in modern American history. The precise total varied depending on the poll, but generally between 20% and 25% of voters disliked both men.

Vice President Kamala Harris arrives to speak during a campaign rally, July 30, 2024, in Atlanta. AP

That was substantially higher than the prior record, the 18% who disliked both Trump and Hillary Clinton in the 2016 contest. These voters decided that race by backing Trump with a 17-point margin. That allowed him to close a 5-point gap in favorability, letting him get close enough to Clinton in the popular vote to allow him to capture an Electoral College majority.

Common wisdom so far is the double haters are no longer so crucial. It’s true they have shrunk dramatically in size, but the near-parity between Trump’s and Harris’ favorability numbers means they still hold the key to the election.

I calculated the two candidates’ favorability ratings using polls taken at least partially on or after June 21, when Biden announced his departure. Harris’ popularity has surged, but she still has only a 44.7% favorability rating. Trump’s is statistically identical at 44.3%.

Do the math: Assuming no one likes both candidates, 11% of voters still are not favorable to both people. That’s much lower than pre-June 21 or 2016, but it is much higher than 2020’s 2%.

This puts them in the campaign’s driver’s seat. Exit polls show voters who like a candidate are almost certain to vote for them. Clinton got 98% of the people who liked only her in 2016, for example, and Biden got 95% of those who liked him in 2020.

Donald Trump arrives to speak at a campaign rally, July 31, 2024, in Harrisburg, Pa. AP

Trump’s numbers in both races mirrored the two Democrats’: If you liked him, you were 95% to 98% likely to vote for him.

Based on this, the national race is essentially tied right now. That means the double haters have as much power as they did in 2016 to determine the victor even though their numbers have shrunk.

We don’t have any hard analysis of these voters; it’s too soon for that given Harris’ quick polling rise. But the inferential data suggest they would tilt slightly toward Trump if forced.

This is what a careful look at the difference between what the two-candidate polling shows and what polls that include Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other minor-party candidates conclude.

Trump leads the two-candidate race by 1.2 points on the RealClearPolitics polling average. But he leads the multi-candidate race on the polling average by only 0.3 points.

The inference is clear. We know that nearly 100% of third-party-candidate votes come from “double haters.” The fact that Trump gains once third-party candidates are removed from polls shows he would be their favorite right now if they were forced to choose between him and Harris.

This matters because of the known propensity of double haters to drop their support for third-party candidates at the last minute. That happened in 2016, where the final pre-election polling average showed Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Jill Stein winning a combined 6.6%, with Trump trailing by 3.3 points.

But when the votes were tallied, Johnson and Stein won only 4.4% between them. Trump lost by only 2.1%. That last-minute shift gave him the votes he needed to narrowly win the presidency.

It may be that one candidate will surge in popularity and make the analysis moot. If Harris or Trump, for example, has a 50% favorability on Election Day, she or he will garner about 50% of the vote and probably win.

But if neither candidate gets to that magic mark, all bets are off. If the two candidates’ favorability remains well below 50% and within a point or two of one another, it doesn’t matter how small the double-hater category is. They will decide the winner if they break even a bit in favor of one candidate.

It rarely pays to bet against the house, but political common wisdom isn’t the house. Watch the two candidates’ favorability ratings closely as the race heats up. If it stays as close as it is now, figuring out where the double haters will go will be the difference between victory and defeat."

The “Air” star appears to have fallen victim to a breakup haircut, having debuted a brand-new faux hawk over the weekend as he headed to his office.

The perpetually brooding actor complemented his rocker look with a Red Hot Chili Peppers T-shirt, a leather jacket, aviator sunglasses, black boots and distressed gray jeans.

Affleck, 51, removed his wedding ring for the outing.

The Oscar winner’s dramatic haircut comes as he and Jennifer Lopez are reportedly no longer talking as their business managers figure out the finances of their seemingly imminent divorce.

The “Let’s Get Loud” singer, 55, has spent the entire summer on the East Coast while Affleck has remained in LA filming the sequel to “The Accountant.”

Affleck is no stranger to making dramatic cosmetic decisions in light of a breakup, as he famously inked his entire backside with a colorful phoenix following his divorce from Jennifer Garner.

Affleck claimed at the time that it was for a role but eventually admitted it was permanent.

“It represents something very important to me. It’s meaningful to me,” he said in 2019. “I like it. It’s something that I sort of kept private, I wasn’t doing photo shoots or whatever. I love my tattoo. I’m very happy with it.”

Although the “Gone Girl” actor didn’t go into detail about the phoenix’s meaning – it’s typically a symbol of rebirth – he did allude the the tumultuous decade he had been having.

“There’s temptation to get like — I could get depressed, I could be like, ‘I’ve been through a lot. That was hard, this was hard,’ or I could be kind of embarrassed. But I have to say, I feel so good right now,” Affleck said, hinting at his stint in rehab and battle with alcoholism.

“I’m in such a great place, kids are healthy, life is good. So whatever it took for me to get to this place, I’m grateful for.”"

Over the weekend, the “On the Floor” singer was spotted touring a $68 million mansion in Beverly Hills, Calif., about 15 minutes away from her and Ben Affleck’s shared marital home, which is on the market for the same price.

Lopez, 55, ditched her wedding ring as she went to check out the five-bedroom, seven-bathroom home alongside her 16-year-old child Emme and a real estate agent, pictures obtained by TMZ reveal.

The threesome kicked off the day with a quick coffee stop before heading over to the 12,294-square-foot home, which features an infinity-edge pool, a home gym, a 1,200-bottle wine cellar, full sports courts, a 10-seat theatre and more.

While it’s unclear if the “Wedding Planner” star liked the modern pad, she has some cash to burn after selling her New York City apartment for $23 million last month.

Oddly enough, Affleck purchased a $20.5 million home in the Pacific Palisades the same day that Lopez finalized the deal.

Both real estate transactions took place on July 24 — the singer’s birthday.

While Lopez was busy celebrating her big day in the Hamptons with friends, Affleck signed the dotted line for the five-bedroom, six-bathroom home.

The “Argo” actor’s new bachelor pad is drastically smaller than his and Lopez’s 38,000-square-foot manse, which he reportedly “never liked” due to its size and the distance from his kids.

Affleck, who recently debuted a new look, shares Violet, 18, Seraphina, 15, and Samuel, 12, with his ex-wife, Jennifer Garner.

“Ben really likes his new home and feels hopeful about the change,” a source told “Entertainment Tonight” last week. “He wanted to move and be closer to Jen Garner and their kids to make co-parenting easier.”

While the “Good Will Hunting” star is focused on his family, he and Lopez reportedly aren’t on speaking terms.

TMZ reported Monday that things are no longer amicable between the couple, who wed in July 2022.

The pair reportedly refuse to talk in person or over the phone, meaning most communication has been going through their respective business managers.

The lack of communication has reportedly slowed down their divorce proceedings, which is being handled by their managers rather than divorce lawyers.

According to TMZ, Affleck and Lopez have a prenup and the only asset they have left to divvy up is their Beverly Hills mansion, which they bought last year for just over $60 million."

Affleck, at that time, was off-and-on dating Gwyneth Paltrow. Lopez filed for divorce and made her couple debut with Affleck soon thereafter.

In November 2002, they got engaged and released the famous “Jenny on the Block” music video in which they co-starred, and for nearly a full year, the world belonged to Bennifer.

Things still seemed hot and heavy for Affleck and Lopez up until days before their September 2003 nuptials, when they released a last-minute announcement that the big day was off. In January 2004, the couple confirmed that they were going their separate ways. And five months later, Lopez married Marc Anthony in a secret ceremony.

Lopez and Anthony went on to welcome twins Max and Emme in 2008 before separating in 2011 and finalizing their divorce the following year,

Affleck, meanwhile, started dating ex-wife Jennifer Garner in August 2004 before marrying her in June the following year. They welcomed their first child, Violet, in December 2005, their second, Seraphina, in January 2009, and their third child, Samuel, in February 2012. In June 2015, amid Affleck’s addiction issues and allegations of infidelity, the couple announced their separation. They officially finalized their divorce in 2018.

Star-crossed lovers Affleck and Lopez maintained nothing but admiration for one another throughout all these years apart, and, in 2021, amid Lopez’s sad split from ex-fiancé Alex Rodriguez, they once again crossed paths, first spotted hanging out around Los Angeles. Soon after the world exploded over the news, everyone’s hearts stopped when they announced the return of Bennifer: Bennifer 2.0.

After they reconciled in April 2021, they were seen smooching and cuddling at a bunch of their movie premieres. They didn’t care who was watching, they just wanted the world to know they were back and better than ever.

Almost a year later, the biggest news of 2022 broke when Bennifer 2.0 put a ring on it again. Lopez uploaded a beautiful, teary-eyed video to her web page, confirming she and Affleck were engaged and showing off the glittering green engagement ring Affleck gave her.

Then, on July 17, the two ended up eloping in Las Vegas! One of our favorite parts of their romance part II? We’re getting new songs inspired by their love. Lopez is putting out a new album called This Is Me…Now, which reflects on their relationship. “We captured me at this moment in time when I was reunited with the love of my life and we decided we were going to be together forever. The whole message of the album [This Is Me…Now] is, ‘This love exists. This is a real love,'” Lopez told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe in a 2022 interview.

However, breakup rumors started all over again in May 2024 and have persisted ever since, especially since they no longer live together, spent the summer apart, or have been spotted without their wedding rings.

This marks the first time the star has completely ditched her wedding bands - after Affleck showed off his own ring-free hand while debuting a midlife crisis makeover of a faux hawk and rocker tee on Saturday.

In recent months, the once-loved up couple - who previously dated from 2002 to 2004 - have been pictured without their wedding rings and now look set to push ahead with their divorce after a final attempt at reconciliation failed.

And as reports about the fate of their A-list union reach fever pitch, the couple has seemingly cut all ties to one another.

According to TMZ, the Love Don't Cost A Thing songstress and the Gone Girl star have stopped talking altogether - making it even more difficult for the pair to reach an agreement.

The outlet revealed that the Hollywood heavyweights have been making their separation harder by keeping tight-lipped - refusing to talk in person or over the phone.

TMZ reported that the celebrities are yet to enlist the help of lawyers and have instead gone through their respective business managers.

However, they plan to hire divorce lawyers after they reach a settlement.

Last week, a friend of the couple told DailyMail.com that they are still set to divorce.

The news came after Ben splashed out a whopping $20.5 million on a new 'bachelor pad' mansion in the Pacific Palisades on July 24 - the day his spouse celebrated her birthday.

And according to Jennifer's friends, the purchase left her furious and felt like a 'stab to the heart.'

Ben's lavish purchase came days after the couple listed their Beverly Hills mansion for $68 million.

And July 24 also marked the day the singer finalized the sale of her four-bedroom New York City penthouse for $23 million, People reported.

'They finalized the divorce papers with her a month ago, but are waiting for the right time to drop them,' one source close to the duo claimed.

'At that time, they will release a joint statement that will say how they have much love for each other and how they fought to make it work, but couldn't.

'Honestly, in the end they could not come to a compromise. What they had before is gone and they have both accepted it,' another source claimed.

The couple showed that they had no plans of romancing as they even spent their wedding anniversary, which was on July 16, in different cities.

Reports of Ben and Jennifer's marital woes began circulating in May when a sources close to the couple reported Ben had moved into a $100,000 rental and the couple intended to sell their 'dream home'.

A separate source noted that the rift between the husband and wife had been 'difficult day-to-day' amid basic philosophical differences.

'She likes to open her heart to her fans and to the world,' the source said. 'He is more introspective and private.'

Susan Wild’s personal Facebook account is the gift that keeps on giving.

Resurfaced screenshots show the Dem congresswoman cheered on the publication of then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s address during the federal government shutdown in January 2019.

Then a first term rep, Wild made two comments under Facebook user Paul Lichty’s post sharing McConnell’s home address in Washington, D.C., suggesting it be emblazoned on a billboard, presumably to direct protesters to McConnell’s home.

4 Wild wrote that somebody should put the address on a billboard.

“Someone should take out a billboard,” Wild replied to Lichty’s post.

“Indeed!” Lichty shot back.

The exchange continued with Wild implying that federal workers impacted by the shutdown should “visit” McConnell’s residence “in the suburbs of DC where many of those workers live.”

Lichty then replied that “a few (thousands) would show up for a chat” with McConnell.

Wild, who represents Pennsylvania’s competitive 7th congressional district, is no stranger to making disparaging statements.

Earlier this summer, Wild was forced to lock her Facebook account after being called out for a bizarre comment she made on the platform calling a veteran she encountered at a Memorial Day parade homophobic.

Previously, the House Ethics Committee ranking member questioned the intelligence of Carbon County voters by saying she needed to “school them” on their strong support for former President Donald Trump.

The rural area had just been added to Wild’s district at the time of her comments in 2022, thus reddening the district.

Wild doubled down on her comments last January, saying on a Zoom call that she was “dismayed” when Carbon County became part of her district because its residents had “drunk the Trump Kool-Aid.”

Wild is seeking a fourth term against GOP state Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, who wasted no time in ripping the incumbent’s comments Monday.

“Despite her claims that she is ‘moderate and bipartisan’, Susan Wild has earned a reputation for making offensive statements about the people she is elected to represent,” Mackenzie said.

“Unfortunately, reckless and threatening comments like the ones in today’s story take her political rhetoric to a dangerous new level — one that has no place in the Lehigh Valley,” Mackenzie added, referring to the geographic region of his eastern Pennsylvania district."

Somos, which bills itself as a “a Latino-led, Latino-focused organization aimed at empowering hardworking Latinos year-round to participate in our nation’s democracy by taking action in our own communities,” commissioned the survey BSP Research conducted of 800 Hispanic voters from seven key states — and released it Monday to the left-leaning New Republic, which predictably frames the group’s efforts as working.

Harris, per the survey, leads 55% to 37% among voters from that demographic in seven key battlegrounds: Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia and North Carolina.

The pollsters say the data show Harris has a “very strong lead among Latinos” in what they bill as polling that contains a “large enough sample in them to arrive at a confident estimate of the two-party vote in the states that will actually decide the election.”

“Harris has strengthened and consolidated support,” said Melissa Morales, president and founder of Somos PAC.

What’s more: The poll suggests Harris could juice turnout, with 34% of Latinos more excited about voting with her on the ballot, while 10% are less interested in participating in November.

Morales argues former President Donald Trump has “very low favorability within the Latino community,” topping out, and his numbers will keep declining the “more we remind them who Trump actually is.”

The poll suggests that compared with Trump, Harris is well-regarded with Hispanic voters. She’s 21 points above water (55% to 34%) with Latino men under 30 years of age and at 70% approval against 23% disapproval with women in the same age bracket. She also enjoys 69% approval with Hispanics in Nevada and 54% among them in Arizona, one of the places the Biden border policy has harmed the most.

Speaking of the border, the polling indicates Harris’ immigration policy should not be, as she might put it, “unburdened by what has been.”

Asked about combining increased border security with amnesty for illegal immigrants, a position the “border czar” now favors, 65% of respondents view Harris more favorably.

Somos PAC has put its money where its messaging is already in this campaign. As NBC News reported in the spring, during what was a very different presidential race, the group had committed to spending $57 million in eight battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin. Crucially, half that spending will be in Nevada and Arizona.

For its part, the Harris campaign says its “winning coalition from 2020 is energized” and Hispanics are a big part of that.

“Since the Vice President launched her campaign, we’ve seen historic enthusiasm from key parts of the Democratic base: Black voters, Latino voters, AANHPI voters, women, and young voters,” claimed Harris’ battleground states director Dan Kanninen in a weekend memo.

Trump’s campaign had a more visible strategy against President Biden with Hispanic voters than against Harris, including a July ad buy in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.

Team Trump said then it was confident in its ability to cut into Democratic support from Hispanic communities, which contain more than 36 million voters and nearly 15% of the electorate, per the Pew Research Center, citing polling that showed 3 out of every 5 Latino voters had soured on Biden.

With a new Democratic nominee, however, the left is betting the race has recalibrated."

The “Becoming” author has been candid about the ups and downs of her marriage to Barack.

In December 2022, Michelle admitted during a Revolt panel she “couldn’t stand” her hubby during the first decade of their marriage because they were carrying uneven loads.

“People think I’m being catty saying this. It’s like, there were 10 years where I couldn’t stand my husband,” she said.

“And guess when it happened? When those kids were little.”

Michelle said she began to envy the politician when he would find time to golf or travel for work while she tried to balance being a mother and a lawyer.

“And for 10 years, while we’re trying to build our careers and, you know, worrying about school and who’s doing what and what, I was like, ‘Ugh, this isn’t even,’” she recalled.

“And guess what? Marriage isn’t 50/50 — ever. There’s sometimes I’m 70, he’s 30, but guess what? We’ve been married 30. I would take 10 bad years over 30.”"

Shapiro elicited strong reactions from young voters like Faith Keyser, who moved to Pennsylvania from California to attend college.

“I watch the news, I hear his name come up, and I’m like, ‘That’s my governor! Right on,” she said, adding that Shapiro isn’t her first choice for Harris’ second-in-command.

She’d rather see Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.

“I’m a big fan of Pete and his work,” Keyser said.

Shapiro, 51, is broadly popular in Pennsylvania, but his views on school choice and the Israel-Hamas war have alienated him from many on the left — including the founders of the “No Genocide Josh” campaign, which seeks to discredit the governor for his support of Israel.

But for some reason, @JoshShapiroPA’s support is problematic to certain leftists.



Such anti-semitism cannot be granted safe haven in any party. Period. — Dean Phillips (@deanbphillips) August 2, 2024

“For some reason, @JoshShapiroPA’s support is problematic to certain leftists,” Minnesota congressman and Biden primary rival Dean Phillips posted last week on X/Twitter.

“Such anti-semitism cannot be granted safe haven in any party. Period,” Phillips added.

Shapiro’s office has also been hit with a sexual harassment scandal, prompting Pennsylvania Treasurer nominee Erin McClelland to float North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper for VP, before he removed himself from consideration.

Never one to fall in line, Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) reportedly “warned” Harris about the extent of Shapiro’s presidential ambitions — concerns other detractors have shared as well."

He accessorized his look with a pair of aviator sunglasses — but ditched his wedding ring for the outing.

Affleck was later seen riding around the city on a blue motorcycle.

The dad of three, 51, and Lopez, 55, have spent most of their summer on separate sides of the US.

The “Air” star has been staying in LA, working on the “Accountant 2” and spending time with his ex-wife, Jennifer Garner, and their kids: Violet, 18, Seraphina, 15, and Samuel, 12.

Meanwhile, the “Selena” actress has been nearly 3,000 miles away enjoying herself in New York with close friends and family.

Lopez celebrated her 55th birthday in the Hamptons with a “Bridgerton”-themed party at her home and a private lunch at Arthur & Sons Bridgehampton.

The couple also spent their second wedding anniversary apart.

On July 16, the “Mother” actress was seen riding around the Hamptons in the passenger seat of a vintage Mercedes-Benz convertible while her longtime manager, Benny Medina, drove.

The “Gigli” co-stars have also put their Beverly Hills mansion up for sale. Lopez and Affleck are asking for $68 million for the 12-bedroom, 24-bathroom home — nearly $8 million more than they paid when they purchased it last year.

The “Good Will Hunting” actor also reportedly purchased a $20 million bachelor pad in LA — on the same day as Lopez’s 55th birthday.

Ben Affleck is holding back on filing for divorce to ‘protect her’.,https://nypost.com/2024/08/05/us-news/kamala-harris-gains-7-points-in-national-poll-and-a-swing-state-vp-could-boost-her-even-more/,"Is it a case of Kamala-mentum?

That’s the question raised by new presidential polling from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and YouGov.

The last time the pollsters were in the field in January, former President Donald Trump led President Biden 43% to 39% when “leaners” were factored in.

In that survey, Robert Kennedy Jr. had 9% support.

3 Vice President Kamala Harris supporters see her campaign in aspirational terms, with 66% believing the 59-year-old former prosecutor and senator represents a “new generation” in the Democratic Party. AP

Yet during a new survey conducted July 29 to August 1, Trump is behind replacement candidate Vice President Kamala Harris 46% to 43%, with Kennedy down to 6%.

When Kennedy voters were asked to choose between the top two candidates, more of them said they would vote for Trump than for Harris, 29% to 26%, with 45% saying they wouldn’t vote at all.

That narrows the margins since January’s poll, when the same prompt was given to RFK voters about Trump and Biden. Back then, Trump received support from 33% of the RFK voters while Biden took only 23%.

But RFK voters leaning toward Trump aren’t enough to offset Democratic gains elsewhere in a D+4 poll that sampled 42% Democrats, 38% Republicans, and 20% independents.

The data indicate Harris’ choice of running mate could give her a boost. Expected Tuesday, the announcement will be a kickoff of her campaign’s battleground-states tour.

3 When Kennedy voters were asked to choose between the top two candidates, more of them said they would vote for Trump than for Harris, 29% to 26%, with 45% saying they wouldn’t vote at all. AP

Roughly half of respondents believe the selection should be a male and about the same amount said he should hail from a swing state.

That checks the boxes for Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, two Democrats in the running — and seen as top favorites — as of Monday evening.

Among Democrats, 14% want Kelly and 12% prefer Shapiro. Kelly has a slight edge among independents at 7%, with Shapiro and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg not far behind at 5%.

The polling points to the former president’s polarization, with 75% of Trump backers saying his accomplishments drive their support and 48% citing Trump’s ability to “save America” as a key point in his favor.

Conversely, 66% of those not voting for Trump say he’s a “threat to America,” with 48% of them also blaming Trump for the “Jan. 6 insurrection.”

Harris supporters, meanwhile, see her campaign in aspirational terms, with 66% believing the 59-year-old former prosecutor and senator represents a “new generation” in the Democratid Party. Of Harris supporters, 37% think she’ll enhance America’s “global standing,” while 35% think Harris will continue the policies of the Biden administration.

Ironically, America’s global standing and the threat of continued Biden policies are key reasons many voters are looking elsewhere, with 77% of Harris haters worried she will perpetuate Bidenism and 49% convinced she will erode international perception of the United States.

3 The data indicate Harris’ choice of running mate could give her a boost. AP

When asked about candidate qualities, Harris has the advantage over Trump in being perceived as compassionate, energetic, likable, intelligent, hardworking and “moderate,” which suggests Trump’s branding of her as “dangerously liberal” isn’t catching on.

Trump is thought of as more experienced, strong and patriotic.

The polling also indicates the prospect of a Harris election inspires more positive feelings than Biden’s re-election would have, with twice as many people saying they would feel “pride” if the vice president was elected in November rather than the incumbent.

A quarter of independents say they’re more excited about voting in a Harris-Trump race, but that number is dwarfed by the 66% of Democrats and the 37% of Republicans who say the same."
Ben Affleck is holding back on filing for divorce to ‘protect her’.,https://nypost.com/2024/08/05/us-news/josh-shapiro-is-betting-favorite-over-tim-walz-as-kamala-harris-closes-in-on-vp-pick/,"(The Center Square) – As the final hours tick down to an expected announcement, the pick for vice president on the Democrats’ ticket remains shrouded in secrecy and angled toward the governor of Pennsylvania.

Vice President Kamala Harris’ reveal is expected before Tuesday’s launch of a battleground states tour in Philadelphia.

While the campaign has cautioned the starting point where she is expected to be alongside her running mate is not an indicator of the choice, a leading candidate since July 21 has been Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Monday morning Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz appeared to be a finalist.

Harris on Friday secured enough of the delegates in the Democratic National Convention’s virtual roll call vote to clinch the party nomination. No other candidates ever emerged. That process started Friday and ends Monday.

The convention, where a ceremonial roll call will be held, is Aug. 19-22 in Chicago.

Harris ascended to the top of the party ticket when President Joe Biden two weeks ago posted to social media he would not accept the nomination for reelection.

Health concerns for the nation’s 46th president grew immensely with his performance on June 27 in a debate against Republican former President Donald Trump; two subsequent appearances making addresses from the Oval Office in which he never once in either looked at the camera as he stumbled a bit reading a teleprompter; and few public appearances.

Walz was considered a longshot at the outset of the process while Shapiro was a frontrunner along with North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Arizona US Sen. Mark Kelly. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker have generally been at a next level.

Vetting information was sought from most if not all of them; the Harris campaign has not publicly announced a list, and varying reports suggest all were asked.

Cooper said last week it was not the time for him to be considered and withdrew his name from consideration.

Professional oddsmakers, in the business of getting equal money on bets for its profits, have seized the moment with prop bets among many others tied to the election.

Shapiro is the consensus favorite as of Monday morning. Reports have Walz supported by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

At BetOnline, Shapiro is minus-275, Walz plus-215, Beshear plus-1600 and Kelly plus-1800.

When the odds are a minus, this is the amount needed to wager to make $100. Wagering $100 on a plus bet nets the amount shown; for example, $100 on a plus-500 wins $500. The latter is a longer shot.

At Oddschecker, Shapiro is minus-188, Walz plus-420, Kelly plus-1800 and Beshear plus-3100.

At Polymarket, Shapiro is the choice over Walz 66%-25%, with Kelly 5% and Beshear 3%. At $markets, it’s Shapiro 64.9%, Walz 25.6%, Buttigieg 9%, Kelly 8.3% and Beshear 5.1%.

PredictIT is similar, with Shapiro 65 cents (betting yes is 65 cents on the dollar), Walz 28 cents, Kelly 10 cents and Beshear 5 cents."

The “Real Housewives of New Jersey” star posted a video Monday of Nate shirtless while posing for pics, ripping off a tank top and even holding a copy of one of Andy Cohen’s books.

“You have to have thick ass skin in the reality world. Growing up, I was a heavy kid. I had such a fear of even being called on in class. You see people just shame and talk, it’s just like, why?” Nate confessed in the video.

The couple shared the video after Danielle nearly got into a physical altercation with Aydin on the season finale of “RHONJ,” which aired Sunday.

Danielle and Jennifer, 47, were hurling insults at each other during the cast’s group dinner when Danielle brought up Jennifer’s past marital woes with husband, Bill Aydin.

“You know what? I know I go home, and my husband is waiting for me at the door,” Danielle told her.

11 After Jennifer made the negative comment, Danielle got up and lunged towards her. Bravo

Jennifer then quipped, “Your husband with the boobs, and you got the brawn, honey.”

Danielle then launched herself at Jennifer as people tried to hold her back.

“You motherf–ker! You animal!” Danielle shouted.

The explosive finale dinner also featured heated moments between sisters-in-law Melissa Gorga and Teresa Giudice, Margaret Josephs and Giudice, and Jackie Goldschneider and Josephs.

The couple, who typically keep their personal lives private, were spotted enjoying the equestrian competition, which took place at the gardens of the Palace of Versailles. Their daughters, Esmeralda (9) and Amanda (8), joined them, making this a family outing.

The couple dressed casually and stylishly. Eva looked stunning in a belted navy blue dress, white heels, and oversized cream color sunglasses that matched her hand bag—all retaining her personal vintage chic style. At some points during the event, the stunning Cuban-American actress also wore an FEI straw hat to shield herself from the sun.

Gosling, the star of blockbuster films like Barbie, opted to wear a white tank top with a plaid shirt on top, khaki pants and a Paris 2024 baseball cap. The couple's presence at the Olympics was unique, as they often avoid the public eye due to their busy schedules.

The 50-year-old actress has stepped back from acting to focus on raising their children, emphasizing the importance of being present in their lives. When asked about retiring from acting in past interviews, she said, ""It was the easiest decision I’ve ever made. I was older, and I knew that my kids were going to be little once, and whatever I do or don’t do right now is going to affect them for the rest of their lives.""

Other celebrities spotted at the Paris Olympics

In addition to Gosling and Mendes, the Paris Olympics attracted numerous other high-profile celebrities. Sharon Stone, Kendall Jenner, Pau Gasol and his wife, Ariana Grande, and Jessica Chastain were among the notable figures seen at various events.

Over the weekend, though, all that changed when the famously private duo attended the 2024 Paris Olympic Games alongside their daughters Esmeralda, 9, and Amada, 8.

Mendes and Gosling were spotted in the crowd at the women’s artistic gymnastics uneven bars final on Sunday where Team USA’s Suni Lee earned a bronze medal. Mendes, for her part, channeled Parisian chic in a navy tea-length dress and classic stilettos. The star styled her hair in tousled bombshell waves and sported a pair of bold square sunglasses. Gosling veered towards the sportier end of the spectrum with his outfit. The Barbie actor wore a white tank top with a plaid shirt. He styled everything with black sunglasses and a green cap that featured the Olympic rings.

Earlier in the day, Mendes and Gosling were seen at the Equestrian Dressage Individual Grand Prix Freestyle event which was held at the Chateau de Versailles. Mendes wore the same outfit as she did to the gymnastics final, but added on a straw hat. Gosling switched out his green hat for a white cap. It appears as though the couple’s daughters skipped out on the equestrian event which was also attended by Kendall Jenner.

Mendes, who stepped back from acting in 2014 to focus on raising her daughters, and Gosling have kept their private life under the radar. After the 2024 Oscars, where Gosling was nominated in the Best Actor category, a source explained that the couple’s “most important job is their girls. Everything else comes second.”

“I wasn't thinking about kids before I met her, but after I met Eva, I realized that I just didn't want to have kids without her,” Gosling told GQ last year. “And there were moments on The Place Beyond the Pines where we were pretending to be a family, and I didn't really want it to be pretend anymore.

The 2024 Paris Olympics were the perfect date for Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes. The couple — who are rarely seen in public together — were spotted in the stands at Bercy Arena in Paris on Sunday, August 4, and they made sure to don Olympic gear to cheer on Team USA.

Ryan, 43, wore a green baseball cap that was embroidered with the Olympic rings for the outing. He also sported a pair of sunglasses and a red flannel shirt over a white tee while watching the women’s gymnastics uneven bars final event. As for Eva, 50, the actress also wore a pair of sunglasses and a plain black shirt.

While keeping a low-key profile at the event, the pair appeared to have brought along their two daughters, Esmeralda and Amada.

The Place Beyond the Pines co-stars — who first met on the set of their 2012 film — also attended the individual Grand Prix freestyle at the Chateau de Versailles over the weekend, where Ryan was seen sporting a white Olympic-themed cap and Eva wearing a floppy sun hat.

The Gosling-Mendes family trip marks the first time they’ve been seen in public together in years. However, the two are each other’s biggest cheerleaders, which they’ve both proven during red carpet appearances, interviews and social media posts. Eva, for her part, never hesitates to gush over her long-time partner on Instagram. Earlier this year, she cheered Ryan on for his performances in The Fall Guy and Barbie. After he was nominated for Best Actor at the 2024 Academy Awards for his performance as Ken, Eva shared how “proud” she was of him and defended Ryan against critics.

“So much hate when he took on this role. So many people trying to shame him for doing it,” Eva captioned a previous Instagram post. “Despite all the #Notmyken ridicule and articles written about him, he created this completely original, hilarious, heartbreaking, now iconic character and took it all the way to Oscars.”

For his part, Ryan revealed that Eva became the “best acting coach” for him during an interview with Extra at the Los Angeles premiere of The Fall Guy in May.

“She’s also like my acting coach,” the Notebook star gushed. “She has really become the best acting coach I have ever had, it’s endless how she helps me.”"

“It was almost just like a non-verbal agreement [between Ryan and I] that it was like, ‘OK, he’s going to work and I’m going to work, I’m just going to work here [at home],’” Mendes recently told Today show in the U.S.. “I still worked, I just didn’t act because acting takes you on locations, it takes you away.”

Mendes—who is now spruiking a new cleaning product brand called Skura and is the author of a new children’s book Desi, Mami & the Never Ending Worries—met and fell in love with Gosling on the set of the 2012 film The Place Beyond the Pines, a high-octane tale of a motorcycle stunt rider who turns to robbing banks to provide for his former partner and their newborn.

“I have never experienced anything like that,” Mendes said in the same interview. “The way [Ryan] works, his commitment to his craft, how he wants to make everything as best it could be, and that means making his co-stars as best as they could be…But unfortunately, or fortunately, there is only one Ryan. So, I pretty much stopped just acting after that.”

Since The Place Beyond The Pines’ premiere 12 years ago, Gosling and Mendes have only been spotted out together a handful of times. One was a Saturday Night Live after party at Tao restaurant in New York City in 2017.

It’s nice to see the couple making memories with their young family at the Olympics. We’re hoping to see more of them in Paris!"

The ""Barbie"" actor, 43, and the ""Hitch"" actress, 50, attended the Paris Olympics together on Sunday to watch the gymnastics uneven bars final.

Gosling was photographed wearing a green Olympics hat with his arm wrapped around Mendes, who was sporting white sunglasses. NBC Sports shared a photo from the outing on X, writing, in reference to Gosling's role as Ken in ""Barbie,"" ""This Ken's job is 'gymnastics fan.'""

Gosling and Mendes have been partners since 2011 and share two children together. They met when they both starred in the movie ""The Place Beyond the Pines.""

In recent years, Mendes has stepped back from acting to focus on raising their kids, a decision she described as a ""no-brainer"" in an interview with ""Today"" earlier this year.

""I'm so lucky,"" she said. ""And I was like, if I can have this time with my children – and I still work, I just didn't act, because acting takes you on locations, it takes you away.""

She added, ""It was almost just like a non-verbal agreement that it was like, 'OK, he's going to work and I’m going to work. I'm just going to work here.'""

Gosling has been having a big year after being nominated for best supporting actor at the Academy Awards in March for his role as Ken in ""Barbie."" He also headlined the action-comedy ""The Fall Guy,"" which opened in May, opposite Emily Blunt.

While accepting an award at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival in January, Gosling referred to Mendes as the ""girl of my dreams"" and said they have ""two dream children"" — though he told E! News that his kids still haven't seen ""Barbie.""

""I don't know if you should watch your father as Ken,"" he joked in the January interview. ""I don't know what age is a good age to see your father do that. It gets pretty crazy.""

In March, Gosling stole the show at the Oscars with a performance of ""I'm Just Ken"" from ""Barbie,"" which was nominated for best original song. Mendes reacted at the time by sharing a photo of herself on Instagram posing with the pink jacket he wore for the number.

""You took Ken all the way to the Oscar's, RG,"" she captioned the picture. ""Now come home, we need to put the kids to bed.""

Speaking with USA TODAY this year, Gosling shared that he always has his family travel with him when he shoots a film.

""We were supposed to shoot ['The Fall Guy'] somewhere else — I won't say where — but it didn't seem like it would be as fun for my kids,"" he said. ""I've been lucky enough to have my family come with me on every film I've made so far, so it becomes hopefully a good experience for everyone.""

Gosling wore a red flannel shirt over a white tank top, as well as a green Olympic rings hat and a pair of translucent sunglasses.

Mendes rocked a sleeveless black dress, white sunglasses and a Fédération Equestre Internationale (FEI) sun hat.

Before the women’s gymnastics event, the couple attended the individual Grand Prix freestyle at the Chateau de Versailles.

Gosling and Mendes met while filming the 2012 movie “The Place Beyond the Pines.”

The couple rarely post about each other online, or share much about their relationship with the public.

Mendes revealed on Instagram last year that they doesn’t post much about each other online or do red carpets together because they don’t like “exposing our very private life that we value.”

The pair also been cagey about whether they’re married, despite Mendes referring to Gosling as her “husband” in 2022.

During an interview on “Today” earlier this year, Mendes said that she and Gosling had a mutual understanding she would give up her acting career and become a stay-at-home mom.

“I was almost just like a non-verbal agreement that it was like, ‘Ok, he’s going to work and I’m going to work, I’m just going to work here,” said the “Training Day” actress.

She added, “It was like a no-brainer. I’m so lucky, and I was like, if I could have this time with my children. And I still worked, I just didn’t act, because acting takes you on location, it takes you away.”

In May, Gosling gushed over Mendes at the premiere of his movie “The Fall Guy,” saying that he “couldn’t be here without her.”

“She is with the girls, and when she works, I stay home with the girls too,” he told Extra.

“She’s also like my acting coach,” the “La La Land” star noted. “She has really become the best acting coach I have ever had, it’s endless how she helps me.”

The couple have also been notoriously private about their children, though Gosling did reveal in May that his daughters call him “Papi,” which means “Daddy” in Spanish.

“It kills me every time,” he told the Wall Street Journal. “There’s just nothing, nothing better than that.”"

Mendes and Gosling have kept their family life out of the spotlight, with Mendes quitting acting to be a mom.

""It was like a no-brainer,"" Mendes told Today in March about her decision to step away from acting. ""I'm so lucky if I could have this time with my children.""

However, Mendes has not quit working all together, she has taken on projects that allow her to be close to her kids, such as her Skura Style household product line.

""It was almost like a non-verbal agreement that it was like, 'OK, he's going to work and I'm going to work. I'm just going to work here,'"" Mendes said of her relationship with Gosling. ""He went and he did his job. He just happens to be really good at his job.""

As Team USA prepares to go for the gold, Access Hollywood asked a variety of celebrities what event they'd win a gold medal in.

But being an A-list movie star does not stop Gosling from taking the lead in raising their daughters at times. The ""Barbie"" star ""held down the fort"" when Mendes attended Milan Fashion Week for the first time since becoming a mother earlier this year, according to E! News.

""La Dolce Evita made possible by…And by my man for holding down the fort at home so I could live the Dolce Evita for a couple days,"" Mendes wrote to Instagram at the time."

The longtime couple was spotted spectating at the Summer Olympics on Sunday, Aug. 4, during a rare public outing — where they checked out the dressage individual Grand Prix freestyle at the Chateau de Versailles before catching the women's uneven bars final at Bercy Stadium.

During the Olympic day out, Mendes, 50, and Gosling, 43, both wore sunglasses and head coverings to shield from the sun during the equestrian event.

The pair kept their day of Olympic viewership relatively low key as they sat mostly behind other spectators, while they watched on as Germany took home both gold and silver in the event. Specifically, rider Jessica von Bredow-Werndl came out victorious, as Germany's Isabell Werth earned silver and Charlotte Fry of Great Britain scored bronze.

Later, Gosling and Mendes were again spotted enjoying some gymnastics at the women's uneven bars final at the Bercy Arena, after Gosling swapped out his white hat for a green one, per the NBC broadcast, images of which were shared on X.

The couple also appeared to be joined by their daughters, Esmeralda, 9, and Amada, 8, during their gymnastics outing.

The family trip to Paris marked a rare outing for the couple, who have not been photographed in public together in some years. Gosling and Mendes — who met while filming The Place Beyond the Pines in 2011 — have still continued to support each other publicly throughout their professional endeavors.

Most recently, Mendes caught up with PEOPLE for the Beautiful Issue in May, when she explained that Gosling supports her ""in all the ways I need to be supported.""

""He's got me in all the ways,"" she added.

During the same interview, the Girl in Progress star explained why she decided to take a step back from acting in recent years to focus on their children, calling it ""the easiest decision I've ever made.""

""I was older and I knew that my kids are going to be little once, and whatever I do or don't do right now is going to affect them the rest of their life,"" Mendes said. ""Your career comes and goes but kids, yeah, that was easy for me. They're just formative years. I wanted to be there for all of it.""

As for the pair's life at home, Mendes revealed at the time that Gosling does the cooking while she does the cleaning. ""I'm not a cook so my man cooks and I clean, so it's a nice even. I can't cook. You don't want me to cook,"" she said. ""My girls, they're so cute but they're like, 'Did you make these eggs, mama?' I'm like, 'They're eggs, yes. They're just regular eggs.' Who messes up eggs?""

Gosling, too, has been vocal about the support he receives from Mendes, telling Extra during the Los Angeles premiere of The Fall Guy in May that he ""couldn’t be here without her.""

As the two stars enjoyed their Olympic outing, they each put their own spin on sun protection: Gosling sported translucent shades and a white “Paris 2024” baseball cap (before changing into a green hat featuring the Olympic rings), while Mendes opted for a Fédération Equestre Internationale sun hat and bold, brow-skimming white sunglasses.

In terms of outfits, Gosling went low-key in a red flannel shirt, worn open with a white tank top underneath. Mendes looked chic in a sleeveless black dress, which featured ruching by its high neckline.

Later in the day, the couple appeared to be joined by daughters, Esmeralda, nine, and Amada, eight. Together, the family watched American Suni Lee take home a bronze medal in the uneven bars—a feat Mendes seemed to enthusiastically capture on camera.

Though Mendes and Gosling have been together for over a decade—first meeting in 2011, while filming The Place Beyond the Pines—the two have not been photographed together in years. As one of the most discreet couples in Hollywood, they like to stay out of the spotlight, even surprising fans when they got secretly married in 2022.

The actors have never missed an opportunity to praise each other, however, and have supported each other publicly many times over. Earlier this year, Gosling flaunted a sweet “E” necklace while promoting his film The Fall Guy, while Mendes consistently cheered on her husband throughout his Barbie press tour.

Until now!

If there is something that Ryan treasures more than anything is his family, and with that, his privacy for his young daughters and beautiful wife.

That feels like a huge ask for a Hollywood couple, but Ryan and Eva have managed to keep their girls out of the spotlight.

Then again, they couldn’t let them miss the chance to see history unfold at the Olympics.

Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes’s First Public Appearance With Daughters at Paris Olympics

Ryan Gosling and his wife, Eva Mendes, joined the slew other big-name celebrities in Paris, France for the 2024 Olympics.

On Sunday, Aug. 4, the pair were spotted attending the equestrian Grand Prix freestyle at the Chateau de Versailles. In tow were their two little girls, Esmeralda, 9, and Amada, 8.

The pair’s daughters have never been seen in public with their parents, at least not in such a public forum.

Ryan and Eva are very private and protective when it comes to their daughters. For that reason, despite attending the event, photos of both of the girls were either cropped to remove their faces or else blurred to protect their identity.

For example, during the equestrian Grand Prix, neither girl can be spotted in photos with their parents. Glimpses of their hair or profiles can be spotted, but in most photos, they are absent entirely.

But then the family attend the women’s artistic gymnastics uneven bar finals.

Ryan Gosling Roots For Simone Biles & Team USA With His Daughters

If you’re attending the Paris Olympics, the event that could not be missed was the women’s artistic gymnastics events. Though the young family missed out on seeing Simone Biles in action, Ryan and his girls caught Suni Lee win Bronze for USA during the uneven bars.

In the photos, Amada and Esmeralda can be seen climbing into the laps of their father to get a better look at the event. However, their faces were blurred out for their privacy.

Still, you can still see the girls’ outfits. The younger sister wore a yellow floral ensemble while Esmeralda had on a white sweatshirt with an American flag and the Olympics logo.

Why You Might Never See Their Daughter’s Faces

“I have always had a clear boundary when it comes to my man and my kids. I’ll talk about them of course, with limits, but I won’t post pictures of our daily life,” Eva wrote on Instagram in 2020.

Eva and Ryan, who met on the set of The Place Beyond the Pines, have been very clear that their kids are not celebrities and as such, deserve the same privacy as every other kid.

Still, should the time come that the girls want to be in the spotlight, like Blue Ivy, Suri Cruise, or Shiloh Jolie, Eva admitted she would relent.

“Since my children are still so little and don’t understand what posting their image really means, I don’t have their consent. And I won’t post their image until they’re old enough to give me consent.”

But being a family is all the pair have wanted, since they played one on the big screen.

“I wasn’t thinking about kids before I met her, but after I met Eva, I realized that I just didn’t want to have kids without her,” The Notebook star told GQ in 2023.

He added, “There were moments on The Place Beyond the Pines where we were pretending to be a family, and I didn’t really want it to be pretend anymore.”

And now, he doesn’t have to!"

The two stars were spotted watching the 2024 Paris Games and ultimately delighting fans with a rare public outing on Sunday, August 4. The cherished Hollywood couple was seen at the Bercy Arena, immersed in the excitement of the women's uneven bars final. Their appearance not only captivated the attendees but also set social media ablaze. Fans were thrilled to see them together and, while many amusing captions floated around, NBC's clever comment truly took gold.

The unexpected appearance of The Place Beyond the Pines stars sparked fans and outlets to take to social media to post their best and most playful takes. NBC's official Sports X (formerly Twitter) account had a playful caption that caught viewers' attention with its nod to one of Ryan Gosling’s most memorable characters :

This Ken's job is 'gymnastics fan.' Ryan Gosling & Eva Mendes are in the building for the uneven bars final! #ParisOlympics

NBC's caption cleverly riffed on the leading man's role as Ken in 2023’s billion-dollar hit movie Barbie, in which his character famously had just one job: ""to beach."" However, for his day at the Olympics, NBC dubbed him a ""gymnastics fan."" At least for the day. It's hard not to appreciate that cheeky little nod, which was a great way to signify the Oscar nominee's presence at the games.

Social media reacted quickly, with fans and viewers excited about the couple's appearance. @_simplyjazzy shared a screengrab of the two and tweeted:

Eva Mendes and Ryan Gosling's most recent public appearance being for uneven bars finals. They're so reallll #Paris2024

The sentiment was echoed by @1Liasonfan , who remarked on the rarity of seeing the two together at public events:

I was so pleasantly surprised to see Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes in the audience. We barely see them at events together. They look great!🩷#OlympicGames

Adding a humorous twist, @bgigglings shared the perfect Snoop Dog meme, which shows him captured in a funny moment at a sporting event. He's wearing a white and red jacket with the NBC and Snoop Dogg logos, lifting his sunglasses in a gesture of surprise or scrutiny. The following caption accompanied the pic:

Not the first photo of Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes together.

The family jaunt to Paris was a notable public appearance for the couple, who haven't been snapped together in quite some time. Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes first connected through The Place Beyond the Pines , which they worked on back in 2011. It was reported in 2016 that Mendes and Gosling married, but the two themselves have never confirmed such nuptials. Over the years, the two have consistently been each other's cheerleaders, supporting one another's careers in the public eye. It's great that the two can find time to catch the games together.

The big news in celebrity circles on Sunday was the fact that Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes made an extremely rare public appearance with their daughters, Esmeralda and Amada. It was the first time in seven years that the couple have actually been seen together at a public event.

Gosling, obviously a BIG Olympics fan, took in the women’s uneven bars final at the Bercy Arena wearing a hat adorned with the most generic Olympics logo possible on it. Rob Lowe must be so proud.

Isabell Wert secured silver, and British equestrian Charlotte Fry took home bronze. Gosling, as seen in NBC's live Olympics broadcast, opted for a white t-shirt, red flannel, funky shades, and a white cap. Mendes wore a navy blue dress, beige sunglasses, and a large tan hat.

Gosling and Mendes’ day out at the summer games continued after the dressage event, as they then made their way to the women’s gymnastics uneven bars final. Gosling watched USA gymnast Suni Lee bag the gold with his arms wrapped around Mendes’ shoulders. The Barbie star also swapped his white Olympic cap for a green one, as captured by NBC.

Mendes and Gosling, for those who may not know, have been together since 2011. Their family outing on Sunday was noteworthy because the couple typically keeps their family life private to provide their children with an upbringing away from the Hollywood spotlight.

During an appearance on Today in March, the Other Guys actress opened up about taking a step back from acting to raise their kids. She said she still works; she just “didn't act” anymore, “because acting takes you on location; it keeps you away.” Mendes shared that she and her partner, whom she referred to as her husband in a few interviews over the decade, had this “nonverbal agreement” where she opted to stay with her kids while he went out and did his job.

Eva and Ryan met on the set of their film The Place Beyond the Pines in the early 2010s. In 2014, the couple welcomed their first child, named Esmeralda, and Eva gave birth to Amanda in April 2016. In 2020, the Ghost Rider star told People that she would obviously talk about the family with limits but wouldn't post any pictures of their daily lives in order to respect the privacy of her young daughters.

“Since my children are still so little and don't understand what posting their image really means, I don't have their consent. And I won't post their image until they're old enough to give me consent,” she noted to the publication.

Other celebrities spotted in the stands in Paris on Sunday were F1 driver Lewis Hamilton, Nina Dobrev, Shaun White, and Snoop Dogg.

Eva Mendes and Ryan Gosling made a rare public outing with their family during the 2024 Paris Olympics.

The longtime couple was spotted in Paris on August 4 sitting in the stands during the dressage Grand Prix Freestyle. The event saw Germany’s Jessica von Bredow-Werndl win gold, with an overall score of 90.09 percent. Bredow-Werndl’s teammate, Isabell Werth, took the silver, while British equestrian Charlotte Fry won bronze.

During the competition, Gosling opted for a white tank top, red flannel, brown sunglasses, and a white cap – which had the Paris Olympics logo on it. His partner wore a navy blue dress, beige sunglasses, and a large, tan sun hat. The pair appeared to be joined by their two daughters, Esmeralda, nine, and Amada, eight.

Gosling and Mendes’ day out in Paris continued after the dressage event as they then made their way to the women’s gymnastics uneven bars final. NBC’s broadcast of the event captured the pair in the stands, as Gosling wrapped his arm around Mendes’ shoulders. The pair watched the competition – which saw Team USA gymnast Suni Lee win the bronze – while wearing sunglasses, with the Barbie star swapping his white Olympics cap for a green one.

On social media, fans expressed delight at seeing the couple on a rare public outing together.

“Legends are in the stands watching the game,” one wrote on X, while another added: “I was so pleasantly surprised to see Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes in the audience. We barely see them at events together. They look great!”

A third wrote: “Eva Mendes and Ryan Gosling’s most recent public appearance being for uneven bars finals. They’re so reallll.”

Mendes has previously opened up about taking a step back from the spotlight as the couple have kept their relationship private for more than a decade. During an appearance on Today in March, she reflected on how she first decided to stop acting, in order to raise their children.

“It was like a no-brainer. I’m so lucky, and I was like, ‘If I could have this time with my children,’” she said, before noting that she still works, she just “didn’t act” anymore. “Because acting takes you on location, it keeps you away.”

Mendes acknowledged that she and her partner both have their own careers, noting that her work-from-home schedule allows Gosling to act.

“It was almost just like a non-verbal agreement that it was like, ‘OK, he’s going to work and I’m going to work. I’m just going to work here,’” she explained. “He went and he did his job. He just happens to be really good at his job. And he did it and he came home.”

During an interview with Glamour a month later, Mendes explained her parenting agreement with Gosling, noting that it wasn’t a “non-verbal” one that led her to work from home. Rather, Gosling and Mendes had many deep conversations about balancing both their professional and family lives, she said.

“For me… recently in an interview I said it was almost like non-verbal agreement Ryan and I had [to step back from acting]. That got… not twisted, but taken out of context because I meant it was almost a no-brainer. But there was actually obviously a lot of thought and conversation - especially on my end - of what I wanted to do with my life,” the Hitch star explained."

Months ago, when Entertainment Weekly began one of multiple conversations with director Shawn Levy about Deadpool & Wolverine, we made a promise to the filmmaker behind the now-record-breaking box-office hit: If we ever sat down again for a more open conversation about all of the film's spoilers, we'd call it ""spoiler orgy.""

And here we are. It's time for the Deadpool & Wolverine spoiler orgy.

As of Sunday morning, the movie, starring Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman as the titular duo, grossed a cumulative total of $395.6 million domestically and $824.1 million globally after just two weeks in movie theaters. It's already the highest-grossing R-rated movie ever.

Promising some of the most high-profile surprise cameos and guest stars, even for a Marvel movie, Levy & Co. delivered with the likes of Chris Evans' return as Johnny Storm from the Fox-era Fantastic Four duology, Wesley Snipes' return as Daywalker vampire hunter Blade, Jennifer Garner's return as sai-wielding Elektra, and even Henry Cavill and Channing Tatum stepping into the shoes of Wolverine variant ""Cavillrine"" and Gambit, respectively.

Speaking with EW in the days following the cast's big Comic-Con panel in San Diego, Levy talks about all of it, from breaking the slump of what the press dubbed ""superhero fatigue,"" to dominating the box office, to the most standout moments of Deadpool & Wolverine.

SHAWN LEVY: I am basking. I mean, we were already basking yesterday, but then we started hearing overnight that actually Disney had been conservative and we were doing more business on Sunday than they expected. So this has been certainly the thrill of my career by a lot.

In the face of all this talk of superhero fatigue, you guys have a record-breaking opening for an R-rated movie.

It's thrilling. It's really affirming. And, look, every time someone has asked me, ""What about superhero fatigue?"" I've held to this conviction that people just want to be surprised. They want something unexpected and new, and I feel like we certainly devoted ourselves to delivering that. So the way it's been embraced, and especially that audience score, this is what I work for. I work for audience satisfaction.

Let's start by talking about a lot of the guest appearances. Were there any actors that you went out for and tried to get, but for one of the multitude of reasons that can pop up in movie planning, they just couldn't fit for whatever reason?

There was a brief moment where maybe we were debating which Juggernaut. There was a Vinnie Jones conversation that didn't really go very far. [Jones featured as Juggernaut in 2008's X-Men: The Last Stand.] But other than that, everybody we asked said yes and somehow made the time. Jen, Channing, Dafne [Keen, returning as X-23 from 2017's Logan], and Wesley, they flew to England a week before shooting on their own volition and desire because they wanted to learn and do the choreography of the action themselves. They came a week early right away showing a level of enthusiasm that is not at all the norm for someone who's just doing a so-called cameo. Then the day before they shot, the actors' strike happened, so they all had to ship home. They all came back months later with that same enthusiasm. That right there says everything people need to know about the spirit that went into making this movie.

You worked with Jen on The Adam Project. You worked with Chris on Free Guy. Do you feel having those relationships already built in were big stepping stones into getting them back for this movie?

I'm really convinced there's too much about this movie that feels destined or at the very least informed by good karma. The outreach to Jen was so comfortable and so easy. It's ironic that Ryan first asked me to direct this movie on the set of The Adam Project. Jen, in fact, reminded me in San Diego that she remembers overhearing us talking about another Deadpool movie on the set in Vancouver. And Chris showed up for us in Free Guy. He and Ryan had done cameos back and forth [for each other's projects], I believe. Chris — like Channing, Wesley, Henry, and so many — started with Ryan and I in our writing room coming up with a zany notion and shooting a text on the spot. That was how 90 percent of that surprise casting got done. That simple, that quick.

Henry Cavill fans were dream-casting him as Wolverine over the years. How close you were paying attention to what the fans have been talking about in the zeitgeist for years?

Ryan may have been a little more fluent in that. I was pretty ignorant of that dream-casting of the Cavill, but when we were working on this script, it was quite recently after the whole infamous meeting that Henry had at DC and the fact that he was no longer going to continue on as Superman. We were just thinking about how Deadpool movies are always in dialogue with culture, and it was really on the heels of that DC decision that Ryan and I were like, ""Wait! How cool would that be?"" Then as soon as Ryan dubbed it ""the Cavillrine"" — which you'll note in the end credits is how Henry is credited...I'm really hoping that term sticks, even though Hugh Jackman's job does now feel quite secure — it was more in response to that and just being able to play with this whole perceived turf war between comic book labels and studios.

For Chris specifically, what was your impression seeing him on set for the first time, just really embracing the energy that Ryan and Hugh were throwing down?

We expected that Chris might need a bunch of takes because that was a page of super dirty, mile-a-minute language. Chris came in, was off book, banged it out in two takes, had us pissing with laughter, and that's what you see in the movie. I think Chris had a blast, and I know our movie benefits from Chris playing Johnny very differently from Cap. Gone is the righteous nobility and cleanliness of Captain America. This is a Boston-inflected, Chris Evans-inspired Johnny Storm. I feel like it's more Chris than the original Chris Evans. Chris is a Boston boy. I'd have to go back and watch the original Fantastic Four, but I don't think he played Johnny as the Boston boy that he did in Deadpool & Wolverine — and to me it is perfection.

Moving on to another topic of conversation that came up with this movie: How do you feel in hindsight about all of the Taylor Swift discourse that was going on in the lead-up?

It was so very loud. I definitely had moments where I was worried I would disappoint people when they realized Taylor as Dazzler was not in the movie, but there's no controlling the internet, and rumors spread like wildfire. It was never a conversation. It was never even a seed of a discussion. Obviously, Ryan and Blake, and myself, to a far lesser extent, have our own relationships in real life with Taylor. But, yeah, those rumors were loud and slightly baffling, but nothing I said or did was going to make them quiet down until this movie came out.

I also saw The Adam Project star Walker Scobell at the New York premiere, and I know he loves Deadpool. He was another one that a lot of fans were hoping to see in this movie. Did you ever have conversations with him about it?

If Walker Scobell had stopped evolving right before puberty, he absolutely would've been Kidpool. It was his dream. Ryan and I reached out to him once we realized he was now going to be too old, both too tall and with his voice too low. Puberty is what it is, and all the Hollywood dreams in the world can't stop it. So we did call Walker and explain why he couldn't be Kidpool, and he was completely understanding. My long reunion hug with Walker at the premiere in New York was one of my favorite parts of that whole night.

This leads me into my favorite scene in the entire movie: the Deadpool Corps.' arrival that looked like a really chaotic sequence to channel into one tracking shot. How did you plan that four-minute one-shot? Did you storyboard it?

That is the single most complicated shot in the movie. It's the most complicated shot I have ever done in any movie, and, frankly, it's more complicated than most shots any of us will ever see in any movie. It took nine months of preparation, starting with the idea, which was always one laterally-tracking shot, always left to right, always in our mind set to ""Like a Prayer."" It aspired to be an ecstatic symphony of violence. It started with storyboards. Those evolved into pre-visualization, where you animate the storyboards. Then the next big hurdle was, let's get 50 stunt people and figure out how we're going to do this with real humans and bodies in space because those are not digi-doubles. Those are real fighters the whole way through. Then the big fly in the ointment is: What happens when you rehearse no longer in sweats but in the suits? The body doesn't move the same way. It took hundreds of teammates to figure it out and pull it off. It's one of our great prides.

Knowing you and Ryan, there are always moments where, maybe it's not written in the script, but you end up finding magic together in the heat of the moment. Were there moments like that that occurred for this big tracking shot for the Deadpool Corps.?

A lot of it was scripted. I do want to give credit to the entire section in the bus through that shot. That was our storyboard artist, Jeremy Simser. That bus section and the idea of the windows getting increasingly obscured with blood splatter, that was Jeremy. I mention it because I really think the key to directing is to be loose enough that you are open to the best possible idea regardless of where it comes from. I am a great beneficiary of tremendous creativity from the whole team. The one thing that I recall being a later add is Ryan fumbling and tapping off this glorious epic action sequence with a very clumsy dismount, and then Deadpool commenting on his God-awful dismount because we could have just ended it with superhero glory, but somehow that's not quite Deadpool. You always want to zig when the expectation is for the genre to zag.

Are there other more general moments where you found things in the moment?

So many. I don't know that there is a scene that didn't benefit from inspiration sometimes on the shooting day, sometimes in the edit room, sometimes in the scoring stage. Off the very top of my head, certainly Deadpool turning to Wolverine and saying, ""Welcome to the MCU. By the way, you're joining at a bit of a low point."" That was Ryan's inspiration. Similarly, his speech to the Deadpool Corps. about miss after miss after miss: ""Let's just take the L and move on."" And then Ryan improvising his Nicepool in response to his improvisation, ""I think it's been steadily uphill since Endgame."" Those are two of probably a thousand inspired adds. One other one that's less comedic but really defined so much in the movie: We were shooting the scene where Wolverine is having compassion for Cassandra Nova. The scripted line was, ""I'm wearing the suit, that means I'm an X-Man."" While we were filming the take, I remembered what Deadpool had said in the diner. So I called out during the take to Hugh from behind the camera. Hugh got very choked up and repeated a line after me, and that ended up defining the tone of that scene.

You have so many lines in this movie where I was like, ""I can't believe they just did that."" I'm thinking of the joke about Hugh's divorce, the Ben Affleck/Daredevil and Jennifer Garner stuff. Was there ever a joke where you thought maybe we shouldn't do this one?

Well, the general rule is to never punch down and to only take the piss out of people who can take it. Certainly, when it was about Hugh in a meta way, Hugh was always the first to laugh uproariously. There was only one line in the entire movie that we were asked to change. We have made a pact, Ryan and I, to go to our grave with that line, but I will say that it was replaced with an equally dirty line of dialogue about Pinocchio shoving his face up Deadpool's ass and starting to lie like crazy. I was like, 'Ryan, that's your replacement line in response to, 'Can we clean it up?' That's Ryan Reynolds for you, audacious to the very edge.

In terms of the ending, you bring back Dafne Keen as X-23 again, and it very clearly leaves the pathway open for the X-Men in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. How much coordination did you have to have with Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige to make this bit within the trajectory of what they're planning?

I have to be honest with you, we really set out to make a movie that was not a setup for another movie or a sequel to anything. Kevin never insisted that we service some story beyond. I've been asked, for instance, why is Thor crying. The answer being: I don't f---ing know. No one does, but I'd sure love to be the guy who helps find out why. But, yes, we see X-23 at the end. Logan has opted to stay in Deadpool's world. Laura's presence there at the final pizza party implies that others might have made it out of the Void. But as for what's beyond, I genuinely don't know. I genuinely hope and intend to be a part of telling those stories. We never once were asked to service a broader storyline or phase. To this day, I couldn't tell you what phase our movie is in. Is it like 14? I sincerely couldn't tell you.

You said on the red carpet a while back that you don't think your partnership with Marvel has ended at this point. Have there been any new developments since the red carpet?

Nothing in an official way. Just so much shared respect and affection between really all of us. Ryan and I as co-writers, as producers, and as star and director, we had the time of our life making this thing. It was certainly before the outcome was mind-blowingly great. So Kevin and Lou [D'Esposito, Marvel Studios co-president] and I, all of us have talked about what might come next. I am now even more confident than I was on that red carpet that Marvel and I are not done with each other.

'Deadpool & Wolverine'.,https://www.cinemablend.com/superheroes/james-mangold-admitted-to-secret-cameo-in-the-wolverine,"The world is currently enjoying the success of Shawn Levy's Deadpool & Wolverine , which has breathed new life into the Marvel Cinematic Universe with an impressive box office performance . This movie is already a massive hit, giving Marvel its best opening weekend in years and treating audiences to their first glimpse of Hugh Jackman in the iconic blue and yellow costume. Jackman has portrayed the character for two decades, and his return is thrilling for fans. However, this success might not have been possible without the groundwork laid by director James Mangold. He directed The Wolverine in 2013 and the critically acclaimed Logan in 2017. Did you know Mangold had a secret cameo in the former? Well, sharp-eyed—and sharp-eared—fan recently discovered it.

An observant fan, who goes by the username Dude Two, Joe 🦧 on social media, recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to share an observation while rewatching The Wolverine. The fan tweeted at James Mangold, asking if he was the voice of the newscaster heard during the film's conclusion. He admitted he couldn’t find any information on it and apologized if it had been previously addressed. The filmmaker responded with a concise answer:

Good catch.

How fun! Who doesn’t love a good director's cameo, especially when it's only audio and isn’t too jarring? Certain filmmaker cameos can pull you right out of the movie. (I'm looking at you, Quentin Tarantino, in Django Unchained.)

The Mangold revelation adds an extra layer of intrigue to a film already rich with complex characters and intense action sequences. Released in 2013, The Wolverine follows the titular character, played by Hugh Jackman, as he battles both external enemies and internal demons while grappling with his immortality. The film’s darker tone and mature themes set it apart from previous installments in Fox's X-Men film series , earning praise for its sophisticated approach to the superhero genre. Let's be honest; it's time the flick received its flowers .

While Logan’s first solo outing, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, is frequently discussed as being one of the worst superhero movies, and Logan is universally praised (we even ranked it among the best Western movies of all time), I often find myself asking: where's the appreciation for The Wolverine? For starters, can we acknowledge what a significant improvement it is over its predecessor?

James Mangold's 2013 superhero movie effort takes place after the events of X-Men: The Last Stand (which I also enjoyed) and follows the former Weapon X as he travels to Japan. There, he faces old and new adversaries while struggling with losing his healing powers. Although often overlooked, the film is an impressive action movie that deserves praise for James Mangold's excellent directing, and his fun voice cameo adds a unique touch to the film. Now, I'm curious as to whether there are any other BTS gems from the film that have yet to be revealed.

Marvel’s “Deadpool & Wolverine,” featuring Ryan Reynolds as the wisecracking Merc With a Mouth and Hugh Jackman as the iconic be-clawed X-Men hero, amassed an impressive $38.5 million during Thursday night previews. This figure marks the highest preview gross of the year to date, outpacing Disney’s animated family hit “Inside Out 2,” which earned $13 million last month. Furthermore, it sets a new record for the highest preview gross ever achieved by an R-rated film. The original “Deadpool” garnered $12.7 million during its Thursday previews in 2016, and its 2018 sequel pulled in $18.6 million, holding the previous record until now. Given the film’s strong start, it is anticipated that more records may fall as the weekend progresses.

Internationally, “Deadpool & Wolverine” has already earned $64.8 million, with its release scheduled for Friday in China.

Estimates suggest that “Deadpool & Wolverine” could open domestically with a robust $160 million to $170 million, though some analysts believe these projections may be too conservative. Others in the industry are forecasting an opening closer to $190 million or even $200 million. Such a performance would surpass the current highest-grossing opening weekend of the year, held by “Inside Out 2,” which earned $155 million. The film is expected to gross between $350 million and $390 million worldwide after its first weekend. With a production budget of $200 million and marketing costs around $100 million, the film is poised for a significant box office success.

The immense appeal of “Deadpool & Wolverine” can be attributed to its integration into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) following Disney’s acquisition of Fox and its properties. Fans are excited to see Reynolds’ Deadpool and Jackman’s Wolverine interact with MCU characters like Captain America, Thor, and Spider-Man—a crossover long anticipated by Marvel enthusiasts. Directed by Shawn Levy, the film is expected to feature a multitude of cameos from previously underutilized Fox properties, potentially delivering an “Avengers: Endgame”-level spectacle.

Following a challenging start to the summer box office, this weekend is set to see a turnaround. Last week’s box office leader, “Twisters,” is projected to earn between $36 million and $40 million in its second weekend.

As the weekend unfolds, all eyes will be on “Deadpool & Wolverine” to see if it continues to break records and solidify its position as a major box office success."

Apparently, the upcoming Disney/Marvel Studios’ film, which just hit six-week tracking, is reporting a projected opening weekend of $200M-$239M, which the service actually believes is conservative.

There never has been an R-rated movie that has opened to $200M, and the Ryan Reynolds-Hugh Jackman threequel might just do that. We don’t even know if it’s a good film, but that doesn’t seem to matter. The current record for an R-rated opening is owned by the first ‘Deadpool' ($132.4M).

A trailer for the film, which Matthew Vaughn claims will “save the whole Marvel universe,” was released in April. Based on the “buzz,” and early word of mouth, I have no doubt that Shawn Levy’s “Deadpool & Wolverine” will be a box office success.

Succeeding directors Tim Miller and David Leitch, Levy is helming this third ‘Deadpool’ movie. He’s the stalwart filmmaker behind “Big Fat Liar,” “Just Married,” “Cheaper by the Dozen,” “The Internship,” “Real Steal,” the “Pink Panther” reboot and those “Night at the Museum” movies. Not a single good movie out of the bunch.

The first two ‘Deadpool’ movies each grossed around $780 million worldwide. The franchise has only grown in popularity on home media and the notion that this third one could cross the billion dollar mark is not a stretch — it’s also set to become the first R-rated instalment of the MCU.

Marvel is trying wipe out the stink of their last flop, “The Marvels,” and will be banking hard on this one, which is set to be the only MCU movie released this year. It’s an R-rated buddy comedy. As the trailer suggests, it’s also a road trip movie. Levy said he borrowed from 1988’s “Midnight Run.” As with all of these ‘Deadpool’ movies, there’s a lot of tongue-in-cheek meta going on here.

“Deadpool & Wolverine,” the second to last movie in the MCU’s Phase 5, is scheduled for a July 26, 2024."
Shawn Levy on cameos and box-office success. 'Deadpool & Wolverine'.,https://www.joblo.com/shawn-levy-success/,"Films directed by Shawn Levy – a list that includes Big Fat Liar, Just Married, Cheaper by the Dozen, The Pink Panther, the Night at the Museum trilogy, Date Night, Real Steel, and Free Guy, among others – have earned about 3 billion dollars at the global box office, and that number is likely to receive a substantial boost with the release of Levy’s contribution to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Deadpool & Wolverine, this weekend. During an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Levy revealed his five “secrets to success” and discussed the creative empowerment he felt while working with Marvel Studios.

While it’s often assumed that Marvel micromanages their productions and doesn’t give directors space to be creative, Levy said, “ Contrary to so many assumptions out there, and even within myself before I had this experience, I’ve been arguably more creatively empowered and trusted on this movie than just about any other I’ve ever made. ” He had such a great time working on Deadpool & Wolverine, “ I absolutely foresee more collaborations between Marvel and me. The when and the what is yet to be seen. “

Levy had been mentioned as being in the running to direct one of Marvel’s upcoming Avengers movies, but it was recently announced that Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame directors Joe and Anthony Russo are in talks to return to helm the next two Avengers movies. Rumor is that Levy is currently focusing on his Star Wars movie instead.

As for Levy’s secrets to success:

Don’t treat the studio like the enemy: I’ve always treated the people who give me the money to do my dream job as worthy of partnership. I don’t lock the room and try to keep the studio out. I make it clear that I’m in charge, but I welcome them into the process because they hold the checkbook that made my dream come true.

Be nice: I can name 15 examples off the top of my head of people who were assholes when they were on top. And when that wheel turns, when you’re no longer on top, if you treated people poorly when you were, nobody is going to hold the door open for you to get back in.

You don’t know what’s around the corner: In my 30s, I was the well-paid, commercially successful family comedy guy. And then in my 40s, things got more interesting because I was suddenly directing things like Real Steel and Date Night and The Internship. Now, in my 50s, I’ve gotten to make Free Guy and The Adam Project and All the Light We Cannot See and Deadpool & Wolverine. Don’t ever assume that what you’ve done is all that you’re going to get to do.

Be decisive: When you fail to be decisive, not only do you undermine the actor’s trust, but the crew starts to feel a power vacuum. And eventually lack of decisiveness leads to wasting time. And wasting time is disrespectful of the crew’s time.

This is an inherently emotional business: Whether it’s a company meeting with my staff at 21 Laps or my set with several hundred crewmembers, if you lead with feeling and enthusiasm and emotionality, I find it brings out the best in people.

Box office: 'Deadpool & Wolverine' hits ₹100cr milestone in India

By Isha Sharma 09:09 am Aug 04, 202409:09 am

What's the story The Marvel film Deadpool & Wolverine, featuring Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, has achieved a significant milestone by crossing the ₹100 crore mark on its ninth day of release in India. The film had a robust opening and has maintained strong performance, successfully passing the Week 1 test. The ongoing success of the film indicates it is poised for a lengthy run at the box office. It is directed by Shawn Levy and features multiple cameos from MCU characters.

Successful release

'Deadpool & Wolverine' ends Marvel Studios's uncertainty

Deadpool & Wolverine was released on July 26, ending a period of uncertainty for Marvel Studios after the conclusion of Avengers: Endgame in 2019. Early estimates by Sacnilk suggest that the film earned a substantial ₹89.90 crore in its first week at the Indian box office. This impressive figure includes both English and Hindi dubbed versions of the film.

Record earnings

'Deadpool & Wolverine' joins 100 crore club in India

The film collected ₹21 crore on its opening day and has maintained a winning streak since then. On Day 9, it collected an estimated ₹7.25 crore, bringing its total to ₹101.40 crore and securing its place in the 100 crore club. This achievement is noteworthy for a Hollywood movie in the Indian market, especially since it has already broken records in the US market. Indian releases such as Kalki 2898 AD and Ulajh have been unsuccessful in marring its business."

Before making the jump to DC Studios, Gunn was a fixture at Marvel Studios for many years, writing and directing three Guardians of the Galaxy movies, the GOTG Holiday Special, and helming Stan Lee's cameos in Doctor Strange, Spider-Man: Homecoming and Thor: Ragnarök (among other things).

So, it's hardly surprising that Gunn would be pleased to see the MCU doing well - although some fans are wondering how the filmmaker would feel about a certain joke early on in the movie.

Spoilers ahead!

When Wade Wilson begins his search for a Wolverine Variant, one of the alternate universe takes on the character he encounters is played by Man of Steel star Henry Cavill. After first expressing his excitement, the Merc With a Mouth tells ""Cavillrine"" that the MCU will ""treat him a lot better than they did across the street.""

This is, of course, a reference to Cavill briefly reprising the role of Superman for Black Adam's post-credits scene only to be replaced by David Corenswet when Gunn and Peter Safran came aboard and decided to reboot the franchise.

It's a playful enough dig, and we can't imagine Gunn getting too worked up about it - assuming he's even seen the movie!

Have you been to see Deadpool and Wolverine yet? If so, what did you think? Check out our review here, and drop us a comment down below.

The MPAA recently gave the movie an official R-rating for: ""Strong bloody violence and language throughout, gore, and sexual references.""

“Marvel Studios presents their most significant mistake to date - Deadpool & Wolverine,"" reads the new synopsis. ""A listless Wade Wilson toils away in civilian life. His days as the morally flexible mercenary, Deadpool, behind him. When his homeworld faces an existential threat, Wade must reluctantly suit-up again with an even more reluctantlier... reluctanter? Reluctantest? He must convince a reluctant Wolverine to - F*ck. Synopses are so f*cking stupid.”

In addition to Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman in the title roles, Deadpool and Wolverine will see Morena Baccarin (Vanessa), Leslie Uggams (Blind Al), Rob Delaney (Peter), Brianna Hildebrand (Negasonic Teenage Warhead) And Shioli Kutsuna (Yukio) return as their respective characters, and they'll be joined by franchise newcomers Emma Corrin (The Crown) and Matthew Macfadyen (Succession), who will play a TV agent and Charles Xavier's evil counterpart, Cassandra Nova.

Shawn Levy directs Deadpool and Wolverine from a script by Ryan Reynolds, Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, and Zeb Wells.

The movie is set to open in U.S. & Canadian theaters on July 26, and will be available in IMAX, RealD 3D, Dolby Cinema, 4DX, Cinemark XD and premium screens everywhere. Will you be checking out Deadpool and Wolverine opening weekend? Let us know in the comments section."

Ryan Reynolds had previously responded to the leaks, which revealed cameos that have since been confirmed in official trailers, asking for everybody not to run the images to ""preserve"" the surprises for everybody.

For Shawn Levy, though, the leaks weren't a surprise, as he expected them to happen once they had decided to film on location.

""We made a choice early on. The traditional way to make one of these huge movies is largely on sound stages with green screens or LEDs or Volume work and mocap. We said no to that. Before we started, we said no,"" he told Digital Spy.

""This is Deadpool and Wolverine. These are real-world anti-heroes. They don't come from space. They aren't magic. They aren't digital. They're analogue. And so we shot the movie with a real reliance on analogue real locations, real sets that we built at scale.

""We knew images would leak, and we thought that the trade-off was worth it because what you get now is a movie that feels raw and authentic in the way I think fans want Deadpool and Wolverine.""

Levy's thoughts were echoed by executive producer Wendy Jacobson, who said it was a ""risk that we were willing to take"" for filming on location.

She added to Digital Spy that, thanks to the Marvel security team, they had a plan in place so that the major surprises weren't going to leak before the movie's release.

""Every time we were going out on location, they knew which ones were the most riskiest, where leaks would likely occur, and ones that we could maybe control more than others. And I wouldn't have changed a thing,"" Jacobson recalled.

""Some of our biggest action sequences or biggest spoilers, in particular one, we made sure to do on the back lot at Pinewood that we totally controlled.

""Unfortunately there's just not enough space for us to do everything on the studio, and if you need woods or the quarry where we shot what was leaked, you've got to go out in the real world.""

We don't have too long to wait to find out what the ""biggest spoilers"" are, and Levy has already been teasing the movie's ""bold"" opening sequence.

That’s how director Shawn Levy and Ryan Reynolds convinced Chris Evans, Jennifer Garner, Wesley Snipes, Channing Tatum and more major stars to join Reynolds and Hugh Jackman in the otherwise top-secret cast of “Deadpool & Wolverine.” In the multiversal adventure, those actors reprised their roles from various Fox-era Marvel movies, including Evans as Johnny Storm from 2005’s “Fantastic Four” and the 2007 sequel “Rise of the Silver Surfer,” Garner’s Elektra from 2003’s “Daredevil” and 2005’s “Elektra,” Snipes from the “Blade” trilogy, and Tatum as Gambit — whose film never saw the light of day. Despite the many, many years that have passed since those names first donned their Spandex costumes, Levy says they didn’t require much persuading to get back in uniform.

“With pretty much no exceptions, every surprise casting in this movie came down to Ryan or I reaching out to the actor before lawyers and before agents [were involved],” Levy, who also co-wrote and produced the movie, told Variety July 29, the Monday after opening weekend. “It literally was us asking and invariably people saying ‘yes.'”

Popular on Variety

Thanks to those high-wattage cameos (some of which were kept under wraps better than others) as well as pent-up demand to see Jackman’s gruff mutant Logan emerge from retirement and finally pair with Reynolds’ wise-cracking Merc With a Mouth, “Deadpool & Wolverine” has obliterated box office expectations. After two weekends of release, the film has grossed $824 to stand as the second-biggest movie of 2024. It’s not an educated wish to declare it’s about to become only the second R-rated film in history to surpass $1 billion globally after 2019’s “Joker” with $1.07 billion.

In a spoiler-filled conversation, Levy spoke to Variety about assembling a who’s who of Fox-era Marvel stars, crafting Tatum’s intentionally unintelligible Gambit accent and the truth about those persistent Taylor Swift rumors.

How did the team pitch Wesley Snipes on returning as Blade?

Wesley’s return as Blade was a very early idea of Ryan’s. We wanted to explore themes of legacy, characters and their endings. Ryan had said, “Blade never really got that moment, and I think people don’t even realize how much they miss Wesley Snipes as Blade until they see him. Let’s give them that feeling.” So, Ryan reached out to Wesley. Wesley has not played Blade in a long time. He and Ryan have not been in close touch in a very long time. But we made clear to Wesley that this was not going for a joke. This was out of reverence for his legacy as this iconic character.

Where did Wesley’s line, “There’s only been one Blade. There will only ever be one Blade,” come from?

That was a scripted line, and Wesley thought it was hysterical. We tried a bunch of reactions from Deadpool but ultimately went with that eyebrows-raised-Deadpool-fourth-wall-breaking look.

What went into crafting Channing Tatum’s Gambit accent?

I am obsessed with Channing as Gambit in this movie. What went into this, first and foremost, is a decade of Channing wanting to play this part and a decade of Channing almost playing this part at Fox. I know this personally because back in those years, I was one of 25 different directors who met with Channing about directing the Fox “Gambit” movie, and yet it never quite happened. So when we decided to have Gambit in this movie, we knew it would be deeply gratifying for Channing.

We had scripted a lot of those borderline nonsensical lines. We wrote them into the screenplay. But then Channing added a lot of Cajun and French flavor. To this day, there are some things he says — like when he sees Hugh drinking his liquor and he throws a charged-up card his way, he says something that sounds a lot like cooyain-zwah — where I don’t fucking know the words. When Deadpool kept saying “That’s not a word. Who is your dialect coach … the Minions?” that was very much all of us on set. We absolutely loved it.

How quickly did Henry Cavill say “yes” to appearing as a Wolverine variant?

If we’re going to talk about him, we must call him by his actual credited name, the Cavillerine, which Ryan coined. I knew it was undeniable as soon as Ryan came up with that term. He said “yes” right away because he knew it would be subversive and playful. It was also with a lot of affection for him and his body of work, and playing with his legacy as a DC hero now that he’s appearing as a variant of a Marvel hero.

Was there ever truth to the Taylor Swift cameo rumors?

That was one of the loudest rumors that came out of nowhere. It was never true. Thank you, internet, for building such a smokescreen of rumors and half-truths so that no one ever knew what was going to happen.

There were a lot of gasps at the New York premiere at the jokes about Hugh’s and Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck’s divorce. Were those lines scripted? Were you concerned they’d be offended?

We never did a joke about or with anyone that we didn’t run by them first. Whether it was scripted, like the Daredevil line, or unscripted, like “He’s normally shirtless, but he’s let himself go since the divorce,” which was more of on-set improv, Ryan or I would always run the lines by performers and make sure everyone felt comfortable and that we were never punching down. It was all in a playful spirit that everyone felt good about. Those lines wouldn’t be in the movie if Hugh and Jen didn’t think they were funny.

Since he’s named-checked, was Ben Affleck ever in talks to return as Daredevil?

Early on, when we were looking at a 70-name menu of Marvel characters, Daredevil was on one of those lists, but never since those earliest of conversations, and never to the point of outreach or offers or anything like that. We made contact with everyone featured in the Fox tribute reel halfway through our end credits — and that’s dozens of actors who have been a part of that legacy. That was fun to build a love letter to those years, those characters, and all the actors who played them.

Were there any legacy characters you wanted in the film but that ultimately didn’t pan out?

When you go into the MCU and have unlimited access to this legacy of characters, you have to be your own disciplinarian. We wanted the movie to, above all, be warm-hearted. It can’t be emotional or poignant if you’re not vested in these characters. We didn’t want to go so crazy with the multiverse that you take your eye off the balls that count most. We were judicious. Several of these characters were in early drafts of the scripts and never changed. Pyro made sense because we knew Johnny Storm was going to be in the movie. And who has a certain superheroic capacity with fire? Pyro. Other ideas were more personal. Zeb Wells, one of our co-writers, has always been a mad fan of Tyler Mane’s Sabretooth. He wrote Sabretooth into a first draft, and it never left because it got him so excited, and that made the rest of us so excited. Others along the way, like the Blob and Azazel, evolved over eight months of pre-production. There was a brief conversation about, “Should we do the Vinnie Jones’ Juggernaut? Should we do a CGI juggernaut?” Ultimately, we thought that we had enough bringbacks in Aaron Stanford, Tyler, Jen and Wesley that we thought, “Let’s do another variant [with a different actor] and keep it non-CGI.” So we used Aaron Reed, who plays Dude in “Free Guy.”

Was it important to Ryan that his wife, Blake Lively, and their kids have cameos in the film?

It just honestly was that they were available and always nearby. A lot of times, we would call people into our edit room and have them record something. Little by little, all of the Reynoldses started being a part of the movie, including their youngest. As the proud godfather of Olin, that might be my favorite voice cameo.

Did you ever plan to show Lady Deadpool’s face?

We never discussed taking off her mask. So there’s always the future.

Ooh, is that a teaser?

It’s definitely not a promise. We also wanted this to be a standalone movie that leaves everything possible but serves no next movie. It is not a setup to anything, so we’ll see what happens.

At one point in the movie, Wolverine tells Deadpool he’s going to beat him up if a single word comes out of his mouth. How did he land on “gubernatorial” as that single word?

I don’t remember, except we went through a lot of words before we ended up on that one. Rarely is it the first idea. We like to really open up our minds and riff on alternatives. I do remember there was once a follow-up joke about Deadpool saying, “Is it pronounced guber-natorial? It’s a confusing word.” But that didn’t that didn’t make the final cut.

Do you have a favorite easter egg or reference in the film?

There is a super classic old-school Thor helmet in the foreground of a void shot that’s from the ’70s or ’80s. It feels so rooted in my own youth. There’s a picture of Tony Stark in Happy Hogan’s office, and we don’t see who is in the picture with Tony. There’s been a lot of fan theories about that, and we conveniently block the other person with an Iron Man helmet. That was a fun shot to line up. Obviously, the proof that Tony Stark has a heart was one of the most thrilling shots I’ve ever gotten to do in my career because that’s a part of genre history. And then maybe you’ll notice a walk-and-talk scene on a green rolling hillside, and there’s the charred vehicle and trunk from “Plane Trains and Automobiles” inexplicably parked on the hillside. That’s a nod to that movie, which inspired a lot of the DNA of our movie.

I almost forgot to ask you the most important question of all! Why was Thor crying?

I would love to know. And I would also love to be part of answering that question someday.

Does this mean you’re open to directing another Marvel movie?

I don’t know what form my Marvel future will take, but I’m very confident Marvel and I aren’t done with each other.

Director Shawn Levy recently teased that the Marvel film will feature “a lot of characters” and that cameos will be “peppered throughout.”

“We didn’t want any of the cameos or characters to be the story of the movie. But they are peppered in throughout. There’s a lot of characters,” Levy told Entertainment Weekly.

On the rumors about who will cameo, Levy said, “The internet is a delight of rumors about the multitude of character cameos that are in this movie. Some rumors are true, some are way off base.”

One of the persistent rumors is that Taylor Swift will have a cameo in Deadpool & Wolverine with star Ryan Reynolds, and a close friend to the singer, reigniting the buzz recently. Reynolds shared a Deadpool photo on Instagram where he was seen channeling Swift’s album cover for Evermore.

Deadpool & Wolverine opens in theaters on July 26, but Reynolds once thought he would not be able to reprise the superhero role. Amid the Disney and Fox merger, he told EW, “I didn’t know if I’d ever be playing Deadpool again. It’s not something I would’ve said necessarily publicly, but I didn’t know how a character like that would fit into that world [of the MCU].”

Reynolds is joined by Hugh Jackman, who is reprising his role of Wolverine from the X-Men franchise. Other actors in Deadpool & Wolverine include Emma Corrin as Cassandra Nova and Matthew Macfadyen as Paradox.

However, director Shawn Levy expressed his desire for Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) and Peter Parker (Tom Holland) to collaborate in future films, as revealed in the new issue of Total Film, which features Deadpool & Wolverine on the cover.

As Ryan Reynolds is set to join the MCU movie timeline, and Deadpool's transition into a full-fledged MCU player allows him to interact with various heroes and villains.

Shawn Levy wants Deadpool and Spider-Man to collaborate

In the latest issue of Total Film via Games Radar, Shawn Levy chatted about other MCU projects he would love to tackle after his work on Deadpool & Wolverine. Sticking with Deadpool, Levy stressed that he would be interested in directing a movie with Deadpool and Spider-Man.

""The thing about Deadpool is I think he makes everything more interesting because of his audacity,"" he said. ""But, boy, I'd sure love to see Deadpool and Spidey. That's a movie I'd love to make. I feel like Tom Holland would run circles around everyone else.""

Tom Holland's ongoing development of Spider-Man 4 could make a Deadpool and Spider-Man movie an ideal continuation for Peter Parker, who is currently on his own after being forgotten by Doctor Strange's spell in Spider-Man: No Way Home. Spider-Man 4 is expected to see him navigate a world without friends or family.

However, once he has faced this emotional journey in Spider-Man 4, a Deadpool and Spider-Man team-up could be a lot more fitting. Not only would it be fun to see Peter meet someone like Wade, but this could introduce a new concept for Spider-Man's live-action legacy, as Deadpool could literally show him the power of breaking the fourth wall.

A Deadpool and Spider-Man movie would also fit the direction for Peter in the MCU, as Marvel is seemingly looking to explore more of his street-level side.

Reynolds and Holland's collaboration with Marvel Studios would be a significant project, especially after Deadpool & Wolverine. However, it's unlikely to happen until Phase 7, as Marvel Studios is focusing on The Multiverse Saga. With Deadpool & Wolverine's box office success, a Deadpool and Spider-Man movie could become a reality.

Hugh Jackman's return as Wolverine will boost the franchise's numbers

Deadpool & Wolverine, the only MCU movie releasing in 2024, is expected to become the first in three years to surpass a billion dollars at the box office. The film, which promises a major multiversal misadventure, is expected to have a successful box office run due to compelling reasons.

Deadpool & Wolverine, set to release on July 26th, reunites Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool and Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, resembling their iconic roles from 2009's X-Men Origins. The film explores the MCU and X-Men universe, featuring a mysterious crisis and the Time Variance Authority's attempt to recruit Wade Wilson for the multiverse.

According to Box Office Mojo, 2016's Deadpool grossed $782,837,347 worldwide. Likewise, 2018's Deadpool 2 made even more at the box office with a worldwide all-time gross of $785,896,632. Both are extremely impressive numbers for R-rated films, as both are in the Top 5 highest-grossing R-rated movies of all time.

Hugh Jackmann's Wolverine will more than likely make up the difference. The combination of Jackman coming out of what many believed was a role he'd retired with 2017's Logan as well as doing so for the sake of a Deadpool team-up is a potent pairing. Regardless of how good or bad the film actually is, the draw of Jackman alone should boost Deadpool & Wolverines well past the successes of the previous two Deadpool movies.

Hugh Jackman's return to the Wolverine role is a big deal. Having originally debuted as Logan in 2000's X-Men, Jackman has been the sole live-action Wolverine for over 24 years. As such, Jackman's return after his character's death in 2017's Logan came as quite a surprise.

The opportunity to see Jackman playing what will likely be a variant of Wolverine joining forces with Deadpool and wearing a legitimate supersuit like the one seen in the comics will prove to be very exciting.

Marvel Studios has already begun the post-production process for scenes filmmaker Shawn Levy has shot, while we're guessing the script is being worked on as we speak to account for any possible reshoots which will need to take place once filming resumes.

Wired recently caught up with Levy and asked where things stand with the movie. After expressing his hope that the strike gets a ""legitimately fair, equitable resolution soon,"" the filmmaker adds, ""Within weeks of the strikes ending we will be back in the United Kingdom shooting the second half of Deadpool.""

The site pushed Levy to divulge spoilers, though he knows better than that. However, the director would say there's a lot of ""misinformation"" online about Deadpool 3's cameos, ""including the Taylor Swift cameo that this interview neither confirms nor denies.""

Ultimately, it sounds like Levy's priority was to bring the Merc with the Mouth into the MCU while finding the correct balance between his R-Rated antics and being part of a much larger world.

""I’ll simply say the whole challenge and North Star priority on this movie was to embrace and take advantage of membership in the MCU without sacrificing or abandoning the raw, gritty, grounded DNA of Deadpool. It’s very much still the Deadpool we all love, but with many new opportunities.""

""Not only have Kevin Feige and Marvel and Disney supported this extremely Deadpool-ian, audacious, R-rated tone, they’ve also supported our super meta, self-referential self-awareness,"" he continues. ""Some of the jokes are dirty, some of them are cultural observations, but that’s what we love about Deadpool, that he knows he’s in a movie, even though the stakes are real.""

""Our movie is very loyal to that DNA too, with tremendous Marvel and Disney support, in making fun of and being self-aware about everything, including themselves.""

After a so-so couple of years for Marvel Studios, it sounds like Deadpool 3 will be the movie that puts the MCU back on the right track.

Alongside Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, Deadpool franchise vets Karan Soni (Dopinder), Leslie Uggams (Blind Al), Morena Baccarin (Vanessa), Stefan Kapicic (Colossus), Brianna Hildebrand (Negasonic Teenage Warhead), Shioli Kutsuna (Yukio), and Rob Delaney (Peter) are all set to return in this threequel.

Emma Corrin is expected to play Cassandra Nova, while Matthew Macfadyen will likely take on the role of a TVA agent named Paradox. It's also been confirmed that Jennifer Garner will reprise her role as Elektra, with Liev Schreiber, James Marsden, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, and even Loki's Owen Wilson expected to appear.

You probably don't need us to catch you up on the chatter surrounding Swift's recent attendance at NFL games, but comic book fans have taken note of the fact she was at MetLife Stadium to see the Kansas City Chiefs face the New York Jets. Why is that significant? Well, she was there alongside Deadpool 3 director Shawn Levy and stars Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman.

They're currently on a break from shooting Deadpool 3 due to the SAG-AFTRA strike and, while we're sure this was just a case of friends hanging out (Reynolds' wife, Blake Lively, was also on hand), it feels like there may be something to this.

Swift has acting experience after appearing in the likes of Amsterdam and Cats, and this is just the sort of show-stopping cameo Reynolds has the ability to arrange. The buzz surrounding it would no doubt give Deadpool 3 a boost at the box office too (not that it's likely to need one based on what we know).

Dazzler feels too predictable a role for Swift, so we go back to the Merc with the Mouth's female counterpart Wanda Wilson. Hailing from Earth-3010, she joined a group of rebels fighting against loyalists in the United States after fascists in the federal government started to impose their will on the people.

We'll see what happens, but even if a cameo hasn't been planned before now, we're sure Reynolds has noticed how much fans want to see it happen. Ultimately, though, it may hinge on whether the singer actually has time to shoot any sort of role in Deadpool 3...

Alongside Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, Deadpool franchise vets Karan Soni (Dopinder), Leslie Uggams (Blind Al), Morena Baccarin (Vanessa), Stefan Kapicic (Colossus), Brianna Hildebrand (Negasonic Teenage Warhead), Shioli Kutsuna (Yukio), and Rob Delaney (Peter) are all set to return in this threequel.

Emma Corrin is expected to play Cassandra Nova, while Matthew Macfadyen will likely take on the role of a TVA agent named Paradox. It's also been confirmed that Jennifer Garner will reprise her role as Elektra, with Liev Schreiber, James Marsden, Patrick Stewart, and Ian McKellen among the many names rumoured to appear.

Shawn Levy on cameos and box-office success. 'Deadpool & Wolverine'.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/movies/deadpool-and-wolverine-shawn-levy.html,"Though the director Shawn Levy has spent the last several months promoting his new blockbuster, “Deadpool & Wolverine,” there was so much he couldn’t say until now.

“This conversation will be tantamount to therapy for me,” Levy joked last week as he signed on to a video call to discuss cameos and plot elements that had to be kept hidden until after the film’s juggernaut opening weekend. (Major spoilers follow.)

Though trailers sold the movie as a team-up between Ryan Reynolds’s meta mercenary, Deadpool, and Hugh Jackman’s surly mutant, Wolverine, the starry supporting cast includes some big surprises, including Jennifer Garner as the assassin Elektra, Wesley Snipes as the vampire hunter Blade and Channing Tatum as the card-tossing mutant Gambit. The film’s multiverse-spanning shenanigans also allow the return of Chris Evans, who retired his Captain America character in “Avengers: Endgame” but here reprises Johnny Storm, the “Fantastic Four” character he played back when 20th Century Fox owned key pieces of the Marvel portfolio.

Levy said nearly all of those surprise cameos were hatched in Reynolds’s apartment, where much of the movie was conceived amid pie-in-the-sky brainstorming. “It was the two of us acting scenes out, passing a laptop back and forth and saying, ‘Hey, what if this?’” Levy recalled. “It invariably led to one of us texting that actor and just asking.”"

Lady Deadpool initially seemed like a possibility, and it unsurprisingly took no time at all for Dazzler's name to be mentioned concerning the best-selling musician.

It's no secret that Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige is a fan of the character and the threequel is arguably the perfect opportunity to make this dream casting a reality. Swift is no stranger to acting after appearing in the likes of Amsterdam and Cats, though it's since been reported the singer will play herself.

The buzz surrounding any sort of cameo would also give Deadpool 3 a boost at the box office courtesy of her devoted fanbase. In recent weeks, NFL fans have become acquainted with Swift thanks to her appearances at Kansas City Chiefs games, so why wouldn't she expand her reach to MCU fans as well?

During a recent interview with Happy Sad Confused, Deadpool 3 director Shawn Levy was once again asked about the possibility of Swift - who released 1989 (Taylor's Version) today - showing up alongside the Merc with the Mouth and Wolverine.

""Um, it sure escapes the lips of social media every day, and that's all I'm gonna say,"" the filmmaker responded when asked if the word ""Dazzler"" has ever been mentioned during his recent meetings with Swift.

Quizzed specifically on whether he thinks she would be a good Dazzler, Levy added, ""Sounds like a great idea. I feel like, 'Oh wow, I went to a football game a couple weeks ago, and I had a really good time with friends, and I am thrilled to be talking about other things.'""

The plot has, however, thickened after Levi was once again spotted alongside Swift in New York City earlier this week...

Dazzler first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #130 in 1980 and is a mutant with the ability to convert sound vibrations into light and energy beams, Developed as a cross-promotional, multi-media creation between Casablanca Records and Marvel Comics, she was created by a committee of Marvel staff, principally writer/editor Tom DeFalco and illustrator John Romita Jr.

Dazzler has been described as one of Marvel's most notable and powerful female heroes and is often labelled as an LGBT icon.

The 'Look What You Made Me Do' singer is heavily rumoured to be appearing in the film for a few reasons. She's good friends with Reynolds' wife Blake Lively, recently attended a sports game with Reynolds, Hugh Jackman and director Shawn Levy, and would generally be a good fit for rumoured character Dazzler, who can turn sound into light.

Speaking to the Vancouver Sun after receiving the Order of British Columbia for his acting and business success (he owns a mobile network, a gin, and Wrexham FC), Reynolds was pressed about Swift.

He didn't give an answer either way, but in true businessman fashion, he made sure to get the film's release date in his answer.

""Yeah, I've heard that one. I love it (the gossip),"" he said.

""I think it is a sign of how eager people are to get a peek behind the curtain in this world. Every single one of these secrets and spoilers will be revealed on July 26.""

Levy also recently responded to the rumours with a non-committal answer, stating: ""I’m going across the board. 'No comment' because that's a double whammy.

Rumors have been flying that Swift may appear in Deadpool 3 as the sound-powered singer mutant Dazzler. These mumblings were only furthered after the pop sensation attended a Chiefs NFL game with Levy and the movie's stars, Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman.

This isn't the first time talk of Swift playing Dazzer surfaced, as she was once speculated to appear in 2016's X-Men: Apocalypse after the singer appeared in a photo with the movie's writer and leading cast.

Taylor Swift

During an interview with The Wrap, Deadpool 3 director Shawn Levy was asked about the potential for Taylor Swift to join the threequel as the mutant Dazzler.

Speaking on the Swifties calling for the singer to play the X-Men hero, the director explained how her fans ""sure are loud.” But alas, Levy offered a ""no comment"" response to the rumors due to its link to two popular topics, Swift and the MCU:

""‘No comment’ because that’s a double whammy. That’s Taylor-related. And it’s MCU-related. I’m no dummy.""

Leaving off on a cryptic note, Levy added how fans are ""going to have to wait and see” whether the singer will appear in the Ryan Reynolds-led blockbuster.

Deadpool 3 has been teased to include some major cameos, with several iconic Fox X-Men heroes expected to return and Jennifer Garner reportedly reprising her role as Elektra from Ben Affleck's Daredevil (2003).

Will Taylor Swift Actually Appear in Deadpool 3?

Marvel Studios

Taylor Swift hanging out in public with the three most important men making Deadpool 3 may indicate her involvement in the production, but things might not be exactly as they seem on that front.

Swift has been friends with Reynolds' wife, Blake Lively, who was also present at the Chiefs game since 2015, and the singer's reported current boyfriend, tight end Travis Kelce, actually plays for the aforementioned NFL team.

There's a chance Swift may simply have been attending the Chiefs game to support her boyfriend and just happened to find herself tagging along with the Deadpool 3 cast and director through her connection to Lively.

Although Shawn Levy's refusal to confirm nor deny whether Swift will appear in Deadpool 3 with a cryptic ""no comment"" does add some fuel to the fire, suggesting the notion may well be on the table.

Having the singer appear as Dazzler, even as a cameo, would certainly boost the box office for Deadpool 3, as the record-breaking success of her new Eras Tour concert movie proves how the Swifties will turn out to theaters to support her.

Perhaps Swift could even write an original song for Deadpool 3, one which she could even sing as Dazzler in the MCU blockbuster.

While the singing mutant may be a rather obscure one, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige is a big fan of the X-Men hero, and Swift has been a popular fan cast to deliver her live-action debut for many years now.

Shawn Levy on cameos and box-office success. 'Deadpool & Wolverine'.,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/deadpool-wolverine-box-office-record-205m-opening-1235960325/,"The Merc with the Mouth is back on the big screen — and he’s a marvel.

Directed by Shawn Levy in close collaboration with franchise mastermind and star Ryan Reynolds, Deadpool & Wolverine opened to a record-shattering $211 million at the domestic box office, landing the sixth-biggest opening of all time for any film and by far the biggest launch for an R-rated film, according to final numbers. That’s up from Sunday’s estimate of $205 million, which would have made it the eighth-biggest opening of all time. The first Deadpool was the previous R-rated record-holder at $133.7 million. The jump from $205 million to $211 million is a big one and underscores how the movie is out-pacing all modeling (put another way, Sunday traffic was far bigger than expected).

Deadpool 3 also shattered records for an R-rated pic on a global scale, opening to $233.1 million internationally from 55 materials markets for a worldwide start of $441.1 million, up from Sunday’s estimate of $438.3 million.

Among additional records domestically, the film is the top opening ever for Reynolds, Levy and co-lead Hugh Jackman and the fourth-biggest superhero launch. It’s also the top July opening, as well as the biggest launch since Spider-Man: No Way Home in December 2021, when the Sony/Marvel pic opened to $260.1 million domestically.

Globally, it’s also the biggest opening since No Way Home after passing up Avatar: The Way of the Water ($439 million) on Sunday. And it pushed Marvel’s MCU movies past the $30 billion mark in combined worldwide ticket sales, further solidifying it as the top-grossing franchise in history (that includes movies distributed by Sony, Paramount and Universal, versus just Disney).

Premium format screens contributed 18 percent of the gross, led by $36.5 million in Imax ticket sales, a July and R-rated record for the large-format exhibitor.

Heading into the weekend, the threequel — which returns Reynolds as Wade Wilson/Deadpool and brings Jackman into the franchise as Logan/Wolverine — was expected to open to $160 million to $175 million in North America, which were already huge numbers for a movie with the restricted rating.

Deadpool & Wolverine is the first R-rated movie released by Disney and puts the Kevin Feige-run Marvel on the road to recovery after a rough patch. The movie’s performance was fueled by strong reviews, an A CinemaScore, near-perfect exit scores and a 97 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, the second-best score ever for a Marvel film behind Sony and Marvel’s Spider-Man: No Way Home.

The pic skewed male, or 63 percent, as most superhero films do. One difference in terms of demos between this and past Deadpool films was that it played to a more ethnically diverse audience. White moviegoers made up 43 percent of ticket buyers, followed by Latino moviegoers (30 percent), Black moviegoers (13 percent), Asian moviegoers (9 percent) and Native American/Others (5 percent), according to weighted PostTrak data. In terms of key stats, the R-rated movie showed strength across all age groups, even the under-17 crowd.

Overseas, China led all foreign markets with $24 million, which is a solid showing for a Hollywood film braving tough conditions at the China box office. (Once a boon for Western studios, China has become far less important in terms of whether a film is deemed successful overall.) The pic came in well ahead of the previous two Deadpool films in almost all markets. The U.K. turned in a hefty $22.1 million, followed by Mexico with $18.7 million, Australia with $13 million and Germany and India with $10 million each.

The first Deadpool made history when opening to $133.7 million domestically in February 2016, proving that a superhero pic could draw big crowds despite the restrictive rating. A little more than two years later, Deadpool 2 debuted to $125.5 million.

Feige’s Marvel took over the irreverent Deadpool franchise when Marvel’s parent company Disney swallowed up 20th Century Fox, which had rights to the X-Men universe of characters.

Deadpool 3 wasn’t the only headline for Disney’s film empire at the box office this weekend. Pixar’s Inside Out 2 — already the biggest animated film of all time worldwide — passed up fellow Pixar title Incredibles 2 in North America to become the biggest animated film of all time domestically, with a cume of $613.4 million. Its worldwide tally is now $1.5 billion.

While Deadpool 3 created its own tornado at the box office, Twisters managed to withstand the storm. The Amblin Entertainment film fell 57 percent in its second weekend — the decline could have been far worse — to $36 million for a 10-day domestic total of $155.6 million. It placed No. 2 domestically. Overseas, it added another $11.1 million from 56 markets for a foreign tally of $66.3 million and $221.9 million globally. Universal is handling domestic distribution duties, while Warner Bros. has overseas duties.

Universal and Illumination’s Despicable Me 4 held at third place with $14.5 million for a domestic tally of $290.9 million. It turned in another $37.6 million from 80 markets for a foreign haul of $386.7 million and $677.7 million.

Inside Out 2 came in fourth, followed by Neon’s Longlegs in fifth place. The hit indie horror pic also made box office history in becoming Neon’s biggest film ever with $58.6 million in domestic ticket sales after earning another $6.8 million this weekend (the pic continues to grow in screen count based on demand). The crown previously belonged to Neon’s Oscar-winning Parasite, which grossed $53.4 million.

Shawn Levy on cameos and box-office success. 'Deadpool & Wolverine'.,https://variety.com/2024/film/news/ryan-reynolds-fox-marvel-movies-deadpool-wolverine-success-1236088716/,"Ryan Reynolds is bidding farewell to the “fun, weird, uneven and risky world” that was 20th Century Fox’s Marvel movies.

The studio, which was acquired by Disney in 2019, was home to the first two “Deadpool” films, starring Reynolds as the wisecracking anti-hero with whom he’s become synonymous. 20th Century Fox produced 18 Marvel adaptations over the years, including the “X-Men” installments with Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, “Fantastic Four” and “Daredevil.” The third “Deadpool” entry, titled “Deadpool & Wolverine,” is significant because it ushers the comic book characters that were previously licensed to 20th Century Fox into Disney’s Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Reynolds on Sunday shared a cast photo from 2015 with some of the biggest stars from 20th Century Fox’s Marvel era, including at least one actor (Channing Tatum as Gambit) whose film never saw the light of day. Along with Reynolds and Jackman, Jennifer Lawrence (Mystique), James McAvoy (Professor Charles Xavier), Michael Fassbender (Magneto), Miles Teller (Mr. Fantastic) and Evan Peters (Quicksilver) are featured in the picture. As Reynolds alludes in the caption, the movies that spotlighted these characters weren’t all critical or commercial winners. But, he says, “we wouldn’t trade it for anything.”

Popular on Variety

“This isn’t just Deadpool saying ‘Oh, Hello’ to the MCU. It’s Deadpool – and Hugh, Shawn [Levy] and me – saying farewell to a place and an era that literally made us,” Reynolds wrote on Instagram. “We are forever grateful to the fun, weird, uneven and risky world of 20th Century Fox. It was our origin story and we wouldn’t trade it for anything. And thank you to Kevin Feige and Disney for allowing us to share it.”

“Deadpool & Wolverine,” directed by Shawn Levy and co-starring Reynolds and Jackman, crushed box office expectations with $211 million in North America and $438 million globally. Those ticket sales rank as the biggest opening weekend of the year, the largest ever for an R-rated film and the sixth-best domestic debut of all time.

“This is kind of hard to process,” Reynolds shared on Instagram after opening weekend. “But thank you to everyone who went to see the film this weekend.”

Deadpool & Wolverine is crushing the box office, breaking records, and giving the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise a much-needed spark of life. However, despite all the fun cameos the film throws at viewers, one of the biggest rumored appearances never happens.

Taylor Swift's name has been attached to Deadpool & Wolverine for almost as long as Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds' names have. Now that the film is in theaters, director Shawn Levy is addressing whether or not Marvel fans ever had a hope of seeing Swift play Dazzler in Deadpool & Wolverine:

""It was never a conversation. It was never even a seed of a discussion,"" Shawn Levy told EW. ""Obviously, Ryan and Blake – and myself, to a far lesser extent – have our own relationships in real life with Taylor. But, yeah, those rumors were loud and slightly baffling, but nothing I said or did was going to make them quiet down until this movie came out.""

Levy also explained how the online rumors about Taylor Swift as Dazzler in Deadpool & Wolverine became so rampant that it made him anxious to be delivering that moment in the actual film:

""I definitely had moments where I was worried I would disappoint people when they realized Taylor as Dazzler was not in the movie,"" Levy said. ""But there's no controlling the internet and rumors spread like wildfire.""

Levy touches upon a point that's been a growing phenomenon within the fandom process: fan theories become fan expectations, which then shape fan reactions to the actual movies and TV shows that come out. So, there is legitimate reason for Levy and others involved with Deadpool & Wolverine to have been concerned about possible backlash from Swift fans – who would come away from opening day disappointed in something that never should been expected in the first place.

For her part, Taylor Swift has taken her MCU fan-casting (and so many other rumors) in good stride. When Deadpool & Wolverine was released, Swift made a post celebrating her friends' work – while making sure to also troll Ryan Reynolds, for good measure:

""Over the past few years, I have watched one of my best friends on this planet pour every bit of his heart, soul, sweat, time, energy, jokes, pain, joy, rebellion darkness, and magic into this film,"" Swift wrote. ""He's created the best work of his life, and this film feels like an actual joy portal, a wild escape from reality, and an ab sandwich. I don't know how he did it. But that's just Hugh for you!""

Deadpool & Wolverine is now in theaters."
Shawn Levy on cameos and box-office success. 'Deadpool & Wolverine'.,https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a61763477/deadpool-wolverine-box-office-how-much/,"Deadpool & Wolverine continued to set records for a R-rated movie in its second weekend of release, following its absolutely massive opening weekend.

At the US box office, it recorded the eighth biggest second weekend of all time with $97 million. Its current haul of $395.6 million is now officially the highest-grossing R-rated movie of all time.

Globally, Deadpool & Wolverine has also become the biggest Deadpool movie, surpassing Deadpool 2's $786.2 million.

It's perhaps not a surprise that the team-up of Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool and Hugh Jackman's Wolverine has been a big draw for fans. But the new MCU movie has even surpassed early estimates for just how big it'd be.

While we're not talking Avengers: Endgame numbers, Deadpool & Wolverine is making the biggest Marvel splash since Spider-Man: No Way Home.

But just how much money has Deadpool & Wolverine made, and why has it been such a box-office success? Let's investigate.

Jay Maidment // 20th Century Studios

How much money has Deadpool and Wolverine made?

Following its second weekend, Deadpool & Wolverine has crossed $800 million worldwide and set a number of records for an R-rated movie.

Here's how much Deadpool & Wolverine has made as of August 4, 2024:

US box office: $395,600,000

International box office: $428,500,000

Global box office: $824,100,000

Its huge opening weekend of $444 million marked the biggest-ever for an R-rated movie at both the US box office and worldwide. At the US box office, its $211 million debut was the sixth best opening ever and the biggest opening since Spider-Man: No Way Home.

Having now recorded the biggest second weekend for an R-rated movie, Deadpool & Wolverine has become the highest-grossing R-rated movie of all time at the US box office, surpassing The Passion of the Christ's $370.7 million result.

Worldwide, Deadpool & Wolverine has a little way to go to surpass Joker as the biggest R-rated movie ever. Joker made $1.08 billion globally, a total that the new MCU movie will easily beat.

As mentioned above, it is now the highest-grossing Deadpool movie, which also makes it the highest-grossing X-Men movie ever too.

In terms of the MCU, it is the 17th highest-grossing outing to date and it should break into the top ten by the end of its run. Captain Marvel is currently the 10th-biggest MCU movie with $1.13 billion.

Jay Maidment // Marvel Studios

Deadpool and Wolverine box office: Why has it been a hit?

We'll start by stating the obvious. Beyond the star power involved in pairing Reynolds and Jackman, fans appear to be really liking what they see from the movie too.

Deadpool & Wolverine received an A CinemaScore in the US. It might not be the highest rating for an MCU movie – The Avengers, Black Panther, Endgame and No Way Home all received A+ ratings – but it still suggests that the movie could get repeat business.

It currently has the third-highest audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes behind only No Way Home and Shang-Chi (both 98%). Again, that suggests that despite a slightly more mixed critical reaction, Marvel fans are enjoying it and if they're enjoying it, it leads to them seeing it more than once or at least sharing praise with their friends.

Any mega box-office hit needs repeat business to hit $1 billion and beyond, and Deadpool & Wolverine seems well-placed to have a lengthy run. At worst, it could drop a typical 60% in its second weekend at the US box office, but at best, it could record one of the MCU's best-ever second weekends.

20th Century Studios/Marvel Studios

Deadpool & Wolverine was likely always set to have a major opening weekend after its global press tour saw Reynolds and Jackman in publicity overdrive. But it's what Marvel did next that could lead to its ongoing success.

Following the surprise Comic-Con screening for the movie on the day of its opening previews in the US, the movie's previously-secret guest stars were brought out on stage to a rapturous Hall H reaction.

Of course, that didn't stay just for the Comic-Con crowd and soon made the rounds on social media. Most of those stars also shared their own posts and held interviews, which is unprecedented for a Marvel movie.

Typically, spoilers are kept under lock-and-key – at least officially – for a week or so. For instance, the first official comment on Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire's No Way Home return wasn't released until seven days after its release.

The Comic-Con appearance led to wider coverage of the major stars that were joining Reynolds and Jackman. Rather than spoiling it, it likely led to more people wanting to watch the movie for those stars – even if they weren't a Deadpool or Wolverine fan – especially as they're from an older Marvel era.

Deadpool & Wolverine also ended up with an ideal release date, following the strikes delaying production and leading to it shifting back from May 2024 to July 2024.

Rather than having pressure to kickstart the summer (like The Fall Guy had), the movie arrived as the blockbuster to see this summer. Twisters had primed audiences for more big-screen spectacle, and Deadpool & Wolverine provides just that.

As the only MCU movie released this year, there's also no chance that Marvel fans are fatigued. The only other MCU outing this year was Echo in January and compare that to 2023 - we had two movies and one TV show by July with another movie and two TV shows to come.

Disney has smartly dialled back on the Marvel 'content' (for want of a better word), building up the hype for Deadpool & Wolverine in the process as the sole big-screen outing for MCU fans this year.

Whether it can 'save' the MCU remains to be seen as it's largely separate to the wider issues where movies and TV shows have set up too many characters with little direction. By contrast, Deadpool & Wolverine is a very contained story with no set-up for the future.

With the Multiverse Saga pivoting to Doctor Doom and a certain Robert Downey Jr, the pressure is arguably more on the trio of 2025 movies to deliver and show the MCU is still the franchise to beat.

But for now, Deadpool & Wolverine has surely confirmed that we'll be seeing the titular duo again in the future.

While we knew before Deadpool & Wolverine's release that Keen was reprising her role as Laura/X-23, it was the first official 'reveal' for the other four major cameos waiting for fans in the movie.

Garner was reported to be coming back as Elektra, but the star was doing her best before release to deny it. The others were genuine surprises in the movie, especially as Evans reprised his Human Torch role, rather than Captain America.

“I’ve waited a long time for this team-up,” Ryan Reynolds’ Wade tells Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine at the beginning of the video.

The background chorus of Madonna’s “Like A Prayer” can be heard as Deadpool consoles Wolverine, saying he knows how to save the nine people that are Deadpool’s whole world.

“In my world,” Wade starts, making a face. “You’re well-regarded. You were an X-Man. F*ck that, you were the X-Man. Wolverine. He was a hero in my world.”

Wolverine disagrees.

“Yeah well, he ain’t sh*t in mine,” Jackman says as a shot of a young Laura (Dafne Keen) mourning her father from James Mangold’s Logan (2017). This marked Keen’s debut as X-23.

Wolverine’s doubt continues as he declares “Whoever you think I am, you’ve got the wrong guy.”

A grown-up Keen appears at the end of the trailer, telling Wolverine “You were always the wrong guy. Til you weren’t.”

Keen’s return, paired with the half-buried 20th Century Fox sign in one of the trailer’s first shots as Deadpool confronts Wolverine, signals the changes made to the property since Disney purchased the studio that originally produced Logan.

Shawn Levy on cameos and box-office success. 'Deadpool & Wolverine'.,https://insidethemagic.net/2023/09/ryan-reynolds-sequel-canceled-barbie-nk1/,"The chances of the Ryan Reynolds hit comedy Free Guy (2021) getting a sequel are practically nothing, and Barbie is to blame.

Free Guy starred Ryan Reynolds as Guy, an ordinary man who becomes aware that he is actually a non-player character (or NPC) living in a vast video game. Alongside a human player (Jodie Comer) and various celebrity pal cameos, he becomes self-actualized and basically is able to accept his nature and grow from there.

Free Guy (which was directed by frequent Reynolds collaborator Shawn Levy) was a great success at the box office, grossing a solid $331 million worldwide.

However, even Ryan Reynolds has to acknowledge the overwhelming dominance of Barbie in theaters, which grossed over a billion dollars more than Free Guy. The movie involves Margot Robbie as a fictional character who realizes her own artificiality and has to interact with the “real” world in order to find some sense of self.

While the Margot Robbie movie was released a full two years after Free Guy, even so, Barbie has managed to crush sequel plans.

Ryan Reynolds, Margot Robbie, and ‘Barbie’

In a recent interview at the TIFF media studio at the Cinema Center at MARBL, director Shawn Levy revealed that any developing plans for a sequel had basically been shut down by similarities to the Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie movie.

Specifically, the director said (via Collider), “The truth is that you now have Barbie that has obviously left a mark about a character in a fictional world who comes to self-awareness. So, we’re only gonna make Free Guy 2 if it’s different than the first movie and if it’s different from other movies.”

It seems that the phenomenal success of Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig has been enough to shut down any concrete plans for a Ryan Reynolds sequel.

Ryan Reynolds, Shawn Levy, and ‘Deadpool 3’

Of course, Ryan Reynolds and Shawn Levy have other plans that are not shut down by Barbie. The two are making their debuts in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Deadpool 3, one of the most breathlessly anticipated MCU movies in years.

Deadpool 3 will team up Ryan Reynolds’ Wade Wilson with Hugh Jackman, reprising his role as the X-Men member Wolverine just six years after retiring with Logan (2017).

However, it seems that Reynolds is an extraordinarily persuasive person, and rumors have swirled that any number of famous faces may show up in the movie, including returning mutant actors like Ian McKellen, Dafne Keen, and Liev Schrieber, as well as new ones like Taylor Swift.

The movie has already surpassed the entire domestic run of Deadpool 2 ($324.6 million) and will be the highest-grossing R-Rated movie ever by the end of this weekend.

When it does so, it will also surpass the first Deadpool movie's $363 million domestic haul.

A drop of only -56% is phenomenal and Deadline's sources believe the threequel will end its North American run with a whopping $500 million. We're still waiting on international numbers but the current chatter among analysts points to an eventual global haul of at least $1.2 billion.

RelishMix, a company that analyzes activity across all major social platforms, tells the trade, ""Exit chatter on Deadpool & Wolverine weave in and around the MCU, with fans whose expectations were met and exceeded: 'Having seen the movie a third time, I still want to watch it another time. Seeing the movie is doing well at the box office, smashing a record for a R-rated film, will Disney and Marvel finally realize the future? I hope so.'""

""Fans are also tipping their caps to the two leads, saying 'I’m watching this in cinema a few more times. Masterpiece. Exactly what a Marvel film should be. I didn’t think it was possible. Thank you, Ryan and Hugh.'""

Marvel Studios has also released a new TV spot touting Deadpool & Wolverine's box office success. In that, we get to see Chris Hemsworth's cameo as Thor in its entirety.

Ryan Reynolds has also taken to Instagram and X to share new stills and behind-the-scenes photos from the threequel. If you scroll through the post from the former, there's a fantastic shot of the actor standing side-by-side with Logan's skeleton!

Deadpool & Wolverine star Wesley Snipes has broken two unexpected Guinness World Records.

The actor reprised his role of half-vampire Blade in Marvel's latest blockbuster, nearly 26 years after first playing the character in 1998. This makes him the actor with the longest career as a live-action Marvel character (via Deadline).

Snipes narrowly beat out Wolverine actor Hugh Jackman, who first appeared in X-Men 24 years ago.

Jackman was expected to take the record from Patrick Stewart, who also made his debut as Charles Xavier in X-Men, before reprising his role in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness in 2022.

Snipes's cameo also claims the record for the longest gap between character appearances in Marvel films. He last played Blade more than 19 years ago, in 2004 blockbuster Blade: Trinity, which also starred Ryan Reynolds as Hannibal King.

The record was previously held by Alfred Molina, who played Doctor Octopus in Spider-Man 2 in 2004 and again in Spider-Man: No Way Home in 2021.

""I didn't think we would be able to pull it off,"" he told Entertainment Weekly at this year's San Diego Comic-Con.

As anticipation builds for the premiere of Deadpool & Wolverine , director Shawn Levy has unveiled tantalising details about the Marvel film, promising an array of character cameos that will delight fans.

In an interview obtained by Deadline, Levy emphasised the presence of ""a lot of characters"" and hinted at how these cameos will be seamlessly integrated into the narrative.

""We didn't want any of the cameos or characters to be the story of the movie. But they are peppered in throughout. There's a lot of characters,"" Levy revealed.

Addressing the rampant speculation surrounding the film, Levy acknowledged the internet buzz about various character appearances, confirming, ""The internet is a delight of rumours about the multitude of character cameos that are in this movie. Some rumours are true, some are way off base,"" according to Deadline.

Among the most persistent rumours is the possible cameo of Taylor Swift, fueled by a recent Instagram post from star Ryan Reynolds .

Reynolds shared an image reminiscent of Swift's album cover for 'Evermore', reigniting speculation about the singer's involvement in Deadpool & Wolverine.

The film, set to hit theatres on July 26, marks a significant return for Reynolds as Deadpool, a role he feared might not continue post-the Disney-Fox merger.

Reflecting on this uncertainty, Reynolds admitted, ""I didn't know if I'd ever be playing Deadpool again. It's not something I would've said necessarily publicly, but I didn't know how a character like that would fit into that world [of the MCU].""

The trailer shares a brief look at the events that may unfold in the multiversal adventure of the iconic duo, as Deadpool seeks Wolverine’s aid, who appears burdened by regrets from not being able to save his own world.

Alongside the dynamic duo, viewers also catch a glimpse of the potential villain of the story, Emma Corrin’s Cassandra Nova. And the trailer’s approach mirrors that of the 2021 MCU blockbuster Spider-Man: No Way Home, as it teases significant details while keeping certain elements shrouded in mystery, fueling anticipation and curiosity among the audience.

Deadpool & Wolverine Crafting Significant Anticipation With its New Trailer

The multiversal adventure of Deadpool & Wolverine is rumored to feature a range of characters, including from the original X-Men franchise and various MCU figures. While the film’s trailer has offered intriguing glimpses into the story, there’s much more to keep fans eagerly anticipating.

The approach to the film’s marketing is akin to that of the 2021 film Spider-Man: No Way Home, which successfully kept major surprises like the return of Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield’s Spider-Man, as well as a cameo from Daredevil’s Charlie Cox, under wraps until release.

It also contributed to the film’s immense $1.9 billion box office collection, making it one of the most successful films in the franchise. Anticipation is building for the Deadpool threequel, which is expected to include various cameos, hinted through the TVA and inter-dimensional portals in the new trailer.

Fans appreciate the studio’s decision to maintain the approach, expressing excitement for the surprises in store. One fan said reacting to the trailer, “I’m so glad they’re taking the No Way Home approach with the marketing. I want all the secrets to be kept until the final release!”

In contrast, the 2023 Marvel film The Marvels faced criticism for revealing major cameos, such as Tessa Thompson’s Valkyrie and an X-Men appearance, in trailers and marketing campaigns.

Considering Deadpool threequel has not followed in on that pursuit so far, it only further adds the hope that the upcoming film, directed by Shawn Levy, could serve as the much-needed catalyst to revitalize the MCU.

Shawn Levy Teases a New Direction For Deadpool & Wolverine

Shawn Levy, who helmed the upcoming installment in the Deadpool film series has shared that he feels privileged to work with two major movie stars in such an iconic project. Talking to Screen Rant during CinemaCon, he shared,

“It also gave me an opportunity. It’s the third Deadpool movie, but it’s not Deadpool 3. It’s a different thing that’s very much Deadpool and Wolverine. And it’s not trying to copycat anything from the first two movies. They were awesome, but this is a two-hander character adventure.”

He emphasized the priority of creating an enjoyable experience for fans, promising that it would be both “gnarly” and “funny” as he shared that the early screenings of the film have been “extremely promising.”

Levy also suggested that while there may not be any major plot surprises, there’s a keen awareness of when to intensify the pace and when to slow down for meaningful character moments, aiming to create a more layered and impactful viewing experience.

But what also is a fact is that not always the buzz translates into box office numbers and that does turn out to be a shocking twist in the tale. One movie that has managed to be an achiever, or an overachiever if we look at it closely, is Deadpool & Wolverine. All of us knew that it was going to be a cinema event when the movie hit the big screen because it was the mutants entering the MCU, Ryan Reynolds making his MCU debut with Hugh Jackman, and the latter reprising Logan after wrapping up his run in 2017. So we were all indeed expecting a very crazy run at the Box office. But none of us expected the rage the film has become.

Deadpool & Wolverine which was released on the big screen on July 26, 2024 worldwide has turned out to be a box office monster (of the good kind) as it is achieving massive milestones throughout its way. The movie that is fueled by exciting cameos has turned out to be a massive success as it managed to break even and turn into a profit venture in the first weekend itself. The movie is the first Marvel Cinematic Universe to have achieved this kind of success after Spider-Man: No Way Home and is even about to surpass its collection.

In its two weekends at the global box office, Deadpool & Wolverine has managed to break record after record. This week it is said to touch $820 Million as per estimation and there is going to be a task to keep track of all of it. This is where we come in because why not compile them together? Below is a list of all the major records the film has broken so far. The last one is expected to be broken and if it happens, it will be a massive milestone for the movie.

Major Box Office Records Broken By Deadpool & Wolverine

Sixth Biggest Domestic Opening

Deadpool And Wolverine Still

Deadpool & Wolverine was consistent at breaking records with its very opening itself. The Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman starrer that opened with a collection of $211.4 Million managed to grab the sixth position in the list of all-time openers domestically. The movie sits right above Jurassic World and below Star Wars: The Last Jedi. The top spots on this list are dominated by Avengers: Endgame and Spider-Man: No Way Home.

Biggest R-Rated Opening Globally

The fact that Deadpool & Wolverine introduced R-rating to the MCU movies is epic because the success means the studio will now invest more in this. The movie is now the biggest opener in the R-rated category where the first three positions are acquired by it and its two predecessors. Deadpool is in the second position and Deadpool 2 on third. Joker holds the fifth position and Logan is on eighth.

Defeats Logan

Well, we love this defeat actually because is it even a defeat. But the wordplay. Logan had earned $619 Million at the global box office in its lifetime. And as you might have already observed, Deadpool & Wolverine has already surpassed its lifetime in the span of days. It is crazy because Logan almost marked the end of the Fox franchise and Deadpool & Wolverine marks the opening of a new avenue.

Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman & Shawn Levy Win

While the movie has done wonders for the makers and the franchise in total, it has also turned out to be a massive success for Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman, and director Shawn Levy. As per data Deadpool & Wolverine has become the top opening film of the career for all three.

Gearing To Leave Joker Behind

Now this is a tall order and still a bit far, but the fact that we are at over $800 million already makes this look possible. As per reports in Forbes, Deadpool & Wolverine is estimated to earn $1.08 Billion in the lifetime collection. This means it will manage to beat Joaquin Phoenix’s 2019 DC Elseworlds release Joker which right now stands on a collection of $1.0789 billion. This will be a big milestone for the movie and MCU as a whole.

The film's success does not just end there; with this new achievement, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has officially crossed $30 billion in total global box office earnings.

Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige expressed his satisfaction with the release, stating, ""Nothing strengthens the Marvel Cinematic Universe or perhaps any cinematic universe like a great movie. A great movie is the answer to many cinematic universe issues, and Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman and our director, Shawn Levy, have made a great movie."" This sentiment captures the essence of the film's importance not only as a standalone feature but also as a pivotal component within the larger scope of the MCU.

The performances have been lauded by critics and audiences alike. Early reviews and viewer feedback indicate that this installment is set to have an enduring impact, supported by an impressive A CinemaScore and a robust 97% audience approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the third-highest for any MCU film.

As plans for the future of the MCU unfold, one undeniable takeaway is that the appetite for R-rated superhero films is growing. With Deadpool & Wolverine breaking records in both the domestic and global spheres, there is a tangible anticipation for more films featuring these darker, more adult interpretations of the comic book world. Speculation is already swirling about the potential for a resurgence of beloved characters and storylines that fans have been clamoring for.

This opening weekend was further punctuated by the recent Comic-Con event held by Marvel, where surprises abounded, including the shocking return of Robert Downey Jr. to the MCU as Doctor Doom in upcoming projects like Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars. The buzz surrounding these developments only heightens the excitement for what lies ahead for audiences, especially as the prospect of Deadpool and Wolverine appearing in these epic showdowns becomes a tantalizing probability.

Deadpool & Wolverine is more than just a box office sensation; it stands as a testament to the evolving landscape of superhero films. The genre is expanding in ways that celebrate its darker roots while also maintaining the humor and style that fans expect. As cinematographic standards evolve and audiences demand more engaging narratives, films like Deadpool & Wolverine will likely chart the course for future releases that push the boundaries of storytelling within the superhero domain.

In addition to box office success, Deadpool & Wolverine has drawn attention for incorporating various celebrity cameos, adding layers of intrigue for viewers. Notably, a cameo by Tom Holland's brother has already sparked interest and speculation, showcasing the interconnectedness of the larger Marvel universe. Ryan Reynolds has even hinted at other unexpected musical elements in the film, indicating that the creative decisions behind the scenes are as entertaining as the film itself.

As the film continues to perform well at the box office, the industry is buzzing with potential for follow-ups and sequels. Major cinema chains like AMC Theatres, Cinemark, and IMAX are basking in the afterglow of this opening weekend's success. AMC Theatres CEO Adam Aron noted, ""It is certainly good news for those who care about AMC that with Deadpool & Wolverine we enjoyed the highest ever attendance and admissions revenue for the opening weekend of a rated-R movie in AMC’s company history."" Cinemark's President and CEO Sean Gamble echoed this sentiment, stating, ""We are thrilled to share that Deadpool & Wolverine drove Cinemark’s biggest summer opening weekend of all time, generated record-breaking results in premium formats and delivered our highest weekend of concession revenues since the pandemic.""

The film's performance has not just revitalized ticket sales for chains but is also paving the way for upcoming releases, solidifying why audiences find themselves back in theaters.

The cultural impact of Deadpool & Wolverine stretches beyond its box office numbers, signaling a shift in how adult themes can coalesce with blockbuster cinema. The engaging storytelling and humor have ignited discussions among fans and critics alike about the direction that comic-based films are headed in, hinting at a future rich with diverse narratives and complex character arcs.

Ultimately, Deadpool & Wolverine represents a significant moment in cinematic history, recalling a period where storytelling, audience engagement, and financial success can harmonize beautifully. As Marvel continues to ramp up new content, this film's success serves as a guidepost, indicating that quality storytelling and character development remain just as vital as high-stakes action and visual effects.

For now, audiences can continue to enjoy Deadpool & Wolverine in theaters, marveling at the creativity and ingenuity that brought this anticipated release to life. As discussions of sequels and evolving narratives unfold, fans are energized and eager to see what the future holds for the beloved characters, leaving open the tantalizing possibility of more thrilling stories in the pipeline."
Shawn Levy on cameos and box-office success. 'Deadpool & Wolverine'.,https://bgr.com/tech/deadpool-3-leak-reveals-a-crazy-cameo-we-never-expected-from-foxs-marvel-movies/,"With each day that gets us closer to the Deadpool 3 release, we hear more rumors about amazing cameos that Ryan Reyolds & Co. have prepared for this massive MCU crossover. Most of these cameos come from Fox’s Marvel movies, which is the universe that was home to Deadpool until Disney acquired Fox.

As a result, Deadpool 3 has to be a multiverse story that will ultimately lead to Wade Wilson becoming stuck in the main Earth-616 reality of the MCU. That’s because Disney said it’ll keep the Deadpool character in place as it transitions to the MCU.

Even without exciting cameo rumors, we expect plenty of characters from the Fox universe to appear in Deadpool 3.

Deadpool 3’s multiverse story

Fox cameos in Deadpool 3 are a no-brainer. Especially considering that Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is back for this movie, and Logan will be a protagonist. Marvel knows better than not to waste an opportunity like this, although Deadpool 3 will hopefully feel more like Spider-Man: No Way Home rather than Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.

No Way Home delivered amazing cameos from the Sony universe, and that’s why that movie made nearly $2 billion at the box office. Multiverse of Madness failed to replicate that success. But the nature of the Doctor Strange 2 cameos differed significantly from No Way Home.

The superheroes we saw in the Doctor Strange sequel were on the screen for a short period of time due to the nature of the movie. Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) was hopping through the multiverse in the film. Meanwhile, the multiverse came to the MCU in No Way Home.

Deadpool 3 will probably be a timeline-hopping adventure, although I’d expect the movie to stick to a particular reality. I didn’t mention Doctor Strange 2 by accident. I expect Marvel to make use of that Earth-838 universe by exploring it in Deadpool 3.

Let’s not forget that universe has mutants, Avengers, Fantastic Four, and Illuminati. And a Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) who isn’t evil. Finally, there’s also an Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) in mint condition in this universe, one whose Ultron project was successful.

These heroes sustained heavy losses in Multiverse of Madness. So they also have a grudge against Earth-616.

Jennifer Garner’s Elektra is back

With all that in mind, I’ll remind you of a recent rumor that said Ben Affleck’s Daredevil will cameo in Deadpool 3. The rumor felt familiar, considering that some Doctor Strange 2 leaks said that Matt Murdock would appear in the movie.

It turns out we might see another exciting character from Affleck’s Fox Marvel adventure. That’s Jennifer Garner’s Elektra, who first appeared in the 2003 Daredevil movie. She then went on to star in Elektra a couple of years later.

It’s been some 20 years since these movies, and I haven’t given them any thought since. I hardly remember Elektra, which wasn’t a commercial success. Affleck’s Daredevil is more memorable and was better received at the time. Still, Fox never bothered continuing these stories, which ultimately gave Marvel a chance to develop the amazing Daredevil Netflix TV show starring Charlie Cox.

That said, Garner’s Elektra was a highlight of those movies.

No because she already filmed her role two weeks ago. https://t.co/8xVZqmotw2 — MyTimeToShineHello (@MyTimeToShineH) July 7, 2023

Having both Affleck’s Daredevil and Garner’s Elektra in Deadpool 3 would be extremely exciting, regardless of the success of those previous movies. It would allow Marvel to give the characters closure while acknowledging the old films.

Marvel is yet to confirm anything, but multiple sources have told The Hollywood Reporter that the actress would reprise her superhero role. Interestingly, Garner worked with Deadpool 3 director Shawn Levy and Ryan Reynolds on Netflix’s The Adam Project.

Insider MyTimeToShineHello claims the actress had already shot her Deadpool 3 scenes. Other mysterious cameos already shot theirs, she continued.

Deadpool 3 will premiere on May 2nd next year, which gives us nearly a year to figure out more details about the cameos and the plot."

Reynolds is set to star Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick are penning the script. Wendy Molyneux and Lizzie Molyneux-Logelin penned a previous draft.

Reynolds gave a fun confirmation of his new Levy trilogy on social media:

This marks the first Deadpool film where Marvel Studios will work hand and hand with Reynolds and Team Deadpool. Fans are sure to be excited at Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige’s involvement after seeing how he helped revamp the Spider-Man franchise after coming on to help in the creative effort for that franchise.

Levy and Reynolds have been on a hot streak in less then a year delivering not one but two big hits in 20th Century’s Free Guy and Netflix’s The Adam Project. Free Guy became one of the surprise hits of 2021, grossing more then $300 million at the global box-office with a sequel currently in development. The Adam Project bows this weekend and has already earned some of the best reviews of both A-listers career.

Shawn Levy on cameos and box-office success. 'Deadpool & Wolverine'.,https://www.elitedaily.com/entertainment/deadpool-3-release-date-cast-trailer-updates,"Large-scale mergers between companies are rarely something the average movie watcher cares about, but Disney’s acquisition of 20th Century Fox in 2019 was rare. The two entertainment behemoths had two major franchises split between them — Star Wars and Marvel — and the merger put Humpty Dumpty back together, as it were. But fans were also concerned this would end some of their favorite Fox Marvel characters. Thankfully, the confirmation of Ryan Reynold’s Deadpool 3 proves at least one 20th Century superhero has come through intact.

At the time of the merger, the conventional wisdom on Disney’s Marvel Cinematic Universe reacquiring The X-Men and Fantastic Four franchises from the Fox vaults was that president and CEO Kevin Feige would reboot both from the ground up. Though Marvel never said one way or the other, the one-two punch of Dark Phoenix and The New Mutants as box office bombs suggested the MCU would choose to go clean slate. And if so, that would include rebooting the one X-Men character who was a box office success: the R-rated, dirty-minded, filthy-mouthed Deadpool, played by Ryan Reynolds.

But Deadpool is Reynolds’ passion project. He spent a decade lobbying Fox to allow him to make the first film, and he took that same salesmanship to Feige. It only took two years, but in January 2021, Feige promised a new Deadpool film would be on its way and maintain its very unDisney risque R-rating.

Here’s what else to know about the upcoming Deadpool 3.

Deadpool 3 Filming Updates

The first sign that Disney was seriously looking into a Deadpool 3 sequel came just ahead of Feige’s confirmation it was happening when Deadline reported the Molyneux Sisters (the team behind the animated hit Bob’s Burgers) would take a run at the script. Since then, they’ve left the project, but at least it was a sign of something.

The following announcement didn’t come until March 2022, when Deadline revealed director Shawn Levy was in negotiations to helm the new film. The director already had one box-office success with Renolds with Free Guy, confirming that Deadpool aimed to put Reynolds with a proven team. But it wasn’t until September 2022 that fans began to get real details of where this was headed via Ryan Reynold’s Twitter.

Deadpool 3 Cast

Until Sept. 27, the only actor confirmed for a Deadpool sequel was Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson, aka Deadpool. The first two films in the 20th Century run had almost wholly different leading casts surrounding Reynolds. The only actors who appeared in multiple films were Morena Baccarin, who played Vanessa, Wade’s girlfriend/fiancée; Leslie Uggams played Deadpool’s elderly roommate Blind Al; and Karan Soni played taxi driver Dopinder. Also, X-Men characters Brianna Hildebrand as Negasonic Teenage Warhead and Stefan Kapičić as Colossus appeared in both Deadpool films but not in any other X-Men franchise iterations. It was unclear if the MCU planned to bring any of them back.

However, cameos from the other X-Men franchise iterations were a staple of the Deadpool films, teasing the standalone franchise’s status, including the actor who has been a throughline from the first 1999 X-Men to the franchise’s final films under the 20th Century banner, Hugh Jackman as Logan, aka Wolverine.

Jackman and Reynolds have a faux feud over Wolverine’s appearances in the Deadpool films. As the tweet above shows, Jackman will now reprise his character, officially making his Wolverine canon in the MCU.

Deadpool 3 Teasers & Trailers

Levy and Reynolds had already proved a winning combination with Netflix’s The Adam Project and for Disney with Free Guy, a rare box office success during the shutdown-depressed 2021 theater year. Free Guy was also the first time Reynolds managed to work his Deadpool character into an official MCU appearance, in a YouTube skit starring himself as the titular superhero alongside Taika Waititi’s Korg from the Thor and Avengers franchises. (Waititi had a role in Free Guy, so this was a natural crossover.)

Deadpool 3 Plot Predictions

It’s impossible at this stage to know what the new Deadpool film will be about, though, as Reynold’s tweet above suggests, it will be a tad more “stabby.” Fans can also probably count on the film to have plenty of innuendoes, bad-taste humor, over-the-top silly brutality, and at least one moment where Deadpool turns to the camera and shrugs.

Deadpool 3 Release Date

Marvel Studios

When Feige confirmed Deadpool 3 was happening back in January 2021, reports said filming would not begin until mid-2022 “at the earliest.” In September, post-D23, Marvel announced an official release date of Sept. 6, 2024. However, it wasn’t long before rearrangement began, and after Blade was delayed, Deadpool 3 fell to Nov. 8, 2024.

Deadpool and Deadpool 2 are streaming on Hulu, where most of Disney’s “more adult” titles are currently found."

'Deadpool & Wolverine'.,https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/stranger-things-producer-wants-ryan-reynolds-cameo-season-5.html/,"The cast of Stranger Things began as mostly unknown actors, but many of them have skyrocketed into stardom through their roles in the Netflix series. However, a blockbuster star has yet to appear on the show, despite the show’s enormous popularity. Stranger Things producer Shawn Levy says that he would want to see Ryan Reynolds cameo in season 5 of the Netflix series, which could make for a wild finale.

Stranger Things season 4 brings back a cast that includes notable names like Finn Wolfhard, Millie Bobby Brown, David Harbour, Joe Keery, and Winona Ryder. In the first season, Ryder was the most recognizable name. Now, it’s harder to tell as many of the cast members have gone on to star in major roles that have given them more notoriety.

Brown, Harbour, Keery, and Wolfhard have appeared in major movies since the series began like Ghostbusters: Afterlife, Godzilla Vs. Kong, Black Widow, Free Guy, and It. However, none of the cast yet has acquired the name recognition that would boost the box office for a film. Someone who does have that reputation is Reynolds who Levy would want to see in season 5.

Shawn Levy wants Ryan Reynolds to appear in ‘Stranger Things’ season 5

Levy and Reynolds have worked together many times in recent years. The two collaborated on Free Guy and the Netflix movie The Adam Project. They are about to work together on Deadpool 3. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Levy said that he would love to see Reynolds appear in season 5 and combine the director/producer’s two worlds together.

“I want to see a Ryan Reynolds cameo in anything,” Levy said. “The truth is, my career over the past half-decade has been defined by Stranger Things and my collaborations with Ryan, so it would be deeply trippy but satisfying to see my two worlds collide. So, Ryan Reynolds, get ready for season five.”

Levy and Reynolds have been successful with their recent projects and bringing that same success to Stranger Things could make season 5 even better. It could be odd seeing a huge star like Reynolds in the series, but he normally makes anything he’s in better.

Ryan Reynolds has brought a lot of success to Netflix

The Adam Project did well with audiences and critics and got a lot of views from Netflix subscribers. In addition, Reynolds starred alongside Dwayne Johnson and Gal Gadot for Red Notice, which was one of the most ambitious projects for the streaming service. It was a hit and a sequel for Red Notice will come to the service at some point.

Netflix would surely love to see Reynolds join season 5 of Stranger Things as fans would be curious to see what his role would be. This is still just a wish from Levy so nothing is confirmed yet, but it would not be the strangest thing in the world to see Reynolds pop up.

DC, confident in its new identity under James Gunn, promises a bold new direction, while Marvel aims to introduce a new era of storytelling. Both studios are united in their strategic choices, using these high-stakes films to segue into an exciting new chapter in their cinematic universes.

While Marvel has put its trust in Deadpool & Wolverine, DC plans to make a big splash with Joker: Folie à Deux. But with such strong players on board, the question remains as to who will take the crown in 2024.

Can Joker: Folie à Deux beat Deadpool & Wolverine on the marketing front?

ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad

While the ultimate question is which one from Deadpool & Wolverine and Joker: Folie à Deux will emerge as the winner, the initial battle undoubtedly takes place on the marketing front. The past year serves as a testimonial to just how much of an impact marketing has on the box office success of a movie. And while Joker: Folie à Deux is nowhere to be seen on this front as of now, Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman, and Shawn Levy are quite literally painting the town red and yellow.

Even before the confirmation announcement of Hugh Jackman making a comeback, Reynolds and Jackman's love-hate relationship already had audiences in a chokehold. As the movie delved deeper into production, the duo reveled in the magic of their mutant-claw relationship. Moreover, the Deadpool & Wolverine team is currently on the road, capturing the attention of everyone from South Korea to India as they give fans a taste of their own multiverse through dynamic interviews. In stark contrast, Joker: Folie à Deux is giving its fans the silent treatment.

The marketing battle, though pivotal, does not determine the ultimate victor. After all, can it truly be considered a clash of superhero titans without the buzz of colossal celebrity cameos enhancing the spectacle?

Deadpool, Wolverine, Joker, and an army of anonymous celebrties

A recurrent theme throughout superhero movies seems to be its indulgence in celebrity cameos. Things do not strike that one chord unless it is not your favorite actor donning his comic-accurate suit. And Marvel's first R-rated movie seems to have made a note of this as the buzz surrounding who, from Taylor Swift and Blake Lively to Brad Pitt, is going to be in the movie, roars at an all-time high. On the other hand, Joker: Folie à Deux seemed to have taken notice of only one-half of the 'celebrity cameo' success rule.

While Deadpool & Wolverine has made fans question the involvement of almost every celebrity under the sun in the movie, Joker: Folie à Deux seems to be overly confident of Lady Gaga's involvement in it. Although a tad bit risky, there is no reason for the latter to not revel in the pop star's presence, as even a single picture of her in Harley Quinn avatar has left a drastic impact on the Internet.

Between Joker and Deadpool's return to the big screens, their past imprints loom larger than the current marketing strategies and celebrity cameos. Not only will the box office results declare which of these two movies will take the crown in 2024, but they will also decide which franchise has had a greater impact through the decades.

Deadpool vs Joker: A battle of franchises

The winner of the 2024 superhero cinematic battle will not only decide the fate of the two studio giants but also prove which franchise among Deadpool and Joker has had a greater impact on the audience. From this side of the stadium, the battle between Deadpool & Wolverine and Joker: Folie à Deux, seems especially tricky as both the characters have made appearances on various screens since several decades ago. However, Deadpool came out in 2016 and Joker came out in 2019.

The disparity between release dates is not the only one as the first Joker movie made a $300 Million splash at the box office, many feet ahead of Deadpool 2. While preceding box office collections do not guarantee that the succeeding ones will follow the path as cinema is no tradition, in the case of Deadpool & Wolverine vs Joker: Folie à Deux, it does prove that it is going to be no easy battle.

In just one week of release, the feature film has already grossed over $496 million at the international box office.

Wade Wilson tries to convince Logan to help him save his friends and his world. But Logan, totally bitter and disillusioned, decides to insult poor Wade (who lied to him) with all the names that come to mind. He wants to emphasize how idiotic and pathetic Deadpool is. A short, intense monologue in which Wolverine unleashes all his rage, all his sadness, all his regrets on a Deadpool who even loses his tongue. For the one and only time in the film, Deadpool is left speechless, losing his legendary repartee to the detriment of his uninhibited violence. The sequence ends with a very muscular confrontation between the two men inside a car. We put the sequence in question below:

“It’s unfortunate it played out this way. Not only was it a web of lies that put me in physical danger, it was a matter of the heart. Love is blind, that’s for sure.”

Cyrus filed for divorce in May, citing irreconcilable differences and inappropriate marital conduct as the reason for the split. He also sought an annulment on the grounds of fraud.

In June, the country singer accused Firerose of charging $96,000 on his credit card and requested a temporary restraining order against her to prevent her from using his cards.

Firerose argued in her own court filing that she has had access to several of Cyrus’ credit cards since they moved in together in 2022. She also claimed that she never had to abide by any limit and should be able to use their martial money to support her new lifestyle.

In a counter-complaint, Firerose then accused her ex of “unpredictable and volatile” behavior that equated to “extreme verbal, emotional, and psychological abuse.”

She claimed Cyrus’ behavior was influenced by his “persistent drug use accompanied with the consumption of marijuana.”

Cyrus denied the allegations and stated that Firerose was actually the one who was abusive and threatened to ruin his career if he divorced her.

Firesrose also claimed Cyrus “ambushed” her with divorce papers one day before she was scheduled to undergo a double mastectomy.

Cyrus was previously wed to Cindy Smith from 1986 to 1991. After their split, he and Tish Cyrus were married from 1993 to 2022.

Tish, 57, and Billy share three children together: Miley, 31, Braison, 30, and Noah, 24. The “She’s Not Cryin’ Anymore” singer also adopted Tish’s two children, Brandi, 37, and Trace, 35, from her previous marriage."

Billy Ray Cyrus and his achy breaky heart are closing a chapter.

The singer finalized his divorce from ex Firerose two months after their breakup, according to court documents obtained by E! News Aug. 5.

Firerose, 36, will not receive any alimony or spousal support in the divorce settlement. However, she will receive all rights, credits and royalties for 17 songs that the couple—who married in October 2023—wrote and published together.

They are each responsible for their own attorneys fees and will retain their premarital property. Billy Ray was awarded all horses and livestock on his property and will keep five vehicles (including a 2024 Nissan Murano and 1993 Harley Davidson), while Firerose will keep her 2020 Mercedes Benz.

Billy Ray—who shares children Brandi Cyrus, 37, Trace Cyrus, 35, Miley Cyrus, 31, Braison Cyrus, 30, and Noah Cyrus, 24, with ex Tish Cyrus, as well as son Christopher Cody Cyrus, 32, with ex Kristin Luckey—spoke out following the heated divorce proceedings, in which the 62-year-old accused his then-wife of lying about her identity."

“This past Friday the parties reached a settlement agreement at mediation to dissolve their 7-month marriage, and the Court declared the parties divorced this morning. Mr. Cyrus is relieved to put this nightmare behind him. Further, a couple of weeks ago, prior to mediation, Ms. Hodges legally changed her last name from ‘Hodges’ to ‘Cyrus,’” Rose Palermo and Jason Talley of Cheatham Palermo & Garrett told In Touch. “Mr. Cyrus feels that this validates his assertion that his ex-wife’s sole impetus for marrying him was to obtain his last name.”

Palermo and Talley also shared a statement on behalf of Billy, 62.

“I’m just very relieved… and giving thanks today to breathe a sigh of relief. This has been absolutely the most crazy insane scam I have ever heard of. Let alone the fact I’m right in the center and basically the target of the scheme,” the statement reads. “It’s unfortunate … it played out this way … not only was it a web of lies that put me in physical danger ….

Billy and Firerose, 35, first met on the set of Hannah Montana in 2010 but their romantic relationship didn’t start until they reconnected in 2022. In Touch reported that Billy filed for divorce on May 23 after only seven months of marriage – and their split was anything but amicable.

In the filing, the “Achy Breaky Heart” singer cited irreconcilable differences and “inappropriate marital conduct.”

From there, the accusations came swinging from both parties after Firerose accused her now ex-husband of physical abuse in a June 14 filing.

Later that month, In Touch exclusively revealed that Billy accused Firerose of being the abuser – which she later denied.

“Not only verbally and emotionally by [Firerose], but also PHYSICALLY abused by [Firerose],” the filing read.

Billy’s lawyer Scott Adkins added, “If [Billy Ray] was indeed as abusive as [Firerose] claims, it is mindboggling to try and explain why, upon vacating [Billy Ray’s] premarital residence, [Firerose] would leave [Billy Ray] a handwritten note and then send him a text message stating in her word, ‘I am sorry’ and ‘please give me a chance to make this right. I can explain everything but i need you on my side.’”

Things got worse from there after a Tennessee judge banned Firerose from using Billy’s credit card. The July ruling came after the “Butterfly Fly Away” singer accused Firerose of racking up a $96,986.05 bill between May 23 and June 7 on his American Express card.

On July 24, In Touch obtained audio of Firerose and Billy, who chastised her actions with explicit language.

“You have once again shown me you will not listen. I don’t know who the f–k you think you are, but you will not f–king listen,” Billy said during part of the recording. “This is ain’t about … your surgery … this ain’t about nothing. This is about your being a selfish bitch.”

Billy broke his silence shortly after the audio went viral and defended his actions in a statement via Instagram Stories.

“Hell yeah I was at my wit’s end. As every day went by, I started realizing something was wrong. And that’s before I knew she was a fraud. I just knew something wasn’t right. That was before I knew she was David Hodges’ ex-wife,” he claimed. “That’s before I knew her parents last name. I had no idea she was arrested for felony residential burglary. I saw before my very own eyes, everything I thought I knew about her, was a lie. She was trying to take over my career, my life and usurp the Cyrus name for her own gain. See you in court.”"

Billy Ray Cyrus took to Instagram to share a statement that confirms that he and Australia-born singer/songwriter, FIREROSE, have officially been declared divorced by the Courts. According to the new statement, the “Achy Breaky Heart” singer is “relieved to put this nightmare behind him.”

The former couple is said to have reached a settlement agreement at mediation on Friday, August 2, nearly three months after Cyrus filed to dissolve their seven-month marriage due to “irreconcilable differences and inappropriate marital conduct.”

When news first broke of the pair’s split, Cyrus was reportedly seeking an annulment from the court, claiming the marriage was “obtained by fraud.” Shortly after, the situation escalated to a point where Cyrus deemed it necessary to seek a temporary restraining order from his now ex-wife, whose real name is Johanna Rose Hodges. This action prevented her from any “unauthorized” use of his credit cards, including personal and business, per documents obtained by PEOPLE, on Thursday, June 13 in a Tennessee court.

The Kentucky native accused FIREROSE of spending over $96,000 in charges on his business account, which reportedly includes $70,665 to her attorneys. These charges to Cyrus’ credit cards reportedly began the day he filed for divorce. She responded to the motion through her attorneys in a statement that was obtained by People and reads, “To claim Wife has made 37 unauthorized charges is untrue. Throughout the divorce proceedings, the parties are to live as per the status quo during the marriage. Wife was simply living as she has since October 10, 2023, and Husband has no right to cut her off.”

Firerose also claimed that she had access to Cyrus’ American Express credit card since June of 2022, which is well before they tied the knot.

According to Cyrus, he and FIREROSE have remained separate in their financial responsibilities, with no joint accounts or credit cards. They also do not own any real estate together. FIREROSE, on the other hand, allegedly owns property in Los Angeles that is valued at over “seven figures” and has more than half a million dollars in liquid assets.

The pair have continued to go back and forth in a public battle over these past few months while waiting for their divorce to be finalized. The songstress accused her former husband of being abusive and reportedly told Page Six in an interview that he had “very strict rules” for her to follow in their relationship. Cyrus denied the claims, but noted that his partner was a cheater, verbally abusive and that she was using him for a “scam.” Firerose also denied his accusations.

The most recent statement from the singer’s divorce lawyers, Rose Palermo and Jason Talley of Cheatham Palermo & Garrett, reveals that FIREROSE legally changed her last name from “Hudges” to “Cyrus” just a couple weeks before mediation took place. This further validated Cyrus’ belief that his ex-wife’s sole reason for marrying him “was to obtain his last name.”

Cyrus went on to say a few words of his own in support of this claim.

“I’m just very relieved…and giving thanks today to breathe a sigh of relief/ this has been absolutely the most crazy insane scam I have ever heard of. Let alone the fact I’m right in the center and basically the target of the scheme. It’s unfortunate…it played out this way…not only was it a web of lies that put me in physical danger…it was a matter of the heart. Love is blind…that’s for sure.”

The latest update regarding their marital status comes less than a year after the couple said “I do” in October of 2023."

And after an increasingly bitter and public break up, during which each accused the other of verbal and emotional abuse, court documents signed Monday and obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com show that Firerose walked away with $0.

But according to a source, that's fine by her. 'She settled for nothing just to be done with him and get away from the situation,' the insider told DailyMail.com exclusively.

For the most part the divorce agreement sees each party walk away from the brief marriage with what they brought to it in the first place.

Billy Ray and Firerose Cyrus's divorce has been finalized three months after the country star, 62, filed for separation

Court documents filed on Monday and obtained by DailyMail.com reveal Firerose – who married the singer in October – walked away with $0 in the divorce

However, the terms of the divorce agreement show that Billy Ray has agreed to hand over any claims he has to credits or royalties on songs that the couple wrote or published together before and during their union.

Billy Ray's May 22, 2024 divorce filing came just days before Firerose 37, was due to have a double mastectomy following her diagnosis with the BRCA gene meaning she is more likely to contract certain cancers.

During the increasingly contentious divorce Billy Ray appeared to cast doubt on the truth of this claim by subpoenaing her medical records.

She has since rescheduled her surgery.

Speaking Monday a source said, 'If this went to trial, Firerose and her team would have provided a significant amount of evidence to prove he fabricated a narrative that would benefit his public image.

‘There is no doubt she would have been awarded the divorce, but it was much more important to her that this continuous smear campaign end, and the emotional turmoil stop so she can close the door on this chapter and recover from her surgery peacefully.'

Billy Ray saw things differently, claiming Firerose had only married him to get the last name Cyrus. He said she changed her name from Hodges – her first husband's last name – just a couple of weeks ago.

'I'm just very relieved,' Billy Ray said in a statement to DailyMail.com.

This has been absolutely the most crazy insane scam I have ever heard of,' he added. 'Let alone the fact I’m right in the center and basically the target of the scheme.

'It’s unfortunate it played out this way,' he said. 'Not only was it a web of lies that put me in physical danger, it was a matter of the heart.

'Love is blind – that’s for sure.'

Last month DailyMail.com exclusively revealed shocking audio in which Billy Ray could be heard belittling and mocking the Australian singer whom he married in October 2023.

In an expletive-laden rant that made for often difficult listening the toxicity of the pair's relationship was writ large.

During the confrontation, which appeared to have been sparked by the 62-year-old singer's fury at being made late to go on stage for a show, he warned Firerose: 'If you had just left it the f**k alone, now I'm really f**king p***ed, once again showing you will not listen.

'I don't know who the f**k you think you are, but you will not listen…this ain't about nothing this is about you being a selfish f**king b***h.'

Warming to his them, Billy Ray sneers, 'I don't think you're real smart, I've changed my mind on that s**t. What I think you are is a selfish f**king b***h. That's what you are.'

The terms of the divorce agreement show that Billy Ray agreed to hand over any claims he has to credits or royalties on songs that the couple wrote or published together before and during their marriage

Firerose claims Billy Ray kicked her out of the martial home on May 23, 2024, immediately after he filed for divorce

As she begged him to 'please stop shouting' he tells her, 'This would not be happening if you had just shut your f**king mouth. Look at what a f**king mess you've made.

'What a dumb ass [you are] …'cos you have to know I will not tolerate that s**t. You just f**ked up…f**k you. You know better than that. F**king idiot.'

Further evidence obtained by DailyMail.com showed that the Achy Breaky Heart singer's vitriol wasn't limited to his much younger wife but extended to several significant women in his life.

They include superstar daughter, Miley, whom Billy Ray refers to only as 'devil.'

In other audio heard by DailyMail.com Billy Ray bizarrely speaks of himself in the third person before turning his attention to his daughter, Miley, and uttering the shocking statement, 'Everyone knows devil's a skank.'

He then rounded on Miley's mother, Tish, his wife of 30 years and mother of three of his biological children – Miley, 31, Braison, 30, and Noah, 24 – whom he never refers to by name but instead calls 's**t.'

Billy Ray has a son from a previous relationship and adopted Tish's two older children, Brandi, 37, and Trace, 35, when they married.

In one shocking text exchange with his manager and publicist Scott Adkins, viewed by DailyMail.com, Billy Ray says of Tish,' She is a liar…a w***e…and a cheat. Complete skank. Scum of the earth. A fraud.'

The bitter split comes after a shocking audio recording emerged of Billy Ray mocking and belittling his now ex-wife Firerose, 37, and disparaging his own daughter Miley

He later owned up to unleashing the expletive-filled rant caught on audio in an Instagram post saying: 'I was at my wit's end'

Comparing her to Lindsay Lohan's mother, Dina, 61, he texted, she 'Makes Deanna [sic] Lohan look like Mother Theresa.'

Posting on Instagram one day after his rant and texts were exposed, Billy Ray made no attempt to deny the truth of it all.

Instead, he doubled down on his words saying: 'Hell yeah, I was at my wit's end. As every day went by, I started realizing something was wrong. And that's before I knew she [Firerose] was a fraud.'

He went on to make a series of claims about his then-wife.

'I just knew something wasn't right. That was before I knew she was David Hodges ex-wife. That's before I knew her parent's last name. I had no idea she was arrested for felony residential burglary.

'I saw before my very own eyes, everything I thought I knew about her, was a lie. She was trying to take over my career, my life and usurp the Cyrus name for own gain.'

In one shocking text exchange with his manager and publicist Scott Adkins, Billy Ray says of Tish: 'She is a liar…a w***e…and a cheat. Complete Skank. Scum of the earth. A fraud'

Billy Ray also has a tumultuous relationship with Tish Cyrus (far left), his ex-wife of more than 30 years and the mother of three of his biological children – Miley, 31, (far right) Braison, 30, (second from left) and Noah, 24 (third from left). He is also the adoptive father of her two children, including Brandi, 37, (second from right)

Billy Ray's marriage to Firerose which came just four months after Tish filed for divorce is believed to have strained his relationship with Miley.

The former child star, who grew up on the Disney Channel alongside her father, famously snubbed Billy Ray in her Grammy Awards acceptance speech in February.

Billy Ray was still married to Tish when he first met Firerose in 2010. The Sydney-born musician was just 22 and Billy Ray was 48.

The two became friends but nothing happened romantically until Billy Ray reached out to Firerose a decade later and asked her to duet with him on a version of Tanya Tucker's 'Delta Dawn.'

He was still married to Tish at the time but told Firerose they were 'soulmates' and promised her a romance for the ages.

Instead, just seven months after their October 2023 marriage, with those words ringing hollow in her ears, Billy Ray filed for divorce in an acrimonious split finalized with the swivel of a judge's ball point pen today."
‘John Wick 4’ Sequel Series From Keanu Reeves & Chad Staples.,https://deadline.com/2024/08/john-wick-4-sequel-tv-series-under-the-high-table-1236030670/,"

EXCLUSIVE: Lionsgate is further expanding its John Wick universe with John Wick: Under The High Table, an action series executive produced by the billion-dollar film franchise’s star, Keanu Reeves, and director, Chad Stahelski, Deadline has learned. Stahelski is also is set to direct the pilot episode.

Written by The Old Man co-creator Robert Levine, the story in John Wick: The High Table picks up directly after the end of John Wick: Chapter 4. John Wick has left the world of the High Table in a tenuous position and a collection of new characters will look to make a name for themselves while some of the franchise stalwart characters remain committed to the old-world order.

The description of John Wick: The High Table, which promises to “combine new and old and thrust the Wick universe into a new age,” indicates a mix of newly created and existing characters, an approach Lionsgate previously used in the John Wick prequel limited series The Continental: From the World of John Wick, one of Peacock’s biggest original launches of 2023.

Stahelski, who in January signed a deal with Lionsgate to oversee creative on the John Wick franchise across film and TV and other media, is executive producing John Wick: The High Table through his company 87Eleven Entertainment. Levine, who serves as showrunner, also executive produces alongside Reeves as well as Thunder Road’s Erica Lee and Basil Iwanyk who are producers on the movies.

Currently, Reeves is attached as an executive producer with no acting component. He is said to be very hands-on with the project, which is being shopped in what is shaping up to become a competitive situation.

In John Wick 4, John and fellow assassin Caine (Donnie Yen) earn their freedom from the High Table and Winston (Ian McShane) gets reinstatement of Hotel Manager of the rebuilt New York Continental after John (Reeves) kills High Table’s the Marquis (Bill Skarsgård) but is left gravely injured. The ending is left ambiguous, with John presumed — but not confirmed — dead, with a post-credits scene teasing a confrontation between Caine and Akira (Rina Sawayama). She attacks him with a knife after Caine earlier in the movie killed her father, Shimazu Koji (Hiroyuki Sanada) while sparing her.

The additional scene could be a teaser for a John Wick spinoff movie about Yen’s Caine assassin character, which is in the works at Lionsgate. The studio also has upcoming spinoff film Ballerina starring Ana de Armas, which takes place between the third and fourth John Wick movie.

There is a fifth John Wick film in development too, and John Wick: The High Table will not interfere with plans for a potential new feature installment, sources said. Lionsgate declined comment.

Levine is co-creator/executive producer of FX’s The Old Man and also co-created and executive produced Starz’s pirate drama Black Sails. He is repped by WME and TFC Management. Stahelski is represented by WME and attorney Tara Kole."

The movie led to three sequels: John Wick Chapter Two in 2017, John Wick: Chapter John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum in 2019, and John Wick Chapter 4 in 2023. We thought that would be the last of it, but now a follow-up series is in the works, picking up where Chapter 4 left off. It looks like we’ve all quietly yet collectively decided not to talk about… that other show.

Deadline reports that a new series titled John Wick: Under The High Table is currently in the works from writer Robert Levine and Chad Stahelski, who is set to direct the pilot episode. While Reeves won’t be starring in the sequel series, he will be involved, to some extent.

Reeves is on board to executive produce the series, and Deadline reports that he is “very hands-on with the project.” It would be better if he were fists-on, but we can’t have everything. The series, which does not have a streamer or network atatched yet, aims to “combine new and old and thrust the Wick universe into a new age,” as the assassins deal with the aftermath of John Wick abandoning his assassin ways… again. Though it did seem pretty permanent this time.

This new project is separate from the upcoming prequel movie, Ballerina, and the previously announced John Wick 5, which is currently being developed by Stahelski. Maybe Reeves will pop back in for that one because he loves a reunion!

The John Wick universe is set to expand.

Lionsgate is developing a new John Wick series with star Keanu Reeves and director Chad Stahelski producing and Stahelski directing the pilot episode. John Wick: Under the High Table‘s script comes from The Old Man co-creator Robert Levine and will pick up where John Wick: Chapter 4 left off.

Deadline scoops that Under the High Table will explore the assort assassins, fixers, and shady underworld characters in the aftermath of Chapter 4‘s heroic sendoff for Wick himself, with new up-and-comers looking to become the next Wick, while longtime franchise characters try to keep order and the old rules intact.

It’s a similar template to how Lionsgate handled the Peacock limited series The Continent: From the World of John Wick, which mixed existing characters within the Wickiverse with newcomers.

Reeves is attached as a producer without any acting component. Under the High Table will be shopped to potential buyers, and the interest will likely be very, very high.

The big unresolved question from John Wick: Chapter 4 is whether Wick died at the end. It wasn’t entirely clear, although he was gravely injured during his standoff with fellow assassin Caine (Donnie Yen). The post-credits scene left Wick’s fate uncertain and instead pivoted to a fight between Caine and Akira (Rina Sawayama), whose father Caine killed earlier in the film. Yen’s character is set to get his own spinoff film, which will join Ana de Armas’s upcoming Wick spinoff Ballerina, set between the third and fourth installment in the Wick franchise. A fifth Wick film is in development, too.

A follow-up TV series executive-produced by franchise front man Keanu Reeves will aim to answer that.

John Wick: Under The High Table is in development at Lionsgate, TVLine has confirmed, with Reeves executive-producing alongside franchise director Chad Stalheski (who would helm the pilot episode), Basil Iwanyk and Erica Lee.

Penned by The Old Man co-creator Robert Levine, the prospective “high-octane action series” (which is currently being shopped) picks up directly after the “stunning end” of the March 2023 Chapter 4 installment. John Wick has left the world of the High Table in a tenuous position, and a collection of new characters will look to make a name for themselves while some of the franchise stalwart characters remain committed to the old-world order.

Though John Wick: Under The High Table promises to “combine new and old and thrust the Wick universe into a new age,” and Reeves reportedly is very hands-on with the project, the film vet has no plans to reprise his action hero role on-screen.

Deadline first reported on the series’ development.

Other John Wick: Chapter 4 follow-ups already in the works include The Ballerina, due out June 6, 2025, and in which Ana de Armas (Knives Out) plays an assassin trained in the traditions of the Ruska Roma, and an untitled film that continues the story of Caine, the highly skilled, blind assassin played by Donnie Yen in Chapter 4.

On the TV side, last fall gave us The Continental: From the World of John Wick, Peacock’s three-part, 1970s-set prequel series that starred Colin Woodell (The Flight Attendant) as Winston Scott, the titular New York hotel’s eventual proprietor played by Ian McShane on the big screen.

Titled John Wick: Under the High Table, the series focuses on the titular assassin-dispatching underworld organization and will be executive-produced by John Wick: Chapter 4 star Keanu Reeves and director Chad Stahelski. According to Deadline, which first reported the news, the sequel series picks up directly after John Wick 4 and the apparent death of the High Table's Excommunicado hired gun.

Stahelski — who co-directed 2014's John Wick and directed 2017's John Wick: Chapter 2, 2019's John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum, and 2023's John Wick: Chapter 4 — will helm the pilot episode. Robert Levine, co-creator of the Jeff Bridges-led thriller The Old Man for FX, is writing the action series that will ""combine new and old and thrust the John Wick universe into a new age."" Reeves is not expected to appear in the series but is ""very hands-on"" with the project that is being shopped to streamers, according to Deadline.

Levine will serve as showrunner and executive producer with Reeves and Stahelski, who in January signed a pact with the studio to assume creative oversight over Lionsgate's John Wick franchise across film, television, and all multimedia platforms.

In his role as creative overseer of the Wick universe — which has so far expanded with the Peacock-aired prequel The Continental: From the World of John Wick TV series and the 2025 spinoff film John Wick Presents: Ballerina, starring Ana de Armas — Stahelski guides the ""short and long-term creative direction, franchise strategy, and strategic growth"" of all things Wick, with the former stuntman's 87Eleven Entertainment ""designing a comprehensive multi-platform content strategy"" for both Wick and Lionsgate's Highlander reboot with Henry Cavill.



Stahelski's deal ""expands on the great creative relationship we already have in place on John Wick and extends it to our Highlander franchise,"" Joe Drake, the outgoing chair of the Lionsgate Motion Picture Group and Adam Fogelson, chair of the MPG, said in January. ""From the outset, Chad has been the creative force defining the world of Wick; as we continue to think about the future for that world, we want Chad, working together with Basil Iwanyk and Erica Lee of Thunder Road, as our stewards guiding us and strategizing together at every step. This deal makes it official, and we look forward to his steady hand and creative input not just on the film he is making, but other stories that arise from it. He is a true visionary, and we are thrilled to have him in our corner.""



""I am pleased to be able to grow my relationship with Lionsgate in this new oversight role for the John Wick universe and its further expansion,"" said Stahelski. ""John Wick is so close to my heart and to be able to continue shepherding it will be a blast for me.

No network or streaming service is attached, with Lionsgate currently shopping the project. The series, titled “John Wick: Under the High Table,” would pick up immediately after the events of “John Wick: Chapter 4.”

The official logline states, “John Wick has left the world of the High Table in a tenuous position and a collection of new characters will look to make a name for themselves while some of the franchise stalwart characters remain committed to the old-world order. The series will combine new and old and thrust the Wick universe into a new age.”

Keanu Reeves will executive produce the series along with Basil Iwanyk and Erica Lee of Thunder Road. Chad Stahelski will executive produce via 87Eleven Entertainment and direct the pilot. Robert Levine (“The Old Man,” “Black Sails”) will serve as writer, showrunner, and executive producer on the series. Lionsgate Television will produce, with Lionsgate having released all of the “John Wick” films to date. Stahelski signed a deal with Lionsgate back in January to oversee the expansion of the “John Wick” franchise across all media.

Should the project find a home, it would be the second TV series set in the world of “John Wick.” Lionsgate TV previously produced the miniseries “The Continental: From the World of John Wick,” which served as a prequel to the events of the films. Originally set up at Starz, the show ended up airing on Peacock in fall 2023.

The first “John Wick” film was released in 2014, while the fourth was released in 2023. A fifth film is in development, while the spinoff film “John Wick Presents: Ballerina” starring Ana de Armas is due to be released in theaters in 2025.

‘John Wick 4’ Sequel Series From Keanu Reeves & Chad Staples.,https://bgr.com/entertainment/keanu-reeves-is-producing-a-tv-series-about-everyones-favorite-dog-loving-assassin/,"Four movies, with a fifth in the works, plus a spinoff movie, a prequel series, and a forthcoming TV sequel series. Not bad for what I guess we can now refer to as the John Wick Cinematic Universe, which has a newly revealed sequel TV series — John Wick: Under the High Table, set after the events of the fourth John Wick movie — currently in development at Lionsgate Television (and executive produced by none other than John Wick himself, Keanu Reeves).

According to the official logline for the new series, “John Wick has left the world of the High Table in a tenuous position and a collection of new characters will look to make a name for themselves while some of the franchise stalwart characters remain committed to the old-world order.

It’s worth acknowledging that some fans of the franchise might greet word of the new series with a bit of trepidation, given the tepid response from critics to Peacock’s The Continental — a John Wick prequel series that’s built around the franchise’s exclusive and noirish hotel for killers. But setting aside the fact that the critics got that one wrong, in my opinion (and in the opinion of many of you, given that The Continental has a solid 78% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes), there are two reasons to let yourself be excited for John Wick: Under the High Table.

First and foremost, even though he’s not expected to appear in the series for obvious reasons (specifically, the ending of John Wick: Chapter 4), Reeves is attached to the new series as an executive producer and is reportedly being very hands-on with it. That wasn’t the case with The Continental.

And while Reeves’ involvement is certainly great news all by itself, so is the fact that Chad Stahelski, who directed the Wick movies, is likewise executive-producing. Both men clearly have a fantastic creative partnership and working relationship, with Stahelski turning a story about an assassin who starts out by avenging the death of his dog into a more than $1 billion movie franchise — one that’s not only about killers-for-hire but features highly choreographed, visually stunning action sequences and a criminal underworld replete with its own artifacts and lore.

And while the writing isn’t exactly Shakespeare, there’s something about it — straight, to the point, economical, and very memorable — that hooked me from the very beginning. I’m talking about lines like, “It’s not what you did, son, that angers me so; it’s who you did it to.” And that foreboding description of Wick as “the man you send to kill the f*****g boogeyman.” All of which is to say, the new John Wick TV series has a lot to live up to, because movies don’t get much more unpretentiously fun and escapist than these."
‘John Wick 4’ Sequel Series From Keanu Reeves & Chad Staples.,https://gizmodo.com/john-wick-5-sequel-show-high-table-keanu-reeves-2000483280,"What’s going to happen to the world of John Wick after the events of John Wick: Chapter 4? That answers is coming in a brand new TV series called John Wick: Under the High Table, produced by star Keanu Reeves and director Chad Stahelski.

Reeves won’t appear in the show but is reportedly hands-on with its creation, according to Deadline. Stahelski, who directed all four John Wick movies, will also direct the pilot. Most importantly, the show will not interfere with any potential stories for a rumored John Wick 5, next summer’s Ballerina starring Ana de Armas, or the Donnie Yen spinoff.

Written by Robert Levine (Black Sails, The Old Man), Under the High Table picks up after the events of Chapter 4 which saw John Wick’s actions throw the whole world of the High Table and secret assassins into disarray. The story follows characters new and old as they try to gain power and reestablish order.

Though a previous John Wick show, The Continental, was on Peacock, there’s no guarantee this show will join it there. Deadline reports it’s “being shopped in what is shaping up to become a competitive situation.”

As someone whose favorite part of the John Wick movies was the vast, fascinating world-building they did, this show sounds incredibly appealing. And if it also goes so far as to reset the universe in a way that makes it possible for Wick himself to rise from the ashes to burn it all down again? All the better.

Meanwhile, the High Table itself is ""in a tenuous position,"" probably because John Wick killed most of the major power players in the organization.

The John Wick universe is expanding once again. While The Continental kicked things off in 2023, and the Ballerina is fast approaching, there’s plenty more already in the works to continue building the franchise.

A full-fledged sequel in John Wick 5 certainly seems inevitable, a movie focusing on Donnie Yen’s Caine is also in the pipeline, and now, another new addition joins the list. Moving the series forward, Under The High Table takes place after the events of John Wick 4.

While it’s early days yet, with plenty of work to be done, here’s everything we know about the spinoff series thus far.

No, there is no release date or even rough release window for Under The High Table just yet. The new spinoff was only just reported to be in the works on August 5, 2024, so it’s clearly still very early on.

Under The High Table reportedly focuses on a mix of old and new characters, the former reaffirming their commitments to The High Table and the world of tradition, and the latter looking to operate in new ways and establish their own position in the fictional hierarchy.

Exactly who we may see in the films is unclear, but it’s safe to expect at least a few familiar faces. Winston Scott working his way through the logistical mess of rebuilding The Continental, the Bowery King focusing his efforts on what’s next, it’s possible we see them all as the show sets up the next mainline installment.

As to whether John Wick himself will appear after the vague ending of the fourth film, well that’s anyone’s guess for the time being, but we do know the man himself, Keanu Reeves, is attached to the project in some capacity.

Both Keanu Reeves and John Wick series director Chad Stahelski are executive producers on Under the High Table.

There’s still no official word on a fifth John Wick movie, although there are two different Wick spinoff films already in the works. A spinoff called Ballerina starring Ana de Armas, was announced back in 2022; after a series of delays and reshoots, it is currently scheduled to open in theaters in June of 2025. Lionsgate has also announced that Caine, Donnie Yen’s blind assassin from John Wick: Chapter 4, will also be the subject of his own movie; that spinoff is set to be shot in Hong Kong next year.

Is the audience this invested in a John Wick universe that (at least at the moment) does not appear to include much involvement from John Wick himself? Lionsgate would surely want a fifth official John Wick “chapter.” Whether Stahelski and Reeves can both be coaxed into returning for it is the big question mark there. In the meantime, you can look forward to seeing Reeves as Wick at least one more time; he did shoot some scenes for Ballerina.

For months now, there have been a ton of questions regarding where the “John Wick” franchise was going to go after the main character’s apparent demise in ‘Chapter 4.’ Would we get a John Wick resurrection? Or is the franchise going to be led by someone else?

According to Deadline, Lionsgate is teaming with “John Wick” filmmaker Chad Stahelski to work on a new TV series titled “John Wick: The High Table.” The series is said to pick up where the fourth film left off, as the powerful High Table is left in a bit of uncertainty.

The official logline reveals that the series will explore the fallout from John Wick’s departure from the High Table, introducing a mix of new characters aiming to establish their influence while some familiar faces remain loyal to the traditional order. The show promises to blend both new and established elements, propelling the Wick universe into a new era.

Keanu Reeves, who stars as the titular character, will serve as an executive producer for the series alongside Basil Iwanyk and Erica Lee of Thunder Road. Chad Stahelski, who directed the “John Wick” films and has been instrumental in shaping the franchise, will also executive produce through his 87Eleven Entertainment banner and direct the pilot episode. Robert Levine, known for his work on “The Old Man” and “Black Sails,” is set to be the writer, showrunner, and executive producer for the series.

Lionsgate Television, which has been the home of all “John Wick” films, will produce the series. Stahelski’s involvement follows a January 2024 agreement with Lionsgate to oversee the expansion of the “John Wick” franchise across various media platforms.

This new project would mark the second television series set in the “John Wick” universe. Lionsgate Television previously produced “The Continental: From the World of John Wick,” a miniseries that served as a prequel to the film series. Originally slated for Starz, the show eventually premiered on Peacock in the fall of 2023.

The original “John Wick” film debuted in 2014, with the fourth installment released in 2023. A fifth film is currently in development, and a spinoff film titled “John Wick Presents: Ballerina,” starring Ana de Armas, is scheduled for theatrical release in 2025.

Deadline was the first to report on the development of this new sequel series."
‘John Wick 4’ Sequel Series From Keanu Reeves & Chad Staples.,https://arynews.tv/john-wick-sequel-series-in-development-from-keanu-reeves/,"A sequel series to the “John Wick” films is currently in the works at Lionsgate Television with Keanu Reeves and Chad Stahelski among the executive producers.

The series, titled “John Wick: Under the High Table,” would follow the story right after the events of “Chapter 4,” according to the Hollywood Reporter.

“John Wick has left the world of the High Table in a tenuous position and a collection of new characters will look to make a name for themselves while some of the franchise stalwart characters remain committed to the old-world order. The series will combine new and old and thrust the Wick universe into a new age,” the official logline of the series reads.

Keanu Reeves, who played the titular role in the four films, will executive produce the series along with Basil Iwanyk and Erica Lee

Chad Stahelski will also executive produce while also directing the pilot. Showrunner Robert Levine will write and also executive produce the series.

The development came after Stahelski signed a deal with Lionsgate in January to expand the franchise across all media.

‘John Wick: Under the High Table’ will be the second series set in the world of “John Wick,” after Lionsgate TV produced the miniseries “The Continental: From the World of John Wick,” a prequel to the events of the films.

The first ‘John Wick’ film starring Keanu Reeves was released in 2014, while the fourth hit theaters in 2023 while the makers have begun works on the fifth title.

The fourth movie of the action flick broke a new record by receiving the highest aggregated review score of any entry in the franchise on Rotten Tomatoes.

The movie holds a rating of 93 per cent positive for critics’ reviews. The milestone rating is higher than all three previous entries, which scored 86 per cent, 89 per cent and 89 per cent respectively."

But come on now, you can't keep that guy down.

Last seen in 2023's ""John Wick: Chapter 4,"" the beloved action-movie assassin will appear in the upcoming spinoff ""John Wick Presents: Ballerina"" (in theaters June 6, 2025) starring Ana de Armas. The explosive first trailer for ""Ballerina"" premiered Wednesday during a Lionsgate presentation at CinemaCon, the convention for movie theater owners and studios.

In it, de Armas' character is touted as ""the new face of vengeance"" when seeking retribution for those who killed her family and wrecking dudes via her hands, legs and a flamethrower.

The footage showcased familiar faces, including Wick allies Winston (Ian McShane) and Charon (Lance Reddick, in his final role). But the good stuff was at the very end, as the female assassin meets up with Wick at a train yard. ""You're him, the one they call Baba Yaga,"" she says. ""How do I start doing what you do?""

Wick's reply: ""Looks like you already have.""

Directed by Len Wiseman, ""Ballerina"" is set between the events of 2019's ""John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum"" and ""Chapter 4,"" which means Wick is still on the run from the high table and not yet dead (at least seemingly) of a bullet wound.

Reeves also appeared in the first footage from writer/director Aziz Ansari's upcoming comedy ""Good Fortune."" In it, the ""John Wick"" star plays an angel named Gabriel who tries to help a financially struggling guy (Ansari) find purpose by switching his life with that of a rich dude (Seth Rogen), and it backfires.

At CinemaCon, Ansari revealed that while the Wick movies never sent Reeves to the hospital, his new movie did: ""Fifteen days into shooting with me, I was like, 'Hey, just chill in your dressing room for 15 minutes' and he tripped on a rug and went, 'Oh, my knee!' Poor guy. He was such a trouper.""

Ansari reported Reeves fractured his kneecap yet ""still filmed everything except some scenes where he we needed him to do salsa dancing"" that they need to pick up once he's fully healed.

""He actually is an angel,"" Ansari said of Reeves. ""This is actually the first he's gotten to play his true form. He has been pretending to be a human in all these other roles."""

Whilst Keanu Reeves' mythic hitman may have seemingly met his maker on the steps of the Sacré-Cœur in John Wick: Chapter 4 (we never actually saw him croak it!), the John Wick Universe has continued to expand in his absence with the likes of hotelier origin series The Continental, Ana De Armas' upcoming quite literal bullet ballet Ballerina, and an in-development spin-off movie centred around Donnie Yen's blind assassin Caine. Now, per Deadline's reporting, The Old Man co-creator Robert Levine is penning John Wick: Under The High Table, a new TV series set directly after the end of the last Wick film.

Franchise star Reeves and Wickiverse head honcho Chad Stahelski are aboard to executive produce the series, with Stahelski — who helmed all four of the mainline Wick movies — set to direct the pilot episode. Little is known at this stage about what we can expect from Under The High Table, but along with confirmation of its direct John Wick 4 sequel status, a description given to Deadline promises the new show will ""combine new and old and thrust the Wick universe into a new age."" And given the way Reeves' last stand shook out, it would be fair to say that the balance of power at the eponymous High Table — the Wickiverse's all-powerful crime lord council — is about to shift."
‘John Wick 4’ Sequel Series From Keanu Reeves & Chad Staples.,https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a43376904/john-wick-5-release-date/,"John Wick 5 still isn't any closer to happening, but we are getting a new spin-off movie to expand the universe.

In May 2024, it was announced that Donnie Yen will reprise his role as Caine from John Wick: Chapter 4 for a new movie, set after the events of the fourth movie (which could well resolve that credit-scene mystery).

There was no update on John Wick 5 though, which was technically confirmed in May 2023, but nearly a year on and we're no clearer whether it's actually happening.

In July 2023, Chad Stahelski – who has directed all four John Wick movies to date – said that he didn't know that a fifth movie would happen. However, as he told Inverse in October 2023, he's not against the idea as long as it's not a ""cash grab"".

""I have notebooks and notebooks of shit behind me, John Wicks 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. We have ideas for days. We just don't have the story locked,"" Stahelski explained.

Given how John Wick: Chapter 4 ended, it's perhaps not a surprise that we might not get a fifth movie. For now though, let's hope that Stahelski finds an idea as we're not sure we're ready to say bye to John Wick just yet.

So with that in mind, here's everything you need to know about a potential John Wick 5.

Lionsgate

John Wick 5 potential release date: When can we expect John Wick 5?

Even though John Wick 5 has been confirmed to be in development (probably), we don't yet have an official release date for the next movie as of April 2024.

The next John Wick movie we see will be the Ana de Armas-led spin-off Ballerina, which takes place between Chapters 3 and 4 in the timeline.

It was set to arrive in June this year, but had a year-long delay and will now hit cinemas on June 6, 2025. Stahelski isn't directing the spin-off, but is working with director Len Wiseman on additional action sequences for the movie.

The Caine spin-off movie does not yet have a release date as of June 2024.

If you need a John Wick fix right now, all three episodes of The Continental are available to watch on in the UK and in the US. Don't expect to see Keanu Reeves in the show though.



We'll likely have to wait until at least 2026 (and likely beyond that) for the fifth movie as there is currently no date for it to start filming.

Lionsgate

John Wick 5 cast: Is Keanu Reeves going to be in John Wick 5?

Despite where he's left at the end of Chapter 4, we can't imagine a John Wick movie without Keanu Reeves, so he'll be back.

Even though the movie is in development, we haven't yet had any official cast confirmations. We can make some guesses though based on where things left off at the end of Chapter 4.

Ian McShane will likely also return as Continental owner Winston, having been restored to his status by the end of the fourth movie, while Laurence Fishburne should be back as the Bowery King too.

Murray Close/Lionsgate

Following his untimely passing, Lance Reddick won't be back as Charon, who was also killed off in the fourth movie but could have made flashback returns. We'll get to see Reddick one final time as the faithful concierge though in spin-off Ballerina.

Outside of those, it's hard to tell who else could return. Maybe Donnie Yen as Wick's old friend Caine, assuming he survives the assassination attempt by Rina Sawayama's Akira as teased in Chapter 4's post-credit scene.

Given that he's now got his own spin-off movie, it's safe to say that Caine will survive that attempt. Quite what that means for Akira is another matter though.

Shamier Anderson's mysterious Tracker could return too, and maybe we'll get an appearance in the main movies by Ana de Armas's ballerina Rooney (assuming Rooney survives her spin-off movie, that is).

John Wick 5 plot: How does John Wick 4 set up a fifth movie?

There's no avoiding it: John Wick looks to be dead at the end of Chapter 4. Following the duel with Caine (Donnie Yen), Wick appears to succumb to his injuries after telling Winston (Ian McShane) to take him home.

We then see Winston and the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne) at the grave of Wick, who is buried alongside his wife. However, we technically never see Wick's body, although he does slump over after the duel.

He'd been through a lot though that evening and morning, so maybe he was just tired. We can see a world where it's revealed Winston helped Wick fake his death so that he was finally free of the High Table.

Stahelski has even revealed that they filmed a different version of the ending that showed Wick did survive, which is why you see his beloved pup look around during that final scene (potentially at Wick).

Whether it's revealed Wick has faked his death remains to be seen though, and could likely depend on whether Reeves and Stahelski want to come back for another movie.

Lionsgate

Stahelski has been open about the fact that there is a certain amount of ambiguity about Chapter 4's ending, which allows for Wick's return.

""I guess I'm going to have to lean on never say never,"" Reeves told EW after the release. ""I mean, I wouldn't do a John Wick film without Chad Stahelski. We'd have to see what that looked like. For me, it feels really right that John Wick finds peace.""

Talking to Collider in May 2022, Stahelski called the fourth movie a ""good conclusion to an emotional thread that we've already had"", which will certainly be the case if there isn't a fifth movie as you can't get more conclusive than killing your main character.

However, it also hints that if a fifth movie does happen, then it'll be a kind of soft reboot for the series and could start telling a new story separated from the High Table, the Continental and all that usual Wick stuff.

Chapter 4 does introduce new characters to the world such as Akira and the Tracker, but if their stories are continued, we imagine it'll be more in a spin-off or as secondary characters in the fifth movie, rather than them becoming main characters of it.

Lionsgate

John Wick 5 trailer: Any John Wick 5 footage yet?

Unfortunately not, since filming hasn't even started on John Wick 5. You'll be waiting a while for any footage.

John Wick: Chapter 4 is available to watch on in the UK. John Wick 5 does not yet have a release date."
‘John Wick 4’ Sequel Series From Keanu Reeves & Chad Staples.,https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/john-wick-5-everything-we-know-so-far,"It's possible that the John Wick franchise can continue without its titular assassin played by Keanu Reeves. Indeed, that's what'll happen later this month when The Continental prequel exclusively checks into Peacock for a three-night stay.

Even so, fans are holding their collective breath with anticipation, feverishly wondering if the dog-loving hitman with an iron constitution will return in a fifth installment on the big screen. Should the series conclusively end with the recent Chapter 4, it's not a bad way to wrap up John's character arc. But if he's still alive, then where might his next adventure take him? Let's take a look at everything we know so far about the potential for John Wick: Chapter 5.

Will there be a fifth John Wick movie?

Lionsgate certainly hopes there will be a fifth John Wick movie. In spite of its lengthy runtime, John Wick: Chapter 4 managed to become the highest-grossing entry of the entire franchise with over $426 million worldwide. If that doesn't scream ""MAKE ANOTHER SEQUEL!!!"" we don't know what does. ""We’re not ready to say goodbye to Keanu with this franchise,"" Lionsgate Motion Picture Group Chair Joe Drake remarked earlier this year.

RELATED: John Wick Director Explains How Franchise Represents The Greek Myths Of Odysseus & Sisyphus

The ultimate irony is that another sequel was originally supposed to be shot back-to-back with Chapter 4 before the COVID-19 health crisis and a grueling production schedule got in the way. While director Chad Stahelski noted that he and Reeves were ""done for the moment"" not long before Drake's pronouncement, Chapter 4's runaway success at the box office prompted him to slightly soften his stance on the matter. Indeed, the filmmaker's still got plenty of ideas for action set pieces they didn't have time to include in the first four movies.

“If a gun was put to my head and they said ‘you have to make three more John Wick movies, could we sustain it with action set pieces and storyline threads and could we put in some tributes or love letter Easter eggs for things? Yeah, we could totally do that,” the director said. “The real question that Keanu and I keep saying is the why? As an audience member, what would you like to see John do? How many more times can I beat him up?”

Not long after, veteran Wick producer Basil Iwanyk explained that Stahelski and Reeves would attempt to hash out the details of a fifth installment over a few bottles of whiskey in Japan. Speaking of which, that jaunt overseas is slated to take place this month — unless it's been canceled or delayed for whatever reason.

“Once they get through their hangovers, if Keanu and Chad have figured out something cool, if they’ve an organic way back in that doesn’t feel like bullsh-t, then there will be a John Wick 5,"" the producer said back in May. ""That trip to Japan, it’s like waiting for a boat to emerge out of the smoke, but that’s the impetus.""

What would John Wick 5 be about?

That's the major sticking point. As Stahelski mentioned above, he's got a laundry list of ideas for action-packed connective tissue, but an overarching story has yet to present itself.

""I don't have a take right now,"" he confessed earlier this summer while speaking to Empire for the magazine's August 2023 issue. ""But I could wake up tomorrow and have a cool idea that I'd pitch to Keanu, or he would pitch to me, and it might hit that chord of, 'Oh my God, we got to do this right now.' I have scenes, I have action sequences in my head that we haven't used yet that I'd love to do. If we do come back, we can't just do the same thing. I gotta do my homework. I gotta get better.""

Would Keanu Reeves return for John Wick 5?

Well, it probably wouldn't be much of a John Wick movie without the title character, now would it? John technically died at the end of Chapter 4, but an alternate ending, where the character is revealed to be alive, was shot. And come on, we never actually see his corpse buried.

""If you asked [Keanu] right now, 'Would you do John Wick 5?' he'd be [like] 'F*** yeah!'"" Stahelski said while appearing on a recent episode of the Happy Sad Confused podcast. ""But then he'd look and go, 'Well, what is it? I have no f-ckin' idea.' ... It's not like, 'We're gonna figure it out today!' Look, man, we're gonna do our other stuff for a little bit. But if I was driving in the car or I was just walking the dog and an idea hit me, within 30 seconds, I'd be on the phone with Keanu and we'd be riffing.""

The real question is whether Stahelski — whose got Rainbow Six, a remake of Highlander, and an adaptation of The Ghost of Tsushima on his plate of upcoming features — would direct. He's not opposed to handing the series off to another filmmaker, who presents him with an irresistible pitch. ""It'd be worth the talk,"" he mused during his chat with Empire, ""but I'm very selfish and jealous. I'm a control freak. I want to smack you just for suggesting it. [Laughs] Like, how dare you? Of course I want to do it.""

What's the latest on the John Wick spinoffs?

The franchise will chug along Friday, September 22 with the premiere of The Continental: From the World of John Wick on Peacock. Set against the backdrop of late 1970s New York, the limited series will explain how Winston Scott (played as a young man by Colin Woodell) became manager of the titular hotel for professional killers. Episodes 2 and 3 arrive September 29 and October 6, respectively.

The second spinoff, the feature-length Ballerina, hits the big screen on July 7, 2024. Centered around a member of the Ruska Roma crime family introduced in Chapter 3, the film stars several Wick newcomers Ana de Armas, Gabriel Byrne, Norman Reedus, and Catalina Sandino Moreno. In addition, Reeves (John), Ian McShane (Winston), and the late Lance Reddick (Charon) are set to make cameo appearances. Directed by Underworld vet Len Wiseman, the project takes place between the events of Chapters 3 and 4.

Lionsgate hopes to go all in on the spinoffs, with Drake alluding to several more projects, including a video game.

""We're now moving across that franchise, not just in the AAA video game space, but looking at ... the regular cadence of spinoffs, television really growing that universe so that there is a steady cadence of a franchise that there's clear appetite [for] by the audience,"" he said on an earnings call in late May (via Collider). ""What is official is that, as you know, Ballerina is the first spinoff that comes out next year. We're in development on three others, including John Wick 5 and including television series. The Continental will be airing soon. And so, we're building out the world and when that five movie comes, will be organic — will be organically grown out of how we're starting to tell those stories. But you can rely on a regular cadence of John Wick.""

‘John Wick 4’ Sequel Series From Keanu Reeves & Chad Staples.,https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/john-wick-5-time-jump,"Despite Keanu Reeves’ reluctance to return to the franchise, the door is still open for a fifth John Wick film. Producer Basil Iwanyk, at least, is hopeful: though Reeves apparently “begged” to see his character definitively retired in John Wick: Chapter 4, he was willing to compromise and left an opportunity for Wick to return.

“We all want another John Wick,” Iwanyk told Collider, and director Chad Stahelski may also be down for a fifth installment. Nothing is officially in the works — and Iwanyk doesn’t want to force the issue — but there’s still a chance Wick’s story could continue in a John Wick 5.

Even if Reeves, Stahelski, and Iwanyk do get on the same page about a sequel, they’ll likely put some distance between it and the first four Wick films. Iwanyk views the franchise as one “book” in a potential series. “If these movies were four chapters, you kind of blame it on the metaphor,” the producer told ScreenRant. “If there is another John Wick movie, which I do believe there will be ... I do feel like it will be a completely other book.”

The Wick creative team is open to a John Wick 5, if they can distance it from the existing story. Lionsgate

Additionally, John Wick 5 could be set away from its predecessors. “It won’t be like six months later from John Wick 4,” Iwanyk continued, suggesting the next “book” in the saga could take place after a significant time jump.

Nothing’s set in stone, but it would definitely be wise to set a fifth film well after the fourth (or well before the first). The John Wick films have all seamlessly bled together — John Wick 3 picks up mere minutes after John Wick 2 — but 4 had a definitive conclusion. A new story should start fresh, and find a convincing way to work around 4’s ending without undermining it.

John Wick 5 doesn’t have to take place decades after Chapter 4. A two-or-three-year gap could be just the reset the franchise (and Reeves) needs to keep going. It may also give Wick spin-offs like Ballerina the space they need to breathe. Wick’s world keeps getting bigger, but there’s no rush to keep the story going. As long as Reeves is willing to return, the saga can continue... someday."
‘John Wick 4’ Sequel Series From Keanu Reeves & Chad Staples.,https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a45264335/the-continental-john-wick-keanu-reeves/,"THAT JOHN WICK has become a ""franchise"" at all is, quite frankly, something of a miracle. 2014's John Wick was planned as a one-off revenge thriller, based on a spec script from writer Derek Kolstad, for a modest budget that sat somewhere between $20 and $30 million dollars. In fact, that original film wasn't even called John Wick; instead, it was Scorn, a title star Keanu Reeves disliked so much that he just kept referring to it as John Wick. Lionsgate eventually changed the title—quite late in the game—as a result.

The first John Wick became a hit (grossing $86 million against that small budget) thanks to a cocktail of things—good word of mouth, a thirst for strong action movies—but mostly thanks to Keanu Reeves' one-of-kind combination of specific on-screen persona and utterly badass action skills. The franchise continued to grow through the years, gaining budget on the back end (making each John Wick movie bigger than the last) and tallying longer and longer box office receipts along the way. And that's almost all thanks to the leading man with the gun and the suit.

Part of what makes the John Wick franchise (now up to four feature films, with more already being teased) unique and different from other similar series like Mission Impossible or Fast & Furious is the utter simplicity of the story—John Wick takes on bad guys is essentially it—mixed with some very intense world building. And while the John Wick films just give audiences a taste of the lore and mystery involved with both The Continental hotel (a haven for assassins), Peacock's new show The Continental: From the World of John Wick is diving all the way in, filling in spaces that may have previously been left blank on purpose.

And to tell that story, The Continental is heading back in time—to the '70s, following a younger version of Winston Scott (Ian McShane's character in the films, played here by The Flight Attendant 's Colin Woodell) as he navigates his own version of New York City before managing the hotel himself. And to get where we know he eventually does, he's going to need to take on the hotel's then-manager, a ruthless crime lord named Cormac (played by the unnecessarily-cast Mel Gibson).

But is it even really part of the John Wick world without John Wick himself?

Is Keanu Reeves in The Continental as John Wick?

Warner Bros.

At this time, Keanu Reeves is not a part of The Continental: From the World of John Wick.

This wasn't always the plan, though. Back in 2017, when the series was first announced as a Starz orignal, the series was meant to take place in a ""hyper-real version of Los Angeles"" rather than the '70s-era New York City that we ended up getting. And at that time, there were plans for John Wick himself to remain a part of the world in the John Wick universe series.

“Keanu is an executive producer, and I think you can expect to see him at some point in the series,” Starz president of programming Carmi Zlotnik said, according to Indiewire. “That is part of the ongoing conversation.” (Reeves is not an executive producer of the 2023 version of The Continental either, though the original film's co-directors Chad Stahelski and David Leitch both are.)

Times change, and things change, though. The long road to existence for The Continental found the series moving from Starz to Peacock, from LA to NYC, and from the present day to the '70s. And somewhere along the way, it lost Reeves as well.

At least it makes sense for John Wick not to appear at this point; if the character is about the same age as Reeves himself, John Wick would've only been about 10-15 years old at the time when the show is set. Hardly an appropriate age to be acrobatically shooting people!

There is some good news, though: Reeves will, however, appear in 2024's Ballerina, starring Ana de Armas, itself a spinoff that takes place between the third and fourth John Wick films.

Will someone else play John Wick in The Continental: From the World of John Wick?

It would be a fairly predictable (though also sensible) easter egg for a young/teenage John Wick to appear at some point in The Continental. After all, Winston in the films has always seemed like a father-figure to John, and John seems to have essentially been birthed into this bizarre, eccentric, world of killers.

We won't count this possibility out."
‘John Wick 4’ Sequel Series From Keanu Reeves & Chad Staples.,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/22/arts/television/the-continental-review-john-wick.html,"The “John Wick” films, starring Keanu Reeves as the world’s most beleaguered hit man, are all about surfaces, systems and choreography. They offer Reeves’s lethal cheekbones; nighttime cinematography that looks like a teenager’s black-light dreams; the honor codes of the gangster drama wedded to the arcane rituals of the medieval fantasy; and the relentless momentum of the fight scenes, in which Reeves moves with the weary, deliberate precision of a chef making his signature dish over and over again. It’s a blend whose continuity of sensation and sentiment can inspire devotion in those (like me) who are susceptible to it.

It helps that the four films, under Chad Stehelski’s direction (working with David Leitch on the original, “John Wick”), are reasonably witty in a way that is largely but not solely visual, and that they’re studded with actors who can stylize their performances to match the material: Reeves, Ian McShane, Lance Reddick, Laurence Fishburne, Anjelica Huston, Willem Dafoe.

Wick appears, for now, to be off the sequel track — there was an ostensible finality to events at the end of “John Wick: Chapter 4” — and into the maze of franchise expansion. A spinoff film focused on a different character is scheduled for release next year. And on Friday, a prequel mini-series, “The Continental,” premiered on the streaming service Peacock. The full title is “The Continental: From the World of John Wick,” but the television project actually seems to be coming from a far distant planet.

If that was a lot of dancing around before getting to the show in question, well, there isn’t a lot that needs saying about the wan, prosaic “The Continental,” which loads incident and exposition into its four and a half hours (over three feature-length episodes) but still feels formless and indistinct."

After killing countless High Table henchmen, falling down hundreds of stairs and dueling one blind master swordsman, Keanu Reeves‘ John Wick is…dead?

“John Wick: Chapter 4” ends with Wick seemingly six feet under, after succumbing to three gunshot wounds he suffered during his final duel with Caine (Donnie Yen). Winston (Ian McShane) and the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne) even pay their respects at the master assassin’s tombstone, which is located next to his wife’s final resting place.

Before he died, however, Wick finally freed himself from the High Table’s clutches. Instead of firing his third and final bullet in his duel against Caine, Wick held onto the round and shot the Marquis Vincent de Gramont (Bill Skarsgard), who had walked over to deliver the final blow to Wick before checking to see if he was out of bullets. With de Gramont dead, Wick won his freedom, but barely got to enjoy it before he died peacefully on the steps of France’s Sacré-Cœur as the sun began to rise.

But is Wick really dead? We never actually see him die from his wounds, nor do we see his body get buried. After all, over four movies he’s survived an inhuman amount of stabbings, gunshots, brandings, hard falls from absurd heights and other serious bodily harm. At the end of “John Wick 3,” he faked his death from the High Table’s Adjudicator (Asia Kate Dillon) and recovered from his wounds with the Bowery King underground, hiding out until the beginning of “John Wick 4.” His death has been staged before, so why not again?

In August 2020, Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer revealed that “John Wick 5” was already in the works, before “John Wick 4” had even begun filming. The original plan was for the fourth and fifth entries to shoot back-to-back, which did not end up happening. Last week, director Chad Stahelski told The Hollywood Reporter that, “In our minds, Keanu and I are done for the moment. We’re going to give ‘John Wick’ a rest. I’m sure the studio has a plan. If everyone loves it and it goes kooky, then we’ll take a quiet minute.”

“The thought process was, when we had the opportunity after ‘Chapter 3,’ what was the ‘why’?” Reeves said at a post-screening Q&A at the SXSW Film Festival. “When Chad and I were talking about it, the ‘why’ is death, and it was John Wick’s dead. For him to get his peace or his freedom in a way, that was the reason to make the movie. You gotta have the ‘why.'”

Even if a mainline “John Wick” movie doesn’t happen for a while, Reeves is already booked to appear in the upcoming spinoff “Ballerina,” starring Ana de Armas. Taking place between the third and fourth “John Wick” films, “Ballerina” stars de Armas as an assassin named Rooney who hunts down her family’s murderers. We previously saw a young Rooney in “John Wick 3,” where she was played by ballet dancer Unity Phelan and was under the tutelage of Anjelica Huston’s Director. Huston’s character is the leader of the Ruska Roma crime syndicate, of which Wick was once a member. The group also includes Katia (Natalia Tena), who welcomed Wick back into the adoptive family and branded him with their crest in “John Wick 4.”

“Ballerina,” which does not yet have a release date, could further crack open the shadowy world of “John Wick.” In addition to Reeves, the cast includes Huston, McShane and newcomers Gabriel Byrne, Norman Reedus and Catalina Sandino Moreno. Lance Reddick will also appear as The Continental concierge Charon, in his final appearance filmed before his death last week. Reddick’s character is shot to death by the Marquis de Gramont at the beginning of “John Wick 4.”

The “John Wick” franchise also a prequel series coming that will show the origins of The Continental and many of its major players. Heading to Peacock in the future, “The Continental” will take place in the ’70s and reveal how a young Winston got control of the assassin hotel and safe haven. Colin Woodell plays a young Winston, Ayomide Adegun is Charon, Katie McGrath is The Adjudicator and Peter Greene is Uncle Charlie, who goes onto covertly dispose of bodies in the “John Wick” movies. Mel Gibson stars as a character named Cormac, and the cast includes many other newcomers playing a variety of Continental guests and killers.

“John Wick 4” also has one final, future plot thread teased in the post-credits scene with Akira (Rina Sawayama) and Caine. Earlier in the movie, Caine kills Akira’s father Koji (Hiroyuki Sanada), who was Wick’s friend and the manager of the Osaka Continental Hotel. Akira, who was the concierge of the hotel, approaches Caine in the post-credits scene to take revenge for her father’s death, perhaps teasing a showdown to come."
‘John Wick 4’ Sequel Series From Keanu Reeves & Chad Staples.,https://slate.com/culture/2023/03/john-wick-4-keanu-reeves-buster-keaton.html,"Chad Stahelski, director of all four of the John Wick movies, got his start in a way that’s not typical for budding Hollywood directors: He spent more than two decades working as a stunt performer and, later, stunt coordinator for such action classics as The Matrix, Spider-Man 2, and V for Vendetta. Having spent the past five-plus years researching and writing a book about Buster Keaton, another auteur who got his start doing stunts, I was especially curious about the Keaton homages sprinkled throughout the John Wick series, as well as the evident love, on the part of Stahelski and star Keanu Reeves alike, for the intricate sight gags and jaw-dropping practical stunt work to be found in silent slapstick comedy. So I hopped on a Zoom with Stahelski for a conversation about fight choreography, the art of messing with the audience’s heads, and whether John Wick is quietly a comedy franchise. Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.

Dana Stevens: It’s not hard to catch the overt Keaton references in the John Wick movies, like the projection of a scene from Sherlock Jr. on the side of a building at the beginning of the second movie. Or John falling out of an upper-story window and having the awnings break his fall on the way down in John Wick 3, a gag that comes straight from a Keaton film, Three Ages.

Chad Stahelski: Keaton’s also in John Wick 4. When Keanu’s walking to the Osaka train station, there’s a projection of Keaton going on in the background.

Ah, since I only got to see that once on the big screen, I didn’t get to rewind and catch that.

You’ll have to check it out.

So there are these references seeded throughout, but there’s also a spirit of slapstick comedy that infuses almost all the fight choreography in these movies. You’re one of the few directors who started out as a stuntman, just like Keaton did. That’s an unusual trajectory toward the job. And so I would like to hear about the DNA of slapstick in your own stunt work and how that’s influenced your filmmaking.

I grew up in Palmer, Massachusetts, a very small town. My mom and dad were borderline professional athletes. Me and my brothers were very athletic. I tried baseball, basketball, football, hockey, and for some reason I was horrible with all of them, probably because I had zero interest. And then one day I saw a Bruce Lee movie with my dad, and I just knew that was the thing. So I started martial arts when I was about 10. And then I stayed in judo and karate and jujitsu till I was about 16. I came out to California to go to the University of Southern Cal. And out there I started training at the Inosanto Academy of Martial Arts.

Dan Inosanto was probably, at the time, the most famous instructor on the planet. He was known for being Bruce Lee’s training partner. And after Bruce died, Dan Inosanto took over that legacy. A lot of Hollywood top stunt people would work out there. So here I am, a little 17-year-old, and at the time I didn’t know it, but you’re bumping elbows with some of the major stunt coordinators.

And through that gym, I met Brandon Lee, Bruce Lee’s son, who unfortunately died on the filming of The Crow. Brandon was getting into acting, and he got a little group of us that all clicked. And on weekends we’d get together at the gym and practice fight scenes and try to figure out how not to hit each other.

I get to be one of Brandon Lee’s doubles on The Crow and, through this, got introduced to Jackie Chan and to Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao and Chow Yun-fat and all these great early John Woo movies or Tsui Hark movies. So now on weekends, in our fledgling stunt careers, we’re trying to do all the Jackie Chan stunts, which wasn’t a good idea because we weren’t as talented and we were usually landing on our heads.

You’ve got to remember, at the time, The Matrix hadn’t come out yet. So martial arts in American cinema was looked down upon. As a stunt person, you made your money falling or driving or doing a stair fall or fire burns. Anything but martial arts.

The Matrix comes out. I get a gig doubling Keanu after I turn it down a few times. I was one of the few 6-foot-1 guys out there that had a gymnastic, martial-arts background. Next thing you know, I’m doubling Keanu Reeves on The Matrix. And who’s doing The Matrix? Yuen Woo-ping himself, the greatest fight choreographer alive today and probably that’s ever been around, and now I’m learning with his team for the next 10 years. And through that time, I’m working with Jackie Chan, Donnie Yen, Jet Li, and being introduced to the best of the best in the industry. And you start talking to Jackie Chan a little bit, and who’s one of his biggest influences? Buster Keaton.

Back up a couple years: My grandfather, for whatever reason, had a ton of 8 mm films of all the old silent comedians. He liked to play Charlie Chaplin in the background. So I’ve already seen Little Tramp, I’ve already seen Buster Keaton, I’ve already seen Harold Lloyd. I’ve already seen it, but it’s not clicking yet until I have a couple conversations with Yuen Woo-ping and his team. And then I meet Jackie Chan for the first time, and he’s telling me how it came about with him.

Of course. Right.

And then you go another generation forward. Now I’m directing. So now I’ve got Keanu Reeves, who I’ve known for a fair amount of time from being his stunt double and his stunt coordinator. And Keanu and I have the talk of what we’re trying to create. We’re taking Steve McQueen, a little Paul Newman, Toshiro Mifune. We’re taking more of the stoic, Clint Eastwood, man-with-no-name kind of mentality with this character because we’re trying to make it hard-boiled. And Keanu says something really interesting to me on the first John Wick. He comes to me and he goes, “Look, just so you know, little bit of advice, when you edit, once a week, you should see the edit on the big screen.” And I’m like, “OK, we’ll try.” Later, alone with him, I’m going, “Well, why?” He’s like, “I’m a big-screen actor.” And I had no fucking idea what that meant. I thought it meant a movie star. And he’s like, “No, no, no, no.”

Advertisement

And he started talking to me about nonverbal acting, like gestures, motions. And he’s like, “Look, when you see me on a little monitor and I give this little look, it’s one thing. But when you see it on a 40-foot screen, that look’s going to say a lot. That’s what I want to play this guy as. So just please be aware of it, so when we punch in on the close-ups, it’s going to mean something.” And it kind of really clicked for me right there.

I’ve always been fascinated by nonverbal gesture, body language. Keanu would go through and strip his dialogue down. It was like, “No, no, nope. I’m just going to cuddle the puppy.” In the first John Wick, he doesn’t talk for 32 minutes. Try to sell that one to a studio: You have Keanu Reeves, and you’re not going to let him talk. I think in John Wick 4 he says, I don’t know, less than 200 words. I forget what it is.

Advertisement

It was 380, which actually seems high to me. And my question, when I read that number, was: Does that include the foreign languages he speaks?

There’s a lot of yeahs, right? But we did that on purpose, because we’re both fascinated by this. A lot of times I’ll be on Keanu when another cast member’s talking, so you can see Keanu slowly react to the words being said. Go back and watch Seven Samurai and watch how much nonverbal stuff is done. So we took that from the Kurosawa world, which ultimately I think derived from silent films. They didn’t have words.

You watch Buster Keaton, he had to give the looks—like, when he’s in love, the twinkling eyes. You go back and watch any of the Harold Lloyds or the Buster Keatons, and are you kidding me? They’re selling whole stories without a word. I don’t think people appreciate how fucking crazy that is. They were getting across love, fear, astonishment. They made you laugh with the shrug of the shoulders. You have to pay attention to that.

“Keanu would go through and strip his dialogue down. It was like, ‘No, no, nope. I’m just going to cuddle the puppy.’”

So our whole philosophy that we got out of the silent-movie mentality was a lot from a little. In every action scene, I can suspend it for about two minutes. Then I got to change the set piece. I got to change the color. I got to change the opponent. I got to change the weapon, and I got to get you to laugh. No matter what I do, just when you think it’s over, I’m going to throw him down the stairs. Just when you think it’s over, the dog’s going to come in. Just when you think it’s over, I’m going to hit him with the car. Just when you think it’s over, he’s going to run out of bullets. That’s our big thing in karate: subversive, subversive, subversive. You think it’s one thing and it’s another. But again, that’s a silent-movie trope. They know how to do excess well. And John Wick is excessive. That’s the whole silent-movie gag, right?

Advertisement

Advertisement

It reminds me of Cops, Keaton’s Cops, right? Where there’s excess…

Exactly it.

The joke is the excess, but there’s minimalism within the excess, and that’s what draws your eye.

Advertisement

Advertisement

Thank you. If you could tell that to all my critics, that’d be awesome.

The slapstick gags and stunts and falls and things like that are everywhere, but there’s also the simple fact that the John Wick character has a really strong resemblance to that unnamed Keaton character that Keaton always played in his silent films. They both have that quality of being really minimalist, incredibly laconic. They have a kind of melancholy about them, and you never learn their backstory. This is a huge thing that makes John Wick work, I think. I hope that we’re never going to learn what the “impossible task” was.

Advertisement

No, not yet. We like talking about it, but I swear to God, every time somebody tries to put it in there, I’m like, I don’t ever want to know what it is. Ever.

In a recent interview with you and Keanu together—a fun little thing you did for Vanity Fair where you were responding to John Wick fan theories—Keanu described a process where he gets the script and proceeds to act out all the parts. And then he said something to you like “You create the world, I just play in it.” What is that process of play like that kicks off the planning of the movie? And to what extent is the script, when you get started, somewhat vague? Does it say things like “John Wick fights,” or does it start to lay out the choreography and the gags already in the script?

Advertisement

Advertisement

I’d say half the writing is from the outside in, just random ideas that we’re going to try and put into our story. Like, I always knew I wanted to get Scott Adkins in a big man suit. And the other half is from the inside out, as we’re trying to make John’s journey interesting. But it all starts with: Where’s our beginning? Where’s our end? And everything else in the middle we kind of throw together.

Advertisement

It’s interesting—that is exactly, almost word for word, how Keaton used to describe putting his films together. He said that once he and his team of gag writers came up with a beginning and an end, “we always figured the middle would take care of itself.”

We knew John was going have to conclude his journey.

Advertisement

Right, right. And when does Keanu get involved in that process? Is it after the script exists or does he come into …

Before I even put pen to paper he’s like, “Hey, wouldn’t it be cool if …”, and we riff back and forth. I don’t think there’s a single scene that we locked into the script that he hadn’t read and commented or given notes on. This time was weird, because I think he was finishing up Bill and Ted, then he had to do Matrix 4 as we’re doing this, so he was out of town a lot, but we were always on a Zoom or call at least once a week. And then when he is in town, he’s in here two, three times a week, literally acting scenes out and writing the dialogue. He’s incredibly involved.

Unlike a lot of action franchises that have underlying deep mythologies the way John Wick does, and that get bigger with every chapter the way John Wick does, I mean—those are two things that tend to be red flags for me: This is going to get self-serious and ponderous at some point. But the John Wick movies avoid that, and I’m curious about how they do. I think the main way they do is that they just always maintain a sense of humor about themselves. With John Wick 4, I really feel like the locations themselves have become funny. Paris has become this chessboard, an abstract space for the High Table to play out its games. So I’m curious both about location scouting and how that gives you ideas—and also to what degree you conceive of these movies as comedies?

Advertisement

Oh, a hundred percent. Of course we’re very self-aware. But it’s supposed to be a gag. We’re making fun of action movies. I’m trying to prove the point that you don’t need $200 million to do an epic. I’m trying to prove a point that action movies don’t have to be ugly. I’m a hard person to work for. I want it to be beautiful. I want my cinematography to match anybody up there. I want my wardrobe to be equal to anything at the Oscars. And the last thing I want to hear is “Well, it’s just an action movie.”

When I knew I was going to shoot in Paris, I watched Le Cercle Rouge, I watched Le Samouraï with Alain Delon, I watched Amélie, of course, and I watched one of my favorite short films, Le Ballon Rouge.

I want you to feel like you did with the old James Bonds. When you see James Bond in a luge in Austria or in the Alps of Switzerland, you go, “Oh my God, I want to go there.” Even on the first movie, we did this little spa in Tribeca. I want you asking, “Where’s that in New York? I want to go to that spa and I want to be on that street. Where’s that alley?” I have a location fetish: I want you to travel. I went back to the desert, I went back to Aqaba, because I’m a huge David Lean fan. Lawrence of Arabia is one of my favorite films of all time. I want you to want to go to that desert.

Laurence Fishburne blowing out the match—probably one of the most famous edits in all of cinema history is Peter O’Toole doing it. Of course, at that point, excuse my language, but yeah, I’m fucking with you. I’m ripping off the most famous edits in cinema, blowing out the match. Of course, it’s a goof. When I throw somebody down 150 steps, we’re having a go. The trick is making all the characters grounded in their reality but at the same time letting you know, yes, sit back and enjoy."
‘John Wick 4’ Sequel Series From Keanu Reeves & Chad Staples.,https://thedirect.com/article/john-wick-4-streaming-release-date-new,"Mere weeks ahead of John Wick: Chapter 4's imminent streaming release date, the timeframe for its debut changed ever so slightly.

John Wick 4 has been one of 2023's biggest R-rated successes, raking in a $430 million haul at the global box office, topping its predecessor by over $100 million, and becoming the highest-grossing movie in this new Keanu Reeves-starring franchise.

Reeves' hero engaged in yet another epic battle against the mysterious High Table, bringing along a stellar cast of actors as the Wick legacy expanded to new heights.

When Will John Wick 4 Begin Streaming?

Lionsgate

Starz made an official announcement that John Wick: Chapter 4 will be available to stream on the service starting on Friday, September 15. This will give the film a 175-day window between its March 24 theatrical release date and its streaming debut.

This is a change from the original steaming release date for John Wick 4, which was initially announced to premiere on Starz on September 26. It will now hit the streamer nine days earlier.

John Wick 4 will remain on Starz for its Pay 1 window (approximately 18 months) before it joins the first three John Wick films on Peacock sometime in April or May 2025.

This movie now boasts one of the longest theatrical-to-streaming windows of any blockbuster movie released in the first half of 2023.

This year's second-highest-grossing movie, The Super Mario Bros. Movie, enjoyed an expansive 120 days on the big screen before it debuted on Peacock as it made over $1.35 billion.

Barbie was announced to get its own streaming release on Max sometime this fall after becoming the highest-grossing movie of 2023, earning over $1.38 billion during its run so far and becoming Warner Bros.' highest-grossing movie ever.

On the superhero movie side, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 gave Marvel Studios its longest streaming release window of the Multiverse Saga, coming to Disney+ 89 days after its May 5 theatrical debut.

When Will the John Wick Franchise Continue?

With John Wick 4 becoming the highest-grossing movie in the franchise, helping the series pass $1 billion in total box office revenue, it would seem to be an easy decision for Lionsgate to continue into a potential John Wick 5.

Director Chad Stahelski remarked he has ""bookcases and shelves of notebooks with hundreds of ideas"" for a potential fifth film, although he said in an exclusive interview with The Direct that he isn't sure how it will come together just yet.

One aspect of John Wick 5 that the director has in mind is who he would want to star in that next movie, rattling off names like Robert Downey Jr., Charlize Theron, Colin Farrell, and Michelle Yeoh as potential actors he wants to take a look at.

But having already turned down the idea of directing a fourth and fifth movie back-to-back, it seems clear that Stahelski wants a bit of a break from the John Wick world before diving back into that big of a challenge.

John Wick: Chapter 4 will be available to stream on Starz starting on Friday, September 15."
‘John Wick 4’ Sequel Series From Keanu Reeves & Chad Staples.,https://www.nme.com/news/film/keanu-reeves-asked-to-be-definitively-killed-in-john-wick-4-3500076,"Warning: Spoilers ahead

Keanu Reeves reportedly asked for the titular character of the John Wick franchise to be “definitively” killed off at the end of Chapter 4, released earlier this year.

Speaking to Collider for a new interview, John Wick: Chapter 4 producer Basil Iwanyk revealed that Reeves had requested for John Wick to be undeniably dead by the fourth film’s conclusion as he was experiencing fatigue from filming.

“After the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th movie, making these films is so exhausting and it destroys Keanu, physically and emotionally,” said Iwanyk. “By the end, he’s always like, ‘I can’t do this again,’ and we agree with him”.

Iwanyk went on to explain: “The guy is just a shell of himself because he just goes off and goes for it. He was like, ‘I wanna be definitively killed at the end of this movie.’ We were like, ‘You know, we’ll leave a 10 per cent little opening.'”

While John Wick is left presumably dead after a duel at the end of the fourth film, the producers and director Chad Stahleski have ended the film on an ambiguous note, leaving the door open for a possible return later on.

In March, Stahelski said that both he and Keanu Reeves are “done for the moment” with the films. “In our minds, Keanu and I are done for the moment. We’re going to give John Wick a rest. I’m sure the studio has a plan. If everyone loves it and it goes kooky, then we’ll take a quiet minute.”

John Wick: Chapter 4 scored a four-star review upon its release earlier this year. Jesse Hassenger wrote from NME: “John Wick: Chapter 4 is a lot. It runs nearly three hours, introduces multiple new characters, further indulges the series’ trademark elaborate mythology, and at one point adds a brief desert-set horseback chase in an apparent homage to Lawrence of Arabia. Yet this latest sequel to the relatively straightforward 2014 revenge action movie also seems hell-bent on proving a theory about self-indulgent blockbuster bloat: it’s not really a problem if the audience is having a good time.”"
‘John Wick 4’ Sequel Series From Keanu Reeves & Chad Staples.,https://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/ent/kit-harington-keanu-reeves-john-wick.html,"A fan artist created some stunning shots of Kit Harington as John Wick.

By Britta DeVore |

While Jon Snow may know nothing, John Wick seems to know everything – maybe it’s the “h” in his name. Nevertheless, a fan of both Game of Thrones and the John Wick franchise posed the question of what it would be like to see Kit Harington take over Keanu Reeves’ role. In a set of photos, which you can see below, the answer is provided – and, we’ve got to say, it looks dashing.

With his jet-black wavy and shoulder-length hair, Kit Harington steps into the role of the lethal assassin made famous by Keanu Reeves. Wearing the iconic black suit with a crisp white button-up and tie combo, the Extrapolations star seamlessly transitions into the suave look of the gun-fu master, even posing with a firearm in one of the images. With a serious look in his eyes, Harington’s John Wick appears just as ready to embark on a globe-trotting, assassin-fighting adventure as the franchise’s killer.

While Kit Harington may look the part, John Wick fans will know there’s just no replacing Keanu Reeves. Since first stepping into the role nearly a decade ago, Reeves has successfully helped launch a fan-favorite franchise that not only boasts four films but also has a television series spinoff and feature-length spinoff in the works. When it comes to the silent and dangerous man known to his enemies as “the boogeyman,” there’s just no one better suited for the role than Keanu Reeves.

To be fair, Keanu Reeves has had his fair share of similar action roles that have prepared him for his run as John Wick. From his time in The Matrix franchise to going up against all the forces that Balthazar (or Gavin Rossdale) himself could unleash in 2005’s Constantine, the celebrated action star is no stranger to rocking an all-black or suited ensemble and kicking butt.

Most recently, Keanu Reeves picked up his arsenal of guns and took on what felt like the whole world in John Wick: Chapter 4. A smash, already bringing in over $250 million according to Box Office Mojo, the film follows the events of the third film and follows the titular hitman who now has a lofty bounty on his head with the High Table using all the power they have from around the globe to track and kill the infamous killer. What started as a man’s quest for vengeance for his slain dog and stolen car has gone beyond what any of the loyal fandom could’ve imagined with the latest film upping the ante and taking off like a rocket.

We’ve recently discovered that although the spin-off feature Ballerina will mostly focus on Ana de Armas’ dancer-by-day assassin-by-night character, audiences can expect to see Keanu Reeves appearing as John Wick. Set for arrival in June 2024, the movie will also star the likes of Norman Reedus (The Walking Dead) and Chloë Grace Moretz (Carrie).

Preparing to return to life beyond the Wall and reprise his role as Jon Snow in a Game of Thrones spin-off, Kit Harington’s hands may be tied when it comes to any future in the John Wick cinematic universe. While we certainly don’t expect the Eternals actor to take over Keanu Reeves’ gig anytime soon, it would be fun to catch him joining forces or fighting against Reeves’ beloved assassin."
‘John Wick 4’ Sequel Series From Keanu Reeves & Chad Staples.,https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/john-wick-chapter-4-reviewed-a-slog-with-a-sensational-ending,"“John Wick: Chapter 4” is by far the best of the four films starring Keanu Reeves as the eponymous hit man, the first of the cycle that I’d recommend—albeit with an asterisk. The new film (which opens Friday) has many of the same problems as its predecessors; although these problems are interesting, they’re far more fun to contemplate in the rearview mirror of thought than in the real-time forward motion of viewing. But something happens, fairly late in the game, that converts the film’s merely technical displays of bloody murder into something suspenseful and romantic, if no less silly. The details are too good to give away, but there’s no harm and much pleasure in considering how the movie climbs, slowly but surely, to that light-headed summit.

One of the curiosities of the John Wick series is that, as an entirely original creation dependent on no prior properties, it has nonetheless given rise to an alluring and self-perpetuating mythology of its own. The premise of Wickworld is cleverly paranoiac, built around the tentacular connections between the crude underworld of contract killers and the shadowy overlords who keep them in action. That wicked authority is called the High Table; it dispenses orders to kill on pain of being killed, ratifies contracts for murder, and brokers the deals for bounty hunters. It commands John to kill, and it sets him up to be killed, but it also sets the tone of the movie. The High Table exemplifies a super-élite of secret societies with elaborate rites, deeply rooted aristocracies, a flaunting of mind-bending wealth, and the executive ruthlessness of a transnational shadow government that has the power to wreak havoc in public with impunity.

It also has the power of information—an enormous database on its registered killers (it apparently goes back centuries) and a terrifyingly comprehensive surveillance network that tracks the hunters and the hunted during their mortal maneuvers and discloses their whereabouts to devastating effect. Its agents hide in plain sight at, for instance, a hotel called the New York Continental, in Manhattan’s financial district. (Delmonico’s plays the role of the hotel.) Its stern manager, Winston (Ian McShane), is John’s handler, and is aided by his discerning and tight-lipped concierge (played by Lance Reddick, who died on March 17th). Another High Table agent on John’s team, the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), disguises his crew of spies as unhoused people in a shelter that he runs.

The High Table itself reveals its enduring traditions in the anachronistic equipment and furnishings of its central intelligence office (complete with card files, blackboards, rubber stamps, and switchboards). The venerable sect of hired killers can trace its lineage to a few authorized families, an aristocracy of blood (pun intended) that pulls the death dealers out of the grubby streets and endows their gruesome trade with a faux dignity. Their rigorous code of conduct dominates the movie’s, and the franchise’s, over-all tone and import: the intricate set of seemingly nonsensical rules plays the role of military discipline and order, but it also signifies, with a politicized wink at the rites and manners of high society, the implacable law of violence, which pretensions to refinement both embody and conceal.

“Chapter 4” takes off from the third installment, which concluded with John killing a High Table assassin at the New York Continental, with Winston’s help, and then teaming up with the Bowery King to fight against the High Table. At the start of “Chapter 4,” the King gets John suited up for battle, and the High Table takes devastating revenge against Winston for helping John—for starters, Winston is excommunicated, and the hotel is demolished. John heads to Morocco (the actual location is in Jordan) to dispatch a High Table overlord called the Elder (George Georgiou) and his minions, then goes to Osaka—to the Osaka Continental hotel, another High Table base—where he learns from its manager (Hiroyuki Sanada), who is his friend, what happened to Winston and the New York hotel. John vows to “kill them all.”

But the manager’s daughter, Akira (Rina Sawayama), who is also John’s friend, wishes he hadn’t come. There’s a contract on John for having killed High Table notables, and Akira is well aware that any place he sets foot is a target, including her father’s hotel. The assassins pursuing him there include a bounty hunter called Mr. Nobody (Shamier Anderson), who shows up with his beloved dog (a cheeky reference back to the premise of the first John Wick movie), and a nasty nebbish called Chidi (Marko Zaror). There’s also a remarkable blind assassin named Caine (Donnie Yen), who has been dispatched by a High Table potentate called the Marquis de Gramont (Bill Skarsgård), an effete and sadistic nobleman who has laid waste to the New York hotel and threatened to kill Caine’s daughter unless Caine kills John.

Yet John, for all his seething lust for revenge, is burdened—he is (to quote Charlie Chaplin’s parody of Hollywood violence in “A King in New York”) a killer with a soul. The very premise of “Chapter 4” evinces sequel fatigue. John Wick wants out. Reeves may well enjoy the role, but he convincingly portrays John’s weariness bordering on exasperation at the absurdity of living under the orders—and in the crosshairs—of the implacable High Table. Even though he shoots and stabs and even nunchucks his way out of the Osaka Continental, leaving a trail of bodies and blood behind, he can’t kill his way out of his indenture to the High Table or its pursuit of him.

What happens in Osaka doesn’t stay in Osaka, and neither does John. He flits to New York, where Winston advises him to duel the Marquis for his freedom, and then to Berlin, where, in a series of set pieces ranging from the sententious to the ridiculous, he has to do some more killing in order to be deemed duel-worthy. What results is a grisly form of multidimensional chess, in which John’s enemies also target one another in order to keep for themselves the privilege of killing John, and in which John allies himself, according to the demands of the moment, with one or another of his prospective killers.

Much of the movie’s delight is in its details, many of them gory (a little trick with a knife that the Marquis pulls on Mr. Nobody), others merely menacing (John’s surprise encounter on an eerily empty subway car), some location-dependent (a brutalist night club with a waterlogged dance floor), and some design-based (including a deck of cards made of glass, and a picturesque molten-gold method for branding flesh). Some of these flourishes nod toward the breezy suaveness in the face of danger that marks the best of the early 007 films. Here, though, the stakes are lowered beneath the absurdity line by the relentless mayhem, which is at once cartoonish and mostly humorless. That’s why, as Caine, Donnie Yen nearly steals the film. His humor is as sly as it is insolent (as when he eats a snack between killings), and his comedic gestures are as tiny and deft as his action maneuvers, which are so fast as to border on sleight of hand.

The comic relief is welcome, but it’s never so extreme or so self-aware as to threaten the grim earnestness and grotesque exaggerations of the violence. (With a little more self-awareness, the movie would have a place in the body-horror genre.) A recent report places John’s estimated body count throughout the series at four hundred and fifty. I’m not sure how many of them pile up in “Chapter 4,” but, assuming a rough average of a hundred and twelve, the killings are (as in the first three chapters) classist and trivializing. Only a few of John’s opponents have names, identities, and personalities; most are woefully anonymous, dispatched into oblivion by John with neither a name nor a story, with nothing but the misfortune to square off against him. They are mere fodder for John’s deathcraft, their heads vaporizing in pink mist inside their battle helmets, their bodies catching fire from his incendiary weaponry, their blood spurting fountain-like from slash wounds."
‘John Wick 4’ Sequel Series From Keanu Reeves & Chad Staples.,https://variety.com/2023/film/news/john-wick-4-keanu-reeves-alive-test-screening-disliked-1235663107/,"Is John Wick actually dead? It’s the question every Keanu Reeves fan was asking after “John Wick: Chapter 4” opened in March. The film ended with John’s presumable death after competing in a duel to free himself from the High Table. John gets shot in the third round of the duel and seemingly dies on the steps of the Basilica of Sacré Coeur while seeing a vision of his late wife, Helen. The film then cuts to a a final scene of Winston (Ian McShane) and the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne) visiting John’s gravestone.

In a new interview with Empire magazine, “John Wick: Chapter 4” director Chad Stahelski revealed for the first time that a more concrete ending to the action tentpole was filmed and tested. In this version of the film, there’s no question that John Wick survives the events of the duel.

“We had a different ending,” Stahelski said. “[The theatrical ending] was the ending Keanu and I wanted, but we shot a different ending. We shot an ending where you actually saw John Wick at the end of the movie. So it was very clear that he was still alive. The audiences we tested with absolutely preferred the ambiguous ending.”

Popular on Variety

The ambiguous ending of “John Wick: Chapter 4” has led many to wonder if Keanu Reeves will return for a fifth “John Wick” movie. A “John Wick 5” now seems like more of a possibility given Reeves and Stahelski flirted with outright confirming John’s survival at the end of “Chapter 4.”

“I don’t know, I guess I’m going to have to lean on ‘never say never,’” Reeves told Entertainment Weekly after “Chapter 4” opened about making another sequel. “I mean, I wouldn’t do a ‘John Wick’ film without [director] Chad Stahelski. We’d have to see what that looked like. For me, it feels really right that John Wick finds peace.”

John Wick’s potential death was the driving force behind Reeves’ interest in making “John Wick: Chapter 4” in the first place. As the actor said during a post-screening Q&A at the SXSW Film Festival, “When Chad and I were talking about it, the ‘why’ is death, and it was John Wick’s dead. For him to get his peace or his freedom in a way, that was the reason to make the movie. You gotta have the ‘why.’”

In an interview with IndieWire, franchise producer Basil Iwanyk said the finale of “John Wick: Chapter 4” is “an ambiguous ending.” He added about Wick’s death, “I’ll put it that way. We don’t have this answer.”

“There are two characters, really,” Iwanyk added. “There’s John Wick, and John, the civilian. The question for all of us is, OK, if the audience embraces the story and the box office works, is there another story to be told? I don’t know. But I don’t think we’ve boxed ourselves into any corner, whether he’s dead or alive, at the end of this movie.”

Surely Lionsgate doesn’t want to say goodbye to Reeves just yet. “John Wick: Chapter 4” broke franchise records with its huge $73.5 million opening and pushed the franchise passed the $1 billion mark at the worldwide box office. Whether or not a fifth movies come to fruition, the “John Wick” franchise will continue in 2024 with the Ana de Armas-starring spinoff “Ballerina,” which features Reeves’ assassin in a supporting role."
‘John Wick 4’ Sequel Series From Keanu Reeves & Chad Staples.,https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/john-wick-chapter-4-sets-up-multiple-spinoffs/,"Whatever the case, John Wick may be dead, but there are already two major spinoffs incoming, and one of them, Ballerina, will even feature Keanu Reeves back as Wick. No, you didn’t miss a mid-credits scene of zombie-Wick’s hand punching through the dirt of his burial ground; the spinoff takes place between chapters 3 and 4. And speaking of post-credit scenes, I hope you stuck around until the very end of John Wick: Chapter 4, because there was a hint at another spinoff potentially to come.

In fact, John Wick 4 does a fine job of setting up multiple spinoffs while concluding Wick’s own story with action-packed panache. Let’s look at what’s already been confirmed to be coming to cinemas (and the small-screen) soon, and then speculate about potential paths the series could walk.

Ballerina

A movie that’s already confirmed: Ballerina picks up with a ballet dancer named Rooney, who was briefly spotted in Chapter 3 – Parabellum during a scene in which Wick visits The Director, played by Anjelica Huston, in Russia. Rooney was originally portrayed by actual dancer Unity Phelan, though she’s been replaced by No Time To Die’s Ana de Armas in the spinoff.

The spinoff, which has no publicly projected release date, will see Rooney take revenge on those who murdered her family, and thanks to taking place before the events of John Wick: Chapter 4, will feature cameos from both Keanu Reeves and Ian McShane’s Continental Hotel manager Winston (presumably not at the same time as they are still on unfriendly terms at this point in the timeline after Winston shot Wick at the end of Chapter 3).

There was one minor nod to Ballerina in Chapter 4; the Marquis is seen watching a ballet dancer. It’s brief and may have nothing to do with Ballerina, but it’s a pointed moment and could come into play in the spinoff, which will be directed by Len Wiseman, who helmed the first two Underworld movies.

The Continental

Another confirmed spinoff, The Continental is a limited series that focuses on the rise of Winston and how he came to manage the eponymous Continental Hotel. As this one’s another prequel, McShane has been replaced by The Purge’s Colin Woodell, and the most notable casting is Mel Gibson as a character known as Cormac."
‘John Wick 4’ Sequel Series From Keanu Reeves & Chad Staples.,https://people.com/movies/keanu-reeves-director-chad-stahelski-giving-john-wick-a-rest-after-new-sequel/,"Fans of John Wick may have bad news coming their way.

Chad Stahelski — former stunt double for Keanu Reeves and current director of the fourth installment in the franchise, John Wick: Chapter 4 — revealed that the series might be coming to an end after the release of the new movie.

""In our minds, Keanu and I are done for the moment. We're going to give John Wick a rest,"" Stahelski, 54, told The Hollywood Reporter in a new interview published Tuesday. ""I'm sure the studio has a plan. If everyone loves it and it goes kooky, then we'll take a quiet minute.""

The filmmaker added that after the press tour ends in Japan, as he mentioned it often does, he and Reeves, 58, will sit down and discuss the next possible step for the franchise — which might mean ending it for good.

""Keanu and I will take the long trip to Tokyo, we'll sit in the Imperial Hotel Scotch Bar and go, 'What do you think?' "" Stahelski said. ""We'll have a couple 20-year-old whiskies and write some ideas on napkins. If those ideas stick, maybe we'll make a movie.""

When reflecting on the franchise's roots, Stahelski admits that banking an entire budget and film on the killing of a puppy — the instigator of vengeful violence for Reeves' John Wick in the series' first movie — was a big risk.

He explained that the producers and directors risked ""credits cards, a house mortgage"" and more on the film, only to create the ultimate sin: killing an innocent pet.

""Killing the puppy was written out as many times as it was written back in,"" Stahelski revealed. ""Ultimately, it's mythological. We had to go so overboard, so extreme to push it to let you know that it was absolutely symbolic.""

He added, ""We're not trying to hold the realism. We want the viewers to know we're having a laugh. But you don't even know how much [co-producer David Leitch] and I stressed about that … I thought we would never come back from it.""

Luckily for Stahelski and his colleagues, they not only came back from it, but also doubled the movies' gross with each installment.

While the curtain may fall for the last time for John Wick in his own original series, Reeves will make an appearance in the spinoff Ballerina starring Ana de Armas as Rooney, a dancer-turned-assassin.

Though no release date has been announced for the film, de Armas, 34, shared in January that the movie had been filming in Prague for four months.

""We still have one more month to go, and I'm in pain,"" she told Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon. ""My body, my back, everything hurts. I'm sore, I'm bruised.""

John Wick: Chapter 4 is in theaters March 24."

The Associated Press

NEW YORK – ""John Wick: Chapter 4,"" the fourth installment in the Keanu Reeves assassin series, debuted with a franchise-best $73.5 million at the box office, according to studio estimates Sunday.

The film, starring Reeves as the reluctant-but-not-that-reluctant killer John Wick, exceeded both expectations and previous opening weekends in the R-rated franchise. Since first launching in 2014 with ""John Wick"" ($14 million on its opening weekend), the Chad Stahelski-directed series has steadily grown as a ticket-seller with each sequel. The 2017 follow-up opened with $30.4 million, and the 2019 third chapter, ""Parabellum,"" debuted with $56.8 million.

But ""Chapter 4,"" running two hours and 49 minutes and costing at least $100 million to produce, is the biggest film yet in the once-lean action series. Critics also said it was a franchise high point, scoring 95% fresh reviews on Rotten Tomatoes.

Though ""John Wick"" has been bigger at the box office with each new release – an enviable and rare trajectory among Hollywood franchises – ""Chapter 4"" brings some finality to Reeves' character. The actor hasn't entirely dismissed continuing the series, telling interviewers ""never say never."" Regardless, the franchise is set to keep humming. A spinoff titled ""Ballerina"" starring Ana de Armas and co-starring Reeves has already been shot.

The release of ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" was also bittersweet. Lance Reddick, who plays Charon, the Continental Hotel concierge in the films, died unexpectedly at age 60 a week before the film's release.

The success of ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" adds to a strong start in 2023 for Hollywood. After ticket sales rebounded to about 67% of pre-pandemic levels last year, the release lineup is steadier and more packed this year.

But there have been some exceptions. After its disappointing $30.5 million debut last weekend, ""Shazam! Fury of the Gods"" slumped to second place with $9.7 million in its second weekend. The superhero sequel dropped steeply, tumbling 68% from its launch.

Rounding out the rest of the top five: Horror sequel ""Scream VI"" (No. 3 with $8.4 million), the Michael B. Jordan boxing drama ""Creed III"" (No. 4, $8.37 million) and Adam Driver dinosaur adventure ""65"" (No. 5 with $3.3 million).

Final numbers are expected Monday.

‘John Wick 4’ Sequel Series From Keanu Reeves & Chad Staples.,https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/john-wick-chapter-4-review-another-stellar-keanu-reeves-sequel,"John Wick: Chapter 4 borders on being too much of a good thing—both in the sense that it’s the fourth installment of a series that could have easily ended after its first, and with regards to its gargantuan 169-minute runtime. Fortunately, more turns out to be just about right in this case, with the film offering up such an onslaught of brutal, breakneck action that it’s easy to forgive its less compelling narrative excesses. Designed as a culmination as much as a continuation, it may not be consistent enough to rank as the franchise’s finest, but when it gets going, it cooks with gas.

[Spoilers invariably follow]

Whereas John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum opened with a breathless bang from which it never fully recovered, director Chad Stahelski’s latest (which premiered Monday at SXSW and is in theaters March 24) takes its time kicking into explosive gear. Thought to be dead thanks to Continental manager Winston (Ian McShane) shooting him off the patio of a NYC skyscraper, Wick (Keanu Reeves) is introduced hiding out with the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), who’s nursed him back to health so that he might make a grand return.

That he does, in the desert on horseback, shooting down three riders before confronting the newest Elder (George Georgiou), a mysterious figure who stands above the High Table that governs the world’s assassin clans. When the Elder refuses to forgive Wick his trespasses—namely, his John Wick: Chapter 2 murder of High Table bigwig Santino (Riccardo Scamarcio)—Wick unceremoniously takes his life.

This execution causes considerable trouble for Winston, who’s visited by the Marquis de Gramont (Bill Skarsgård), a dapper High Table member who—as punishment for Winston failing to kill Wick—takes a figurative pound of flesh from the manager before excommunicating him and detonating the Continental. This turns Winston back into a Wick ally, and it’s followed by Gramont hiring blind professional killer Caine (Donnie Yen) to kill Reeves’ famed assassin.

Caine has no interest in this gig (in part because he’s old friends with Wick), but in order to protect his innocent violinist daughter from Gramont, he accepts the assignment. Almost immediately, he’s found his target in Osaka, where Wick has taken refuge with another long-standing pal, Shimazu (Hiroyuki Sanada), who risks life and limb—despite his daughter Akira’s (Rina Sawayama) protestations—to help fend off an invading High Table battalion.

Wick’s pitstop in Japan is followed by trips to other global locales, including Germany and Paris, where he’s destined to face off against Gramont at Sacré-Coeur—merely the final church that he visits along his blood-soaked journey. Initially determined to slay the entire High Table, Wick instead takes Winston’s advice and opts for another route to freedom: challenging Gramont to an old-school High Table-sanctioned duel, which requires that Wick first get back in the good graces of his Ruska Roma family.

This deus ex machina is a bit absurd, if in keeping with the saga’s obsession with portentous rituals, rigid moral codes, gilded markers and crests, and other assorted world-building details, all of which have become so prevalent that they flirt with the ludicrous. Still, they add an extra layer of over-the-top severity and enormity to a venture predicated on insane immoderation.

Wick’s skirmishes in John Wick: Chapter 4 are progressively more elaborate and awe-inspiring, beginning with a nunchucks-enhanced throwdown against adversaries sporting various forms of armor (including designer suits) and peaking with a monumentally lengthy gauntlet from the circular roadway around the Arc de Triomphe to the steps leading up to Sacré-Coeur.

These and other sequences go on so long, and are filled with so much blistering hand-to-hand, blade-to-blade, and firearm and vehicular combat that the blitzkrieg of ferocious movement and mangled bodies becomes hypnotic. Contributing to that dazed-and-confused atmosphere is the film’s sterling set design, with Wick and his foes battling in color-coded environments (a neon light-drenched space decorated with Japanese artwork on glass panels; a posh, rhythmic rave marked by artificial waterfalls) that render the mayhem in quasi-abstract terms.

Stahelski and cinematographer Dan Laustsen put a premium on glossy surfaces, silhouetted figures and glistening panoramas of international hotpots—an approach that’s in tune with the series’ comingling of beautiful style and vicious carnage, and is highlighted by a prolonged video game-ish aerial-view showstopper. Shay Hatten and Michael Finch’s script isn’t nearly as sharp, yet it provides enough context to keep Wick moving from one perilous encounter to another, as well as shrewdly reduces the protagonist to a ronin-by-way-of-gunslinger of few words.

Letting his stares and homicidal skills do the talking for him, Reeves exudes typically fearsome gravity, purpose and weariness. Though he can more than hold his own, he’s greatly assisted in this sequel by Hong Kong legend Yen, who—doing his best Zatoichi routine—proves an enlivening addition, whether cracking jokes, fuming solemnly, or demonstrating his own amazing capacity for lethality, during which he resembles a cross between a poised samurai and a drunken master.

While Skarsgård’s Gramont is an arrogant upper-cruster who likes to hold court in the Louvre and the Paris Opera House, he’s more of a functional than unique villain, and Shamier Anderson’s Mr. Nobody, an enigmatic tracker with a dog that likes to attack opponents’ crotches, feels like a bland rehash of Halle Berry’s Sofia. John Wick: Chapter 4 is less about novelty than immensity, and there are times when it suffers for that minor sin; as Wick performs headshot after headshot, the film can become a tad routine. Stahelski, however, ups the ante—in terms of scale and stakes—to delirious effect, such that somber conversations about what Wick might do should he liberate himself from the High Table, what kind of man he is, and the epitaph he wants for his tombstone come to resonate as more than mere filler.

The body count is astronomical in John Wick: Chapter 4, yet Stahelski still prioritizes his personality-rich cast, including Scott Adkins (under mounds of latex) as a heavyset German Table titan who invites Wick, Caine and Nobody to play a deadly game, and Clancy Brown as the Harbinger, a High Table muckety-muck who’s asked to arrange and oversee Gramont and Wick’s climactic showdown (partially in Latin!). By film’s conclusion, Wick may not view himself as a killer at heart, but his fourth adventure—like those that preceded it—thrillingly and savagely slays its modern action competition.

‘John Wick 4’ Sequel Series From Keanu Reeves & Chad Staples.,https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/23/entertainment/john-wick-4-review/index.html,"CNN —

Inflation comes in many forms, including the running-time bloat that can afflict sequels. Hence the economical 90-some-odd minutes of “John Wick” becomes 2 hours and 49 minutes in “John Wick: Chapter 4,” a more-is-less epic that showcases the dazzling stunt work for which the franchise is known while piling on the action to near-exhausting extremes.

The film does carry an additional degree of emotional resonance, but that’s due to what happened off the screen, not on it, with the unexpected death of co-star Lance Reddick. Although Reddick occupies a smallish role, there’s a sobering note to his appearance.

Beyond that, the additional length is, charitably, devoted to presenting as much inventive mayhem as possible, with Keanu Reeves’ taciturn hitman seeking to extricate himself from his ties to the shadowy organization known as The High Table by, as usual, killing everyone, carving a path toward the sneering leader (Bill Skarsgård) who has put a sizable bounty on his head.

The film does take a step up in class opponent-wise by casting Donnie Yen as Caine, an old friend and associate of Wick’s grudgingly tasked with doing him in and every bit as skilled in the art of killing, and then killing some more. Shamier Anderson also joins the fray as a mysterious mercenary, accompanied by his equally deadly dog, whose motivations remain as hard to penetrate as Wick’s Kevlar suits.

Keanu Reeves stars in ""John Wick: Chapter 4."" from Lionsgate/YouTube

Director Chad Stahelski mines humor from Caine’s reluctance and the over-the-top nature of the carnage, dragging out the violent sequences so long as to wear down resistance. The film again benefits from the quality of actors in the supporting roles, particularly Ian McShane’s world-weary Winston, who as always seems to steal every scene in which he appears.

The problem is that with such a large canvas and so many elaborate action pieces – including an extended fight across the heavily trafficked streets of Paris – Wick can’t help repeating his signature fighting moves over and over and over again (punch, shoot, repeat), until the effect becomes more numbing than thrilling.

The mere fact that the franchise has reached the “Chapter 4” stage underscores the equity associated with the name and Reeves’ affiliation with this sort of muscular vehicle, so heavily tilted toward action that it’s a good thing the star isn’t getting paid by the word.

At one point, Caine prefaces a skirmish with Wick by saying, “Let’s get this s**t over with,” which draws chuckles in the moment.

By the time “Chapter 4” finally closes its pages, though, the line echoes in a way that feels somewhat uncomfortably more serious and literal than intended.

The franchise, which stars Keanu Reeves as a vengeful assassin fighting for his life in the criminal underworld, left fans in shock with a very surprising ending - but what was it all about? Here's the ending explained and warning, there are major spoilers from here…

How did John Wick 4 end?

In the conclusion of John Wick: Chapter 4, John saved the day by requesting a duel with the villainous member of The Table, Marquis Vincent de Gramont, in exchange for his freedom of obligations from the order. In a duel - complete with duelling pistols - against the Marquis’ champion, Caine, John is badly wounded from the third gunshot.

While the Marquis stepped in to finish the job, he hadn’t realised that John had not yet fired his bullet - and he instead shoots and kills the Marquis. As such, Caine and John are released from their obligations, while it is agreed that Winston will have his hotel reinstated.

However, it appears that the duel ultimately kills John, who asks Winston to ""bring him home"". After thinking about his late wife, Helen, he keels over and apparently dies, with the next scene seeing Winston and the Bowery King at his grave.

While the movie heavily insinuates that John died in the final moments of the movie, fans are hoping that he could have faked his own death. However, the movie appears to confirm that the character was indeed killed off, particularly when he didn’t appear in the post-credits scene.

‘John Wick 4’ Sequel Series From Keanu Reeves & Chad Staples.,https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/john-wick-chapter-4-ending-explained-1234822562/,"[Editor’s note: Spoilers ahead for “John Wick: Chapter 4.”]

John Wick has been through a lot in nine years. The sullen hitman, played by Keanu Reeves, tried to retire from the profession back in the first movie and mourn his late wife, only to get dragged back into action in search of vengeance for his dead dog. From there, John just can’t catch a break. He’s forced back into service for the sequel, which ends with a contract on his head by the High Table, and decides to take the whole hitman enterprise down by the end of chapter three.

In the fourth entry, out this weekend, the renegade assassin closes in on his target, setting his sights on High Table boss Marquis Vincent de Gramont (Bill Skarsgård) even as the marquis hopes to take John down first.

Per usual with the “John Wick” movies, the stakes of the story are mostly just a giant MacGuffin for John to shoot, punch, and kick his way through highly stylized environments, surviving many impossible ordeals along the way. This time, John somehow manages to make through some pretty gnarly falls, smashing through glass and, in one of the movie’s most amusing slapstick moments, tumbling down seemingly infinite flights of stairs, yet he still manages to get up and keeping fighting his way forward.

Until the ending, that is, where the future of the entire series suddenly becomes harder to figure out.

The final act of “John Wick: Chapter 4” finds John agreeing to a sunrise duel with the Marquis, who nominates blind killer Caine (Donnie Yen) to take his place. After Caine hits John with a bullet that knocks him down and John appears to miss his target, the Marquis takes the gun from Caine in an effort to deliver the mortal shot. But it turns out that John didn’t actually fire his gun, and uses his final bullet to kill the Marquis, effectively destroying the High Table and releasing John from the bounty on his head.

A bloody John staggers to the staircase, sits down, and remembers his late wife before falling over. In the final scene, John’s pals Winston (Ian McShane) and the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne) are in a cemetery regarding John’s tombstone and its place next to his wife. They walk away, the camera drifts into the trees, and we fade to black.

So that’s it, right? John’s dead, finally at peace with the love of his life? Not so fast.

“It’s an ambiguous ending,” producer Basil Iwanyck, who produced all four “John Wick” movies, told IndieWire. “I’ll put it that way. We don’t have this answer.”

Iwanyck cited another interview where director Chad Stahelski said that if the new movie were a hit, he would sit down with Reeves in Japan over a glass of whiskey and discuss how they might follow up the story with another chapter. However that hypothetical discussion plays out, it’s not hard to imagine a scenario in which John essentially faked his death to start his life anew once more.

“There are two characters, really,” Iwanyck said. “There’s John Wick, and John, the civilian. The question for all of us is, OK, if the audience embraces the story and the box office works, is there another story to be told? I don’t know. But I don’t think we’ve boxed ourselves into any corner, whether he’s dead or alive, at the end of this movie.”

With the High Table in ruins, one might imagine John enlisted to oversee the creation of a new network for contract killers. There are also some other loose ends to sort out, as a brief mid-credits sequence shows. While John remains friendly with Caine, the martial arts killer did murder Koji (Hiroyuki Sanada), the manager of the Osaka Continental Hotel, after he tries to protect John. That leaves Koji’s daughter Akira (Rina Sawayama) out for revenge. In the mid-credits scene, Akira pulls out a blade and approaches Caine in a crowd as he walks toward his own daughter with flowers. It’s unclear how the moment plays out from there. Does Akira, who blames John for her father’s death, figure out that he fakes his death and track him down as well?

Wherever this all leads, Iwanyck said the team will need to take a breather before they get it sorted. “After every ‘John Wick’ movie, everyone is so wiped out,” he said. “These are hard movies to pull off, as you can imagine, and Keanu’s always like, ‘Never again.’ We’ve done it all. We’re all friends working together almost nonstop, and we’ve gone through so many things.”

That’s another reason to suspect Reeves will find a way to return for a fifth installment. “Just on a personal level, we can’t break up the band yet,” Iwanyck said. “If the movie does really well, and people love it, and if there’s a germ of idea, we’ll entertain it. We’re so far away from that. I’m not saying there will be a sequel by any stretch, but if there is a world where we can find a story, we’ll explore that.”

Regardless of what happens there, the “John Wick” universe has a lot in store for future. The Ana de Armas spin-off “Ballerina” is currently in post-production, though a release date has yet to be announced, and Reeves has a supporting role. There’s the prequel TV series “The Continental,” which moved from Starz to Peacock last year and is expected to premiere on the streaming service later this year. The series, directed by Albert Hughes (“The Book of Eli”) takes place in 1970s New York.

“On a franchise like ‘John Wick’ that’s never slowed down to explain who people are, it’s not only entertaining but really satisfying if you’re a fan,” Iwanyck said. “We don’t want to sell out by any stretch.”

“John Wick: Chapter 4” is now in theaters."
‘John Wick 4’ Sequel Series From Keanu Reeves & Chad Staples.,https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/john-wick-chapter-4-review-keanu-reeves/,"Chad Stahelski’s original John Wick thrives on simplicity. Its efficient narrative whisks us along from set piece to set piece, barely stopping to take a breath for a moment of plot and character development. Its elemental setup—bad dudes kill the wrong man’s dog, full stop—demands only that an onslaught of increasingly skilled villains be served up for legendary hitman John Wick (Keanu Reeves) to knock down and finish off with a headshot.

With each subsequent John Wick film, though, Stahelski and company have further expanded the world in which the series is set, exploring the inner workings of the council of crime lords known as the High Table and the various rules and consequences that regulate behavior in specific settings and situations. They’ve continued to add new fetishistic objects as signifiers of broad ideas—honor, loyalty, professionalism, you name it—as well as flashier sets. And in this gradual development and expansion of the Wickaverse, the filmmakers seem to have lost the thread of what makes the first and, at times, second film in the series work so well.

John Wick: Chapter 4 rounds out at 169 minutes, more than an hour longer than the first film. While this may suggest a more expansive raison d’être, the filmmakers have merely surrounded the epic set pieces for which the series is known with skirmishes between new characters that feel like filler, as well as lengthy, pompous conversations about friendship, death, honor, and how the High Table should be run. Chapter 4 does see martial arts legends Donnie Yen and Scott Adkins fighting John Wick for the first time—and the pair are involved in two of the three best fight scenes—but it also spends an inordinate amount of time spinning out Wick’s backstory and further building out the already needlessly convoluted mythology of the series.

As for the set pieces that fans of the series have come to expect, they certainly aren’t in short supply. But while some of them are fresh, particularly a prolonged showdown outside the Sacré-Coeur in Paris, there are a couple of sequences that feel like conspicuous rehashes of similar moments from the earlier John Wick films. There’s yet another neon-drenched art installation in which Wick busts up more baddies and another neon-drenched club scene that sees, well, more of the same. Meanwhile, the addition of another dog-loving assassin, Mr. Nobody (Shamier Anderson), is little more than a callback to the first film in the series.

Save for the fight on the steps up to the Sacré-Coeur, whatever could be called unique here can be traced not to the expectedly innovative choreography, but to the slew of new characters who exist only to further develop the lore of the series. Indeed, Chapter 4 is so replete with talk of rules of excommunication and reinstatement, as well as plans to condemn buildings, that it often feels like fan fiction geared toward anyone obsessed with the nuts and bolts of an organization and world that were never designed to be so complicated or deeply scrutinized.

Ironically, Chapter 4 is as much a film of its time as John Wick was a rejoinder to the Hollywood of its time. Back in 2014, Stahelski’s stripped-down film, as it followed its all-action-no-talk hero’s lurid killing spree, felt like an antidote to so many Hollywood action films that, to this day, are needlessly bloated, convoluted, and packed to the gills with mediocre CGI.

While Stahelski and Reeves have been coy about announcing whether a fifth John Wick film will happen, this one’s obsession with broadening the series mythology sets the terms of that inevitability. That a TV prequel all about the Continental is set to land on Peacock later this year only demonstrates that the series is doomed to further Marvelization, as the pointless minutiae that served merely as background details in the earlier films is now taking center stage alongside the series’s penchant for stylish, over-the-top vengeance and competing for our attention.

‘John Wick 4’ Sequel Series From Keanu Reeves & Chad Staples.,https://www.btlnews.com/film-reviews/john-wick-chapter-4-review-keanu-reeves/,"To boost their middling viewership, the Oscars may want to introduce Best Original Headshot as a new category. The nominees for the past few months alone would include the sanguinary Violent Night, J-Lo’s Shotgun Wedding, and without question, Keanu Reeves‘ latest martial arts obscenity, the much-anticipated sequel John Wick: Chapter 4.

It seems as if filmmakers are catering to an incessant audience desire for gore that centers around bullets, exploding brains, and buckets of blood worthy of the Grand Guignol. So many such sequences dominate this needlessly long and convoluted film that it would undoubtedly be crowned the ultimate Oscar winner in this imaginary contest. But no amount of gold plating could obscure what is otherwise yet another pointless story about a hero who refuses to die and proves cinematically impossible to kill.

Reeves returns as the black-clad title character, a mercenary assassin trained by a mysterious cabal known as the High Table. Like Jason Bourne and many others before him, Wick seeks to extricate himself from a life of crime and malfeasance, only to find himself pulled into an international web of senseless, endless violence. Picking up where the last fan-devoured entry, John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum, left off in 2019, Wick finds himself with an eight-figure bounty on his head, running to escape (read: kill) an endless list of goons in his own pursuit of a man whose death could ensure the freedom for which he has long yearned.

Director Chad Stahelski and his writers, Shay Hatten and Michael Finch, know full well that audiences are blood-lusting after this sequel and show up to watch Wick perforate skulls with his band of deadly accomplices. These include the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), a disgraced assassin working with the city’s underbelly to exact revenge on the High Table by sponsoring Wick along with Winston (Ian McShane), the manager of the Continental Hotel in New York, and its concierge, Charon (Lance Reddick), whose only purpose, as it turns out, is to help keep Wick alive for the bloated proceedings.

Wick also does battle with “The Blind Man” (Donnie Yen), a highly-effective assassin who mows down foes despite being unable to see, and the Marquis (Bill Skarsgard), a high-ranking Table member with a preposterous French accent, whose death Wick can leverage into freedom. The filmmakers make the incredibly solipsistic decision to craft a needlessly convoluted plot that will occupy three hours of your time and require Wick to jump through an endless array of video game-like hoops before getting to the ultimate boss in the last level. 90 minutes would have sufficed — unless the point, of course, was to fulfill some purpose around expiating the target audience’s anger with a constant parade of violence.

To be fair to this franchise’s fandom, the original John Wick became a sort of instant cult hit because the comeback by ’90s action star Reeves was both improbable but also nostalgically welcome 15 years after The Matrix. It was also based on the sort of ludicrous premise that the aging Reeves could play this incredibly nimble assassin, one who can deflect bullets with his cufflinks and be thrown down 200+ concrete stairs suffering nary a scratch. Audiences, in other words, created a sort of inside joke about the preposterous nature of the entire premise behind these films.

But, the joke is on them this time around, as John Wick: Chapter 4 is sloppy and almost entirely senseless from the beginning. In a pivotal sequence, a snarling, supposedly German crime boss (martial arts expert Scott Adkins) cheats at a game of five-card draw by turning over a five-of-a-kind, a hand that does not exist in poker. In another pivotal plot point, the High Table lays out a set of supposed time-honored rules about hand-to-hand combat and the importance of respecting protocol and honesty, only to see the principal villain engage in a concerted campaign to cheat this code of conduct. And, in the most infuriating betrayal of all, a supposedly high-stakes climatic denouement is anything but, as yet another story sacrifices consequences at the altar of corporate Hollywood greed.

Meanwhile, what had been some of the franchise’s best attributes — cool cinematography, crisp editing, and stunning fight sequences — are also mostly absent from these proceedings. In their place are more ludicrous sequences, including an extended one in a Berlin nightclub where the ciphers bop and bob their bodies like disco zombies while Wick shoots, maims, and kills all around them. If it was meant to be psychedelic or even neo-noir, it was anything but. Having the dancing drones escape the club in arm-waving panic after more than 30 minutes of shootings is the opposite of inspiring. Thus, neither the talent of Cinematographer Dan Laustsen nor Editor Nathan Orloff can mitigate any of this damage.

Bad habits die hard, and never more so than in Hollywood, which is currently starved for creativity, attention, and profit. Audiences will show up in droves to John Wick: Chapter 4, all but ensuring that the hero and his past-its-prime franchise will live to see another day and that any semblance of cinematic merit will continue to die the painful, head-exploding death of most of Wick’s victims.

"LAPD releases images of suspects, vehicle in killing of 'General Hospital' actor Johnny.",https://people.com/johnny-wactor-suspects-photos-general-hospital-star-killed-8690351,"The Los Angeles Police Department released photos of the suspects in the killing of General Hospital actor Johnny Wactor.

The still images, taken from video footage, were released Sunday, Aug. 4, also include photos of the stolen black Infiniti Q50 sedan police say the suspects were driving.

Wactor, 37, was fatally shot on Saturday, May 25, when he came upon armed car thieves who were attempting to steal his vehicle’s catalytic converter, police have said.

Authorities said the suspect that shot Wactor ""has a tattoo above the left eye and on the right cheek,"" according to the LAPD press release.

Wactor’s brother Grant Wactor previously told PEOPLE that his brother, who was working as a bartender, and a female co-worker were walking to their vehicles after their bar shift in downtown Los Angeles around 3:25 a.m. when the shooting happened.

Grant said the colleagues were approaching their vehicles when his brother noticed his car “was jacked up or lifted in some way. He thought he was being towed.”

Grant told PEOPLE his brother soon realized “they were definitely not tow truck people.""

Grant said Wactor put his body in front of his female colleague and had put his hands up when he was shot.

“He did not confront them,” Grant said. “He did not try to stop them. He was just trying to diffuse the situation by stepping back.”

After the shooting, the men fled the scene in the stolen vehicle, police have said.

Wactor was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced deceased.

The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner had determined that Wactor died from a gunshot wound to the chest. His manner of death is listed as a homicide.

""I still cry every morning in my devotions,"" she said. ""I have his picture in front of me, like I talk to God, tell him what I want. Those days are still here. I'm still doing that.""

Wactor started doing theater in elementary school and moved to Los Angeles after he graduated from college around 2007 to pursue his acting dream.

“He was always very self-motivated, self-driven, a very hard worker,"" Grant says. ""He always wanted to do more, to do better. That’s what I think made him happy. He liked making people laugh, making people smile. Every fan that he had, he loved doing it for them and making them happy.""

The two images were released by the Los Angeles Police Department on Sunday in a community alert seeking help in identifying the suspects.

One image shows the vehicle, described as a stolen 2018 black Infiniti Q50 with a tan interior. The other image shows three individuals outside the car.

The alert states that Wactor was shot in the chest by “suspect 1,” who has tattoos above the left eye and on the right cheek.

The actor was shot around 3:20 a.m. on May 25.

His mother, Scarlett Wactor, told ABC 7 that her 37-year-old son had left work at a rooftop bar with a coworker when he saw someone at his car and thought it was being towed. A mask-wearing suspect opened fire, his mother said. The trio fled in the Infiniti.

Police said the pair encountered a crew of people trying steal the catalytic converter from Wactor's car, and one of them shot Wactor as he approached.

The suspects had Wactor's vehicle raised up with a floor jack and were in the process of stealing the catalytic converter, police said, adding that Wactor was shot by one of the individuals without provocation.

Police said the three suspects drove away from the scene in a stolen 2018 black, four-door Infiniti Q50 with tan-colored interior. The suspects, all wearing dark clothing, drove away from the scene northbound on Hope Street. One of the suspects had a tattoo above the left eye and on the right cheek, police said.

Paramedics rushed Wactor to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Catalytic converters are popular targets for thieves because they are rich in precious metals that can be resold.

DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- The Los Angeles Police Department on Sunday released photos of the suspects and vehicle connected to the killing of ""General Hospital"" actor Johnny Wactor in downtown Los Angeles.

Wactor, 37, was fatally shot early in the morning on May 25 while walking with a coworker toward his parked car near Hope Street and Pico Boulevard after finishing a bartending shift.

Police said the pair encountered a crew of people trying steal the catalytic converter from Wactor's car, and one of them shot Wactor as he approached.

Wactor was leaving work downtown when he encountered three men at his car. He thought he was being towed.

No arrests have been made since then.

The LAPD released images in an attempt to get the public's help to identify the suspects involved. The newly released images show a stolen black 2018 Infiniti Q50 sedan, which the suspects fled the scene in.

""I'm hoping the community is sick enough that somebody will step up and help,"" the actor's mother, Scarlett Wactor, told Eyewitness News.

Friends and family are surprised it took 10 weeks for the LAPD to release the images and they wonder if that means the investigation has stalled.

""Surprised mainly because I had the impression that the investigation was going extremely well to the point that perhaps there was going to be an imminent arrest,"" said Micah Parker, Wactor's friend.

Since then, little has been known about the three suspects. The suspect who police say shot Wactor in the chest is described as having a tattoo above the left eye and on the right cheek.

Paramedics rushed Wactor to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

""I still cry every morning in my devotions,"" Wactor's mother said. ""I have his picture in front of me, like I talk to God, tell him what I want. Those days are still here. I'm still doing that.""

Catalytic converters are popular targets for thieves because they are rich in precious metals that can be resold.

""Going through that together, I'm grateful that I was there for him and he was not alone,"" said Anita Joy. ""That's been the only peaceful thing for his mom and I when we walk.""

""Without provocation, the victim was shot by one of the individuals,"" the LAPD announced in a written statement. ""The three suspects involved were wearing all dark clothing and driving a dark-colored sedan. The suspects fled northbound on Hope St."" Wactor's brother, Grant Wactor, told the Los Angeles Times that his brother was walking a co-worker to her car after his shift when he noticed a group of men crowded around his own car, and he confronted them because he thought his vehicle was being towed.



In addition to the grainy images of three suspects, police on Monday released images of the allegedly stolen vehicle the suspects are believed to have used in their escape.

Police said the three suspects drove away from the scene in a stolen 2018 black, four-door Infiniti Q50 with tan-colored interior. The suspects, all wearing dark clothing, drove away from the scene northbound on Hope Street. One of the suspects had a tattoo above the left eye and on the right cheek, police said.

Paramedics rushed Wactor to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Catalytic converters are popular targets for thieves because they are rich in precious metals that can be resold. Wactor appeared on nearly 200 episodes of ""General Hospital"" from 2020-22. His other credits included ""Westworld,"" ""The OA,"" ""NCIS,"" ""Station 19,"" ""Criminal Minds"" and ""Hollywood Girl."""

The Los Angeles Police Department has released photos of three suspects wanted in connection with the murder of General Hospital star Johnny Wactor, as the killers remain at large over two months on from the shooting.

Wactor was shot dead on 25 May when he confronted three men who were trying to steal the catalytic converter on his car, police said.

New photos, released on Sunday, show the three suspects standing around a black four-door Infiniti Q50 sedan with a tan interior in a Los Angeles parking lot. The vehicle has been identified as stolen, the LAPD said.

The three men are all wearing dark and hooded clothing with police revealing that the suspect believed to have shot Wactor has a distinctive tattoo above his left eye and on his right cheek.

Following the shooting, the hooded men fled the scene in the stolen sedan.

Wactor had been working as a bartender in restaurant and lounge bar Level 8 on the night of his death.

He was walking his coworker Anita Joy to her car at around 3 am after their shift at the bar when they stumbled upon the three men.

Wactor, 37, initially believed his car was being towed and he confronted the suspects, Joy revealed.

When he confronted them, one of the men opened fire, shooting him in the chest.

He was taken to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead upon arrival.

Following his death, Joy took to Instagram to say that her “heart is shattered” with the loss of her “beautiful” friend of eight years.

Joy also called the man who shot Wactor a “coward” and demanded to see “these awful men brought to justice.”

Wactor’s ex-fiancée Tessa Farrell posted an emotional video on Instagram and TikTok back in May, pleading for help in identifying and catching his killers.

Through tears, Farrell addressed his killer directly: “If the person who did this, if you’re watching, I’m sorry, but you shot the wrong guy.”

The Hollywood star also asked for people to “be like Johnny and stand up and do what’s right”, as she hit out at the crime rates in California.

“Do you want better laws to reduce the escalating crime and theft rates in California?” she wrote.

“If you’d like to help raise awareness for stricter crime and theft laws in California, please use hashtag #justiceforjohnny.”

Wactor’s mother Scarlett has also previously spoken out about the loss of her “hero” son, telling NBC News’ Morgan Chesk in late May that she was “thankful” that he did not die alone.

Wactor’s former General Hospital co-stars also paid tribute to him following his death, hailing him as a “special person” who was “humble” and “caring”.

Emmy-nominated actor Kirsten Storms, who plays Maxie Jones on the show, wrote on Instagram that “Johnny was one of those rare ‘real individuals’ that you almost never come across.”

The official Instagram page for the tv show, which is the longest-running Hollywood serial, posted a statement saying: “The entire General Hospital family is heartbroken to hear of Johnny Wactor’s untimely passing. He was truly one of a kind and a pleasure to work with each and every day,” the post continued, “our thoughts and prayers go out to his loved ones during this difficult time.”

A march demanding justice for Wactor and a “safe city” took place on June 12, followed by a “Mile for Johnny” event on 29 June.

No arrests have been made in relation to Wactor’s murder."

He was with his coworker, Anita Joy, at the time, who took to Instagram following the shooting to share what happened.

She posted: “Everything happened in an instant, I've come to describe it as a glass of water that gets tipped over and you're scrambling to grab it and save it from spilling out completely, but it just runs through your fingertips and is gone.”

Joy added they “cautiously approached the men, questioning what they were doing, at first thinking the car was being towed. Wactor's co-worker shared he “kept his cool,” told the men it was his car, and asked them to leave.

“Johnny was between me and the man who shot him — as I heard the shot ring into the night, he forcefully tumbled back into my arms and as I grabbed for him, I shouted ‘Hunny you ok?!’ And he only responded ‘Nope! Shot!’”"

Wactor was shot and killed in May while he and a coworker were walking to his car after they were done working at a downtown Los Angeles bar.

The LAPD said they had come across a group of people who were trying to steal a catalytic converter from the actor’s car and one of the group shot him.

Wactor’s car had been lifted with a floor jack to gain access to the undercarriage, KTLA reported.

He was pronounced dead at an area hospital.

No arrests have been made, so the LAPD released the images in hopes that the public could identify the people or the car, a stolen black 2018 Infiniti Q50, that they drove away from the scene.

The photos are grainy and no additional information has been released, CNN reported

It’s been 10 weeks since Wactor was killed, and Wactor’s family and friends are surprised that it took this long to release the images.

“Surprised mainly because I had the impression that the investigation was going extremely well to the point that perhaps there was going to be an imminent arrest,” Micah Parker said, according to KABC.

Few details have been released, but the man who police said pulled the trigger has a tattoo above his left eye and on his right cheek.

Police said that catalytic converter thefts are common because they have precious metals that can be sold, KABC reported.

“Catalytic converter thefts are often seen as petty or victimless crime, not what happened to Johnny,” Councilman Kevin de León said, according to CNN. “This tragic incident underscores just how quickly such acts can escalate into deadly violence.”

"LAPD releases images of suspects, vehicle in killing of 'General Hospital' actor Johnny.",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-08-04/johnny-wactor-fatal-shooting-suspect-getaway-car-description,"Security images of the suspects in the May 25 shooting death of “General Hospital” actor Johnny Wactor in downtown Los Angeles were released Sunday by Los Angeles police.

Wactor, 37, was killed after confronting three men who jacked up his car on Hope Street near Pico Boulevard in order to steal its catalytic converter, authorities said. He had just finished a late night bartending shift at the nearby Level 8 bar when he was shot about 3:20 a.m.

Police said the man who shot him has a tattoo above his left eye and on the right cheek, according to a Community Alert Notification released Sunday on X. The getaway car was described as a stolen 2018, black, four-door Infiniti Q50 with a tan interior.

Police also released grainy security images of the three suspects and of the Q50 driving down the street. The suspects fled northbound on Hope Street after the shooting.

Police attempted to pull fingerprints from Wactor’s car and link the crime to any nearby catalytic converter thefts. The police are seeking the public’s help in solving the crime.

Wactor starred as Brando Corbin on “General Hospital” from 2020-22. He also had roles on shows including “Westworld,” “Criminal Minds” and “Station 19.”

Wactor was walking with co-worker Anita Joy, who had just finished a bartending shift with him, when he approached the men, thinking his car was being towed, according to an account of the shooting posted by Joy on Instagram.

After realizing that wasn’t the case, he asked the men to leave, with his hands held out open at his sides to indicate he wasn’t a threat. Nevertheless, he was then shot, she said, at close range. A security guard from the bar called 911, Joy said.

Thieves target catalytic converters because they contain precious metals including rhodium, palladium and platinum. They can sell for hundreds of dollars to auto parts suppliers or scrap yards, where they can be melted down and the valuable metals extracted.

Thefts of catalytic converters skyrocketed in California during the COVID-19 pandemic. That prompted new state laws that make it illegal for recyclers to buy the parts from anyone other than the vehicle’s legal owner or a licensed dealer. Penalties were increased for buyers who fail to certify that a catalytic converter wasn’t stolen.

The Los Angeles Police Department on Sunday released photos of three individuals suspected of being involved in the fatal shooting of former “General Hospital” actor Johnny Wactor in May.

The grainy photos released by LAPD on Sunday show three individuals wearing hooded sweatshirts, and police indicated the man who fired the weapon has a tattoo above his left eye and the right cheek.

The photos also show a black four-door Infiniti Q50 sedan with a tan interior. Authorities said the car was stolen.

Officials did not release any other details or updates in the case.

Wactor, 37, was shot as he left work at a downtown rooftop bar early on May 25, CNN previously reported.

His mother told CNN affiliate KABC that her son had been walking with one of his coworkers when he saw what he thought was someone working on a car.

LAPD told CNN at the time that three men were trying to steal a catalytic converter when the victim interrupted them. One of the suspects pulled out a gun and shot the victim before the men drove off in a vehicle, according to police.

During a news conference with city leaders and Wactor’s family and friends in June, Los Angeles City Councilman Kevin de León urged anyone with information to come forward.

“Catalytic converter thefts are often seen as petty or victimless crime, not what happened to Johnny,” de León said. “This tragic incident underscores just how quickly such acts can escalate into deadly violence.”

Similarly, Wactor’s friend and fellow actor Micah Parker called on the LAPD to not relent until the suspects are brought to justice.

“As a matter of faith, I am called to forgive, but you cannot escape the consequences of your actions here on Earth. You do not get to terrorize our streets, stealing and killing with impunity anymore,” Parker said.

Wactor starred in “General Hospital” as Brando Corbin from 2020 to 2022, according to IMDB. Other acting credits included “Criminal Minds” and “Siberia.”"

He and his co-worker Anita Joy had been walking to their cars after a bar shift when they interrupted three armed car thieves. The masked thieves had been trying to steal the catalytic converter from Johnny's vehicle and shot him when he approached.

The men involved in the shooting fled the scene and remain at large, months after the shooting. Johnny's colleague later took to Instagram to share his final moments and reveal his last words.

Anita explained how Johnny shielded her from the gunman, writing: ""Johnny was between me and the man who shot him - as I heard the shot ring into the night, he forcefully tumbled back into my arms and as I grabbed for him, I shouted, 'Hunny you ok?!' And he only responded, 'Nope! Shot!'""

Anita said they had just finished their shift at Level 8 in Downtown Los Angeles when Johnny walked her to her car. Anita said: ""He was killed senselessly by a coward who reacted without care of the gorgeous life he was taking.

""So I'm angry, I'm sad and I'm all of the feelings at once... but above all, I am here for Johnny's justice. My friend of 8 years went from laughing together, working side by side, leaving our bartending shift and walking to our cars, to him dying in my arms in the streets of DTLA in the dark hours of 3 a.m.""

Anita said ""everything happened in an instant"", explaining how they had ""cautiously approached the men, questioning what they were doing, at first thinking the car was being towed"". She added: ""Johnny kept his cool as he always did, simply stating that it was his car and for them to leave. Hands open to his sides in peace.""

Anita explained how her friend toppled ""onto the street"" and she pushed her legs under him to try and hold his body up while ""screaming for help and screaming at him to stay with me"". A security guard named Bryan, who also worked at the club, came by and called 911 before trying to perform CPR on Johnny. Anita tied her denim jacket around her friend to try and stop the bleeding but explained the gun shot had been ""too close range"" and ""too extreme of a wound for him to survive""."

ROBBERY GONE WRONG

Johnny Wactor was shot and killed in Los Angeles on May 25, 2024.

The actor, who starred in over 200 episodes of General Hospital, was leaving his bartending job in the early hours of the morning.

Along with a co-worker, Johnny walked to his car a few blocks away from the bar.

General Hospital actor Johnny Wactor, 37, ‘is shot and killed in theft gone wrong’ in downtown Los Angeles

He was parked on the 1200 block of Hope Street in downtown Los Angeles.

As he approached his vehicle, he noticed three men messing with his car.

The trio had raised his vehicle with a floor jack and were reportedly trying to steal his catalytic convertor.

Wactor's Career The actor from Charleston, South Carolina, starred in General Hospital between 2020 and 2022. His first appearance on the show was on January 30, 2020, as Brando Corbin, but he was written out two years later after his character was stabbed by an unknown killer. However, before playing Corbin, Wactor started his acting career in 2007 by starring in Army Wives. He also featured in NCIS, Criminal Minds, Station 19, The OA, and West World. In 2016, he landed a movie role in USS Indianapolis: Men Of Courage, starring Nicolas Cage. Wactor is set to feature in a new movie by Luca Perito called American Sognare, which is currently in post-production, according to IMDb.

Johnny did not attempt to confront the men or get in his car but was shot by one of the masked men before the group took off.

Paramedics were called to the scene immediately, and after being taken to a local hospital, Johnny was pronounced dead.

His coworker tearfully recalled the heartbreaking moment as she watched him die in her arms.

REST IN PEACE

Following Johnny's death, his ex-fiancée, Tessa Farrell, slammed his killers in a now-deleted emotional video.

""If the person who did this, if you're watching, I'm sorry, but you shot the wrong guy,"" she sobbed.

She also urged the greater Los Angeles community to help bring Johnny's murderers to justice.

""These criminals can't keep being on the street, and they can't keep being sent back and have no repercussions for their actions,"" she said in her video.

""It's not ok; this can't keep happening. So many lives are being lost, just us not being smart - we have to be smarter as a community,"" she added.

Johnny's former soap opera co-stars also paid their tributes to the actor, remembering him as a ""beautiful soul"" despite his senseless"" death.

In one post, fellow General Hospital star William deVry called it a ""senseless"" death.

""Honestly, words can't begin 2 express the sadness with which 2 convey my feelings towards losing another #GH Alum,"" he said in a post on X.

Sofia Mattsson, who played Wactor's wife in the drama series, also shared an Instagram post in his honor.

""Johnny was the absolute best. So genuine. So caring. Incredibly hard-working and humble,"" she wrote.

Even the show commented on Wactor's tragic death, saying he was ""one of a kind.""

""The entire General Hospital family is heartbroken to hear of Johnny Wactor's untimely passing,"" the post read.

""He was truly one of a kind and a pleasure to work with each and every day.

""Our thoughts and prayers go out to his loved ones during this difficult time.""

SEEKING JUSTICE

Months after Johnny's senseless murder, his family and friends continue to seek justice.

In June, those closest to Johnny urged elected officials not only to find Johnny's killers, but also to make the city of Los Angeles safer.

“Unfortunately, what happened to Johnny can, and is likely to, happen again,” the group wrote in a news release.

The group then cited a sobering statistic: there's a one in 119 chance of being a victim of a violent crime in LA.

“Johnny’s family and friends are urging local community leaders to explore legislative and municipal actions that will hopefully not only lead to breakthroughs in Johnny’s case, but that will also help make the city that Johnny chose to call home safer.

“This should be important to us all,"" they added.

Police said the pair encountered a crew of people trying steal the catalytic converter from Wactor’s car, and one of them shot Wactor as he approached.

The suspects had Wactor’s vehicle raised up with a floor jack and were in the process of stealing the catalytic converter, police said, adding that Wactor was shot by one of the individuals without provocation.

Police said the three suspects fled the scene in a stolen 2018 black, four-door Infiniti Q50 with tan-colored interior. The suspects, all wearing dark clothing, fled the scene northbound on Hope Street. One of the suspects had a tattoo above the left eye and on the right cheek, police said.

Paramedics rushed Wactor to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Catalytic converters are popular targets for thieves because they are rich in precious metals that can be resold.

Wactor, 37, was shot as he left work at a downtown rooftop bar early on May 25, CNN previously reported.

His mother told CNN affiliate KABC that her son had been walking with one of his coworkers when he saw what he thought was someone working on a car.

LAPD told CNN at the time that three men were trying to steal a catalytic converter when the victim interrupted them. One of the suspects pulled out a gun and shot the victim before the men drove off in a vehicle, according to police.

During a news conference with city leaders and Wactor's family and friends in June, Los Angeles City Councilman Kevin de León urged anyone with information to come forward.

""Catalytic converter thefts are often seen as petty or victimless crime, not what happened to Johnny,"" de León said. ""his tragic incident underscores just how quickly such acts can escalate into deadly violence."" Similarly, WWactor'sfriend and fellow actor Micah Parker called on the LAPD to not relent until the suspects are brought to justice.

""As a matter of faith, I am called to forgive, but you cannot escape the consequences of your actions here on Earth. You do not get to terrorize our streets, stealing and killing with impunity anymore,"" Parker said.

Wactor was leaving his shift as a bartender in downtown Los Angeles when he saw the men who had raised his car with a floor jack, witness statements later revealed, according to a report by KTLA 5.

One of the three men then shot the actor “without provocation” once they were confronted, police said. After he was shot, Wactor’s friend, Anita Joy, rushed to his side and held him in her arms.

“Everything happened in an instant,” Joy said. “I’ve come to describe it as a glass of water that gets tipped over and you’re scrambling to grab it and save it from spilling out completely but it just runs through your fingertips and is gone.”

Wactor was then transported to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. The murder suspects, meanwhile, had fled the scene.

In addition to playing Brando Corbin in 164 episodes of the popular soap opera General Hospital, Wactor has also appeared in other shows such as Westworld, and Criminal Minds.

In May, Grant, the actor’s brother, shared that Wactor initially believed his vehicle was being towed. Upon realizing the true situation, he instinctively shielded his co-worker by positioning her behind him.

“We’re Southern, born and raised, and we would never let a female walk to their car by herself,” Grant Wactor said at the time. “He came across them and he thought his truck was being towed. So he said something to the guys, like, ‘Hey, are you towing?’”

Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign Release New Album Vultures 2.,https://www.billboard.com/lists/kanye-west-ty-dolla-sign-vultures-2-songs-ranked/,"For Ye — the artist formerly known as Kanye West — and Ty Dolla $ign, the third time was indeed the charm. After a pair of potential Vultures 2 release dates came and went, fans were apprehensive to believe the Aug. 2 arrival that was announced on the Yeezy website last week.

Ye (who hasn’t posted or said anything publicly about the album’s arrival) and Ty released their “Slide” single on Friday to kick off the rollout.

Hours later, Ty and Ye previewed the album via a YouTube livestream early Saturday (Aug. 3) and Vultures 2 began to land on streaming services just hours later. V2 boasts 16 tracks in total with features from some frequent collaborators such as Playboi Carti, Don Toliver, Lil Wayne, Future, Young Thug and more.

Prior to the album’s arrival, Ty Dolla $ign told Billboard in July that V2 was finished but they were still finalizing plans about a proper rollout for the LP. “We got all the songs. Basically it’s just like, ‘How can we get it there? How can we go bigger than the first album?’” the rapper said. “Certain people will probably expect you to just do the same exact sound. But that sound’s already out.”

The Vultures duo look to be taking the sequel project on the road for their signature listening experiences. Ye and Ty will be heading to Salt Lake City on Aug. 9 before trekking to Asia for a pair of shows in South Korea and Taiwan later this month. If Vultures 2 debuts atop the Billboard 200, Ye will have earned his 12th project to reach the chart’s apex in his career.

The album remains a “living, breathing” body of work-in-progress with Ye and Ty still making updates to the sequel in real time. Songs have already been bolstered with new mixes, mastering and vocal tweaks in the hours since the project was released. While there’s plenty of potential for greatness scattered throughout the project filled with West’s avant-garde production, at times V2 is derailed by sound quality issues, unfinished thoughts or portions when Ye’s rapping dips.

Billboard has run through Vultures 2 and ranked every song from the project (sans the nine-second “Isabella” interlude)."
Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign Release New Album Vultures 2.,https://www.slantmagazine.com/music/kanye-west-ty-dolla-sign-vultures-2-album-review/,"At this point, one expects a Kanye West album to be incomplete in some way upon release, but Vultures 2, his second collaborative album with Ty Dolla $ign, is in shambles. It’s marked by improper mixes, unfinished verses, demo-quality audio (“530,” a Donda 2 leftover, sounds like it was ripped from a YouTube leak), and one track in particular, the otherwise heartfelt “My Soul,” is panned to one speaker. Of course, these are trivialities that West will eventually get around to fixing like he did with 2016’s The Life of Pablo.

But Vultures 2 represents a tipping point for West’s methodology of pushing the limits of a deadline, resulting in songs that sound either half-assed, such as the too-cutesy “Promotion,” or simply incomplete. Which, in some ways, might be the point: Like the first Vultures, this one leans more heavily on vibes and aesthetics than substance or emotion (other than self-pity, which is fully on display throughout “Husband”).

Advertisement

Ty does reliably good work here, but he’s more or less relegated to a supporting role, while West seems to be aiming to capture a moment rather than fully develop an idea into an actual song. “Fried,” a desperate attempt to recapture the fire-in-a-bottle energy of the more manic “Carnival,” serves as the working thesis for this ethos: all bluster, zero modesty. At one point, West, perhaps a tad too self-aware, aptly sums it up: “What if I start off the track, hum the beginnin’/Fuck up the middle part, and mumble the endin’?”

Despite all the stern swaggering, Vultures 2 is deeply unserious. A disconnected malaise permeates the album, from West’s almost non-presence on many tracks (quite literally, as he’s employed generative AI for some of his vocals, with others rapping for him) to the sluggish, repetitive beat selection that turns tracks like the menacing “Dead” into non-starters.

Advertisement

Even the occasional sparks of interest, like Kodak Black hopping on a sample of Portishead’s “Machine Gun” for the cluttered “Field Trip” or Lil Wayne delivering some quotable lines on “Lifestyle,” prove fleeting. This makes something like “Bomb,” a vanity song where West’s children North and Chicago rap in Japanese over a Jersey club beat, a double-edged sword: It’s terrible, yes, but at least someone sounds like they’re having fun, and it’s certainly not Dad.

What’s perhaps most frustrating about Vultures 2 is that it provides glimpses of the high level of quality formerly associated with West’s output. “Slide,” which currently stands at the pinnacle of the Vultures era alongside “Fuk Sumn” and “Beg Forgiveness,” is a high-octane fever dream, with its pairing of squealing organs and a booming percussion section sounding straight-up cinematic. And “River” transforms a fairly pedestrian Leon Bridges song into a touching and triumphant plea for freedom on behalf of both Larry Hoover and Young Thug, with a sleek Thugger feature tacked onto the start for good measure.

But those are exceptions, not the rule, on the 16-track album. One can only imagine that West might resort to using artificial intelligence to entirely craft Vultures 3, reportedly due later this year, and call it a day. At least then it might be finished on time.

The duo dropped the album “Vultures 2″ on Saturday. The album is a sequel to “Vultures 1,″ which was released six months earlier, and debuted at No.1 on Billboard’s 200 album chart. Some fans have so far criticized the sequel in social media comments.

The “Vultures Listening Experience” will take place Friday at the Delta Center, 301 W. South Temple, Salt Lake City. Tickets range from $60 to $275. It’s the only listening session announced in the United States so far; according to Billboard, two other listening sessions have been announced, one in South Korea and one in Taiwan.

(Amy Harris | Invision / Associated Press file photo) Rapper-musician Ty Dolla $ign, seen here in 2018, has released ""Vultures 2"" with Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West. A ""listening experience"" for the new album is scheduled for Salt Lake City's Delta Center on Friday, August 9, 2024.

For “Vultures 1,” listening sessions were held in Milan, Bologna and New York City. UBS Arena in New York had the following description of the event on its website: “This event marks a historic moment as attendees will listen to the album together with the artists and album collaborators.” It also promised a audio and visual showcase put together by the musicians.

Some fans in the comments of the Delta Center’s post announcing the event speculated on whether or not the two artists would be present Friday. One wrote, “They are at every listening party.”

Ye previously brought his “Sunday Service” experience to downtown Salt Lake City in October 2019. The artist has had a history of “extreme rhetoric” over the years, including antisemitic remarks, as reported by Rolling Stone. In 2022, his remarks had an effect on his career, as chronicled by The New York Times. Despite this, Ty Dolla $ign has been vocal in his support of Ye and their artistic endeavors — together and solo."

It was only a year ago when Ye’s rank antisemitism and adoration of white supremacists prompted an exodus of corporate supporters. Then, with Vultures I, he joined a wave of “canceled” men re-establishing ties with polite society. Critics stung by his unrelenting anti-Black stunts grudgingly admitted that Vultures was impressively produced. “Kids love Kanye,” declared a Complex account on the X platform.

Vultures I had the benefit of debuting amid the music industry’s annual post-Christmas doldrums – it achieved the top position with a remarkably low number of 20,000 sales equivalents – as well as the kind of inexplicably intractable goodwill for Ye that prompted the gold-winning U.S. Olympic women’s gymnasts to quote from his memorable 2005 Grammy acceptance speech for Best Rap Album. Never mind the “White Lives Matter” T-shirts, the sundry lawsuits surrounding his charter school Donda Academy, the sexual harassment lawsuit, and innumerable allegations that he commits financial crimes against his employees. Much of the public believes that Ye hasn’t done anything wrong. Sure, he’s indulged in impolitic comments and weird behavior. But he’s no R. Kelly. He hasn’t physically hurt anyone…right?

For old heads who remember spotting Kanye West’s name in the credits on rapper Grav’s 1996 album Down to Earth, the Atlanta-born, Chicago-raised musician’s evolution from talented beatmaker circa Jay-Z’s The Blueprint and wunderkind circa 2004’s The College Dropout to visionary circa 2010’s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy to now must seem dispiriting. But give Ye this: the man can still “pop a wheelie on the Zeitgeist.” His heel turns feel appropriate for an era in which mainstream rap is designed for the whims of the manosphere. Vultures I’s most overwhelming sonic moments, like Inter Miami football supporters Curva Nord Milano chanting loudly on “Carnival” and the dubby house thump of “Paid,” rattle with bleak fascistic dominance. There’s shit-talking about penis power and amassing impenetrable fame and wealth. Admissions of pain, whether spiritual or romantic, are intended primarily for male salvation, not extensions of empathy towards others. At the end of “Hoodrat,” Mike Tyson instructs the audience to become willing sycophants. “Shit Kanye say is basically affirmations. What people say for success,” he tells us. “No doubt he’s got some mental fuckin’ issues. Most leaders do.” Editor’s picks

Alas, Vultures 2 feels like second helpings of a memorably distasteful meal. Despite Ye’s boast on “Time Moving Slow” that “I rewrote my ending,” it has fewer ear-grabbing samples than the first volume, just as well given how his use of Donna Summer’s “I Feel Love” on the since-deleted Vultures 1 track “Good (Don’t Die)” led to a noisy lawsuit. “Field Trip,” which has the sparky bang of a middling Netflix action flick, makes use of the hard piano arpeggios of Portishead’s “Machine Gun.” “Sky City” finds Ty Dolla $ign harmonizing the chorus from the Five Stairsteps’ incandescent 1970 soul classic “O-o-h Child.” The album artwork for Vultures II shows Ty holding a framed picture of his brother Big TC, who is currently serving a life sentence for murder despite his professed innocence. At album’s close, Big TC himself harmonizes on “My Soul” about keeping his Muslim faith in despite imprisonment. “It’s predestined and God got a plan,” he sings anxiously.

Given the cover artwork, it seems that Vultures 2 should be Ty’s moment to assert himself in the Y$ venture. But he remains a junior partner, although it’s his voice we hear first on the album’s opening track, “Slide,” crowing about how he’ll “hit that pussy good, I’m gonna put her on a flight.” As an era-defining R&B hook-slinger, Ty can call himself “the new [Hugh] Hef” on “Dead” with slickly diabolical glee, comfortable in the knowledge his audience won’t take him too seriously. His intentions don’t seem as fraught – or as impactful – as Ye; or guest stars like Young Thug, the now-imprisoned ATL innovator who appears on “River.” Given Thugger’s never-ending racketeering trial, his claim that he has “Too much money to be in the streets” feels sadly ironic. Related

Regardless, this is a Ye operation, from Vultures 2’s demo-like construction to pseudo innovations such as when Future’s voice is sequenced to repeat “Cook up the yay, make it jump out the gym” six times on “Dead.” And his obsessions are wearyingly familiar. He raps, “fuck Adidas” on “My Soul,” and compares his YZY brand to being liberated from “picking cotton” on “Sky City.” He meanders through “Husbands,” yet another entreaty to ex-wife Kim Kardashian. “The only thing you really need is a husband/The only thought you ever need is, ‘I trust him’,” he sings. “530” finds him rapping, mournfully, “It’s game time, matter of fact it’s Ye time/The past year been a strange time/Visitations on FaceTime/And who gon’ break whose heart first, always just breaks mine.” There’s little discussion of how his divorce may have affected her. Charitably, he invites his daughters North and Chicago West to play in the studio on “Bomb.” That track is immediately followed by “River,” which begins with Thug harmonizing, “Big booty bitch, I know who payin’ for it.”

In the past, Ye’s delusions of grandeur and curdled misogyny scratched at deeper truths about sex and spirituality, and how we struggle to center ourselves while acquiring property and influence in a heartlessly capitalistic society. But it’s been eight years since he declared himself a MAGA acolyte before embarking on his current path as a “freethinker” and would-be billionaire plutocrat. The textual delights of his imperial phase have long since dissolved into broken promises of deeper meaning beyond spectacle. Despite the Vultures II artwork, little time is spent on the ravages of the criminal justice system besides vague shouts of “Free Larry [Hoover]” and “free [Big] Meech.” Certainly, nothing is said about the Black women who have been victimized by the police state.

Vultures 2 isn’t completely devoid of pleasure. “Husbands” is a vivid moment of characteristic selfishness. Longtime G.O.O.D. Music ghostwriter Cyhi delivers a great verse about visiting “ancestors” on “Sky City,” a track reminiscent of 2Pac’s “Thugz Mansion” where Ty echoes the chorus from the Five Stairsteps’ soul classic “O-o-h Child.” They’re joined by 070 Shake and Desiigner. Other rap bros appear like Playboi Carti, Kodak Black, Don Tolliver, Lil Wayne, Lil Durk, and Lil Baby. According to a Genius.com citation, the voice of Todd Rundgren is buried somewhere within “My Soul.” Given that Rundgren disparaged Ye as a “shoe designer” in 2021, this may be old session fodder that Ye unceremoniously threw into the Vultures bouillabaisse.

Eventually, Vultures 2 feels like a chore. Congratulations: You made it through Ye’s latest disasterpiece. Why can’t the world unsubscribe from this shitty content? Perhaps we’re meant to submit to this Trumpian bargain, giving him our time, money and attention for nothing in return. “Never let ‘em break up the gang, we gotta stay together,” implores Ty on “Forever Rolling.” Lil Baby adds, “The world got a whole lot to offer, you got to live a little/Some shit I’ll never figure out, I’ll probably never get it.”"

Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign Release New Album Vultures 2.,https://stupiddope.com/2024/08/kanye-west-and-ty-dolla-ign-drop-vultures-volume-2/,"Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign are back at it again, serving up a musical feast with their sophomore joint album “VULTURES Volume 2.” This long-awaited sequel to their first collaborative effort lands just a day after its latest release date—because, of course, nothing in Kanye’s world follows a normal schedule.

Spanning a generous 50 minutes, “VULTURES Volume 2” offers 16 tracks packed with enough star power to light up a small city. The album drops nearly three months after its original May release date, proving that good things really do come to those who wait—or at least those who tolerate rescheduled release dates.

This album is a who’s who of the music industry, featuring guest appearances from the likes of Don Toliver, Kodak Black, Playboi Carti, Future, Lil Wayne, Chicago and North West (yes, Kanye’s kids are in the mix), Charlie Wilson, The Inter Milan Ultras, Young Thug, Lil Durk, Lil Baby, James Blake, 070 Shake, CyHi the Prynce, Desiigner, and even Todd Rundgren. It’s like someone shook the music industry tree and all the biggest names fell into Kanye and Ty’s recording studio.

One of the album’s most touching elements is its cover art. Ty Dolla $ign pays tribute to his incarcerated brother, Jabreal Muhammad, also known as Big TC. Muhammad is currently serving a life sentence for a murder he and Ty insist he did not commit. This nod to his brother adds a personal and poignant layer to an otherwise star-studded affair.

For those who can’t wait to dive into this musical extravaganza, “VULTURES Volume 2” is available for streaming on Spotify and Apple Music. Whether you’re a die-hard Kanye fan, a Ty Dolla $ign devotee, or just here for the guest stars, there’s something in this album for everyone.

So, what are you waiting for? Fire up your favorite streaming service and let “VULTURES Volume 2” take you on a wild ride through a galaxy of musical talent. And while you’re at it, consider the poetic justice of an album dropping a day late—because in Kanye’s world, nothing is ever too late, just fashionably delayed."
Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign Release New Album Vultures 2.,https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/831292-kanye-west-vultures-song-updates-hip-hop-news,"The polishing is now underway.

""VULTURES 2 AVAILABLE ON ALL DSPS. UPDATED SONGS WILL BE PUBLISHED IN REAL TIME"". That is the message that still reads across Kanye West's yeezy.com site amid the release of VULTURES 2. He shared that news the night of the album's release, August 3, after fans were voicing their frustrations all day. Many have been dubbing this his worst project of his career thanks to poor mixing, vapid performances, and etc. This is something that the Georgia multi-hyphenate has done before, à la The Life Of Pablo. While there are quite a bit of people out there who feel these changes will help improve V2, others think there's no saving it.

Regardless of what side you're on in this ongoing discussion, Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign are living up to their promise. According to Kurrco, he shared the first of five tweaks to the 16-song tracklist. Whether or not we receive adjustments to each cut remains to be seen. For now, though, Ye and Ty have brought updates to ""RIVER"", ""530"", ""SKY CITY,"" ""FIELD TRIP"", and ""FRIED"". Kurrco provides extra insight for the first two, which are arguably the most coveted tracks, and the ones fans were disappointed in the most. For ""RIVER"", the ""OG drums"" are back in the mix, so if you were able to hear the demo of that record, that may be a major tweak.

Kanye Fans, How Are We Feeling About These VULTURES 2 Changes?

Then, for ""530"", Ty Dolla $ign, as well as Alvin from the titular chipmunk band, have vocals added. However, at the time of writing, these changes have not yet been deployed onto streaming yet. Whether or not Kanye actually releases each refined version like he said he would in ""real time"" or all at once when each track is done, remains to be seen. For now, continue to refresh your streaming platforms."
Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign Release New Album Vultures 2.,https://www.vibe.com/news/entertainment/kanye-west-ai-vultures-2-1234902585/,"Kanye West fans think the artist is using AI all throughout Vultures 2.

After the album was finally released over the weekend, fans became suspicious of West’s output on the project. “SKY CITY,” a track that fans have eagerly awaited, was one of the first songs to be vocally analyzed with a fine-tooth comb.

“Did Kanye partly use AI on his SKY CITY verse?” a fan asked on X/Twitter. “It feels like someone gave him a ref and they just deepfaked the voice. Theres also the random punch ins that sound authentic but are way too noticeable Wtf does this man delay his albums for???”

Another fan drew two examples from the same song, drawing attention to “more human” elements in certain parts of the song versus other parts of the track.

“For those who can’t hear it the AI Verse on ‘Sky City’ First video is the AI Ye Verse 2nd part is the Punch-in Ye did (diff quality, more human take), I thought it was Newtone or Melodyne at first but the AI artifacts are there This was 100% a deliberate choice, no clue why,” they wondered.

A subsequent take hypothesized that Ye’s “SKY CITY” verse was actually Cyhi The Prynce vocally dubbed to sound like the Chicago artist. “That first verse on ‘Sky City’ is DEFINITELY a Cyhi verse converted to Ye’s voice with AI. His flow and Cadence is all over it,” they typed.

“FIELD TRIP” was another song being targeted for allegedly containing AI vocals. One fan pointed at the end of Ye’s verse being a replica of Ty Dolla $ign‘s leaked verse from the song. They expressed that “The end of YE’s verse on ‘FIELD TRIP’ is seemingly one of Ty Dolla $ign‘s vocals with a YE ai filter over it…this is getting sad.”

For those who can't hear it the AI Verse on Sky City



First video is the AI Ye Verse

2nd part is the Punch-in Ye did (diff quality, more human take)

Vultures 2 arrived early Saturday morning (Aug. 3) after suffering from multiple delays. The LP was initially set for a March release before being edited and updated for several months. After missing the March release date, West claimed that the music would arrive on May 3 before being delayed again.

That same month, Ty appeared on YouTuber Vitaly’s livestream, revealing the duo’s plans for more music. He stated that they have enough leftover music to potentially give fans a fourth Vultures LP after a third one.

That first verse on “Sky City” is DEFINITELY a Cyhi verse converted to Ye’s voice with AI.

Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign Release New Album Vultures 2.,https://genius.com/a/read-all-the-lyrics-to-kanye-west-and-ty-dolla-igns-new-album-vultures-2,"Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign were supposed to drop VULTURES 2, their second collaborative album as ¥$, on Friday. As often happens with Kanye West albums, that date came and went without any new music, but the duo actually did release the album yesterday (Saturday). It’s got 16 tracks and a whole mess of special guests.

Among those featured on VULTURES 2—as per initial Genius transcriptions—are Don Toliver, Kodak Black, Playboi Carti, Future, Lil Wayne, Charlie Wilson, Young Thug, and Lil Baby. No feature credits are attached to the songs on Spotify or Apple Music.

Although Kanye has become something of a pariah in the wake of his many controversies—most notably his antisemitic rants of 2022—he’s retained a loyal, or at least curious, audience. VULTURES 1, which dropped in February, topped the Billboard 200, and the single “CARNIVAL,” featuring Rich The Kid and Playboi Carti, went to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Vultures 2 is already stirring up controversy, as Geoff Barrow of U.K. trip-hop legends Portishead is claiming that he did not authorize the sample of “Machine Gun” heard on “FIELD TRIP.” As per Variety, there might also be issues with Kanye and Ty Dolla’s interpolations of Leon Bridges’ “River” and Five Stairsteps’ 1970 classic “O-o-h Child.”

Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign Release New Album Vultures 2.,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/leylamohammed/kanye-west-seemingly-references-kim-kardashian-new-album,"The surprise release came roughly two years after Ye sparked heavy backlash when he shared a series of antisemitic messages online, resulting in him losing his Adidas and Gap partnerships and temporarily being banned from social media sites.

Months prior, Ye faced criticism for his treatment of Kim Kardashian following their divorce.

Kim filed to end her and Ye’s six-year marriage in February 2021, citing “irreconcilable differences.” The rapper hit out at her online months later when she went public with her new relationship with Pete Davidson.

Ye repeatedly referred to Kim as his “wife” in several social media posts, and, at one point, even denied her motion to be legally single.

Ye also shared a series of scathing, now-deleted messages aimed at Pete. He also released a disturbing music video, in which he depicted a cartoon version of the comedian being kidnapped, decapitated, and buried alive.

Now, Ye has seemingly addressed his past marital issues on his new album, with several internet users speculating that his lyrics are aimed at Kim."
Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign Release New Album Vultures 2.,https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-fans-she-reacted-kanye-west-vultures-2-dig-1235746510/,"In the eyes of Swifties, nothing is ever an accident. That’s why some fans are convinced that Taylor Swift subtly shaded Ye — formerly known as Kanye West — at her latest Eras Tour show following the rapper’s reference to her on his new album with Ty Dolla $ign, Vultures 2, which dropped hours before her performance in Warsaw Saturday (Aug. 3).

On the track “Lifestyle (Demo),” Lil Wayne name-checks the 14-time Grammy winner and her boyfriend — Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce — on his guest verse. “I twist my Taylor spliffs tight at the end like Travis Kelce,” he quips.

Though Ye himself doesn’t mention Swift, his choice to include a nod to her on his second joint LP with Ty Dolla $ign is noteworthy considering the “Donda” artist’s past feud with the pop star. That’s why the “Anti-Hero” musician’s wardrobe choice on her first Eras show after the track’s release turned some heads, with Swift sporting a T-shirt during the Red set reading, “I Bet You Think About Me.”

Trending on Billboard

“She’s so funny for wearing the I bet you think about me shirt after Ka*ye name dropped her and Travis in his song an actual comedian,” one person tweeted.

Though Swift has worn the shirt at past shows, a few fans think her choice to sport it at this particular performance at the PGE Narodowy was intentional. “saw the k*nye thing a little bit ago and I knew she was gonna wear it lmao,” the same Swiftie tweeted, to which another fan replied, “it makes so much sense now.”

Swift’s tumultuous relationship with Ye is one of the most storied music industry feuds of the past decade-plus. It all started when he interrupted her acceptance speech at the 2009 VMAs to declare that Beyoncé deserved the best female video honors more, after which they eventually patched things over — that is, until he bragged that the incident launched Swift’s career on his 2016 track “Famous.”

When Swift slammed Ye for the song, he claimed that he got the “Karma” singer’s blessing on a phone call before its release, which she denied. After that, his then-wife Kim Kardashian posted an edited recording of their conversation to portray Swift as a liar, something the latter spoke about as recently as last year.

“You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar,” she told TIME in her Person of the Year cover story in December. “That took me down psychologically to a place I’ve never been before. I moved to a foreign country. I didn’t leave a rental house for a year. I was afraid to get on phone calls. I pushed away most people in my life because I didn’t trust anyone anymore. I went down really, really hard.”"
Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign Release New Album Vultures 2.,https://www.vibe.com/music/music-news/kanye-west-shots-drake-kim-kardashian-vultures-2-1234902708/,"Kanye West is an all-time great at stirring up controversy, though that hasn’t always been the best move for him throughout his career. Even so, the 47-year-old artist took shots at Drake and, subliminally, ex-wife Kim Kardashian on his new album, Vultures 2 with Ty Dolla $ign.

On “530,” a highly-anticipated song that was recorded during the Donda 2 sessions, Ye raps “You a fake bi**h, you don’t really love Ye bi**h, go listen to Drake bi**h.” On the same song, he alludes to his eight-year marriage to Kim K, its failure, and how it has impacted his life.

“Pray your soulmate got a soul when you meet her/ The crystal ball couldn’t tell me if they’d leave again / Problems too extra large to share it with a medium,” he rapped. Later, he added “The past year been a strange time/ Visitations on Facetime / And who gon’ break who’s heart first? Always just breaks mine.”

Kanye West and Kim Kardashian have both moved on from one another since officially getting divorced in November 2022. Ye married Bianca Censori in January 2023, and Kardashian dated Pete Davidson for some time. As for Drake, though, the Chicago producer may never move on from his issues with his former collaborator.

In the heat of the Toronto superstar’s feud with Kendrick Lamar, a remix of “Like That” with a verse from West surfaced online. He also appeared in an interview with Justin LaBoy, where he revealed that he excitedly joined forces with Future, Metro Boomin, Rick Ross, The Weeknd, and A$AP Rocky to assist in the “elimination of Drake.”

In another part of the interview, he called the five-time Grammy winner’s raps “meaningless” and “artificial” due to help from Universal Music Group CEO Lucian Grainge. “Every bar that Drake said means nothing anymore,” he said. “‘Drop and give me 50,’ ain’t nobody dropping to do sh*t. Your raps don’t mean sh*t, ni**a. It doesn’t mean [anything because] the sh*t is artificial. Lucian [Grainge] and Drake, all this sh*t is artificial. That’s why gods had to come [together to] pack that boy up.”

Kanye West says Future called him to get on the remix to ""Like That"" and he addresses artists/rappers teaming up to go against Drake ?

Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign teased Vultures 2, the second of what is supposed to be a trilogy of albums, for months after the first installment came out in February. Finally, the project hit DSPs at midnight on Saturday (August 3). Though the tracklist only shows Ye and Ty, the LP included guest appearances from Future, Lil Wayne, Lil Baby, Playboi Carti, Lil Durk, and more."
Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign Release New Album Vultures 2.,https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/831100-kanye-west-lifestyle-debate-hip-hop-news,"Fans have been extremely let down by Kanye's decisions on ""VULTURES 2"".

It appears that all Kanye West is doing with VULTURES 2 is making fans angry. To be honest, it's completely fair criticism. After waiting on the sequel to the inaugural VULTURES 1 for months, the album still sounds extremely unfinished. It especially doesn't help that a lot of the songs were known about for years thanks to the leak community and DONDA 2. Of course, there are a few ride-or-die supporters of Ye trying to defend the project. Ultimately, though, the amount of disappointment far outweighs the love being shown to this debatably even worse LP. Some predicted this would happen, but some were still holding out hope for Kanye West because of songs like ""LIFESTYLE"".

Hip-hop Twitter (now X) is having quite the field day picking VULTURES 2 to pieces. ""LIFESTYLE"" is one of the handful of songs that Kanye West had hype around thanks to a demo that had been floating around the internet. However, when you listen to each version side-by-side, you can see why fans are confused and upset. Instead of having Ty Dolla $ign sing the chorus --who has the better singing voice -- Ye instead takes the reins, and it sounds like a non-artist singing in the shower. Additionally, the instrumental is mixed much better, which is another big gripe that people have with VULTURES 2.

""LIFESTYLE"" Is Just One Of Many Gripes Fans Have With Kanye & VULTURES 2

However, those few Kanye stans we mentioned earlier are trying to contest that the latest version is better. One user says, ""Bruh the new one better lol"". Another even sends some shade at Drake, saying, ""Demo version is giving Drake energy. Official version is more Ye"". Someone else even calls out the leaking camp for ruining the official album release. ""This is prob with leaks and the reason I don’t listen to them more than once, you guys have an idea what something is SUPPOSED TO SOUND like, ruining ur personal experience when the real thing shows up, now y’all mad smh"".

What are your thoughts on the current version of ""LIFESTYLE"" off of VULTURES 2? Listening to the demo and official renditions back-to-back, which one sounds better? Where do you currently stand on the new album? Do you agree with the camp out there that Kanye West is tarnishing his legacy? We would like to hear what you have to say, so leave your thoughts in the comments.

Its track “Field Trip” apparently samples Portishead’s “Machine Gun,” according to the band’s Geoff Barrow who says Ye and Ty$ didn’t get permission.

The English producer and Beak> member posted a clip of the track on X. “FFS,” he wrote. “Not again.” This follows his 2014 feud with the Weeknd also over an uncleared sample of “Machine Girl.” At the time the Weeknd claimed his “Belong To The World” was merely inspired by Portishead, although Barrow posted a Weeknd rep’s licensing request that he had denied. That same year, Barrow claimed Phantogram ripped him off as well.

“Field Trip” features Playboi Carti, Don Toliver, and Kodak Black. An earlier version, previewed at a Vultures 1 & 2 in Phoenix in March, also featured Lil Durk. It first leaked last December. Other guests on Vultures 2 include Lil Wayne, Future, Lil Baby, Young Thug, 070 Shake, and Ye’s kids Chicago and North."

But the body of work’s arrival isn’t the only thing to shock the public.

Yesterday (August 3), Portishead’s Geoff Barrow was annoyed to learned that the duo sampled the group’s song “Machine Gun” without permission. Over on X (formerly Twitter), Barrow called out the duo for featuring its revered instrumental break on the Vultures 2 track, “Field Trip,” which features Playboi Carti, Don Toliver, and Kodak Black.

“For f*ck’s sake,” he wrote. “Not again 🤷🏼‍♂️.”

Ye has reportedly already been hit with several copyright infringement lawsuits from past projects, Donda. Even Vultures 1 was surrounded with sample clearance issues (from Donna Summer’s estate to Ozzy Osbourne). But based on Barrow’s response, this is Ye’s second time ripping off his past work. Could this be his legal breaking point?"

The musicians released the long-awaited second instalment of the ‘VULTURES’ series on Saturday (August 3), with the first album having dropped in February this year.

Two more volumes were scheduled to drop on March 8 and April 5, but the follow-up failed to materialise in March. Its release date was pushed several times, with West even failing to deliver the album after teasing its arrival on Friday (August 2).

Portishead’s Geoff Barrow has now joined scores of fans taking to social media to share their reactions to the album.

The Beak> member posted a clip of ‘Field Trip’ – which features Don Toliver, Kodak Black and Playboi Carti – as well as reportedly sampling Portishead’s ‘Machine Gun’ on X/Twitter.

Barrow appears to be referencing another instance when ‘Machine Gun’ was sampled without permission, writing: “FFS. Not again”, also taking to Instagram to say: “Why can’t he write his own beats?”

In 2013, The Weeknd released ‘Belong To The World’, and Barrow accused the Canadian singer of using the track without permission.

Tweeting directly at the singer, Barrow wrote: “When someone asks to sample you and you refuse they should have the respect as a fellow artist to not use it.”

Discussing the topic further and defending himself against suggestions from fans of The Weeknd that Portishead wanted more money to clear the sample, Barrow continued: “We usually give sample clearance to tunes we like. It’s got fuck all to do with money!

“As most of them are hiphop artists that are skint. Feels like I’m being used to promote the track now. I’ll shut up now.”

Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign Release New Album Vultures 2.,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/taylor-travis-named-dropped-new-33394912,"Ye, previously known as Kanye West, wen through the very public feud with Taylor after the 2009 MTV VMAs

Fans believe Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have just been named dropped in Kanye West's latest song with Lil Wayne.

Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West released a collaborative album with Ty Dolla $ign over the weekend. Vultures 2, the second in a trilogy of albums, also featured a collaboration with Lil Wayne,

In Ye and Lil Wayne's song, ""Lifestyle (Demo)"", the lyrics seemingly reference the Eras Tour singer and her football player boyfriend, the tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs.

In his verse, Lil Wayne says: ""Ice up in my veins, old flames tryna melt me / I twist my Taylor spliffs tight at the end like Travis Kelce.""

Predictably, fans quickly connected the song to Swift and Kelce given the singer's feud with Ye. It all began when Ye interrupted a then 19-year-old Swift onstage at the VMAs in 2009. Swift won the award for Best Female Video, and Ye, who believed Beyoncé should have won, stormed the stage as she delivered her acceptance speech.

After the incident, Swift told reporters: ""I was really excited because I had just won the award and then I was really excited because Kanye West was on the stage. And then I wasn't so excited anymore after that.""

While Ye eventually apologised for rushing the stage and the pair started to mend their relationship, it wasn't the end of the bad blood between the artists.

In his 2016 song Famous, Ye seemingly shaded Swift. ""I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? I made that b*tch famous,"" he said. He then released the music video for the song, featuring a naked wax figure of Swift.

Ye claimed he'd sought Swift's permission to name-drop her in the song, but a representative for Swift clarified: ""Taylor was never made aware of the actual lyrics, 'I made that b*tch famous'.""

Swift, meanwhile, shared her hurt over the comment. ""You don't get to control someone's emotional response to being called 'that b*tch' in front of the entire world,"" she said at the time.

Fast forward to 2024 and fans think Swift just responded to Ye's latest song in epic fashion. During her Eras Tour show on Saturday, Swift's ""22"" t-shirt read, ""I bet you think about me."" Naturally, it could have been a coincidence Swift chose the costume for her latest show, but Swifties have their suspicions. Reacting to the moment on X, one such fan said: ""She's so funny for wearing the I bet you think about me shirt after Ka*ye name dropped her and Travis in his song an actual comedian."""

Yesterday, Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign took fans by surprise by unveiling their eagerly anticipated album, Vultures 2. Previously, it was announced that it would drop on August 2, though fans were skeptical as the announcement was deleted within hours. Just a day later, the duo delivered, though the project has earned mixed reactions so far.

While many are just glad to have gotten something from Ye and Ty, others are demanding changes to the mix. A message on the Yeezy website confirmed last night that ""UPDATED SONGS WILL BE PUBLISHED IN REAL TIME,"" so it's to be seen whether or not that will satisfy listeners. This is far from the only Vultures 2 controversy to arise after its release, however.

Swsh Calls Out Ye & Ty Dolla Sign For ""530"" Sample

Recently, LA-born artist Swsh took to social media to react to praise after being sampled on ""530."" According to them, however, they allegedly never cleared the sample. ""When people keep thanking you for clearing the sample for Kanye but you literally found out this morning lol,"" they wrote alongside a clip of themself shrugging. Fortunately, it doesn't look like Swsh is too upset. ""Much love tho,"" their caption reads. Fans are urging them not to pull the track, but think they should request financial compensation at the very least."
Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign Release New Album Vultures 2.,https://sg.news.yahoo.com/kanye-west-distributor-working-remove-190643902.html,"UPDATED: Shortly after releasing “Vultures 1,” his collaborative album with Ty Dolla Sign, Kanye West is facing a rocky road in keeping the project on streaming services: The album was removed from Apple Music and iTunes on Thursday afternoon (although several of its singles remain) amid word that its distributor was working to have it pulled from all streaming services. But soon after, the album returned to the platforms thanks to Label Engine, who is now reportedly in charge of distribution.

According to FUGA, which was listed as the distribution service in YouTube’s metadata for the album, West initially uploaded the album to DSPs on Saturday through its automated process after the company had previously declined to distribute the record. Now, as first reported by Billboard, FUGA claims to be working directly with streaming platforms to remove the album from their respective databases. So far, it has been removed from the iTunes store and Apple Music, and a song that interpolates Donna Summer’s 1977 song “I Feel Love,” apparently without permission, was earlier pulled from Spotify.

More from Variety

“Late last year, FUGA was presented with the opportunity to release Vultures 1. Exercising our judgment in the ordinary course of business, we declined to do so,” FUGA shared in a statement to Variety. “On Friday, February 9, 2024, a long-standing FUGA client delivered the album ‘Vultures 1’ through the platform’s automated processes, violating our service agreement. Therefore, FUGA is actively working with its DSP partners and the client to remove Vultures 1 from our systems.”

A rep for Apple Music did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment.

Since FUGA made its statement this morning, distribution for “Vultures 1” has reportedly shifted over to Label Engine, which was previously listed as the distributor for two of the album’s pre-release tracks.

Last year, West had been shopping for potential distributors after years of releasing music while signed to Universal Music Group. Now an independent artist, he reportedly was denied distribution services from numerous companies due to his caustic antisemitic remarks. It’s unclear if that led to the album’s consistent delays, or if it was due to West’s proclivity to meticulously keep working on his music, often after it reaches the market.

Yesterday, fans noticed that one of the tracks, “Good (Don’t Die)” had already been removed from Spotify, though it remains on other streaming services including Apple Music and YouTube. The song, which interpolates Donna Summer’s “I Feel Love,” came under fire following the album’s release, with the late singer’s husband Bruce Sudano claiming that the estate denied its use.

“@kanyewest asked permission to use Donna Summer’s song I Feel Love, he was denied… he changed the words, had someone re sing it or used AI but it’s I Feel Love… copyright infringement!!!” he wrote on social media.

Sudano isn’t the only one taking issue with West’s use of existing music for his own. Ozzy Osbourne also asserted on Friday that the rapper sampled a Black Sabbath song without his permission. “@kanyewest asked permission to sample a section of a 1983 live performance of ‘War Pig’ from the US festival without vocals & was refused permission because he is an antisemite and has caused untold heartache to many,” he wrote. “He went ahead and used the sample anyway at his album listening party last night. I want no association with this man!”

Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign recently released their collaborative album Vultures 2.



The album, initially slated for release on Friday but arrived a day later, sparked controversy particularly the track Field Trip.

The track allegedly samples Portishead’s song Machine Gun without obtaining permission.

Taking to X on Sunday, Geoff Barrow of Portishead voiced his displeasure, stating that Kanye and Ty did not obtain permission to use the sample.

Barrow posted a clip of the track along with his comment, ""FFS, not again.""

This isn't the first time Barrow accused anyone of using Machine Gun without permission.

In 2014, Barrow accused The Weeknd of using an uncleared sample of Machine Gun for his track Belong To The World.

Field Trip features contributions from Playboi Carti, Don Toliver, and Kodak Black.

An earlier version of the track, which was previewed at a Vultures 1 & 2 event in Phoenix back in March, also included Lil Durk."

'North West raps in Japanese on ""bomb"" from Kanye's Vultures 2. That was smart.'

A number of fans accused the song of being racist because of the Japanese language being looped into a song titled Bomb.

One wrote 'Singing Japanese on a song called bomb is straight up crazy'.

Another said 'A song called bomb is the last song you should be speaking Japanese in'.

Another fan clapped back at accusations to point out that North is just a child, one wrote: 'it's just Chicago and North having fun'.

Some listeners also accused Kanye and North of copying Megan Thee Stallion after she speaks Japanese in her Mamushi song.

A fan on twitter said 'now everyone wanna rap in Japanese after Megan did it?' along with a skull enoji.

North, daughter of Kanye and Kim Kardashian, 43, has been breaking into the entertainment industry within her own right, with her debut acting performance earlier this year.

North performed as Young Simba during The Lion King's 30th Anniversary concert - but online trolls lashed out at the ten-year-old's nepo-baby advantage.

North took to the stage at The Hollywood Bowl to perform I Just Can't Wait To Be King.

After belting out lyrics at the crowded venue, North received a standing ovation from the audience.

However, some social media users on X (formerly known as Twitter) shared their thoughts on Kim and Kanye's daughter snagging a coveted role in the musical concert.

One noted: 'Nepotism is literally the best thing to be born with,' while another added, 'The worst case of nepo I have witnessed.'

It was also announced that North was cast in the live-to-film concert event which ran for two nights on May 24 and May 25.

Following the surprise release, multiple fans took to X to call the unexpected timing 'random.'

One person wrote, 'Kanye West Mad Random But I Respect It,' while others used memes to compare to the Chicago-bred music artist.

Another fan used a LeBron James slam dunk highlight reel, adding: 'kanye west when it comes to dropping albums at random times.'

The rap duo — Kanye, 47, and Ty, 42 — debuted their initial joint project on February 10.

There was also a fan who shared an old video clip of West in a blue hat and gray sweatshirt, saying, 'Gotcha!' twice in a row.

To accompany the snippet, the person wrote: 'Kanye West surprising everyone by dropping Vultures 2 without warning.'

Ty, born Tyrone William Griffin Jr, teased the album earlier in the day in his Instagram Stories.

Building anticipation among his 7.7 million followers, he wrote, 'V2 loading,' in white typewriter font set against a black background.

A few hours later he revealed, 'V2 LIVE,' adding a link to the music via Yeezy.com.

Hours before the full-length album came out, the two music artists released the single Slide.

Slide had been in development for some time — a version was first played at a listening party in Geneva last September, according to Variety.

Then, the live audience at Vultures Rave in Miami was treated to a full version of the tune in December 2023, months before Friday night's release date.

Hours before Slide was dropped, an announcement appeared on Yeezy.com that the full Vultures 2 album would be unveiled on Saturday — but the statement was later deleted.

Earlier this week, West, his wife Bianca Censori, and Ty Dolla $ign attended a birthday dinner for Kanye's manager John Monopoly.

John, who is also from Chicago, wrote on social media that the celebration 'was a vibe.'

Additionally, he shared that the father-of-four gifted him 'ANOTHER' Tesla Cyber Truck.

'I couldn’t make this sh*t up if I tried!' he emphasized to his 40,000 followers on Instagram.

Vultures 2 comes just weeks after screengrabs emerged that allegedly showed West expressing a desire to retire from 'professional music.'

News of the hitmaker's shock plans were revealed in an alleged text message exchange with rapper Rich The Kid.

Rich The Kid, 31, shared a screenshot to his Instagram Story of messages he'd received from an iPhone contact under the name 'Ye.'

The text from a person believed to be West — who legally changed his name from Kanye West to Ye in 2021 — read: 'I'm retiring from professional music. Not sure what else to do.'"

Another added: “North West's talent is undeniable. It's cool that Kanye has given her a hIS platform to shine just like Beyonce did for Blue Ivy. Last but not least the convergence of American rap and Japanese anime is a fun idea…”

Kanye West mentioned Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce in his new album Vultures 2 amid the rapper and pop singer’s ongoing feud.



The 47-year-old rapper released his album Vultures 2 in collaboration with Ty Dolla $ign on Saturday morning.

But in the Lyrics of his new track Lifestyle (Demo) West has seemingly given reference to Swift and her boyfriend Travis Kelce, who plays tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs.

He rapped in his song, “I twist my Taylor spliffs tight at the end like Travis Kelce.”

However Swift and the football tight end have not responded to the reference yet.

For those unversed, Swift and West and not been on good terms since 2009 when during the MTV Music Awards West interfered with her acceptance speech for female video saying the award should be given to Beyonce instead.

Later in 2016, the rapper called out the Lover singer’s name in his rapping saying, “I feel like me and Taylor might still have s** / I made that b***** famous.”

Moreover, Swift opened up about the feud in an interview on Today in 2023, revealing that the scandal had affected her a lot.

“That took me down psychologically to a place I’ve never been before,” Swift said."
Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign Release New Album Vultures 2.,https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/geoff-barrow-kanye-west-portishead-sample/,"Geoff Barrow condemns Kanye West’s unauthorised Portishead sample

Geoff Barrow of Portishead is claiming that Kayne West and Ty Dolla $ign have used a sample of a Portishead track on a tune from Vultures 2. The long-awaited second album of the music series arrived over the weekend, following the first part, which dropped in February earlier this year.

West and Dolla were meant to release another two volumes of Vultures in March and April, but they were not made available. However, now that Vulture 2 has finally been made available, the ears of Barrow have pricked up owing to the track ‘Field Trip’ using a sample of Portishead’s ‘Machine Head’, seemingly despite Kayne and Dolla not gaining prior permission.

Barrow has now taken to social media to express his dismay at the unauthorised use of the track. “FFS. Not again,” the BEAK> member wrote, while on his Instagram account, he added, “Why can’t he write his own beats?”

‘Field Trip’ features a number of guest stars, including Don Toliver, Kodak Black and Playboy Carti. The track is not the first instance of a musician using ‘Machine Gun’ without gaining Portishead’s permission first.

Back in 2013, The Weeknd used the tune on his song ‘Belong to the World’ and straight away, Barrow was on hand to offer another damning verdict, writing directly at the singer, “When someone asks to sample you and you refuse they should have the respect as a fellow artist to not use it.”

Barrow had also said that he and his fellow Portishead members would likely allow any musician they are fans of to use one of their songs as a sample, noting, “We usually give sample clearance to tunes we like. It’s got fuck all to do with money!”

According to Barrow, the hip-hop artists that mostly contact Portishead for a sample are “skint”, so he will likely be even more pissed off with the fact that Kayne West has not only used the ‘Machine Gun’ sample but actually used it without permission.

‘Machine Gun’ was released as the lead single from Portishead’s 2008 album Third and has been used in a number of entertainment pieces, including the trailer for the video game Metro: Last Light, the Channel 4 drama Skins and the Netflix series Orange is the New Black.

In using the song for a track from Vulture 2, Kanye West has seriously pissed off the Portishead drummer and may face legal action in the coming months."

While it was PartyNextDoor’s concert, the crowd was treated to a nearly hour-long surprise set by Drake, who according to Billboard focused on the R&B-leaning tracks in his catalog, including performing the live debut of his Plain White T’s-interpolating “Wah Gwan Delilah“:

The first signee to Drake’s OVO Sound label, PartyNextDoor has frequently collaborated with the rapper over the past decade, including on hits like “Come and See Me” and “Loyal,” plus Drake album cuts like “Wednesday Night Interlude,” “Members Only,” and “With You.” The upcoming LP however marks the first time the two artists have worked on an entire album together.

PartyNextDoor released his latest LP PartyNextDoor 4 in April. Outside of Drake’s season of diss tracks and Camila Cabello guest spots, the rapper last released his For All the Dogs in 2023. Prior to that, Drake teamed with 21 Savage for their collaborative LP Her Loss in 2022.

Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign Release New Album Vultures 2.,https://www.netflixjunkie.com/music-news-ye-has-this-legendary-donda-collaborator-working-on-vultures-2-updates/,"There have been months of speculation about whether Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, has lost his creative spark. With the release of 'Vultures 2,' fans quickly took it as the moment of truth for their worst fears. Although 'Vultures 2' did climb to the top of the Billboard charts upon its release, the audience's reception has been quite mixed. While some have praised the rapper for his phoenix-like resurgence, others feel Ye, as an artist, is no longer iconic.

Amid controversies surrounding 'Vultures 2,' it seems Ye is trying to turn things around and rekindle the old magic by teaming up with his former partners.

Ye plans to recreate the Donda magic with old collaborator

'Donda' was considered one of the best albums of 2021. It was nominated for both Album of the Year and Best Rap Album at the Grammys that year. Much of its acclaim is because of the sound engineer, Irko, who worked wonders with the album despite having less than 30 days to mix all the tracks. And according to record producer Digital Nas, who also rose to prominence for his work on 'Donda', Irko is also working behind the scenes on the update of ‘Vultures 2’.

Ye, through his Yeezy website, informed that the 'Vultures 2' tracks are being “UPDATED” and would be published in “REAL TIME”. This news came as the album has been drawing a lot of criticism for its mixing. Ye and Ty Dolla $ign have also been accused of sampling tracks without permission, much like they allegedly did with the first volume of 'Vultures'. However, these were not the worst of the criticisms.

It has been alleged that Ye could not replicate his own voice on the album and hence, resorted to AI in 'Vultures 2'.

As soon as 'Vultures 2' dropped, fans began noticing some abnormalities with the vocals in the tracks, and certain bars sounded pasted. Especially on two of its tracks, ‘SKY CITY’ and ‘FIELD TRIP,’ fans claimed that it sounded as if Ty Dolla $ign’s raw vocals were overlaid with Ye’s voice using AI. This led fans to poke fun at the ‘College Dropout’ creator, who have been wondering what all the fuss and delays were for.

From the very beginning, ‘Vultures’ was plagued with delays after delays. After so many release cancellations, without any explanation, fans had nearly lost hope of ever hearing the album. Yet, even after the release, it seems their expectations were not met. Nonetheless, with updates underway for ‘Vultures 2’ and old collaborators working to revive it, there is still hope that the naysayers' grievances with the album could be smoothed over.

They went on, ""Zero creativity. I hope you eventually get compensated for it, and I hope they have to pay double tax for being so god d**ned boring. FFS indeed.""

West was embroiled in copyright infringement lawsuits over his past albums, including the ""Donda"" projects. The release of ""Vultures 1"" also faced hurdles with sample clearance from Donna Summer's estate and Ozzy Osbourne.

Summer's estate disclosed that West had modified the lyrics of her 1977 song ""I Feel Love"" and used a re-recording of it for his track, ""Good (Don't Die)"" after he was denied permission to use the original track. They accused the rapper of copyright infringement.

Meanwhile, Osbourne accused West of taking a part of Black Sabbath's ""Iron Man"" live performance from 1983 and combining it with one of his ""Vultures 1"" songs without permission.

According to legal professionals, the unauthorized use of the samples would constitute copyright violation.

Donald M. Woodard, an entertainment attorney, said in February that the situation seemed straightforward and undisputed by West.

Woodard clarified to Business Insider that for the ""All of the Lights"" rapper to proceed, he would have had to obtain clearance for the master recording and the underlying composition. This suggests that Osbourne and Summer may hold the copyright to either or both song elements.

The expert explained that even if West chose to re-record the music, thus avoiding the need to clear the master recording, he would still be required to clear the composition.

Woodard explained that it is a regular practice for artists in the music industry to incorporate samples.

""Major labels have a clearance department, and they actually have someone on staff that will listen and have a pretty keen ear to detect when there's probably a sample or an interpolation,"" the lawyer said.

He added, ""Then the artist is notified, and the artist's team will have to see to clear the record or clear the use, so that's not unusual.""

Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign Release New Album Vultures 2.,https://www.netflixjunkie.com/music-news-who-is-the-man-on-the-cover-of-vultures-2-heres-the-ye-and-ty-dolla-sign-connection/,"After what felt like an eternity of delays, broken promises, teases, and listening parties, Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, finally dropped the second volume of ‘Vultures’ this Saturday. ‘Vultures 2’ ’ saw many popular collaborators lending their artistic genius to the album. However, one aspect of Ye’s albums that has always stood out, are his iconic cover arts, and ‘Vultures 2’ was no different. As soon as the cover art surfaced, fans noticed a masked person, most likely Ye, holding up a portrait of another man.

While people were confused as to who the man in the portrait was, Ty Dolla $ign revealed how the cover art was so meaningful to him.

Decoding Vultures 2 cover art

Ty Dolla $ign confirmed on Instagram that the person in the ‘Vultures 2’ portrait is his brother, Jabreal Muhammad, also known as Big TC. Through the cover, $ign paid homage to his brother, who is currently serving a life sentence for a crime judgment that the ‘Spicy’ creator vehemently opposes. $ign has been rallying against the judicial system for his brother’s sentence for years. He even released his 2015 debut album, ‘Free TC,’ as a testament to his fight.

In an interview with XXL Magazine, $ign spoke out about his sibling being ""wrongly accused"" and described his debut album as a “movement.” While Ye’s ‘Vultures’ cover art has always sparked its fair share of controversy, this time around, the reasons for controversy were many others. Now that there is no more delays to pin on Ye, fans have shifted their controversial lens to some other pressing contentious concerns.

From sampling controversy to AI allegations, ‘Vultures 2’ is already at the center of controversy just hours after its release.

There has hardly been a Ye release that has not sparked some polarizing response. True to form, even this time, Ye stirred a wave of backlash for allegedly using AI-generated vocals on several tracks in his latest album, 'Vultures 2'. Among these are ‘SKY CITY’ and ‘FIELD TRIP,’ which, as per fans, sounded like Ty Dolla $ign’s raw vocals were overlaid with Ye’s voice through AI.

On top of that, Ye has been accused of not securing proper permission before allegedly sampling Portishead’s 'Machine Gun'. Band member Geoff Barrow himself took to X to call out the rapper. Nonetheless, despite these hurdles, Ye has managed to top the charts once again with ‘Vultures 2'.

Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign Release New Album Vultures 2.,https://marketresearchtelecast.com/kanye-criticizes-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-in-new-record/,"Kanye West collaborated with Ty Dolla $ign to release their album Vultures 2 on Saturday, August 3. One of the tracks, “Lifestyle,” which also features Lil Wayne, has especially caught the attention of Taylor Swift fans. The New Orleans-born rapper makes a notable mention of both Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce in his verse.

In the lyrics, Lil Wayne raps, “Codeine and cocaine, that’s Lisa Turtle when it’s Kelly / Ice up in my veins, old flames tryna melt me / I twist my Taylor spliffs tight at the end like Travis Kelce.”

The mention of Taylor Swift did not sit well with many fans, despite the fact that it was Lil Wayne and not Kanye who delivered the verse. Reactions varied but were notably vocal.

One fan suggested Swift could counter the mention by releasing digital versions of her songs to steal the limelight from Kanye: “Taylor can do the funniest thing possible and release Digital Versions of TTPD to block his @–.”

Another fan hinted at a deeper obsession, writing, “The obsession Taylor was truly his dream girl even during 2 marriages.”

“Taylor Swift is the standard! Like every single person name drops her for clout!” exclaimed another Swiftie.

This isn’t the first instance Kanye West has mentioned Taylor Swift in his music. Perhaps most famously, he referred to her in his 2016 track “Famous,” claiming some credit for her rise to stardom.

In the controversial song, Kanye rapped, “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex/Why? I made that b—- famous (Godd—)/I made that b—- famous.”

The music video for “Famous” further stirred controversy. It depicted wax figures of various celebrities lying naked in bed together, including Taylor Swift, Kanye’s then-wife Kim Kardashian, his ex-girlfriend Amber Rose, Rihanna, Chris Brown, Anna Wintour, Bill Cosby, Caitlyn Jenner, George Bush, Donald Trump, and Kanye himself.

Fans speculated Swift responded to this recent name-drop subtly. During her Red set at her latest concert held at the PGE Narodowy stadium in Warsaw over the weekend, Swift wore a t-shirt with the words “I Bet You Think About Me,” which fans believe was a nod to Kanye’s latest lyrical mention.

WWE Summer Slam: Cody Rhodes vs Solo Sikoa WWE Championship match results.,https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/2024/08/03/wwe-summerslam-live-match-results-winners-highlights-analysis-at-cleveland-browns-stadium/74659913007/,"WWE delivered the biggest party of the summer with SummerSlam 2024.

Roman Reigns made his long-awaited return and put Solo Sikoa in his place, providing Cody Rhodes with an unexpected assist. The Judgment Day imploded, first with Dominik Mysterio betraying Rhea Ripley in her championship match, before he left arm and arm with Liv Morgan. Then it was Finn Balor, who cost Damian Priest in his world title bout against Gunther.

Meanwhile, Drew McIntyre finally got the upper hand on nemesis CM Punk, who was wrestling in his first televised WWE singles match in over 10 years.

In total four new champions were crowned, including Nia Jax (women's championship), LA Knight (U.S. championship) and Bron Breakker (Intercontinental championship).

The fallout from SummerSlam 2024 will be felt for a while as rivalries will continue to heat up into the fall.

Here's a recap of SummerSlam with all the highlights and grades from every match:

WWE SummerSlam post show, press conference

Roman Reigns returns, takes out Solo Sikoa in match vs Cody Rhodes

During a chaotic match between Cody Rhodes and Solo Sikoa for the Undisputed WWE championship that featured run-in after run-in, Roman Reigns made his long-awaited return at SummerSlam.

At the time, both Rhodes and Sikoa were down in the ring.

What was Reigns going to do? Was he coming for his longtime rival in Rhodes or Sikoa, the man who has called himself the new Tribal Chief in the absence of Reigns?

Reigns, last seen at WrestleMania after losing his title to Rhodes, gave everyone that answer quickly. Sikoa a Superman punch and then speared him to a thunderous ovation.

Rhodes then finished the job and delivered a final Cross Rhodes on Sikoa for the win.

Rhodes was in shock that the man he fought at the last two WrestleMania's was giving him an assist. But for Reigns, it's likely more about giving Sikoa a reminder about who runs The Bloodline. Reigns has led The Bloodline faction since 2020 and did so as the champion. But after Reigns left the scene after WrestleMania, Sikoa self-appointed himself the Tribal Chief and brought in several new family members.

Reigns has clearly been watching and disapproves with how Sikoa has been running things. The next chapter in The Bloodline is upon us with the return of Roman Reigns.

Watch out Sikoa, Jacob Fatu, Tama Tonga, Tonga Loa and the rest of WWE, the Head of the Table is back.

Grade: A+

Watch Cody Rhodes' SummerSlam entrance: Cody Rhodes' dog, Arn Anderson

Cody Rhodes' entrance is always memorable. His entrance at SummerSlam might be the best for who was involved. His dog, Pharaoh and Arn Anderson, a contemporary of Rhodes' late father, Dusty Rhodes, who gave Rhodes a pep talk.

Watch it here:

Who is Cody Rhodes' dog, Pharaoh?

Pharaoh is Rhodes' longtime companion on the road. Rhodes' dog has joined him on the road for years across his time in AEW and WWE.

Rhodes posted on social media this week that due to Pharaoh's age — he's 13 — he will no longer travel with him.

Rhodes said Pharaoh is ""still thriving but slowing down a bit.""

""These days he's more comfortable keeping eyes on Libby Curls and hard napping at the house,"" Rhodes wrote ""... He's been a constant for me and hands down the most loyal friend.""

Pharaoh waited for Rhodes as he got off his bus prior to his SummerSlam match against Solo Sikoa on Saturday night.

SummerSlam attendance

The Biggest Party of the Summer delivered the largest attended SummerSlam in WWE history.

SummerSlam host The Miz, along with his tag team partner R-Truth, announced the SummerSlam attendance of 57,791, a new record.

Gunther is new World Heavyweight champion thanks to Finn Balor costing Damian Priest

The Judgment Day is toast.

And so is Damian Priest's title reign.

The beneficiary was Gunther, the Ring General who won his first world championship.

Hours after Dominik Mysterio cost Rhea Ripley her match against Liv Morgan, Finn Balor did the same toward Damian Priest in his fight with Gunther.

For those keeping score at home, that's two members of The Judgment Day, a long-running faction in the WWE that has held many championships over the last few years, ruining the chances for its own members.

But this has been building for some time. And at the center of it was Finn Balor, whose jealousy of Damian Priest reared its ugly head again.

Balor came out amid an extremely physical match between Priest and Gunther. Would Balor help his longtime friend Priest retain the title he has held since WrestleMania?

He did anything but that.

After Priest gave Gunther the South of Heaven power bomb, the champion rolled his challenger over to the side of the ring where Balor was positioned. Wrong move.

As the ref was counting Balor put Gunther's leg on the rope, ending the count. Priest initially couldn't see that Balor was responsible, but he saw it on replay. Balor had his back toward him initially and had a smirk on his face like Mysterio earlier in the night.

The ultimate betrayal.

Priest was furious. He then tried to grab Balor by the neck through the ring ropes. But all that did was give Gunther the opening he needed. He then put Priest in a sleeper to secure the win.

It's a huge moment for Gunther, who has been one of WWE's most dominant superstars over the last few years.

Like with Mysterio and Ripley, the fallout of The Judgment will be felt for a while. Balor has some serious explaining to do.

Grade: B+

Drew McIntyre finally stands tall over CM Punk in wild match at SummerSlam with Seth Rollins as special guest referee

CM Punk's first televised singles match in over 10 years didn't end how he planned.

After months of getting the upper hand in his heated rivalry with Drew McIntyre, the Scottish Warrior finally got the better of Punk.

He returned the favor on Punk by delivering a low blow on him with special guest referee Seth Rollins out of the picture. It was reminiscent of when Punk gave McIntyre a low blow back at Clash at the Castle earlier this summer to cost him in his championship match.

In the end, CM Punk let his hatred for Rollins get in the way.

As WWE announcer Michael Cole said before the match, McIntyre vs. Punk had a ""big fight feel."" It's been WWE's best storyline and it's had long-term storytelling even as one of its main characters, CM Punk, has been out of action with an injury.

The match turned when Punk was going for his finishing move - the Go To Sleep - on McIntyre. It was then that Punk saw that Rollins was wearing Punk's coveted bracelet that has the names of those close to him. Rollins was wearing it after it got loose from McIntyre, who had stolen it, making this feud even more personal.

He got in Rollins' face and the ref later was knocked out of the ring. Punk eventually got McIntyre down with his signature move but Rollins wasn't in position for the count.

Punk was livid and the two were face to face, exchanging words.

Punk then picked up Rollins and delivered GTS on his longtime rival as the match further broke down.

With Punk distracted with Rollins, McIntyre gained the upper hand when he first executed a low blow and then his finisher Claymore.

Rollins, still down, had enough energy to crawl over to make the three count.

McIntyre finally overcame CM Punk by winning at his own game. The feud between all three of these has been going on for much of the year. But if this match proved anything it's that the rivalry among all three will continue.

The CM Punk-Seth Rollins singles match, which was supposed to happen at WrestleMania this year, will be must-watch when that happens.

Nia Jax wins women's championship over Bayley at SummerSlam, Tiffany Stratton provides distraction

The queen is now a champion.

Queen of the Ring Nia Jax has her first women's championship in six years after she powered her way to a victory over Bayley at SummerSlam.

Bayley, who won the title back at WrestleMania, appeared to have the match in her favor when Nia Jax's new friend Miss Money in the Bank winner Tiffany Stratton came down to the ring. She had her Money in the Bank briefcase with her and a ref as if she intended to use her MITB contract make the match a triple threat.

But her appearance was just intended to offer a distraction. She did her job. Bayley turned her back on the Irresistible Force, who then gave her two sit-down powerbombs.

She wasn't done.

Jax then got up to the top rope and crashed down on Bayley with back-to-back annihilators.

That was more than enough for the win.

Jax and Tiffany Stratton celebrated in the ring together, Jax with her new title and Stratton with her briefcase.

Jax and Stratton are friends now but don't be surprised if Miss Money in the Bank eventually cashes in on Jax later this fall.

Bayley delivered a noteworthy performance and had the crowd on their feet when she delivered a power bomb of her own from the corner to the middle of the ring on the much bigger Jax.

Bayley then delivered a beautiful flying elbow from the top rope. But Jax kicked out, setting off the wild finish.

LA Knight defeats Logan Paul to win US championships, overcomes brass knuckles assist from Machine Gun Kelly

Ohio native Logan Paul had his usual entourage for his match against LA Knight at SummerSlam.

But it wasn't enough to win this time, despite his usual antics.

LA Knight overcame it all to defeat Paul and capture his first singles championship in the WWE.

Machine Gun Kelly greeted Paul, who was wearing Cleveland Browns colors, when he entered the stadium. The two walked to the ring together but this wasn't the last we'd see MGK.

LA Knight brought the aggression before the match even started. Before coming out to the ring he smashed the windows of Paul's huge Prime-themed vehicle in the parking garage.

When LA Knight finally made his way out he and Paul fought outside the ring, including on top of the announcer's table before the match even started.

When the bell finally rang, the physicality continued. Paul thought he had the match a couple times, once after he drilled LA Knight with one of his signature right hands and later after he struck him with brass knucks, which were provided to the champ by MGK.

But that wasn't enough to keep LA Knight down.

Did the fans at Cleveland Browns Stadium like this result? One word: Yeah!

Grade: B+

Stephanie McMahon is at SummerSlam

Stephanie McMahon, the daughter of former WWE CEO Vince McMahon, is ringside at SummerSlam. Stephanie McMahon has had several roles in WWE over the years, including as the company's longtime chief brand officer. She left the company in January 2023. She's married to Paul ""Triple H"" Levesque, a WWE legend and the company's current chief content officer.

She was last seen on WWE TV at WrestleMania in April.

Bron Breakker defeats Sami Zayn at SummerSlam to win WWE Intercontinental championship

There's a section at Cleveland Browns Stadium called the Dawg Pound.

Bron Breakker and the dogs were barking on Saturday night at SummerSlam.

Breakker overpowered Sami Zayn to win the Intercontinental championship, his first singles title on the main roster.

Breakker, who fell short of the title at Money in the Bank in July against Zayn, won the match with a huge spear as the champion was going for a Helluva Kick.

It was a quick match following the explosive opener and it's clear these two could have given more of a show. But WWE brass likely wanted to show the dominance of Breakker. Mission accomplished. The sky is the limit for the 26-year-old Breakker, who is the son of Rick Steiner and nephew of Scott Steiner.

Grade: C

Is The Judgment Day over?

DominikMysterio costing Rhea Ripley her match isn't sitting well with fellow Judgment Day members.

During a break, World Heavyweight champion Damian Priest was furious in the group's Clubhouse. He questioned Finn Balor if he knew Mysterio was going to turn on Ripley.

Balor denied it. The tension is building between The Judgment Day.

Dominik Mysterio gets dirty, turns on Rhea Ripley to help Liv Morgan retain women's championship

Dominik Mysterio has turned on his Mami, Rhea Ripley.

And he helped Liv Morgan in the process retain her women's championship and defeat Rhea Ripley in the first match at SummerSlam.

Things heated up late in the encounter when Morgan brought a steel chair into the ring. She was going to use it on Ripley, but her strike was blocked before the challenger executed a Rip Tide on the champion.

She didn't go for the pin, however. She wanted to make Morgan pay for her deeds over the last few months, including injuring her with a steel chair four months ago. As she was going up to hit her with a chair, Mysterio, who was ringside, grabbed it from behind to stop her. Ripley would have been disqualified had she used it. But it was all a ruse. It was just the beginning of Mysterio's involvement.

As Mysterio and Ripley were arguing at the top of the ring, Morgan hit her finishing move, Oblivion. It wasn't enough to get the pinfall as Ripley kicked out at two.

But moments later, with the steel chair still in the ring, Mysterio again jumped to the top of the ring to distract the referee. This allowed Morgan to hit her finisher on Ripley on the steel chair.

Mysterio's intentions were crystal clear this time. He was done with Mami. The camera showed him with a smirk on his face as Morgan received her title back.

And as Morgan left the ring, Mysterio gave her a big kiss. Unlike a few months ago when Morgan pursued him to make Ripley jealous while she was out with an injury, it was Mysterio who initiated it.

Dirty Dom did Mami dirty.

Ripley was heartbroken in the ring. Mysterio and Morgan walked to the back arm in arm. Mysterio had his arm raised. and Morgan raised her title belt.

This match was the perfect opener and had the fans wanting more and intrigued by what is to come. But they were also crushed for Ripley.

This drama between Ripley, Morgan and Mysterio is far from over. Mysterio better be ready for the fallout from not only Ripley but also his fellow Judgment Day members or whatever is left of it.

Watch Rhea Ripley put her shoulder back into place during SummerSlam match

Liv Morgan vs Rhea Ripley starts SummerSlam

The women's world championship between Liv Morgan and Rhea Ripley kicks off SummerSlam. It's one of the more personal matches on the SummerSlam card

And Dominik Mysterio, the son of Hall of Famer Rey Mysterio, is ringside with Ripley. Mysterio has been the love interest of Morgan as she has sought revenge on anything that belonged to Ripley, who put her out of action in 2023.

After Morgan put Ripley on the shelf after WrestleMania, she has had her eyes on stealing Mysterio away from Ripley.

Mysterio and Ripley have been a pair within The Judgment Day for over a year.

And not to be forgotten, this match is for the women's title, a championship that Ripley has never lost. She was forced to vacate the title after her injury in April.

WWE SummerSlam matches 2024

Seven matches are on the SummerSlam card.

SummerSlam history in Cleveland

This is Cleveland's second time hosting SummerSlam. It last hosted the event in 1996 when SummerSlam was held at Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse.

WWE chronicled its history with Cleveland in this video posted on its social media accounts:

Country superstar Jelly Roll kicked things off with ""God Bless America.""

SummerSlam host The Miz rides into SummerSlam with Maryse and R-Truth

SummerSlam host The Miz, along with his wife, former WWE superstar Maryse make their grand entrance ahead of the event via The Miz Express bus.

The Miz is a Cleveland native.

Oh, and his former tag team partner R-Truth provided his usual laughs as he came off the bus. He called the tag team of Johnny Gargano, who was wearing a Cleveland Browns jersey, and Tommaso Ciampa, who are known as DIY, D-Generation X. D-X, of course, is not Gargano and Ciampa. D-X is the Hall of Fame group of Triple H, Shawn Michaels, Road Dogg, X-Pac and others.

Gargano is also a Cleveland native.

Jelly Roll will perform at SummerSlam

WWE has a long history of connecting with music stars for their big events.

The two worlds collide again at SummerSlam when country music star Jelly Roll will perform at Cleveland Browns Stadium.

Jelly Roll just tore the house down at Milwaukee's Harley Fest last week. He caught up with WWE's Chief Content Officer Paul ""Triple H"" Levesque inside the stadium on Saturday afternoon.

""When we can all get together — we love his music and he loves our product and we share that passion together it's the absolute best,"" Triple H said in the video with Jelly Roll.

Jelly Roll was beaming.

""We're watching every week,"" he said. ""Crazy. Awesome.""

Triple H makes way to SummerSlam

Paul ""Triple H"" Levesque is ready for ""an epic night"" at SummerSlam.

Seth Rollins arrives for SummerSlam, has interview with Michael Cole

Seth ""Freakin"" Rollins has arrived for SummerSlam. He doesn't have a match, but he has an important job as the special guest referee of the Drew McIntyre vs. CM Punk match.

Rollins lost his world title match against McIntyre at Money in the Bank last month thanks in part to the interference of CM Punk. Rollins and Punk go way back and were rumored to be in line for a match at WrestleMania this year had Punk not been injured.

WWE SummerSlam 2024 predictions

Drew McIntyre defeats CM Punk

This is the only match that isn't for a championship. But it might be the most anticipated. The match has been over six months in the making ever since CM Punk was injured at the hands of McIntyre at the Royal Rumble in late January. Punk has been rehabbing his injury but his presence has been felt, costing McIntyre matches and championship opportunities at every turn. Oh, and then there is special guest referee Seth Rollins, who has a long history with both superstars. And then there is the extra excitement of seeing CM Punk in an actual match. It will be his first televised singles match in WWE since January 2014. Rollins will clearly get involved. I see him costing Punk the match and McIntyre gets revenge on Punk and a much-needed win.

Cody Rhodes defeats Solo Sikoa to retain the Undisputed WWE Championship

While we probably won't see the likes of John Cena and The Undertaker like we did at WrestleMania in the last Bloodline Rules match involving Cody Rodes and The Bloodline, expect a lot of interferences and a chaotic finish again. And expect Cody Rhodes to come out on top and continue a title reign that he began at WrestleMania 40. The big question is whether Roman Reigns will return as well as The Rock in the aftermath to set Solo Sikoa and the new Bloodline straight.

Gunther defeats Damian Priest to win the World Heavyweight Championship

I've gone back and forth on this one but am now leaning toward The Ring General winning his first world title. I see fellow Judgment Day member Finn Balor costing Priest the title. Gunther lost his Intercontinental championship at WrestleMania, ending his historic title reign. At WWE's second biggest premium live event, Gunther won't lose again. A rivalry between Balor and Priest has been building and a feud into the fall between them should be hot as The Judgment Day further fractures.

Liv Morgan defeats Rhea Ripley to retain the Women's World Championship

The Liv Morgan Revenge Tour has been sizzling since she won the women's world title. She took out Ripley this spring and now Mami is looking for her own revenge. Ripley got Dominik Mysterio back in her clutches, but something tells me that Dirty Dom will provide an unlikely assist to Morgan to help her retain her title. But this rivalry will be far from over after SummerSlam.

Bron Breakker defeats Sami Zayn to win the Intercontinental Championship

In a rematch of Money in the Bank, Bron Breakker breaks through for his first singles championship on the WWE main roster. He came up just short at WWE's last premium live event to fan favorite Zayn. But come SummerSlam Breakker's power will be too much for Zayn, who won the IC title back at WrestleMania.

LA Knight defeats Logan Paul to win the United States Championship

Whose time is it? LA Knight's!

The Megastar has been one of the most popular superstars for well over a year now. And SummerSlam is the perfect time to put the title on him.

Nia Jax defeats Bayley to win the WWE Women's Championship

The winner of the Queen of the Ring earlier this summer has been a dominant force since she returned to WWE last fall. There aren't too many wrestlers who get heat like Nia. Bayley, meanwhile, has been a popular babyface since she made her turn earlier this year. Tiffany Stratton and her Money in the Bank also looms large. Nia's strength will be the difference and she'll capture her first individual title since 2018."

After Cody Rhodes agreed this would be a ""Bloodline Rules"" match on SmackDown, Tama Tonga, Jacob Fatu and Tonga Loa would undoubtedly get involved.

Rhodes entrance began in his trailer, and as he exited he was met by his dog Pharaoh. Rhodes was then met by wrestling legend Arn Anderson, who teased some help coming for Rhodes during the match. Rhodes was given his American Nightmare jacket and a winged eagle skull mask as he went through Gorilla and emerged.

Rhodes and Sikoa circled before engaging in a collar-and-elbow tie-up — the first such start of a match tonight. Sikoa looked powerful early, unfazed by a couple of shoulder tackles and thwarting Rhodes' patented drop-down slap. While Sikoa's power was evident in the early stages, Rhodes' speed and wit was on display.

Action spilled outside the ring as Rhodes landed a Disaster Kick and suicide dive on Sikoa, but the challenger was not down for long, as he met a second dive attempt with a blow to the head before both men returned to the ring.

As Rhodes went for his scoop powerslam, Sikoa faked him out, unveiling another layer of his ring psychology. Sikoa kept up the offensive with a pair of near-falls and teasing the Samoan Spike, but Rhodes countered with two kicks and a Cody Cutter. Rhodes stayed on the offensive, sending Sikoa outside the ring briefly.

After some quick offense, Rhodes played the hits, landing his drop-down slap and the Bionic Elbow before a Disaster Kick attempt was countered with a powerbomb and near-fall from Sikoa. The momentum swung back into the Tribal Chief's favor, who landed a huge running maneuver on Rhodes in the corner and a spinning uranage for yet another near-fall.

Sikoa tied Rhodes up in the Tree of Woe and connected on a pair of flying headbutts. Sikoa taunted before going for a third headbutt, allowing Rhodes to evade the maneuver and land a top-rope cross body. Rhodes' brief rally was snuffed out by another spinning uranage. Sikoa took his time, taunting as he went to the top rope, allowing Rhodes to recover for a massive superplex.

Both men exchanged blows as they battled to their feet. Rhodes gained the upper hand and landed a CrossRhodes. This brought out the first interference on behalf of the Bloodline, as Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa emerged to assault Rhodes. Sikoa attempted to make the cover, but Rhodes kicked out. As the Bloodline attack continued, Kevin Owens rushed to Rhodes' aid.

Owens briefly battled the Bloodline but was overwhelmed, drawing out Randy Orton. Orton swung things back into the babyfaces' favor, as him and Owens took out all three members of the Bloodline. Rhodes recovered to hit a CrossRhodes on Sikoa, but the challenger kicked out at two. The four interlopers exited, battling through the crowd.

Rhodes tossed steel steps into the ring, using them to hit Sikoa in the head twice, but the challenger was held up by the turnbuckle. As Rhodes with for a third blow, Sikoa delivered a huge spear for a near-fall. Sikoa set up the steel stairs and went for another rear-view on Rhodes against the stairs. The champion moved out of the way and began to set up a triple CrossRhodes. After the second finisher, Jacob Fatu broke into the match and took out Rhodes.

Fatu dragged Sikoa to cover Rhodes, but the champion kicked out at two. Fatu continued his assault on Rhodes outside the ring, setting up Rhodes on the announce table. Fatu climbed to the top turnbuckle and landed a frogsplash on Rhodes through the table. Sikoa put Rhodes back into the ring and hit a frogsplash of his own, but Rhodes was resilient as ever, kicking out again.

Rhodes rebounded with a superkick and a top-rope Cody Cutter. As both men were laid out in the ring, Roman Reigns' music hit and the former champion and Bloodline leader emerged for the first time since losing to Rhodes at WrestleMania 40.

Reigns ran into the ring and delivered a Superman Punch and spear to Sikoa before staring down and nodding at Rhodes. Reigns then exited without saying a word. Rhodes, not taking his eyes off Reigns, delivered CrossRhodes to Sikoa and pinned him to retain his title.

The Original Tribal Chief cost his former enforcer, Solo Sikoa, his match against Cody Rhodes. Additionally, four new champions were crowned: Bron Breakker, LA Knight, Nia Jax, and Gunther.

SummerSlam featured the most twists and turns out of any WWE PLE this year. Here is a full rundown of the results and our thoughts on each match.

A hot opening between Liv Morgan and Rhea Ripley

SummerSlam began with the highly-anticipated match between Liv Morgan and Rhea Ripley. While the outcome was obvious, a recurring theme of the WWE PLE, the way it got there was fun.

Dominik Mysterio was always going to be the wild card of the match. He came out with Ripley for one final time before turning on her, costing her the title and leaving her heartbroken.

Mysterio was always going to be a part of the match's decision. However, whether or not it would be intentional was the question. Ultimately, Mysterio turned on Ripley — first preventing her from using a steel chair before placing it in the ring for Morgan to hit the final Oblivion on.

The segment culminated with a kayfabe kiss between Mysterio and Morgan. Mysterio's allegiance has firmly switched sides, and this was the beginning of Judgement Day's demise.

Grade: B

Bron Breakker, LA Knight get their moments

Following the opening, Bron Breakker once again took on Sami Zayn for the Intercontinental Championship. After losing at Money in the Bank, there was no way Breakker would lose his next shot for his first WWE main roster gold.

The match was a glorified squash, with Breakker winning after a devastating spear. It was akin to Brock Lesnar and Goldberg's WrestleMania 33 match in its fast-paced nature.

Ultimately, I wish Breakker had just won at the previous WWE PLE. Zayn is too good to be beaten down for five minutes and lose his championship. It was a rushed match with the right result.

Grade: C

Immediately after Breakker's big win, LA Knight got his moment against Logan Paul. While Paul — who was accompanied to the ring by Machine Gun Kelly — was the hometown hero, the match began with a brawl that saw him get beaten up.

LA Knight is a popular WWE star. However, his in-ring work has never been special. Luckily, Paul brought the best out of him, and the two put on an entertaining match.

Paul losing was the right call, as his two title defenses across a nearly year-long reign were egregious. Now, LA Knight can move on to a feud with Carmelo Hayes and the rest of the SmackDown roster.

Grade: A-

Queen of the Ring Nia Jax gets crowned

Nia Jax defeating Bayley was the biggest letdown of the 2024 SummerSlam event. For one, Bayley has not had a reign that lives up to the euphoric WrestleMania XL victory she had.

Ever since Bayley won the 2024 women's Royal Rumble, her stock has fallen significantly. It is not all her fault, as the WWE seems hesitant to fully buy into her.

To her credit, Jax has been a lot better in-ring in her latest sting with the WWE. Her mid-match smack talk was hilarious. And to the match's credit, it picked up as it went on and had a fun ending.

The most impressive part of the match was Bayley performing a powerbomb on Jax. She showed incredible strength going halfway across the ring before slamming Jax to the mat.

Where they go from SummerSlam will be interesting. Jax is now the Women's Champion and has the looming threat of Tiffany Stratton's Money in the Bank cash-in over her head.

Grade: B-

Drew McIntyre beats CM Punk

There were several exciting matches happening at the 2024 SummerSlam. However, the match between CM Punk and Drew McIntyre may have topped the list. Add Seth “Freakin” Rollins as the special guest referee, and you have a main event-worthy match.

Yes, CM Punk is admittedly slower than his prime. But he looked a lot better than his AEW run and held his own against McIntyre. Of course, McIntyre had to carry most of the match on his shoulders, but the dynamic worked for the pieces in play.

Adding Rollins in as the referee only made the match better. While he hates both men involved, Rollins has some sympathy for Punk, preventing a chair shot from McIntyre.

The match began with Rollins not giving a care about it. Seeing him relaxing on the ropes was a funny image. As the match progressed, he became more involved.

Punk doing exactly what he claims McIntyre has been, which is being his own worst enemy, was poetic. He cost himself when he noticed Rollins was wearing the bracelet McIntyre originally stole. It was a clever way of redirecting Punk's anger at Rollins, thus setting up a match between the two.

Grade: A

Another Judgement Day betrayal as Gunther wins the World Heavyweight Championship

Despite only having two or three weeks to build their feud, Gunther and Damian Priest delivered. Their promo work on the last few episodes of RAW leading into SummerSlam was great.

Gunther won the 2024 King of the Ring tournament, which landed him an opportunity to face the world champion of his choosing at SummerSlam.

The biggest issue with winning that opportunity nearly three months in advance is it is hard to build around that. What if Priest had lost the championship after Gunther immediately announced that he was going after the World Heavyweight Championship?

It all ended up okay, as Gunther and Priest had the most physical match of the night. Priest may be Gunther's toughest opponent, even more so than Ilja Dragunov and Sheamus, as he busted open his chest with chops.

Gunther is one of the WWE's biggest gems, and SummerSlam further proved that. While his slow pace may be frustrating, the brutality and moves he chains together are always amazing to see. He also sold for Priest like a champ, making him look like a thousand bucks in defeat.

Finn Bálor turning on Priest became obvious when Morgan and Ripley opened the 2024 SummerSlam card. Now, Priest and Bálor have a high-profile feud that is unpredictable thanks to the former losing his World Heavyweight Championship.

Additionally, Gunther can build up to a match at Bash in Berlin later in August. We will have to wait and see who steps up as his first challenger.

Grade: A+

Roman Reigns returns during Cody Rhodes vs. Solo Sikoa

At SummerSlam, the second-ever Bloodline Rules match happened (the first was at WrestleMania XL). This stipulation is more of a preface to fans that returns will be happening.

Cody Rhodes vs. Solo Sikoa began with a slow pace akin to a Roman Reigns match. Eventually, the Tonga brothers — Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa — came out to beat down Rhodes. The duo of Randy Orton and Kevin Owens returned to fend them off.

However, Jacob Fatu was nowhere to be seen. He would later make his presence known, hitting a Whisper in the Wind on Rhodes and putting him through the announce table.

After taking himself out, Fatu stayed on the ground as Reigns' revamped WrestleMania XL music hit. Just as he did at SummerSlam 2020, Roman Reigns returned at the 2024 event with a shirt that read “OTC,” presumably for Original Tribal Chief.

He ran to the ring, and Superman punched and speared Sikoa before staring down Rhodes. Roman Reigns seemed to smirk, perhaps indicating respect towards the man who dethroned him after a 1,300+ day reign as Universal Champion.

Or, it could be that Roman Reigns wants to reclaim his throne after dealing with Bloodline business. Either way, SummerSlam left WWE fans with more questions than answers.

Grade: A+"

After a second song from Jelly Roll, Rhea Ripley made her way out to challenge Liv Morgan for the women's world title. Dominik Mysterio accompanied Mami as usual.

Morgan rolled out of the ring to play some mind games, but The Eradicator gave chase. The champion smiled as Ripley looked frustrated at not being able to catch her. She finally faked Morgan out and got her hands on her.

Dom cheered as Mami hit a series of clotheslines followed by a suplex. Ripley sold an injured shoulder as if it was dislocated so she could pop it back in eventually.

Morgan began focusing on the injury. Dom sacrificed himself to save Ripley from a suicide dive, but seeing him hurt upset her more. She popped her shoulder back in and went after the champ.

With the exception of the dislocated shoulder being a bit cheesy, most of this bout was entertaining. We saw a lot of storytelling, so they were taking their time and making each move count instead of trying to go 100 mph.

Dom stopped Ripley from using a chair and reminded her she couldn't win that way. Morgan used the distraction to hit Oblivion for a close two-count. Dom distracted the ref, and Morgan ended up hitting a second Oblivion on the chair to get the win.

Dom smiled knowing his evil plan had worked.

A lot of this was overbooked and overdramatic, but it was done in such a way that it was easy to have fun with it.

Ripley looked like she wanted to kill Dom after he kissed Morgan, so Raw should be very interesting on Monday.

Result: Morgan defeated Ripley

It was a night of betrayal, shocks and surprises as WWE SummerSlam unfolded in front of 57,000 fans in Cleveland on Saturday.

All eyes were on CM Punk as he wrestled his first televised singles match in over a decade, going toe-to-toe with British star Drew McIntyre to conclude one of the hottest feuds of the year.

But it was “Dirty” Dominik Mysterio who set the tone for the evening long before those two stepped into the ring, turning on Rhea Ripley and The Judgement Day after the Women’s World Championship match opened the show.

The Judgement Day imploded further as the penultimate match of the night concluded, with Finn Balor betraying Damian Priest.

However, the biggest shock of the night came in the main event, which saw Cody Rhodes face Solo Sikoa for the Undisputed Universal Championship - amid rumours of a Roman Reigns return.

After a gruelling battle, “The American Nightmare” secured the three count to defend his title, as the “Tribal Chief” made his first appearance since WrestleMania, returning to attack his own Bloodline.

Many wouldn't have realised but it's already been four months since WrestleMania. Which can only mean one thing. We are into the biggest part of the summer, and if you're a wrestling fan… Oh yes! You guessed it right. We are here for WWE SummerSlam. WWE's second-biggest Pay Per View of the Year, which if reports are to be believed, like WrestleMania is being considered to evolve into a two-night affair is finally here. And going by the type of matches that are lined-up, you've got to believe this is a mini-WrestleMania of sorts.

WWE has undergone a storyline since Mania 40. In the absence of Roman Reigns, Solo Sikoa has assembled his own faction, known as Bloodline 2.0, comprising his cousins Tama Tonga, Tonga Loa and Jacob Fatu. The four of them together have ran roughshod of Friday Night SmackDown over anyone that's come in their way, including the wiseman and WWE Hall of Famer Paul Heyman. And on WWE's biggest night of the Summer, Solo and his henchmen plan on taking down the biggest thorn in the Bloodline's eyes – the Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes, who beat Solo's cousin four months ago in Philadelphia.

The 37th edition of WWE SummerSlam, was brought to you live from Cleveland, Ohio, only second time the PPV comes to the city and the first since 1996. SummerSlam has had a huge significance in WWE history, leaving behind a slew of memorable matches. The Undertaker vs Stone Cold Steve Austin in 1998. The Rock vs Triple H the same year. The Heartbreak Kid Shawn Michaels' return after 4 years from injury. The two best of their generation AJ Styles and John Cena finally having their singles match. You name it and SummerSlam has delivered. This is the first SummerSlam of the TKO era, and with business booming, nothing can be off the charts.

Below are a few pointers regarding WWE SummerSlam 2024:

- Roman Reigns returned to the WWE for the first time since WrestleMania 40 and speared Solo Sikoa.

- Cody Rhodes pinned Solo Sikoa to retain his Undisputed WWE Championship.

- Liv Morgan defeated Rhea Ripley with assist from Dominik Mysterio.

- Bron Breakker beat Sami Zayn for the WWE Intercontinental Championship.

- LA Knight won the United States Championship, beating Logan Paul.

- Drew McIntyre beat CM Punk after with a low blow and a Claymore Kick.

- Gunther defeated Damian Priest with assist from Finn Balor and won the World Heavyweight title."

In an action packed 'Bloodline Rules' match, both Rhodes and his challenger Solo Sikoa were joined at various times in the ring by multiple other wrestlers, including The Bloodline to assist Sikoa, as well as Kevin Owens and Randy Orton coming into bat for Rhodes.

Both men were close to pinning down each other in sometimes scarcely believable circumstances, but it would be the return of Reigns, who has been away since Wrestlemania, that would ultimately be the deciding factor in the match.

Reigns, after slowly making his way towards the ring, would hit Sikoa firstly with a Superman punch, followed by a spear; this gave Rhodes the chance to use his Cross Rhodes to finally put Sikoa to bed and successfully pinning him down.

It was a thrilling end to a great night of wrestling action. as over 54,000 fans piled in to Cleveland Browns Stadium, a record for Summerslam.

Four Titles changed hands, including Gunther winning the World Heavyweight Title off Damian Priest after the latter was betrayed by Finn Balor.

It was not the only instance of betrayal in Cleveland, as earlier in the night, as in the Women's World Championship fight, as Dominik Mysterio betrayed Lea Ripley by causing a distraction, allowing Liv Morgan to retain her title; Mysterio and Morgan shared a kiss post-match, confirming Mysterio's new alligegiance.

Nia Jax was able to gain the WWE Women's Title against Bayley, with a little help from a Tiffany Stratton, whilst Bron Breakker and LA Knight were able to defeat Sami Zayn and local hero Logan Paul to win the WWE Intercontinental Title and WWE United States Championship respectively.

The only match without a title on the line was still an eagerly awaited one, as the feud between CM Punk and Drew McIntyre reached its peak in their match with special guest referee Seth ""Freakin"" Rollins.

There were arguments within the match between all three main men, and though Punk looked like he was about to steal a notable victory, some lapses in concentration allowed McIntyre to get the win via pinfall, though we doubt it is the end of the feud at all.

WWE Summer Slam: Cody Rhodes vs Solo Sikoa WWE Championship match results.,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/wwe-money-bank-2024-live-202045447.html,"Who captured the championship opportunity of a lifetime?

WWE Money in the Bank, one of the biggest premium live events on the wrestling company’s calendar, took place Saturday in Toronto, and it was a chaotic, thrilling night. The event was headlined by the men's and women's Money in the Bank matches, where the winner of each match would earn a contract for a championship opportunity at any point in the next year. One winner tried to cash their briefcase in and it ended in wild fashion.

Three other matches also took place Saturday night. The World Heavyweight and Intercontinental Championships were on the line, and there was a shocking ending in the next chapter of the rivalry between Cody Rhodes and The Bloodline in a six-man tag-team match.

Here's a recap of all the action from Toronto:

The Women's Money in the Bank briefcase.

Drew McIntyre unleashes frustrations on post-show

Losing the World Heavyweight Championship because of CM Punk again is not sitting well with the 2024 Men's Money in the Bank winner.

After the conclusion of Money in the Bank, McIntyre took over the post show and assaulted the referees and Raw general manager Adam Pierce as they tried to stop him. It took Wade Barrett to get McIntyre out of the way.

Cody Rhodes, Kevin Owens and Randy Orton vs. The Bloodline

Kevin Owens has dealt with every iteration of The Bloodline, and he let his frustrations out with a frenzy attack on Tama Tonga before allowing Cody Rhodes and Randy Orton to do the same thing. WWE got its first taste of Jacob Fatu in competition, and he showed why he is regarded as one of the most intense wrestlers in the world, recovering from vintage Orton quickly and taking apart ""The Viper"" and setting his family up to launch an offensive attack.

Orton was able to get Owens in so he could continue his frenzy, but The Bloodline was able to neutralize him this time around. Owens got the majority of the beating and there were several times he tried to get a tag before The Bloodline would get in the way and punish him more. Owens eventually got Rhodes in and that's when he teed off on Solo Sikoa. The champion took his eyes off Sikoa by targeting the rest of the faction, which gave Sikoa enough time to land a spear on Rhodes. He went for the pin and Rhodes kicked out.

Sikoa inadvertently took the referee out and Rhodes, Owens and Orton all hit signature moves on Sikoa. The match erupted in chaos, including Owens sending Fatu through the announcer's table. The action got brought into the ring, and when Rhodes went for three CrossRhodes on Sikoa, Fatu got up and took the champion out. He set up the new ""Tribal Chief"" with a Samoan spike. The referee was dragged into the ring for the count and Sikoa got the pin on the champion for the win for The Bloodline in its first major victory in its new era.

Analysis: The Bloodline is asserting itself back on top of WWE, and it has made a statement. The Bloodline needed to win on Saturday more than its opponents if it wanted to be seen as a legitimate new version of this dominant faction. Jacob Fatu's debut was incredible and showed why there is so much hype surrounding him. For Sikoa to get the pin on Rhodes, he absolutely earned a shot at the Undisputed WWE Championship. Roman Reigns isn't back and who knows if or when he'll be back, but The Bloodline is doing just fine with its new ""Tribal Chief.""

Women's Money in the Bank match

It was clear Chelsea Green was the crowd favorite after the pop on her entrance and Samantha Irvin’s signature announcement. Green also got the match started with a laugh by trying to jump to get the briefcase once the match started.

Each star got their own chance to shine, like when Zoey Stark utilized the ladder in several ways to punish Lyra Valkyria and Tiffany Stratton launched herself off the top turnbuckle and took out other stars. It took time for someone to climb up and make an attempt to grab the briefcase, and once Valkyria was the first to do so, all stars then duked to get on the ladder. After back-and-forth blows using the ladder, Naomi was standing alone ready to grab the briefcase, only for Green to emerge to stop the threat and hit her opponent's face off the ladder. Last year's winner Iyo Sky and Stark met at the top of the ladder and Sky delivered a wicked piledriver onto the perpendicular ladder.

Green was open and just when she grabbed the briefcase, Stratton came out and not only shook the ladder, knocked Green off and into the tables out of the ring in a hard-hitting spot. Stratton was left alone, and she grabbed the briefcase to become Ms. Money in the Bank.

Analysis: What a spectacular match. The women laid it all on the line and deserve major props for the wild bumps they had. The creativity was among the best in recent Money in the Bank match memory and raised the bar for how good it can be.

Stratton had a quick rise on the main roster, but it looked like it wasn't going to amount to much and she would be a flash in the pan. Instead, Money in the Bank is on ""Tiffy Time,"" and it's a great move for WWE to put another woman's star in the conversation as one of the faces of the brand. There is a reason she's already won over the crowd; she can talk and she backs it up in the ring. The Women's Money in the Bank winner has always ended up as a champion, and it looked like Stratton is not far from having gold around her waist.

World Heavyweight Championship match: Damian Priest (c) vs. Seth Rollins

Drew McIntyre's threat of cashing in his Money in the Bank contract on Saturday loomed large in the championship match. Both stars had a sense of urgency to get the match over and get out of the arena as quickly as possible.

With Damian Priest and Seth Rollins on high alert, they each tried to land big strike after big strike in a match that was never slow. Rollins and Priest traded powerbombs, then had a sequence of kicks to each other. Rollins landed his patented curb-stomp and went for the pin but Priest kicked out. The champion went for his own knockout move with his razor-edge, ending in the same result: Rollins getting out of the pin. There was a confusing moment when Rollins hit the falcon's arrow and went for the pin on Priest, and even though it didn't look like Priest kicked out, the referee didn't count to three.

McIntyre then came out and cashed his Money in the Bank contract, making it a triple-threat match. McIntyre went for the claymore kick on Rollins to take the title, but Priest came out to clothesline him.

Then just like at Clash at the Castle, CM Punk emerged and unleashed a relentless assault on McIntyre, hitting him with a chair and choking him out with a cable. Punk took the championship title and knocked McIntyre out with it. Priest delivered a choke-slam to McIntyre to retain his title.

Punk has cost McIntyre again by wasting his contract, and he also cost Rollins from chasing the title as long as Priest is champion.

Analysis: The CM Punk-Drew McIntyre rivalry continues to deliver. Fans knew neither Priest nor Rollins was going to win this match without the 2024 Men's Money in the Bank winner getting in the fold. Punk's interference was his most ruthless assault on McIntyre yet, surely sending a message he is close to officially competing in the ring. The match didn't really set the next steps for Priest and his championship, and the botched pin spoiled it, but Punk and McIntyre are one step closer to finally getting a match and putting on a banger in the ring.

John Cena surprises

There is something about Money in the Bank and John Cena.

Trish Stratus announced a surprise guest on Saturday: 16-time WWE Champion Cena. His music hit and the crowd erupted, making another entrance like he did at Money in the Bank 2021.

Cena then revealed he will retire from WWE in 2025, and it appears WrestleMania 41 will be his last match.

The GREATEST OF ALL TIME is here!

Intercontinental Championship match: Sami Zayn (c) vs. Bron Breakker

Sami Zayn had the home-country advantage, but Bron Breakker wasn't fazed, going quickly after the champion. However, Zayn isn't just some squash opponent; he has finesse and is one of the smartest wrestlers in the company, and he showed he wouldn't go down easy, taking some shots that seemed to surprise the challenger.

There were spots where Breakker would deliver one of his signature hard-hitting counters to get on offense, including a Franken-steiner to Zayn off the top rope. Breakker had words for Zayn after he kicked out and they went outside of the ring. Breakker tried to do his top-speed spear around the ring, only for Zayn to jump over. Breakker didn't run into the steel steps, so he had time to recover, get onto the mat and deliver a flying clothesline to Zayn off the announcer's table.

Breakker had the opening and went for the final blow. Zayn got out of the way and clipped him. With the challenger hanging off the turnbuckle, Zayn delivered a massive kick, knocking Breakker out and getting the pin to retain the title.

Analysis: Anyone could have made the case for either star to win, but it made sense for Breakker to get his first big push now. He has unlimited potential and a win would have launched his career to new heights. Zayn is the ideal champion who can compete with anybody on the roster and won't go down easily.

While Breakker was able to showcase his power and speed, he learned his opponents aren't just going to be out in seconds. It takes skill to win, and it'll be something for him to work on as he works his way up to the top. Don't be surprised if this isn't the only meeting between the two.

Men's Money in the Bank match

The chaos started as soon as the bell rang, and Drew McIntyre emerged as the first person to attempt to grab the briefcase, only for the quick ending to be spoiled by Chad Gable and Andrade. ""El Idolo"" then did an impressive Spanish fly to Hayes and onto the ladder. The crowd was clearly loving the energy.

LA Knight and Jey Uso were the fan favorites and traded barbs at the top of the ladder, with the crowd chanting ""yeet"" and ""yeah"" with every blow. Hayes disrupted the moment and had a chance to grab the ladder, only to again be taken out by Andrade. Andrade then delivered an insane sunset flip power bomb to Hayes onto the ladder. Moments later, Gable launched LA Knight out of the ring and to a ladder out of the ring.

Gable went to get the briefcase, but Uso moved the ladder, leaving Gable hanging off the briefcase. He couldn't grab it and fell face-first onto the mat. Uso had a prime chance to win, only for McIntyre to hit Uso with a ladder. It knocked him off, and McIntyre was all by himself. He climbed the ladder and grabbed the briefcase to secure his championship opportunity.

Analysis: There were plenty of spots to create some stunning moves that a Money in the Bank match is expected to have. It was easy to tell there were only three contenders who really had a chance to win, and while it was expected, McIntyre's victory makes sense given he has the best story going right now since WrestleMania.

Trish Stratus kicks off Money in the Bank

WWE Hall of Famer and Toronto native Trish Stratus is the host of Money in the Bank, and she got the night started by welcoming the crowd to Scotiabank Arena. Ring announcer Samantha Irvin then sang the U.S. national anthem and artist Rylan James sang the Canada national anthem.

Triple H: ‘Few surprises in the tank’ for Money in the Bank

Will there be a shocking ending or dramatic return on Saturday night?

Ahead of Money in the Bank, WWE chief content officer Paul “Triple H” Levesque dropped a hint that fans may get something extra during the premium live event.

“Got a few surprises in the tank. So, it’s going to be a fun night,” Levesque said on social media.

World Heavyweight Championship match stipulation

There will be some high stakes in the World Heavyweight Championship match between Damian Priest and Seth Rollins. If Rollins wins, then Priest must leave The Judgment Day, but if Priest wins, then Rollins cannot challenge for the title as long as Priest remains champion.

Why Bron Breakker can become WWE’s next superstar

Cody Rhodes says prior to his entrance music “Wrestling has more than one royal family,” and while it’s true, there’s another WWE star making a solid case for his family to be in the picture.

Son of Rick Steiner and nephew of Scott Steiner – both WWE Hall of Famers – Bron Breakker has exploded onto the scene ever since he arrived at the company in 2021. He won the NXT Championship twice and the NXT Tag Team Championship, and since his callup to the main roster, he’s become someone with unlimited potential. He’s been nothing but dominant since his arrival, and he’ll have the biggest match of his young career Saturday when he challenges Sami Zayn for the Intercontinental Championship during WWE's 2024 Money in The Bank event.

So even though he isn’t exactly a “genetic freak” like his uncle, Breakker has proven there is no star like him.

“With what I'm doing, I'm not so sure anyone's ever done it before,” Breakker told USA TODAY Sports.

Who is in The Bloodline?

This isn’t the same version of The Bloodline WWE fans got used to seeing just a few months ago.

Roman Reigns hasn’t been seen since he lost the Undisputed Universal Championship at WrestleMania 40, and taking his place is Solo Sikoa, who was previously appointed the Tribal Chief in-waiting. He’s brought on some more family too, first bringing in Tama Tonga in April. At Backlash France, Tonga’s brother Tanga Loa debuted. Lastly, Jacob Fatu joined the faction in June.

The 38-year-old had previously said he'd like to retire from wrestling at 40, but it seems he's changed his mind after signing a contract extension with WWE.

In an interview with Justin Walker, Rhodes confirmed that he's signed a new WWE contract and it will keep him wrestling past his 40th birthday in June 2025.

""[The contract] extends beyond my 40th birthday,"" Rhodes shared. ""The plan is still, when it's time to step out, to step out without it being a painful process.

""Solely because I saw my dad [Dusty Rhodes] as an old man wrestler and he loved it and enjoyed it, but as his son, it was hard to see.

""My daughter is two going on three, there does have to be a time, just like he was with us, where I have to be home all the time and be there with her. It's not 40 anymore,"" he added.

""I'll update the number. I hit this prime run late in the game. I often forget that I'm nearing 40.""

They made it a Bloodline Rules match at the last minute, and that led to great anticipation for exactly how it would play out.

First, a surprise — Arn Anderson backstage to greet Cody during his walkout, letting him know he still had friends and he wouldn’t have to go it alone against The Bloodline. Sure enough, Kevin Owens and Randy Orton both returned on this show to help fight off Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa.

But that still left Jacob Fatu, and he showed up just in time to save Sikoa from sure defeat, taking Rhodes out along the way, leaving him vulnerable to Solo. And it was about to be the end too, with the Spike.

Except none other than Roman Reigns made his return.

And he laid Sikoa out cold with a Superman punch and a Spear.

He gave Rhodes a nod and then left the ring so he could do what he was going to do. One more Cross Rhodes finished it off.

Reigns looked downright disappointed. But there’s much to unpack there.

Four new champions, CM Punk returns to the ring and Roman Reigns returns.

Triple H up next

First he thinks the sponsors and the media before getting into the events of SummerSlam. Biggest he thinks the fans of Cleveland for helping them put on a great show. The fans were allowed at most times in Cleveland should get credit. He said they continue to set records in attendance and revenue from PLEs. He then thanked Jelly Roll for making the show extra special not only singing, but getting involved physically. Triple H really says nice things about Sami Zayn. Good to hear. He also says Bronn Breakker is a star and he's 100% right. Triple H then runs down the show and sing the Praises of just about everyone who competed. They all deserve it he's not lying in any way. Triple H runs down the rest of the year PLEs and says fans have a lot to be excited for.

The first question compares the main roster right now to NXT when Triple H ran it. It's a great question because the WWE main roster PLEs have been top notch since Wrestlemania 40. Even before that they were great but the new format of running a few matches but making them all important has made the shows more enjoyable from where I sit. To ask why WWE has been working with TNA Wrestling. Triple H says we're open for business. He said they're going to look at what's best for WWE and if it benefits them he will work with anyone. He said working with other promotions gives his younger guy reps and that's how you get better. He said for other people to grow they need to create opportunities. And working in for a live crowds does just that. He's asked if Stephanie McMahon has a role in a company after she appeared on camera. He said she does not but he loves to see her around and that she loves the business. I'm not sure if he delayed his answer but you can tell he loved having her there. That's pretty adorable! He said we'll see what the future holds and he expects to see her around because she loves being around wrestling. Long time wrestling reporter Bill Apter was asked where John Cena was. Triple H says he'll be back by the Royal Rumble to begin his Last Dance. He said he's looking forward to crafting the story and praised Cena for his incredible career. He was asked if SummerSlam will be two nights from here on out. He says as they continue to grow he'll take it step by step. He said he's excited about the opportunity to see what happens.

Bronn Breakker up next

Bronn Breakker talks about having his dad Rick Steiner and at two nights match uncle Scott Steiner. He said he was happy to have them there it's such a big moment of his career. Breakker looks very happy about his championship win, he can't stop smiling. You're always trying to BigE really says some nice things about the new Intercontinental Champion and since the sky is the limit for him. Big E would know, he was quite the champion. Monday night he wants to elevate the IC championship that'll be tough considering with the past two Champions have done. But for him the sky is the limit as Big E said. Breakker then talks about Sami Zayn giving him a chance and says he respects him. It was a great answer for a young guy and he's going to do wonders for the championship.

Cody Rhodes up next

It sounds like Cody Rhodes will be the final wrestler taking part in a presser. I was hoping we'd get Roman Reigns but I understand why we don't. I assume we'll find out why he did what he did on SmackDown. It'll be a long six days! The first question is about Cody's dog. They said this is his final premium live event. I was worried he was sick but luckily it sounds like he just retiring. Congrats Pharaoh! Cody says he is 2-0 in Bloodline rules matches. He credits Roman reigns with helping him keep the championship tonight. Did you ever think that would happen at Wrestlemania 40 when you saw Cody the feet Roman. He said WWE fans wanted Roman and boy was Cody right. Cody is asked they go from here, he said he doesn't know but acknowledged Roman Reigns deserves a rematch. He prayed Roman for being a great wrestler and said wrestling him is hard. Roman might get a title shot but I think he's going to be busy with Solo and Bloodline 2.0 before he turns his attention to the American Nightmare.

They ask Cody about on Anderson. He said Arn is a huge part of his story. He said since his dad can't be with him he's happy to have a guy who was close to his dad you with him. He said Arn is a visionary and brought up the promo in AEW where Arn Anderson talk about appointment gun. He talks about having a hall of famers at tonight's show, then said he hopes we see more of Arn Anderson in the future.

He talks about the future and really seems excited. Cody has been a workhorse since coming back to WWE minus the time on the shelf with his injury. He'd lose a lot of credit for carrying the company doing a very important time. he certainly has help but he's been the man.

LA Knight wins US title! Yeah!

LA Knight is up next. He said he's been drinking Hard Lemonade to prepare for the presser but he looks fine. He's asked about beating a guy who is new to the business while he is a long time veteran. ""The things that I'm looking for maybe not quite getting the recognition of looking for out at the same time if I don't see it the damn sure nobody else can see it so for me and he I don't know if I'm empty headed or what but I don't have to quit."" He talks about never quitting even as a kid. He proved that tonight by winning the US championship. Anyway this is the first time I remember LA Knight doing a presser. He's very well spoken, he gives good interviews and he's truly a star. And we work for this, happy to see it! Knight is asked who is next challenger should be if it's not Logan Paul. He said he just won the damn thing before saying there are many different contenders for the championship. He said anybody who wants to challenge him will get a shot. That was the last question and he's out. Yeah!

Gunther celebrates

They ask Gunther if his championship match with marred by Finn Balor turning on Damian Priest. Gunther says no and he's right. It's not his job to make sure his opponent has friends he can depend on. Priest is great but he lost. Gunther had nothing to do with that.

McIntyre speaks after beating Punk

Drew McIntyre praises CM Punk, and Wade Barrett celebrate with Drew. They show Punk listening to Drew's presser and he looks unhppy. Who can blame him. Not only did he lose but there was no sign of Larry in Cody Rhodes was allowed to bring his dog to the match. Doesn't seem fair to me. McIntyre says it's funny that punk doesn't drink but spends all his time in rehab, alleging he's always hurt. Punk, McIntyre and Rollins have been , incredible, and it appears this feud will continue. We all win.

Tiffany Stratton and Nia Jax start presser

Jax starts by asking where her congratulations is. Jax gets emotional when talking about how she went from unemployed to Queen of the Ring and champion. They asked Nia a question but she defers to Tiffy. She said she helped my Jax win the title. They then talk about Stratton's new pink Money in the Bank briefcase. How long until wrestling dolls come with that?Stratton said she was handpicked to be Nia Jax's bestie. They do look like they're having fun together. Nia really goes out of her way to praise Tiffy. Let's hope it turns out better than last time she had a bestie.

Overall Summerslam thoughts

I was excited going in and the show exceeded my expectations. Roman is back, Judgment Day might be dead, Gunther is a new champion, so is Nia Jax, LA Knight and Bronn Breakker, Dirty Dom has a new girlfriend and nothing has been settled between CM Punk, Seth Rollins and Drew McIntyre. Great night of wrestling and lots of issues to still work out. Great PLE. Only downside, man I like Roman Reigns has a bad guy. He has a lot of work to do to be as good a good guy as he was during the past 4 years and the biggest jerk in the game. If anyone can do it it's him.

Cody Rhodes defeats Solo Sikoa

He needed to help arguably his biggest rival in WWE but Cody Rhodes walks out of SummerSlam with the title. Solo did himself well, look strong and never looked at a place. He's come a long way since making his debut two years ago and he'll continue to be a big player in WWE.

Roman Reigns is back

Roman Reigns' music hit and he's slowly makes his way down the aisle. The head of the table has returned to claim his seat. But he has issues with both guys so who will he go after? It's solo and he hits a Superman punch and the tribal Chief is a good guy. He hits a spear glances over at Cody, acknowledges the crowd and walks to the back. The best wrestler in the past five years has returned and WWE just got even better. But Cody still has work to do.

Cody hits another Crossrhoads and pins Solo. He locks eyes with Roman Reigns as he gets his hands raised. You have to think Roman has issue with Solo but he'll eventually won his belt back. Welcome back Roman Reigns.

Cody Rhodes defeats solo Sikoa

It took some help from Roman Reigns but Cody Rhodes defeated the fake Tribal Chief with help from Roman Reigns. Good match that had some moments but obviously the best part was Roman returning. This will set up roaming against Solo at some point and gives WWE yet another top guy -- actually the top guy. You were missed Roman, welcome back! Score: 88 out of 100.

Solo Sikoa vs. Cody Rhodes, Bloodline Rules!

This is going to be a wild ride! Last Bloodline Rules match was incredible. This should be just as good! Solo lives up to his name, coming out alone. That likely won't last. Cody comes out with his dog. WWE does a great job promoting stars with dogs. If you want to be like them, visit your shelter and get a homeless dog or cat. You won't regret it. Arn Anderson is there! He's giving Cody a pep talk! This is great! Anderson says Cody has friends. Wonder who he is acknowledging? I hope they smash em. Cody has defended the title four times since winning it. Does that mean live events are nontitle or they don't count? Bell rings and we are off! Cody Rhodes hits a couple shoulder blocks but Solo Sikoa shake them off. The fans are really going nuts early in the match. They lock up again Cody goes to slap the Sikoa in the face but he blocks it and they're back to square one. Sikoa takes over on the outside. He Rams Cody's head into the steps and ass fans to acknowledge him. They respond telling him they'd rather not. Sikoa hits a nice spin kick and gets a two count. Then he hits a big back body drop. Cody Rhodes is in trouble. He hits a Samoan drop and shows off the Samoan Spike but Cody avoids it and drills a Cody cutter. Solo is sent to the floor and Cody goes to work ramming him into the barricade and now get hydrated and hits Solo with a drink. Solo hits a power bomb and gets a two count. If Rhodes doesn't start making a comeback, it might not matter that this is Bloodline Rules. Because right now Solo looks like he needs no help. Another Samoan drop in Solo looks to have this match in hand. Of course Cody Rhodes has been down before. I almost feel like I'm waiting for interference instead of enjoying this match. Eric Bischoff said this week that fans wearing clamoring for Roman Reigns to come back. I like Eric Bischoff, I enjoy his podcast and I think he was great in WCW, but he couldn't be more wrong about fans not wanting Roman Reigns back. You want him back, I want him back and anyone who loves wrestling wants him back. He was so good at champion and I can't wait to see what he does tonight. Assuming he comes back.

Solo is really putting on a good match here. He's another guy who's really stepped up. They have an abundance of big guys, many are young and can really go. It's exciting to see where this roster will go because there's no shortage of stars. Cody hits a superplex and both men are looking for a second wind. Crazy how easy these guys jump up to the top rope. I remember when only Rob Van Dam could do that. Now you got 300 pounders doing it and Cody just made it look very easy. Cody hits a Crossrhoads, and two members of the Bloodline interfere. You know how they say the war games have now begun? Well Bloodline Rules has now begun! They hit a double team move but Cody kicks out. And here comes Kevin Owens. Owen goes after all three members of the Bloodline. Only Jacob Fatu is missing. Owen takes control but eventually gets cut off so who's next? It's Randy Orton and he's jogging to the ring to even out the odds. Orton hits an RKO then Owens hits a stunner. I would assume this would bring out Jacob for two because now Orton hit the power slam on Solo followed by a senton on Solo. Cody hits another Crossrhoads in Solo kicked out. Solo ain't no job or he looks good. RKO battles back to the locker room with the two members of the Bloodline as Cody looks to win the match. He brings in the steps and stalks a Solo. Steps in the Solo's face and does it again. He goes for a third with Solo spears him. He's Now setting up the steps in the corner and he does not look like he has good intentions. Cody hits a third Crossrhoads. A fourth. And before you can hit a fifth he gets crushed by a Jacob Fatu flying somersault off the top rope. But Cody kicks out before solo can pin him. Who is coming out next? I think it's the former champion of the winners' bracket.

Jacob Fatu it's a super kick putting Cody on the table and we know Fatu can fly. He just put Cody through a table and it appears he hurt his ankle but he's popping up because he's a warrior. Cody is a warrior too but he can't get up, he was just smushed. Solo hits a frog splash but Cody kicks at out at two. Will Cody get some help? Believe that! Cody hits a super kick and a Cody cutter. And there we have it stand up and throw your ones up. The Tribal Chief has returned!

Awesome Truth appear to talk SummerSlam attendance

It's announced 57,701 people are there. A-Town Down come out to talk trash to the former champs. They rip the Browns, which is fair. Then Jelly Roll. Truth calls A-Town Down the Rock and Roll Express. Jelly Roll hits both members of A-Town Down with a chair and they celebrate!

Gunther defeats Damian Priest to win championship

It took Finn Balor turning on his Judgment Day teammate, but Gunther is your new world heavyweight champion. Glad Balor is getting elevated to a big feud, glad Gunther got the belt and happy for Priest, who isn't a potential star. He's a huge star. Score: 87 out of 100

Gunther vs. Damian Priest

This should be another classic. There are as many top guys in WWE now than ever before. That's a bold statement, but true. And two of the best are ready to battle it out for the title. Challenger is out first, followed by the champ. Priest goes to work on Gunther. They're going back and forth. These are two of the best hosses in the game. So far it's what you would expect, two big dudes pounding on each other. Gunther is bleeding, but he's not backing down, hitting Priest with chops. Priest is doing soccer kicks. For as big as these dudes are, they can move! Fans are quieter for this match, they shouldn't be. Now they're getting behind them. That was fast! Priest hits the chokeslam but can't get the pin. Gunther is pounding Damian, and things look bleak for the champ. Finn Balor comes to ringside. Gunther continues the beatdown. Balor encourages Priest, but Gunther cheapshots the Irishman. Priest with two viscous clothesline. Then a chokeslam. Balor puts Gunther's foot on the rope. That's not nice! Priest sees the replay. Balor and Priest lock eyes, but Gunther pulls him in and chokes him out but he recovers and kicks out. But Gunther hits a powerbomb when Priest attacks Balor and he gets put choked out. We have a new champ.

Drew McIntyre pins CM Punk

Rollins leaves after counting the three. Now Punk has a serious problem. He lost, he's made an enemy out of Rollins, and McIntyre gets the win and takes back the bracelet. How did Larry make that? That's a talented dog. McIntyre puts his foot on Punk's chest and walks out. Punk looked good, there were lots of bells and whistles, and all three men still have issue with each other. Great match. Score: 92 out of 100.

CM Punk vs. Drew McIntyre, Seth Rollins special guest referee

Rollins has a smoking hot referee jacket. He looks like he's ready to do his job! McIntyre out next, and he looks unhappy as always. Crazy that this match is No. 3 on the card. Shows how deep and talented the WWE roster is. I hate to sound like Gorilla Monsoon, but this could be a main event anywhere in the country! McIntyre requests Punk make his entrance and just like that we hear Cult of Personality. Punk says it's clobbering time and he's headed to his first singles match at a WWE PLE in a long time! And they're off beating each other up. Punk takes over and is thrown out of the corner by Seth. As he argued, McIntyre takes over. Punk hits a flying clothesline and is punching him. Drew hits a throat shot and then a nasty chop. Punk throws him out. This is fun. But Punk looks beat up. He hits a flying clothesline off the apron. This is going to be a slobberknocker, JR! Rollins has a wardrobe malfunction and his tending to his shoes as Punk hits some cheapshots on the stairs. Fans are singing Rollins song and this is a giant party in Cleveland. McIntyre swings Punk's head into the announce table, and he has the edge. Rollins is an incredible wrestler, but not very good as a ref. He just let McIntyre slingshot Punk into the ring apron. That's allegedly steel! Punk throws a wild punch ala Terry Funk! Love it! Punk is taking a beating and is thrown across the ring. Rollins didn't make the count. He's struggling in his first night as a ref. We can criticize, but we've never done it! McIntyre gets warned by Rollins, now he's grabbing a chair. Wonder if it's shaved down? Rollins and McIntyre discuss the chair situation, and McIntyre says if he does it, their problems go away. He's got a point. He allows it, then doesn't, grabbing the chair. They're yelling more. Rollins really needs to study before reffing his next match. This isn't his calling. McIntyre puts on Punk's bracelet and calls for the kick, but Punk is the one who delivers a kick. He then hits a neckbreaker and he's in control. Punk is taking over. He's now going for an elbow drop. He blows a kiss to Rollins and delivers it. But Punk kicks out. He goes for the anaconda vice and then he reclaims his bracelet. But turns around and eats a Claymore kick, but kicks out at 2. McIntyre goes for a DDT, but Punk escapes. He goes for a G2S, but sees Rollins wearing the bracelet. He drops McIntyre and goes after Rollins. Rollins is bumped to the outside, Punk hits a Go To Sleep, McIntyre kicks out after a delayed count. Rollins and Punk are arguing again. Rollins hit him in the chest, which is unprofessional. Punk hits a G2S on Rollins, which was uncalled for. Then he puts on the bracelet and goes after McIntyre who kicks him low. Then he hits a Claymore. Rollins counts out Punk. What a match!

Hawk Tuah girl at Summer Slam

The 'Hawk Tuah' girl who went viral with a funny video a few weeks back is at SummerSlam. Haliey Welch is her name and while she went viral for a strange reason, she's made the most out of her new found fame. She's also given back, donating her time and money to animal rescues. Glad she's a wrestling fan!

Nia Jax defeats Bayley for WWE Women's Championship

Bayley took a licking and eventually couldn't keep on ticking. Jax overpowered her and thanks to the Tiffany Stratton failed attempt to cash in, Nia keeps the belt and Tiffy keeps the briefcase. Score: 71 out of 100.

Nia Jax vs. Bayley

The challenging queen is out first. Heavy is the head of she who wears the crown, but in this match, that would be Bayley, right? Bayley starts out hot but Jax overpowers her pretty easily. Jax hits a stinkface in honor of her cousin. Or uncle. Someone in her bloodline did that. Bayley is taking a whooping here, but she fights back with a choke. That's turned into a standing gourdbuster and Jax hits a senton. Wow, that looked painful! But not enough for a three count. Still, Jax has control. She missed a Matt Hardy leg drop, and Bayley hits the Bayley to belly but gets a two count. Three wrestlers used that as a finish, her, Magnum TA and Shane Douglas. Who had the best? Jax back in control now. She goes for a sitdown splash off the second rope, nails it but only gets a two count. I'm not sure I ever saw anyone kick out of that before. Jax is still in control. Bayley hits a dive to the floor, but Jax catches her and hits a Samoan slam on the floor. Bayley is earning her check tonight. Jax goes for another, but Bayley hits a powerbomb out of the corner. Bayley is strong! Macho Man elbow and scores a two count. They're working hard! Wait, it's Tiffy Time! She tries to cash in, but Bayley cuts her off. She then tries to take over on Jax, but she eats a powerbomb. Another powerbomb. Then a sitdown splash. And another. It's over. Queen Nia is the champion!

WWE Judgement Day

Is this the end of the Judgement Day? With Dirty Dom Mysterio turning on Rhea Ripley, someone is obviously out. But what happens to Damian Priest, who still has a huge match tonight? He yelled at the other members of the faction after Ripley was defeated. Will this be the end of the Judgement Day? I hope not, they've been fun, but you have to think they'll at least look different at Monday Night Raw.

Will Roman Reigns come back at SummerSlam 2024?

Nothing is official, but he has to right? Solo Sikoa has run the Tribal Chief down, he's beaten up Paul Heyman, he's called himself the Tribal Chief and he said Roman isn't coming back. If he doesn't, maybe Sikoa is officially the new Tribal Chief. But I think he does. And I think he's the reason Cody Rhodes wins.

LA Knight defeats Logan Paul for US championship

Knight has been hot for more than a year now, and he finally cashes in with a championship. Logan Paul has been a fine champ, but Knight deserved this one. Score: 81 out of 100.

LA Knight vs. Logan Paul with Machine Gun Kelly

Logan Paul is coming out with Machine Gun Kelly. Paul is letting MGK carry the championship to the ring. This is something I bet a lot of old school fans love! LA Knight comes in the Prime Mobile, breaks out the windows and heads to the ring. YEAH! Knight starts off strong outside the ring, bouncing the champ around ringside. Knight continues to pour it on, hitting a TKO neckbreaker on the table. It doesn't break and both men are banged up. YEAH! The two have battled back and forth, lots going on but nobody close to winning. In fact, it's been a very back and forth affair thus far. Paul can really wrestle. Knight can too. Logan Paul is showing courage in this match, unlike this week when he tweeted an incorrect statement about an Olympic boxer, then apologized for being wrong, but wouldn't allow comments and made the tweet about something else completely. Sorry, X. He does hit a springboard moonsault and drilled Knight. Paul hit a big punch and got a two count. Knight beats up Paul's entourage, but MGK is giving Paul brass knuckles. That's unsportsmanlike. He nails a punch, goes for the slingshot clothesline, but walks into a LA Knight finisher and he wins. It's Knight time in Cleveland! New US champion.

Bronn Breakker wins Intercontinental championship

Breakker ends Zayn's title reign that began at Wrestlemania 40. He's also been featured on just about every PLE since winning the title, and has had some amazing matches on Raw. Great run for Sami, but Bronn Breakker is a star and this belt is a stepping stone to bigger things. He's a top guy waiting to happen. Score: 75 out of 100.

Rick Steiner, Scott Steiner must be proud

The Steiner brothers are among the greatest tag teams in wrestling. And tonight, Scott's nephew, Rick's son, Bronn Breakker won his first main roster title. Scott Steiner is an all-time great as Big Poppa Pump, and his nephew has the skills to surpass him. Congrats, Steiners.

Bronn Breakker vs. Sami Zayn

Breakker is out first. Zayn out next and the champion starts out hot, hitting a plancha on the bigger challenger. Breakker is favoring his shoulder, but he is able to dodge a Helluva kick. Breakker hits a FrankenSteiner and he might be the best athlete in wrestling. That's a bold statement, but I can't see anyone his size who can do the things he can do. It's sick. Zayn recovers and hits a Blue Thunder Bomb, but only gets a two count. Breakker hits a spear that is nastier than any other spear you'll see. He hits another and wins the belt.

Damian Priest unhappy with Dom

Damian Priest comes in the Judgment Day locker room and he's livid about what happened. Finn Balor says he had no idea Dom Mysterio was going to do that. Priest stormed off. He has bigger fish to fry, he can't get involved in these affairs of the heart! Good news for Buddy Murphy, I guess, he gets his girl back. It shows that no matter how bad of a guy you are, you can always make a heel turn!

Liv Morgan defeats Rhea Ripley with help from Dirty Dom

It was a good match, both worked hard and the story continues. Score: 86 out of 100

Rhea Ripley vs. Liv Morgan

Rhea comes out with Dirty Dom Mysterio. They look quite the happy couple. I guess Michael Cole likes Rhea's outfit, he said it looks like the Badda Bing. Whataya gonna do? Liv is out and looks very happy for a woman who was recently dumped on national TV. I wonder what helped her get over him. Ripley dominated early, but she hurt her recently healed shoulder and now Liv is going to work. Liv worked on Rhea's arm, but when she went for a suicide dive, Dom took the bullet for Rhea. Oh my god, Rhea just popped her shoulder back in by ramming it into the announce table. That looked so painful. Rhea takes control, and goes to hit Morgan with a chair. Dom stops her! Tells her you can't win the title that way. Dirty Dom has a point. Morgan hits her finisher, but Ripley kicks out! Dom tosses a chair in, Morgan hits her finisher again, this time on a chair, and she wins. Dom helped her, but not obviously. I blame Ripley, she introduced the weapon! Liv Morgan defeats Rhea Ripley. And then Dom gives her a big kiss. Michael Cole with a great call! Ripley is crying, but not tears of sadness. Tears of anger. Liv and Dom walk out together. Ripley looks bad ass with lipstick on her teeth, crying. Pat McAfee doesn't care for Dom, apparently! I thought this finish was too obvious, but I'm happy the feud is continuing.

Is SummerSlam sold out?

WWE is hot right now and its been selling out just about everywhere they go. But is SummerSlam a sellout? It wasn't as of an hour ago, but it was pretty darn close and after walkups, it very well could be.

Triple H welcomes fans

In what is becoming a tradition for big PLEs, Triple H made his way before the crowd prior to the start of SummerSlam. He asked Cleveland if they're ready. They let him know they were on board. He gave a shoutout to Jelly Roll for his performance of God Bless America and then Jelly sang another song. They interviewed him prior to the show, he's a huge WWE fan. Good for him. But if I said I liked this song, I'd be a Liar.

How long is SummerSlam 2024?

Traditional PLEs under Triple H have featured five matches and three hours. With SummerSlam starting at 7 p.m., it's safe to assume with seven matches, we will see a show that will run around four hours.

What will open SummerSlam?

The first match of the night will be Liv Morgan vs. Rhea Ripley. This is a great call. I'd argue this is the hottest feud of the night. I guess Drew McIntyre-CM Punk has the same momentum heading into the show, but Ripley has gotten more popular since her injury and Morgan has been so entertaining as a bad girl. She's been so much fun, and this match is going to be the perfect way to open the night. We'll likely see a surprise in this match, and I know people think Dirty Dom will turn on Rhea, but I'd like to see them stick together and have Rhea be the bad girl.

Jelly Roll to kick off SummerSlam

Pat McAfee interviewed Jelly Roll prior to the show and it was announced that he'll open the show with a song. Pretty cool interview, McAfee is one of the top stars in media, and Mr. Roll is one of the top musical performers right now. Very cool.

SummerSlam 2025 location?

OK, so we know in two years, SummerSlam becomes two nights when it comes to Minnesota, but where will SummerSlam be next year? WWE hasn't released that information, but possibly we'll hear it tonight.

Summerslam Preshow Matches?

Unlike in previous years, this year's preshow is a straight up preview show. It includes interviews and recaps and predictions, but there are no matches scheduled.

Is SummerSlam free on Peacock?

If you want to watch tonight's SummerSlam in the United States, you need Peacock. The NBC streaming service no longer offers a free trial, but if you sign up, you get SummerSlam as well as the Olympics. To watch, you can sign up here.

SummerSlam Match Order

It's hard to predict the order of this. But we'll give it a shot. And we've already established that we've earmarked Cody Rhodes-Solo Sikoa as the main event.

For the opener, we'll go with Rhea Ripley vs. Liv Morgan. I think this has the best story going in, so this has earned a marquee billing. After that, we'll go Logan Paul vs. LA Knight. This keeps the crowd alive with a local guy who sounds like he'll be the bad guy. Thought Cleveland was loyal to their won, but not according to the cheers thus far! Next up, Bayley vs. Nia Jax. The other women's match has the most buzz, this match to me has the least. But Jax has improved a lot this time and Bayley never has a bad match. Next up it's time for Damian Priest vs. Gunther. The only reason this isn't in a main event spot is because of the competition. I could see Bronn Breakker vs. Sami Zyan as the next match, followed by the CM Punk vs. Drew McIntyre match. Pretty outrageous the level of matches on this show, there isn't a bad one listed. Then throw in a segment with the Miz, he should be allowed to come out and put on a little show in his hometown, nobody deserves it more. Then send out the Bloodline!

He's the Miz and he's awesome

I'm glad they found a prominent role for the Miz. I've interviewed him in the past and you can tell he's a good guy. Whatever role they throw at him, he stars. Good guy? He can pull it off. Bad guy? Few are better. Tag team? Sure. World champion? He was good. IC champ? One of the best. Zombie match? He did it! Movies, interviews, MizTV, reality show, he's done it all and done it all well. He's getting his accolades more and more these days, and he's earned it. By my favorite part of the Miz? He's probably the most popular wrestler among his peers. That's great to see.

What will main event SummerSlam?

There are at least three matches that could main event tonight, and I'm excited to see what will. Either big title matches, Cody Rhodes-Solo Sikoa and Damian Priest-Gunther could headline, yet so could CM Punk vs. Drew McIntyre with Seth Rollins serving as ref. It's CM Punk's first singles match on TV in WWE in a long time. Gunther winning the title could be as important a moment in WWE as Brock Lesnar beating the Rock at SummerSlam. Sounds crazy, but why couldn't Gunther grow into that kind of star? And the match with the best storyline is arguably Rhea Ripley vs. Liv Morgan. Probably a long shot to be the main event, but who doesn't want to see that match? I think they'll go with the Bloodline Rules match, and if Roman Reigns returns, I think it's the right call.

Bloodline Rules?

Love the switch to Bloodline Rules. Think it was very stupid of Cody Rhodes to accept it, but it opens up so many possibilities. I predicted a lot of interference earlier, but this makes it legal. And this makes Roman Reigns' return easy to see. I hope that happens, but I hope he stays the Tribal Chief, the guy who was a total jerk. And I think he will. Just good to have him back.

Special guest SummerSlam refs

This is the third time that I can remember when one of the top SummerSlam matches featured a special guest referee. In 1997, Shawn Michaels was the ref in the championship match between the Undertaker and Bret Hart, and a few years later, Jesse Ventura officiated the title match between ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin, Mankind and Triple H. Tonight will be the third with Seth Rollins calling the match between CM Punk and Drew McIntyre. For a minute I felt bad for Rollins, not being in a match, but in this PPV, it's almost like the refs have been bigger. Rollins might be the best all around performer in the sport and any role he gets, he'll star.

SummerSlam will be held Saturday, Aug. 3.

SummerSlam will be held at Cleveland Browns Stadium.

What time does the SummerSlam Preshow start?

The SummerSlam Preshow starts at 4 p.m. It will last three hours.

SummerSlam begins at 7 p.m. after a two-hour countdown show that begins at 5 p.m.

In the United States, SummerSlam will stream live on Peacock. It will also be available on traditional pay per view at a price of $44.99. Internationally, it will be available on WWE Network.

After months of animosity, Women’s World Champion Liv Morgan wanted no part of challenger Rhea Ripley early in the match.

Once Ripley caught Morgan, it was all one-way traffic, with Morgan on the backfoot. Ripley looked to wrap up the match early when she hit a Riptide onto the top turnbuckle, but her second attempt failed.

Just as Mami looked dominant, Morgan threw Ripley into the ring post, with the challenger’s shoulder appearing to pop out and Ripley screaming “it’s out.”

In an intense moment, Ripley threw herself into the announce table, resetting her shoulder back into place to the shock of Morgan and the WWE Universe.

Despite pain coursing through her shoulders, Ripley hit Morgan with the Riptide before taking a steel chair and getting ready to blast Morgan with it.

“Dirty” Dominik Mysterio saved Ripley from a disqualification, hopping onto the apron, taking the chair away from her and reminding her that she couldn’t win the championship that way.

Morgan took advantage of the distraction by hitting Ripley with Oblivion, but Ripley kicked out.

With a steel chair planted in the ring, Mysterio distracted the referee. Seconds later, Morgan hit another Oblivion on the steel chair to retain the title.

After coming up just short when he challenged Sami Zayn for the Intercontinental Title at WWE Money in the Bank, Bron Breakker swung for the fences at the opening bell by immediately trying to hit a Spear. Zayn, however, moved out of the way and caused Breakker to crash shoulder-first into the ring post.

Breakker fought through the pain, but Zayn landed a Blue Thunder Bomb and exploder suplex.

Action was at a premium between United States Champion Logan Paul and LA Knight, as Paul hit the ring with Machine Gun Kelly, and The Megastar smashed a window on The Maverick’s Hummer and dropped him with a neckbreaker on the announce table – and all of that occurred before the match began.

Once the bell rang, Paul hit a huge springboard moonsault from the ring to the outside, wowing the WWE Universe with his freakish athleticism.

Knight impressed as well, hitting a huge fisherman’s superplex and nearly winning the match in extraordinary fashion.

Irate at Paul’s entourage, Knight pulled The Maverick’s buddies over the ringside barricade and stomped them before Paul threw The Megastar into the ring post.

After MGK gave Paul his brass knuckles, Paul blasted Knight with the weapon before readying for a springboard somersault clothesline. Just as The Maverick was about to clobber his challenger, Knight countered with the BFT before scoring the pinfall to claim his first championship in WWE.

Queen Nia Jax can add another piece of gold to her trophy cabinet after dethroning Bayley to win the WWE Women’s Title.

Bayley hit a huge Bayley-to-Belly, and Jax landed an Annihilator, but both kicked out of the devastating maneuvers.

In fact, The Role Model became the first Superstar to kick out of the Annihilator, leaving the Queen exasperated.

In an awesome moment, Bayley summoned all her strength to carry Jax halfway across the ring and drop her with a powerbomb. Bayley immediately followed with the Flying Elbow, but once again Jax kicked out.

With both Superstars exhausted, Ms. Money in the Bank Tiffany Stratton ran down to the ring, seemingly looking to cash in her contract. Bayley blasted Stratton with a right hand when she hopped onto the apron, but the distraction resulted in Jax hitting two Annihilators to crown herself WWE Women’s Champion.

At each other’s throats for months, CM Punk and Drew McIntyre had a chance to finally unload on one another.

As soon as the bell rang, Special Guest Referee Seth “Freakin” Rollins had to get out of dodge as Punk and McIntyre viciously pummeled each other.

McIntyre landed the first big blow when the fight spilled to ringside, hitting a catapult to send Punk throat-first into the steel rungs under the ring.

The Scottish Warrior kept up the onslaught by delivering several powerbombs before bringing a steel chair into the ring. Just as McIntyre was about to use the weapon, Rollins took it away.



Rollins looked to hit McIntyre with the steel chair, but McIntyre ducked. Luckily, Rollins stopped himself before he connected with Punk.

As Rollins thew away the weapon, Punk rolled up McIntyre, but Rollins was slow to the count, allowing McIntyre to kick out.

Punk eventually let his emotions get the better of him as he took back the bracelet that McIntyre stole from him by removing it from The Scottish Warrior’s wrist.

His emotional act nearly cost him, as McIntyre clobbered Punk with the Claymore, but Punk kicked out.

As Punk was about to hit McIntyre with the GTS, Punk saw that Rollins had his bracelet on his wrist. McIntyre used the fracas to hit Punk into Rollins. Punk’s GTS attempt was successful, but Rollins was again slow to the count, allowing McIntyre to kick out once more.

Punk became incensed at The Visionary as the two engaged in a war of words that ended in a GTS from Punk to Rollins.

With Rollins out of the equation, McIntyre booted Punk below the belt before nailing the Claymore. Rollins then reluctantly counted the three, and McIntyre left the victor and with Punk’s bracelet back on his wrist.

World Heavyweight Champion Damian Priest and Gunther engaged in a physical battle in their first one-on-one meeting.

Priest took the fight to The Ring General, leaving Gunther’s chest bloodied after leveling him with chop after chop.

As Gunther looked to have Priest down and out, Finn Bálor came down to encourage his Judgment Day brother, though Gunther soon booted him in the face through the ropes.

Gunther looked like a gladiator with his scarred chest as he berated Priest and continued to pummel him.

Priest eventually found his next gear, rallying to hit Gunther with the Razor’s Edge and the South of Heaven Chokeslam.

Priest had Gunther pinned, but Bálor shockingly put Gunther’s foot on the ring ropes to break up the three-count.

As Priest locked eyes with Bálor, Gunther synched in the Sleeper Hold while Priest began to fade with Bálor watching. Priest escaped the Sleeper, but Gunther locked it back in after the champion tried to attack Bálor, causing Priest to pass out and winning his first World Heavyweight Title.

Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes def. Solo Sikoa in a Bloodline Rules Match

Cody Rhodes once again had to endure Bloodline Rules in an Undisputed WWE Championship match, this time against self-proclaimed Tribal Chief Solo Sikoa.

Sikoa dominated Rhodes in the early goings, hitting a Spinning Solo and two running headbutts.

As The American Nightmare landed the Cross Rhodes, Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa arrived to try to help Sikoa win the title.

With Rhodes down, Kevin Owens and Randy Orton entered the fray, taking Loa and Tonga out of the equation as they fought to the backstage area.

Rhodes used the ring steps on Sikoa, but Sikoa caught him with a huge Spear for a long two-count.

As Rhodes fought back, he was readying for the third Cross Rhodes until Jacob Fatu assaulted him.

Fatu delivered a devastating frog splash onto Rhodes through the announce table, and Sikoa hit another huge splash, but Rhodes once again kicked out.

Moments later, Rhodes blasted Sikoa with a Cross Rhodes to win his second Bloodline Rules Match and retain his Undisputed WWE Championship.

Reigns, who was halfway up the entranceway, locked eyes with the victorious Rhodes as SummerSlam concluded."

After months of animosity, Women’s World Champion Liv Morgan wanted no part of challenger Rhea Ripley early in the match.

Once Ripley caught Morgan, it was all one-way traffic, with Morgan on the backfoot. Ripley looked to wrap up the match early when she hit a Riptide onto the top turnbuckle, but her second attempt failed.

Just as Mami looked dominant, Morgan threw Ripley into the ring post, with the challenger’s shoulder appearing to pop out and Ripley screaming “it’s out.”

In an intense moment, Ripley threw herself into the announce table, resetting her shoulder back into place to the shock of Morgan and the WWE Universe.

Despite pain coursing through her shoulders, Ripley hit Morgan with the Riptide before taking a steel chair and getting ready to blast Morgan with it.

“Dirty” Dominik Mysterio saved Ripley from a disqualification, hopping onto the apron, taking the chair away from her and reminding her that she couldn’t win the championship that way.

Morgan took advantage of the distraction by hitting Ripley with Oblivion, but Ripley kicked out.

With a steel chair planted in the ring, Mysterio distracted the referee. Seconds later, Morgan hit another Oblivion on the steel chair to retain the title.

After coming up just short when he challenged Sami Zayn for the Intercontinental Title at WWE Money in the Bank, Bron Breakker swung for the fences at the opening bell by immediately trying to hit a Spear. Zayn, however, moved out of the way and caused Breakker to crash shoulder-first into the ring post.

Breakker fought through the pain, but Zayn landed a Blue Thunder Bomb and exploder suplex.

As Zayn went for the Helluva Kick, Breakker struck with the Spear prior to connecting with a second momentous Spear, winning the Intercontinental Title for the first time in his career.

Action was at a premium between United States Champion Logan Paul and LA Knight, as Paul hit the ring with Machine Gun Kelly, and The Megastar smashed a window on The Maverick’s Hummer and dropped him with a neckbreaker on the announce table – and all of that occurred before the match began.

Once the bell rang, Paul hit a huge springboard moonsault from the ring to the outside, wowing the WWE Universe with his freakish athleticism.

Knight impressed as well, hitting a huge fisherman’s superplex and nearly winning the match in extraordinary fashion.

Irate at Paul’s entourage, Knight pulled The Maverick’s buddies over the ringside barricade and stomped them before Paul threw The Megastar into the ring post.

After MGK gave Paul his brass knuckles, Paul blasted Knight with the weapon before readying for a springboard somersault clothesline. Just as The Maverick was about to clobber his challenger, Knight countered with the BFT before scoring the pinfall to claim his first championship in WWE.



Nia Jax def. Bayley to win the WWE Women’s Championship

Queen Nia Jax can add another piece of gold to her trophy cabinet after dethroning Bayley to win the WWE Women’s Title.

Bayley hit a huge Bayley-to-Belly, and Jax landed an Annihilator, but both kicked out of the devastating maneuvers.

In fact, The Role Model became the first Superstar to kick out of the Annihilator, leaving the Queen exasperated.

In an awesome moment, Bayley summoned all her strength to carry Jax halfway across the ring and drop her with a powerbomb. Bayley immediately followed with the Flying Elbow, but once again Jax kicked out.

With both Superstars exhausted, Ms. Money in the Bank Tiffany Stratton ran down to the ring, seemingly looking to cash in her contract. Bayley blasted Stratton with a right hand when she hopped onto the apron, but the distraction resulted in Jax hitting two Annihilators to crown herself WWE Women’s Champion.



Drew McIntyre def. CM Punk with Special Guest Referee Seth “Freakin” Rollins

Explosive rivals Drew McIntyre and CM Punk finally clash in the ring with Seth “Freakin” Rollins serving as the Special Guest Referee, presented by C4. Catch WWE action on Peacock, WWE Network, FOX, USA Network, Sony India and more. #SummerSlam

At each other’s throats for months, CM Punk and Drew McIntyre had a chance to finally unload on one another.

As soon as the bell rang, Special Guest Referee Seth “Freakin” Rollins had to get out of dodge as Punk and McIntyre viciously pummeled each other.

McIntyre landed the first big blow when the fight spilled to ringside, hitting a catapult to send Punk throat-first into the steel rungs under the ring.

The Scottish Warrior kept up the onslaught by delivering several powerbombs before bringing a steel chair into the ring. Just as McIntyre was about to use the weapon, Rollins took it away.



Rollins looked to hit McIntyre with the steel chair, but McIntyre ducked. Luckily, Rollins stopped himself before he connected with Punk.

As Rollins thew away the weapon, Punk rolled up McIntyre, but Rollins was slow to the count, allowing McIntyre to kick out.

Punk eventually let his emotions get the better of him as he took back the bracelet that McIntyre stole from him by removing it from The Scottish Warrior’s wrist.

His emotional act nearly cost him, as McIntyre clobbered Punk with the Claymore, but Punk kicked out.

As Punk was about to hit McIntyre with the GTS, Punk saw that Rollins had his bracelet on his wrist. McIntyre used the fracas to hit Punk into Rollins. Punk’s GTS attempt was successful, but Rollins was again slow to the count, allowing McIntyre to kick out once more.

Punk became incensed at The Visionary as the two engaged in a war of words that ended in a GTS from Punk to Rollins.

With Rollins out of the equation, McIntyre booted Punk below the belt before nailing the Claymore. Rollins then reluctantly counted the three, and McIntyre left the victor and with Punk’s bracelet back on his wrist.

World Heavyweight Champion Damian Priest and Gunther engaged in a physical battle in their first one-on-one meeting.

Priest took the fight to The Ring General, leaving Gunther’s chest bloodied after leveling him with chop after chop.

As Gunther looked to have Priest down and out, Finn Bálor came down to encourage his Judgment Day brother, though Gunther soon booted him in the face through the ropes.

Gunther looked like a gladiator with his scarred chest as he berated Priest and continued to pummel him.

Priest eventually found his next gear, rallying to hit Gunther with the Razor’s Edge and the South of Heaven Chokeslam.

Priest had Gunther pinned, but Bálor shockingly put Gunther’s foot on the ring ropes to break up the three-count.

As Priest locked eyes with Bálor, Gunther synched in the Sleeper Hold while Priest began to fade with Bálor watching. Priest escaped the Sleeper, but Gunther locked it back in after the champion tried to attack Bálor, causing Priest to pass out and winning his first World Heavyweight Title.

Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes def. Solo Sikoa in a Bloodline Rules Match

Cody Rhodes once again had to endure Bloodline Rules in an Undisputed WWE Championship match, this time against self-proclaimed Tribal Chief Solo Sikoa.

Sikoa dominated Rhodes in the early goings, hitting a Spinning Solo and two running headbutts.

As The American Nightmare landed the Cross Rhodes, Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa arrived to try to help Sikoa win the title.

With Rhodes down, Kevin Owens and Randy Orton entered the fray, taking Loa and Tonga out of the equation as they fought to the backstage area.

Rhodes used the ring steps on Sikoa, but Sikoa caught him with a huge Spear for a long two-count.

As Rhodes fought back, he was readying for the third Cross Rhodes until Jacob Fatu assaulted him.

Fatu delivered a devastating frog splash onto Rhodes through the announce table, and Sikoa hit another huge splash, but Rhodes once again kicked out.

Just as Sikoa looked dominant, Roman Reigns made his shocking return to a thunderous ovation from the WWE Universe.

As the Cleveland faithful anticipated what Reigns would do, The Head of the Table hit the ring and blasted a shellshocked Sikoa with a Superman Punch and a Spear before giving a subtle nod to Rhodes and leaving the squared circle.

Moments later, Rhodes blasted Sikoa with a Cross Rhodes to win his second Bloodline Rules Match and retain his Undisputed WWE Championship.

WWE Summer Slam: Cody Rhodes vs Solo Sikoa WWE Championship match results.,https://wrestlingrumors.net/tommyhall/summerslam-2024-results/,"Summerslam 2024

Date: August 3, 2024

Location: Cleveland Browns Stadium, Cleveland, Ohio

Commentators: Michael Cole, Corey Graves, Pat McAfee

It’s another stadium show for one of the biggest events of the WWE year. That should make for a big deal and now we get to see what WWE can do with this stacked of a card. There are seven matches scheduled with six titles on the line, plus a heck of a grudge match. That should be more than enough to carry things so let’s get to it.

HHH welcomes us to the show and introduces Jelly Roll to sing Liar, one of the show’s official theme songs, set to a preview of the card.

Miz welcomes us to the show, serving his purpose as host.

Raw Women’s Title: Rhea Ripley vs. Liv Morgan

Ripley, with Dominik Mysterio, is challenging. Morgan hurt Ripley and tried to take Mysterio from her, only to have Mysterio turn her down. The bell rings and Morgan bails outside, then does it again for a bonus. An attempt at a third roll outside is cut off by a head fake and Ripley grabs her for some clotheslines. They go outside for a ram into the steps, allowing Ripley to like Mysterio’s face.

Ripley sends her into the steps a few more times and then Riptides her onto the top turnbuckle. Morgan slips out of Riptide again and sends Ripley’s recently repaired arm into the buckle. Ripley goes down fast and screams “IT’S OUT” but insists that the match keep going. It’s time to go back to the floor where Ripley’s bad shoulder goes into the steps this time, followed by some stomping back inside.

Back in and Morgan cranks on the arm (as you do) before hitting a springboard Codebreaker on said arm. Ripley gets smart by kicking her in the head and going outside, where Dominik shoves her out of the way of Morgan’s dive. Back up and Ripley rams her arm into the announcers’ table to pop it back in, meaning the beating can ensue. Another Riptide attempt is countered into a DDT and they’re both down.

Ripley gets back up and tries the Prism Trap but Morgan slips out and grabs a crucifix bomb for two. A cross armbreaker has the arm in more trouble but Ripley powers out with a spinebuster for two of her own. One heck of a headbutt rocks Ripley, allowing Morgan to snap the arm over the middle rope.

Morgan goes for a chair but walks into a Riptide for her efforts. Ripley picks it up instead, with Dominik cutting her off to save the match. Morgan sends them together and a quick Oblivion connects for two. Then Dominik slides the chair in ala how he “accidentally” helped Morgan win the title, setting up another Oblivion onto the chair for Morgan to retain. This time though, Dominik is smiling.

Result: Liv Morgan b. Rhea Ripley – Oblivion onto a chair (15:53)

Post match Ripley wakes up and Dominik kisses a surprised Morgan, much to Ripley’s dismay.

After some advertisements, Damian Priest storms into Judgment Day’s locker room and wants to hurt Dominik Mysterio. He asks if Finn Balor knew what was coming and seems to accuse Balor of being behind it but Balor denies knowing anything. The rest of the team and Carlito go off to find Dominik, with Priest threatening violence.

We recap Bron Breakker vs. Sami Zayn for the latter’s Intercontinental Title. Zayn survived against Breakker last month but now Breakker is more focused and ready.

Intercontinental Title: Bron Breakker vs. Sami Zayn

Zayn is defending and avoids a charge at the bell, sending Breakker shoulder first into the post. Breakker rolls outside but gets sent back inside, where he has to avoid an early Helluva Kick attempt. Breakker catches him with a running clothesline, which works a bit better. Some right hands in the corner set up a super Frankensteiner for two as Zayn is in early trouble.

Zayn springboards over him and hits a clothesline but can’t hit the Blue Thunder Bomb. Instead Breakker goes up for the Steiner Bulldog, which is reversed into the Blue Thunder Bomb for two. The exploder into the corner connects but Breakker cuts him off with the spear. Another spear gives Breakker the pin and the title at 5:44.

Result: Bron Breakker b. Sami Zayn – Spear (5:44)

Stephanie McMahon is here.

We recap Logan Paul defending the US Title against LA Knight. Paul has frustrated Knight, who keeps coming back and wanting a US Title shot. Knight pinned him in a Money In The Bank qualifying match and that was enough to get the shot here.

US Title: LA Knight vs. Logan Paul

Paul, the hometown boy, is defending, but we cut to the back where Knight smashes the window of the Prime truck that he stole from Paul on Smackdown. It’s a brawl on the floor before the bell with Paul being sent into the barricade. Knight sends him into the hydration station but Paul fights back and clears the announcers’ table. That’s fine with Knight, who hits a torture rack neckbreaker onto the table and NOW we go in for the opening bell.

Knight fires the shoulders into the ribs to start as Graves makes a Major League joke in a nice touch. The jumping elbow hits raised knees and Paul sends him shoulder first into the post. Paul posts him again and hammers away at the head, followed by a big boot and legdrop for two (with the Hogan pose). Knight fights up from his knees but walks into a gutwrench suplex for two more. A powerbomb faceplant gives Paul two but he spends too much time on mockery and walks into a powerslam for two.

Knight slugs away again and stomps away in the corner, setting up a running knee to rock Paul again. A Side Effect of all things sets up a middle rope elbow, only to have Knight jump to the top in an impressive display, for two more. Back up and Paul sends him to the apron for a springboard clothesline to send Knight outside, setting up a springboard spinning moonsault (awesome).

Back in and Paul’s big right hand gets two so it’s time for Paul’s cronies to give him the brass knuckles. That’s broken up and Knight hammers away, but Paul gets the knuckles anyway. They head back inside, where Knight grabs BFT for the pin and the title (his first in WWE) at 12:04.

Result: LA Knight b. Logan Paul – BFT (12:04)

Various wrestlers shill Manscaped products.

We recap Nia Jax challenging Bayley for the Smackdown Women’s Title. Jax is on a roll and won Queen Of The Ring but Bayley isn’t laying down for anyone.

Smackdown Women’s Title: Bayley vs. Nia Jax

Jax is challenging and Bayley slugs away to start fast before tying the arm up in the ropes. Bayley has to escape a powerbomb but Jax runs her over without much trouble. An elbow drop keeps Bayley in trouble but she fights up and hits a belly to back suplex. Back up and Bayley manages to knock her outside, only to get crotched back inside. Bayley manages a guillotine choke (how she beat Jax in NXT) but gets shoved off with straight power.

Jax’s middle rope legdrop misses and a quick Bayley To Belly gets two. Bayley charges into a release Rock Bottom out of the corner and the Annihilator connects for two, leaving Jax stunned. Back up and Bayley sends her shoulder first into the post so Jax needs a breather on the floor.

Bayley’s suicide dive is countered into a Samoan drop on the floor, followed by the running hip attack in the corner. Another Annihilator is broken up though and Bayley manages a heck of a middle rope powerbomb. Bayley’s top rope elbow gets two….and it’s Tiffy Time. Bayley cuts her off but Jax powerbombs Bayley down, setting up a pair of Annihilators to win the title at 12:32.

Result: Nia Jax b. Bayley – Annihilator (12:32)

Post match Tiffany and Jax celebrate with no cash-in attempt.

We recap Drew McIntyre vs. CM Punk. McIntyre injured Punk during the Royal Rumble and then bragged about it. Therefore, Punk has promised, and managed, to ruin McIntyre’s life. McIntyre is obsessed with Punk and stole a personal bracelet of his, meaning it’s time for revenge, with Seth Rollins, who doesn’t like either of them, as the guest referee.

CM Punk vs. Drew McIntyre

Seth Rollins is guest referee and calls for the opening bell after quite the delay. Punk hammers away to start but Rollins pulls him away in the corner. That lets McIntyre get in some stomps of his own, but Rollins breaks that up too. McIntyre strikes away until a clothesline puts him on the floor. Rollins chills on the top rope as Punk posts McIntyre before stopping to tie his shoes as Punk sends McIntyre into the steps. McIntyre fights up and swings Punk into the steps while Rollins conducts the singing crowd.

A catapult sends Punk chest first into the ring structure and it’s time to throw what’s left of Punk back inside. McIntyre powerbombs him for two, with Rollins’ count not sitting well with him. The chair is brought in, with McIntyre saying this makes their problem go away. Rollins takes the chair away and loads up a swing but has to stop himself from hitting Punk by mistake. The chair is thrown out but Rollins misses the rollup on McIntyre. Back up and McIntyre drops him again before pulling out the bracelet.

Punk fires off the running knees in the corner and the top rope elbow gets two. The Anaconda Vice is brought out of mothballs, only for McIntyre to fight out and hit the Claymore for two. The Futureshock is escaped and McIntyre misses a charge into the post. Punk yells at Rollins for picking up the bracelet but McIntyre rams them into each other, sending Rollins outside. The GTS gets a VERY delayed two, with Punk yelling at Rollins and his “stupid Sabu pants”. That means a GTS to Rollins, leaving McIntyre to hit Punk low. Another Claymore finishes for McIntyre at 16:59.

Result: Drew McIntyre b. CM Punk – Claymore (16:59)

Finn Balor comes in to see Damian Priest, saying Dominik Mysterio and Liv Morgan are gone. Priest apologizes for accusing him earlier, with Balor accepting and apologizing for his response. Go take care of Gunther.

We recap Damian Priest defending the Raw World Title against Gunther. Priest cashed in Money In The Bank to win the title at Wrestlemania and has been trying to prove himself as champion since. Gunther on the other hand is the King Of The Ring while coming off the record shattering Intercontinental Title reign. He also doesn’t think much of Priest, referring to him as street trash. It’s a cultural battle along with a title fight.

Raw World Title: Gunther vs. Damian Priest

Priest is defending and there are no seconds. They slug it out to start with Priest knocking him into the corner and grabbing a lifting Downward Spiral to send Gunther outside. Gunther blocks a powerbomb attempt and rams him into the apron, only for Priest to hit an ear clap back inside. Priest’s superplex is broken up with some shots to the ribs but he settles for a super hurricanrana into the Broken Arrow for two.

Priest chops him so hard that Gunther’s chest is bleeding but he’s back with a powerbomb. Gunther sees the blood and chops even harder, only for Priest to kick him in the head and hit the South Of Heaven for two. Back up and Gunther kicks him in the face so Priest tells him to bring it on (oh that’s dumb) so it’s a chop to put him own. Cue Finn Balor to cheer Priest on and Gunther kicks Priest down again.

A running kick to the ribs has Priest in trouble and Gunther kicks Balor in the face too. Priest fights up and hits some clotheslines, setting up the Razor’s Edge. South Of Heaven connects…but Balor puts Gunther’s foot on the ropes. Priest didn’t seem to see what happened but sees the replay on the screen and turns to glare at Balor. The distraction lets Gunther get the sleeper, with Priest flipping backwards for two and the escape. Priest lunges for Balor and Gunther grabs a powerbomb. Another sleeper gives Gunther the title at 16:39.

Result: Gunther b. Damian Priest – Sleeper (16:39)

Here are the Miz and R-Truth to announce the attendance of 57,791. Jelly Roll’s theme song, with the line “YOU AIN’T NOTHING BUT A LIAR” playing just after that number is announced amuses me for some reason. Cue A-Town Down Under to mock Jelly Roll, saying only Cleveland could have this many people who look like Roll (who weighs a good bit over three hundred pounds). Truth thinks he’s talking to the Rock N Roll Express (because of the Rock N Roll Hall Of Fame) but here is Roll in disguise to chair them down. A Five Knuckle Shuffle ensues and Miz and Truth have to help Roll up.

We recap Cody Rhodes vs. Solo Sikoa for the Smackdown World Title. Rhodes thought he defeated the Bloodline at Wrestlemania when he took out Roman Reigns but Sikoa has reformed the team with a much more dangerous lineup. Now it’s a Bloodline Rules match but all of Cody’s friends have been taken out by the Bloodline, meaning he’s all alone.

Smackdown World Title: Cody Rhodes vs. Solo Sikoa

Cody is defending under Bloodline Rules (anything goes). We go to the back where Rhodes gets off his bus, takes his dog Pharaoh, and walks into the arena, where he runs into Arn Anderson of all people. Anderson talks about how proud Dusty Rhodes would be but Cody has four ticked off island boys coming for him. Cody’s friends are on the way though.

Feeling out process to start with Sikoa using the power to take over early on. Sikoa blocks the drop down right hand and Cody isn’t sure what to think. They chop it out until Cody low bridges him to the apron, with a Disaster Kick sending Sikoa out to the floor. Back in and Cody’s snap powerslam doesn’t work so Sikoa hits a spinwheel kick. The Samoan drop gets two but Cody is back up with a Cody Cutter for a breather.

Back up and Sikoa grabs a sitout powerbomb for two, followed by a running Umaga Attack for the same. Spinning Solo sets up the nerve hold and another Samoan drop cuts off the comeback bid. Cody is tied in the Tree of Woe for the running headbutt but another one only hits mat. A top rope moonsault to a standing Sikoa gives Cody a breather but Sikoa plants him back down for two more.

Sikoa goes up, only to get superplexed right back down. Cody slugs away but has to counter Sikoa’s Cross Rhodes attempt into one of his own. Cue Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa so the beatdown can be on, including the double spinning neckbreaker to give Sikoa two. Cue the returning Kevin Owens for the save but the Bloodline fights back, meaning it’s Randy Orton running in (and high fiving fans on the way) for the save of his own.

Cody uses the help to hit Cross Rhodes on Solo, leaving the other four to fight off into the crowd. It’s time to bring in the steps, with Cody getting in some hard shots to the head. Sikoa cuts him off with a spear though and puts Cody up against the steps in the corner. The running Umaga Attack misses though and Cody hits a pair of Cross Rhodes. Cue Jacob Fatu to wreck Cody though, with Sikoa getting two.

Fatu takes him outside for a top rope splash through the announcers’ table….and Fatu can’t stand on his leg. And it doesn’t matter as ROMAN REIGNS is back to a thunderous reaction. The Superman Punch and spear cut Sikoa down and, with a look at Reigns, Cody hits Cross Rhodes to retain at 29:14.

Result: Cody Rhodes b. Solo Sikoa – Cross Rhodes (29:14)

Reigns returned to WWE for the first time since losing to Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania 40 in April, aiding his former rival in defeating the replacement Tribal Chief, Sikoa, in the main event of SummerSlam.

Cleveland hosted a dramatic event chock-full of betrayal, tension and misdeeds. Rhodes successfully defended his undisputed WWE championship in Saturday's main event thanks to Reigns' unlikely assistance. Drew McIntyre scored vengeance against CM Punk with Seth Rollins serving as a distraction, and the Judgement Day imploded from multiple betrayals.

Beyond those storyline developments, there were four title changes on the show, notable since WWE has not seen most of its main roster championships switch hands since WrestleMania.

2024 WWE SummerSlam results, grades



Women's World Championship -- Liv Morgan (c) vs. Rhea Ripley: SummerSlam's opening match had two primary subplots: The love triangle involving Dominik Mysterio and a cat-and-mouse game. Morgan was apprehensive about a straightforward fight, preferring to flee and find openings. Both superstars flirted with Dominik to try and get under their rival's skin. Ripley eventually got her hands on Morgan but her offense was short-lived. The champion hurled Ripley into the corner post, aggravating her previously legitimate shoulder injury. Ripley, in character, claimed, ""My shoulder is out,"" but refused to concede. Mysterio, who accompanied Ripley to the ring, showed his allegiance by throwing himself in front of Morgan's suicide dive. A bizarre spot saw Ripley ram her shoulder into the announcers' table to pop it back into place. Morgan looked horrified as Ripley stormed the ring.

Morgan countered Riptide with a DDT before Ripley locked in a one-arm Prism Lock. Morgan's brightest moment was a crucifix driver and armbar. The shoulder spot became a recurring bit. Ripley repeatedly rammed her shoulder into the turnbuckle to put it back in place. Morgan tried to get herself disqualified -- titles don't change hands via DQ or countout -- by hitting Ripley with a steel chair. Ripley countered Morgan by hitting her with a Riptide. Ripley picked up the chair instead of going for the pinfall. Mysterio tried to talk some sense into Ripley, during which Morgan pushed Ripley into Mysterio and hit Oblivion. Ripley kicked out at two, but a second distraction by Mysterio allowed Morgan to hit her finisher on a steel chair. Post-match, Mysterio handed Morgan the title and kissed her, confirming his betrayal of Ripley. Mysterio flipped off the SummerSlam crowd as a seething Ripley looked on. An angry Damian Priest interrogated Judgement Day about Mysterio's actions shortly after the mach.

Morgan vs. Ripley was arguably SummerSlam's second-best storyline coming in, behind CM Punk vs. Drew McIntyre. This is an instance where a deceptive finish was welcome, perfectly playing into the soap opera-heavy story. Ripley looked strong and sympathetic in defeat, Morgan and Mysterio elevated their profiles in victory. It's not a five-star athletic match but an excellent representation of this type of pro wrestling. Morgan (c) def. Ripley via pinfall to retain the title. Grade: A

Intercontinental Championship -- Sami Zayn (c) vs. Bron Breakker: Saturday's sophomore match was the antithesis of the opening contest, which was a fast-paced workhorse match. Both men made crucial mistakes early by going for signature moves. An overzealous Breakker hurt his shoulder spearing the ring post, and Zayn whiffed on a Helluva Kick. The challenger hit a nice Frankensteiner off the top ropes, an ode to his uncle Scott Steiner. The champ hit Breakker with a Blue Thunder Bomb and an exploder suplex in what felt like 5 minutes into the match.

Zayn lined Breakker up for a match-ending Helluva Kick but was intercepted by a nasty spear. The Cleveland crowd barked in favor of Breakker as the challenger followed up with an even meaner spear to win the intercontinental title. Blink and you missed most of this match. The crowd had no time to be bored, but the short runtime left something to be desired from two superstars with more to give. On the plus side, it sets up a trilogy match that hopefully will be granted more time. Breakker def. Zayn (c) to win the title. Grade: B-

United States Championship -- Logan Paul (c) vs. LA Knight: Paul was accompanied by musician Machine Gun Kelly. Knight rolled up in Paul's Prime-branded Hummer that he stole on SmackDown, busting out the blue-tinted windows with a steel pipe. Fists started flying before the match. Knight repeatedly slammed Paul's head into the announce table before planting the champ with a burning hammer neckbreaker onto the table. Knight rolled his opponent into the ring and the match was underway. The match was evenly contested throughout. The crowd was clearly behind the challenger despite Paul being born nearby.

Knight nearly won after landing a big top-rope elbow drop, but Paul answered nicely with a springboard clothesline. Paul's athleticism is remarkable, and he often delivers a memorable spot. Saturday's might have been his best yet. Paul executed an incredible spinning springboard moonsault to the outside. Paul subsequently countered Knight's signature BFT with a haymaker punch. The commentators made a big deal of Paul's titanium fist but Knight kicked out at the last moment. The moonsault wasn't the match's only huge spot. Knight landed a gnarly avalanche brainbuster that was legitimately scary to witness. Fortunately, Paul seemed unharmed. MGK slipped brass knuckles to Paul in the closing moments. The champion cracked Knight with the foreign weapon but couldn't seal the deal. Knight flawlessly countered a Buckshot Lariat into a BFT to win the title.

Knight and Paul had fantastic chemistry. The execution of the counters was terrific and the two major spots looked beautiful. Knight was overdue for a singles title reign, his first main roster belt in a 21-year-long career. The U.S. title has a good chance of being on par with the intercontinental title under Knight's watch. Knight def. Paul (c) via pinfall to win the title. Grade: A

WWE Women's Championship -- Bayley (c) vs. Nia Jax: Jax entered the ring wearing her crown, a reminder that she earned this title shot by winning the Queen of the Ring tournament in May. David vs. Goliath showdown. The champion's speed and experience provided her with windows of opportunities, but Jax's sheer strength often gave her the edge. Jax relied primarily on power moves, including her signature Samoan drops inside and outside the ring. Jax was gobsmacked when Bayley kicked out of her Banzai drop finisher, dubbed the A-Nia-Later.

Bayley showed plenty of underdog spirit but also shrugged off her label as the undersized champion. Bayley slid underneath as Jax set up for a second A-Nia-Later, lifting up the challenger with a powerbomb. It won't have the cultural impact of Hulk Hogan power-slamming Andre the Giant, but Bayley's feat was praiseworthy as she walked around with Jax on her shoulders. Ultimately, Bayley could not overcome the power disadvantage. Tiffany Stratton teased a Money in the Bank cash-in, giving Jax the space to hit two powerbombs and two mores A-Nia-Later to become champion. Jax and Stratton celebrated post-match.

This match won't get a lot of love compared to tonight's heavy-hitters, but it was a solid showing. Bayley's powerbomb was legitimately impressive, and Jax continued to grow as a performer. Having Jax as champion and Stratton as Ms. Money in the Bank will create an interesting dynamic for their partnership moving forward. Jax def. Bayley (c) via pinfall to win the title. Grade: B

CM Punk vs. Drew McIntyre (Seth Rollins as special guest referee): The tension between Punk, McIntyre and Rollins was palpable. Punk and McIntyre brawled off the bat. Each man's refusal to adhere to five counts implored Rollins to get physically involved. The action spilled outside as Punk repeatedly rammed McIntyre's head into steel steps. McIntyre retaliated by swinging Punk into the announce table. While Rollins diligently applied the rules early, he ignored countouts to let McIntyre and Punk beat each other. McIntyre manhandled Punk through the middle portion, chucking Punk around and slapping him in the face. The dynamic between Rollins and the competing superstars was a primary factor in the match. McIntyre compelled Rollins to turn a blind eye to using a steel chair. Rollins snatched the chair from McIntyre, prompting McIntyre to pie-face the referee. Rollins attempted to hit McIntyre with the chair but nearly struck Punk instead. Punk pieced together a flurry of signature moves -- including a top rope elbow drop and Anaconda Vice, setting up a crucial theme in the match.

Punk made a rare psychological error, retrieving the sentimental bracelet McIntyre stole from him instead of completing the submission. McIntyre took advantage by cracking a distracted Punk with a Claymore but only managed a two count. Notably, Rollins took the bracelet off the mat and wore it around his wrist. Punk lifted McIntyre onto his shoulders for Go To Sleep but was again distracted by the bracelet. Punk saw Rollins wearing the bracelet and dropped McIntyre off his shoulders. Punk accused Rollins of playing mind games, which Rollins staunchly denied. McIntyre shoved Punk into Rollins and set up a Future Shock DDT, the same move that legitimately injured Punk at the Royal Rumble. Punk countered with the Go To Sleep but Rollins was still recovering on the floor. Rollins rolled back in but McIntyre kicked out after a delayed two-count.

An argument ensued between Punk and Rollins, the latter of whom proclaimed that Punk wasn't welcome in WWE after having his buttons pushed. Punk hit Rollins with a GTS before turning his attention to McIntyre. McIntyre kicked Punk in the groin -- a callback to Clash at the Castle where Punk did the same to McIntyre -- and hit a match-ending Claymore. A compromised Rollins made a slow, hesitant three-count to award McIntyre the victory. McIntyre snatched the bracelet post-match as he mocked Punk.

Much like Morgan vs. Ripley, this match prioritized long-running drama over in-ring action. It was an all-around success. Punk's rare tactical errors suggested ring rust, McIntyre finally scored a measure of vengeance on Punk, and Rollins was reintroduced as an integral part of the feud. WWE has many ways to pivot from here. Options are a good thing. McIntyre def. Punk via pinfall. Grade: A

World Heavyweight Championship -- Damian Priest (c) vs. GUNTHER: Priest entered the match as an underdog champion, a stigma emphasized early in the match. GUNTHER overwhelmed Priest with his combination of physical power, technical brilliance and ring generalship. It took a while but Priest turned the tide with a top-rope hurricanrana and his signature Broken Arrow. The next phase of the match was striking-oriented: Priest's MMA-inspired strikes vs. GUNTHER's chops. Priest's dynamic striking was more effective. The champion even managed to make GUNTHER -- arguably WWE's best chopper -- bleed from chops. ""The Ring General"" GUNTHER reputation preceded him. Priest made the mistake of trying a second spinning kick. GUNTHER scouted the move, scooped the leg and planted Priest with a T-bone suplex. GUNTHER followed with a barrage of strikes. Finn Balor tried to will his Judgement Day leader Priest to life as GUNTHER continued to chop the champ's lifeless body.

GUNTHER knocked Balor off the apron, a misdeed that spurred Priest back to life. Priest planted GUNTHER with a Razor's Edge and South of Heaven, but Balor draped GUNTHER's leg over the rope to break the count. Priest wasn't immediately aware of the betrayal but caught the incident on the big screen replay. GUNTHER locked in a rear-naked choke as Priest tried to confront Balor. It appeared that Priest would pass out, but the champ rolled over and nearly pinned GUNTHER. Priest couldn't ignore the treachery and lunged again for Balor. GUNTHER intercepted with a powerbomb and rear-naked choke for the technical submission victory.

The opening match set the table for a complete coup within the Judgement Day. The match was great, but it had some things going against it. The drama-heavy nature of the match was similar to Liv Morgan vs. Rhea Ripley and CM Punk vs. Seth Rollins. There was definitely fan sympathy for Priest, but it didn't feel quite as strong as it did for the night's other heroes. WWE is also heading towards a Bloodline civil war storyline, making a similar storyline involving the Judgement Day not quite as intriguing. Kudos to the parties involved for putting in a hard-hitting effort and doing the best they could within the confines of the story. GUNTHER def. Priest (c) via submission to win the title. Grade: B+

Undisputed WWE Championship -- Cody Rhodes (c) vs. Solo Sikoa (Bloodline Rules): Sikoa notably entered without The Bloodline. Rhodes received encouraging words from the legendary Four Horsemen member Arn Anderson en route to the ring with Arn telling the champ he had friends around. Your mileage will vary on Sikoa as Tribal Chief, but he reminded folks his aura is most potent in singles matches. Sikoa was intimidating, powerful and tactical from the get-go. Sikoa blocked Rhodes' signature fallback mat strike, warning the champ that he's been studied. The main eventers had a back-and-forth match taking place between the ropes and ringside. Sikoa had the better reads for much of the match, allowing him to land big moves. Rhodes capitalized on a small opening to remedy his grief. Rhodes lept onto the corner ropes, intercepting Sikoa with a superplex. Sikoa's hubris got the better of him during a back-and-forth exchange. Sikoa tried to hit Rhodes with his Rhodes' finisher but the champ countered into a Cross Rhodes. The champ didn't have time to capitalize as Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa stormed the ring. The Bloodline dragged Sikoa over Rhodes but the champion kicked out. Queue Kevin Owens and Randy Orton. Rhodes' allies had been absent for weeks after being attacked by The Bloodline but returned on Saturday to even the odds.

The three fan-favorites hit Sikoa with signature moves, yet the challenge managed to shrug his shoulder off the mat for a two-count. Rhodes repeatedly struck Sikoa with steel steps. The champion was prepared to take Sikoa's head off with the stairs, similar to what he did to AJ Styles at Clash at the Castle. Sikoa countered with a spear but was soon after the victim of a pair of Cross Rhodes. The champ lined up Sikoa for a match-ending third consecutive finisher, but Jacob Fatu made his presence known. The Bloodline's new enforcer tore through Rhodes before Sikoa crawled over for the cover. Rhodes managed to kick out at the final moment but it only made things worse. Fatu lunged again, laying Rhodes across the announcers' table and driving him through the table with a top rope splash. It appeared Fatu may have legitimately injured his ankle or knee on the landing. Sikoa rolled Rhodes into the ring and hit a top rope splash, yet the fighting champion kicked out. Rhodes hit a Cody Cutter as both men laid fatigued.

That's when Roman Reigns' music hit, eliciting a huge ovation from the Cleveland crowd. Reigns took his time entering the ring. he came face-to-face with Sikoa, slugging him with a Superman punch and shredding him with a spear. Reigns gave Rhodes an acknowledging nod before exiting the ring. Rhodes hit Sikoa with a match-ending Cross Rhodes and stared down Reigns while covering Sikoa.

Candidly, I was prepared to give this match a lower grade. I was burnt out from the sheer quantity of slow burn dramatic matches on the card. But people mostly remember the finale and SummerSlam's finale was awesome. The live audience came unglued for Reigns, who set the stage for an incredible Bloodline civil war that will probably carry SmackDown into November's Survivor Series PPV. Some logic gaps dragged the match down. The most notable was Fatu's late arrival. There were a few instances where Sikoa could have believably lost, putting Fatu's absence into question. Still, it was a phenomenal conclusion to SummerSlam that sets the scene for the rest of 2024. Rhodes (c) def. Sikoa via pinfall to retain the title. Grade: A"
WWE Summer Slam: Cody Rhodes vs Solo Sikoa WWE Championship match results.,https://itrwrestling.com/news/wwe-summerslam-2024-results/,"The WWE SummerSlam PLE featured Cody Rhodes against Solo Sikoa in the main event while Drew McIntyre faced CM Punk.

WWE SummerSlam took place at Cleveland Browns Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio.

It was Michael Cole, Corey Graves and Pat McAfee on commentary. Jelly Roll sang his song “Liar” to start the PLE.

Match #1: Liv Morgan defeated Rhea Ripley to retain the Women’s World Championship. After Morgan brought a steel chair into the ring, Ripley hit a Riptide slam. No cover. Ripley grabbed the steel chair so Dominik grabbed it out of her hands. The fans booed while Dominik said that you can’t win the title like this, which is true. Morgan dropkicked Ripley in the back to knock Dominik off the apron. Morgan hit Oblivion for two. Dominik slid the chair into the ring, he distracted the referee and Morgan capitalized with Oblivion onto the steel chair. Morgan sent the chair out of the ring. Morgan covered Ripley for the pinfall win.

After the match, Dominik Mysterio had a smirk on his face while Morgan celebrated with the Women’s World Title. Dominik picked up Morgan and Dominik kissed Morgan on the lips. Cole: “Dominik, you sorry two-timing son of a bitch!” The fans were booing loudly while Dominik put his arm around Liv’s shoulder and walked away with her. The fans were booing Dominik and Morgan while Pat called Dominik a “piece of s**t” to describe Dirty Dom. The fans were booing loudly for this.

Following some videos and commercials, The Judgment Day’s clubhouse was shown with Damian Priest asking Finn Balor, JD McDonagh and Carlito where Dominik was. Priest asked Balor if he knew Dominik was going to do that. Balor said he didn’t know. Balor, JD & Carlito left to go look for Dominik. Priest said “I’m going to kill this kid” about Dominik.

Match #2: Bron Breakker defeated Sami Zayn by pinfall to win the Intercontinental Championship. Breakker hit two Spears in a row to get the win. It was the shortest match on the show that went about six minutes.

Stephanie McMahon was shown sitting at ringside. She was clapping. The fans cheered.

Logan Paul and LA Knight fought around the ringside area repeatedly for about five minutes before their match started. Knight gave Paul a neckbreaker on the commentary table, but the table didn’t break.

Match #3: LA Knight defeated Logan Paul by pinfall to win the United States Championship. Paul had rapper MGK at ringside and MGK handed Paul some brass knuckles. Paul hit Knight in the head with the brass knucks, but it was like a jab rather than a big punch. Paul went for a Buckshot Lariat, Knight avoided it and Knight hit Blount Force Trauma aka BFT for the pinfall win.

Match #4: Nia Jax defeated Bayley by pinfall to win the WWE Women’s Championship. Tiffany Stratton ran down to the ring with a referee to tease cashing in Money in the Bank, but Bayley punched Stratton to knock her off the apron. Jax hit Bayley with two Powerbombs.

Match #5:Drew McIntyre defeated CM Punk by pinfall in a match with Seth “Freakin” Rollins as the special guest referee. Punk hit Drew with a GTS and Rollins was knocked off the apron to the floor, so when Rollins finally got back in the ring, Drew kicked out at two. Punk got in Rollins’ face and yelled at him about being slow with the count. Rollins said that we don’t need or want Punk here. Rollins said that not everything is about Punk. Rollins said it’s not always about you, a**hole. Punk picked up Rollins and hit him with the GTS. Punk: “It ain’t always about me, but it’s never about you.” Punk got his bracelet back. When Punk turned around, Drew hit Punk with a low blow like Punk did to Drew in the past. Drew was back up and hit the Claymore Kick so Rollins counted the pin for the one…two…and three! Rollins did a count that was at a regular speed although there was a bit of a delay before the third count.

After the match, Drew McIntyre grabbed the bracelet off Punk’s arm and Drew put it back on his arm. Drew put his foot on Punk’s chest and posed as the victor of the match. Referees checked on Punk in the ring as Drew walked away.

Damian Priest was in the locker room getting ready for his match. Finn Balor walked in saying they looked everywhere and couldn’t find him. Priest said he probably left. They both said sorry about what happened earlier. Balor said that The Judgment Day comes first. Balor said he knows Priest doesn’t want him out there, but if he changes his mind, just say the word.

Match #6: Gunther defeated Damian Priest by pinfall to become the new World Heavyweight Champion. Finn Balor made his way down to the ring during the match. Priest hit South of Heaven near the ropes, so when Priest covered, Balor put Gunther’s left leg on the bottom rope! They showed a replay of what Balor did. The announcers said that Priest never saw it because of how he covered Gunther, but Priest saw the replay on the video screen. Balor had a smirk on his face. Priest tried to go after Balor, but Gunther grabbed Priest and applied a sleeper hold on the mat. When Priest got back up, Priest grabbed Balor around the throat. Gunther picked up Priest and hit a Powerbomb. Gunther applied a sleeper hold on the mat with a body scissors around the waist. The referee raised Priest’s hand, Priest was out and Gunther got the win.

The Awesome Truth duo of The Miz & R-Truth were in the ring for a promo. The Miz said that this show set the record for an American SummerSlam attendance record with 57,791 in the crowd. Grayson Waller and Austin Theory aka A-Town Down Under showed up at ringside for the interruption. Waller and Theory kept on insulting the crowd as well as Jelly Roll in the audience. That led to Jelly Roll going into the ring, helping Miz & Truth and Jelly hit Waller & Theory with chairs to the back. Jelly Roll also gave Theory a Chokeslam. The trio of Jelly, Miz & Truth did John Cena’s Five Knuckle Shuffle fist drop on Theory. The fans enjoyed it.

The WWE Bash In Berlin PLE takes place on Saturday, August 31st. That’s four weeks away with a 1 p.m. ET start time.

Who Won The WWE SummerSlam Main Event?

The Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes was shown on his extravagant bus where he walked his beloved dog Pharoah on a leash. I saw Cody mention recently that this was Pharoah’s final trip on the road (Graves mentioned it as well) and Cody left Pharoah with WWE Hall of Famer Arn Anderson, who gave Cody some words of encouragement. Arn said that 54,000 people think that Cody is a damn fine WWE Champion. Arn said that those four guys were coming for Cody. Arn said that he’s got a little influence, had a few conversations and told Cody that he has a few friends who are on the way. As Cody kept on walking, he left Pharoah with a friend and was given his American Nightmare jacket. Cody put on some headgear and made his way into the arena.

Match #7: Cody Rhodes defeated Solo Sikoa by pinfall in a Bloodline Rules Match to retain the Undisputed WWE Championship. After Cody hit Solo with Cross Rhodes, that’s when the interference began. Tama Tonga & Tonga Loa beat up Cody, so Kevin Owens and Randy Orton made the save. Those four guys went fighting to the back. After Cody hit Solo with the Cross Rhodes two more times, Jacob Fatu showed up for an attack. Jacob went up top and Jacob jumped off the top with a Superfly Splash that put Cody through the table. Jacob was selling a right leg injury because he had a rough landing when he hit the table. Back in the ring, Solo went up top and hit an Uso Splash for two. Cody was back up with a superkick. Cody went to the turnbuckle and jumped off with a Cody Cutter.

A graphic appeared saying “Head of the Table” as the familiar music of the real Tribal Chief played and Roman Reigns walked out wearing an “OTC” shirt since he’s the Original Tribal Chief. The fans cheered loudly for Reigns as he slowly walked down to the ring while both guys were down in the ring. Roman went into the ring and nailed Solo Sikoa with a Superman Punch. The fans loved it. Reigns nailed his cousin Solo with a Spear. Reigns looked over at Cody, who was seated up against the ropes. Reigns looked out at the crowd as they chanted “holy s**t” for his return. Reigns nodded at Cody as a sign of respect. The fans chanted “Thank You Roman” for Reigns. Cody picked up Solo, Cody hit Cross Rhodes and Cody pinned Solo while looking at Reigns and the referee counted one…two…and three to give Cody the win.

Cody Rhodes celebrated on the turnbuckle while staring at Roman Reigns. Solo Sikoa was screaming at ringside about what happened. Reigns pointed at his shirt that said “OTC” meaning Original Tribal Chief. Cole said that the real Tribal Chief is back and God help Solo Sikoa. Cody continued to celebrate. The show ended there.

Thanks for reading."
WWE Summer Slam: Cody Rhodes vs Solo Sikoa WWE Championship match results.,https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/wwe-summerslam-2024-live-results-193043309.html,"WWE’s biggest party of the summer was a rager for the ages.

Outside of WrestleMania, SummerSlam is one of the grandest premium live events on WWE’s calendar, and after Saturday night, the course of WWE has drastically changed.

Seven matches took place at the home of the NFL's Cleveland Browns, six of which were for championship gold. CM Punk and Drew McIntyre finally got in the ring months after the hottest rivalry in wrestling began, and the main event featured Cody Rhodes defending the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship against Solo Sikoa. But a remarkable return happened during the Bloodline rules match, and now the fight to be the true ""Tribal Chief"" begins.

Here is a recap of all the action at SummerSlam 2024:

The real ""Tribal Chief"" is back, making his entrance during the Undisputed WWE Championship match. He took out Solo Sikoa.

Undisputed WWE Championship match (Bloodline rules): Cody Rhodes (c) vs. Solo Sikoa

The aura inside Cleveland Browns Stadium was immaculate to start this match, and the crowd made its distaste for Solo Sikoa known early. The first minutes of the match were spent feeling each other out, but it was Sikoa that got some of the best shots in to start. He tried going for quick pins and a Samoan spike, but the champion is a seasoned star that won't go down easy.

Sikoa was still aggressive in his approach, paying homage to his family with several moves they made famous. Rhodes would counter some opportunities only for Sikoa to regain the advantage. Rhodes finally got the upper hand when he executed a Cross Rhodes, but since it was Bloodline rules, Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa came out to punish the champion. Sikoa went for a pin, only for Rhodes to kick out. That's when Kevin Owens came out to aid Rhodes and deal with the siblings. When The Bloodline began to gang up on him, Randy Orton came out to help. Owens and Orton took out Tonga and Loa, and Rhodes got a Cross Rhodes on Sikoa, but he kicked out.

Understanding it takes more to win, Rhodes used the steel steps on Sikoa. He was surprised by a spear from Sikoa, which resulted in an unsuccessful pin. When Sikoa tried to use the steel steps, it backfired and led to two Cross Rhodes from the champion. That's when the unpredictable Jacob Fatu emerged and unleashed a ruthless assault on Rhodes. He helped Sikoa attempt a pin, but Rhodes kicked out. Fatu continued the onslaught with a dive onto the announcer's table, and he appeared to hurt his leg off the jump. Sikoa brought Rhodes into the ring to finish it, and somehow, Rhodes kicked out.

That's when Roman Reigns emerged. The former WWE champion delivered a Superman punch to Sikoa and then a spear to his former enforcer before leaving the ring. Rhodes was stunned watching it happen, but he did what he needed to do. He hit the Cross Rhodes and got the pin on Sikoa as Reigns and him locked eyes. The title is retained.

Greatest shot of the year. pic.twitter.com/WNmPh6OLsS — Roman Reigns SZN 💥 (@reigns_era) August 4, 2024

Analysis: It finally happened. Roman Reigns has made his emphatic return to WWE and he made a statement. Yes, this was a match for the WWE title, but this result means so much more for The Bloodline. Cody Rhodes will be dealt with later.

Now the serious battle for the right to be the ""Tribal Chief"" begins. Solo Sikoa has self-appointed himself to the head of the table, but Reigns is back to remind him who is in charge. How everything unfolds after this will be captivating television that every fan will be excited to watch. One year ago, Paul Heyman said The Bloodline storyline was in the bottom of the third inning, and people thought he was crazy for thinking this story could continue on. Flash forward to now, and it's again the top story in WWE. The ""Wiseman"" was indeed wise.

Pharaoh. Arn Anderson. What an entrance for the Undisputed WWE Champion.

What an arrival for the Undisputed WWE Champion at #SummerSlam! pic.twitter.com/ppePo27mVE — WWE (@WWE) August 4, 2024

Jelly Roll delivers chokeslam, five-knuckle shuffle to Austin Theory

Not only is he the artist of the official song of SummerSlam, he also can put some moves on in the ring.

When The Miz and R-Truth announced the crowd attendance, Austin Theory and Grayson Waller came out to bash Cleveland. Jelly Roll didn't like that, so he showed up in the ring with a steel chair and hit both Theory and Waller with it. Afterward, he delivered a chokeslam to Theory, and he, The Miz and R-Truth hit the five-knuckle shuffle to take him out.

World Heavyweight Championship match: Damian Priest (c) vs. Gunther

Damian Priest knew the challenge he had ahead of him, and he wasted no time going on the attack, surprising Gunther. Once the fury settled, that's when Gunther displayed his prowess and started his game. The champion wasn't going to down easy, responding to anything thrown at him. Gunther is known for his ruthless chops, but it was Priest who landed merciless slaps that were so strong, it cut open the challenger.

Gunther executed his dropkick-powerbomb combo but was unsuccessful in securing the pin. Preist responded with a South of Heaven slam that was also kicked out of. Once Gunther recovered, he started to launch blow after blow to Priest, each hit more punishing than the last. Finn Balor came out and tried to rally his champion, but Gunther was having none of it, even as he had blood running down his body. He kicked Balor in the head, only it added some fuel to Priest. He responded with some vicious clotheslines, landed a Razor's Edge and a South of Heaven slam to get the pin, but chaos ensued.

Balor put Gunther's foot on the rope to end the pin. Priest saw the replay on the Jumbotron and was baffled to see what happened. With Priest distracted, Gunther put the champion in a sleeper hold, only for him to get out. Priest tried to retaliate on Balor, but Gunther went back to the sleeper, and this time the champion was out for good. ""The Ring General"" is the new World Heavyweight Champion.

Analysis: Well, there goes The Judgment Day. With Dominik Mysterio betraying Rhea Ripley and Finn Balor backstabbing Damian Priest, the faction that has controlled ""Monday Night Raw"" for more than a year is basically in shambles.

Gunther is among the best in the business and he didn't need help to keep his hopes of winning the title alive, but it was necessary for story purposes. The World Heavyweight Championship is still young and needs to be held in high regard, and Gunther is the perfect person to take it to the next level. There's a chance he holds this title for a lengthy time period and solidifies his position as the unstoppable force of WWE.

On the other side, a feud between Priest and Finn Balor has been brewing for months and now it'll finally take place. Priest's title reign helped him become a more respectable wrestler, and now he'll look more legit when he takes on a veteran in Balor. The demise of The Judgement Day will be something worth watching.

Drew McIntyre vs. CM Punk (with Seth Rollins as special guest referee)

The most highly-anticipated match of the night started off with tremendous hype, and Seth Rollins helped the crowd get even more wound up before he rang the bell and the two stars teed off on each other.

Issues with Rollins started early when CM Punk and McIntyre both got upset with him going with five-counts off the turnbuckles. CM Punk got the first advantage and took the action out of the ring, and Rollins didn't even bother with the count − or care. When McIntyre got on offense, he bounced Punk off the steel frame of the ring and all Rollins did was laugh.

McIntyre tried pushing Rollins' boundaries with a steel chair, and Rollins looked to allow it, but ultimately grabbed it from McIntyre before he could hit Punk. McIntyre shoved Rollins, who tried to hit McIntyre with the chair in retaliation but almost took out Punk instead. Rollins held back, and got rid of the chair. When he wasn't looking, he missed a roll-up pin from Punk. Punk responded with three high knee kicks and an elbow drop off the top rope, but it wasn't enough for a pin.

Punk had McIntyre ready to submit, but he saw the bracelet that had his wife's and dog's name on it, and he let go to get the bracelet back. It cost Punk. McIntyre landed a Claymore. However, Punk kicked out.

Punk recovered and was going to go for a GTS, only to see Rollins with the bracelet on. Distracted, it gave McIntyre enough time to hit Punk and inadvertently take out Rollins. Punk was able to get the GTS, but since Rollins was out, he wasn't able to get the pin. Punk and Rollins argued, and it ended with Punk delivering a GTS on the referee. Punk got his bracelet back, but McIntyre hit a low blow and then a Claymore on his opponent. He went for the pin, and even though it was slow, Rollins counted to three to get McIntyre the win. Plus, McIntyre got the bracelet back

Analysis: There was plenty of hype for this match and it delivered on all fronts. Seth Rollins was so good at creating chaos, letting CM Punk and Drew McIntyre unleash hell on each other while adding layers of complexity with his authority.

For as much as McIntyre has cost himself this year thanks to his rival, it was Punk who blew it this time. He lost focus with Rollins and it led to him losing his first WWE singles match in a decade. But despite not having an actual match in quite some time, he looked fantastic. There were moments where it looked like we were watching prime Punk from years ago, and that's a good sign as he gets fully back into competing with WWE. The rivalry between him and McIntyre is far from over, but it did plant the seeds for a future feud between Punk and Rollins, something that was planned for WrestleMania 40. Round one goes to McIntyre. Can't wait to see what round two offers.

Watch: CM Punk makes entrance for first WWE singles match since 2014

WWE Women's Championship match: Bayley (c) vs. Nia Jax

The ""Queen of the Ring"" took quick control of this match, dominating Bayley right out of the gate with vicious, powerful moves. Even when Bayley was able to get some shots in or slow down the challenger, Nia Jax would take back control, taunting her several times in the process. Jax even got in an Annihilate-her that surely looked to end the match, but Bayley got out of it.

Jax continued to put the pressure on, and she was going to go for another Annihilate-her, but Bayley not only got up before it was too late, she picked up Jax and delivered an insane power bomb in an incredible display of strength. Bayley went for a flying elbow to end the match, but Jax kicked out.

Tiffany Stratton came out and attempted to cash in her Money in the Bank contract, but she wasn't able to do it since Bayley knocked her out. Turns out, that's exactly what Jax needed.

The challenger recovered and caught Bayley trying to end the match. She hit a power bomb on her and landed not only one, but two Annihilate-hers on Bayley. It was more than enough and Jax claimed the WWE Women's Championship.

Analysis: This was a shocking result. Bayley hadn't done much with her title reign, but she was still a formidable champion that was looking to get a convincing victory. Instead, Nia Jax is queen and champion.

Say what you want about Jax's in-ring abilities, but she has improved so much since her first stint in WWE. She's a great heel, and now she's able to pull it off exceptionally in matches. Now, she's getting rewarded for how far she's come. Tiffany Stratton may have come out to just be a distraction, but regardless, she and Jax are a formidable threat in the women's division for now. Yes, Stratton can cash in her contract on Jax if she wants to, but that likely won't come soon. So in the meantime, Jax can reign in terror on ""Friday Night SmackDown"" and become a legitimate, dominant champion.

United States Championship match: Logan Paul (c) vs. LA Knight

The hatred between these two is so strong, the action started outside of the ring before the bell even rang. LA Knight was attacked, but he got the upper hand and even used Prime bottles as a weapon before he pulled off a Neckbreaker on the announcer's table.

The two finally got in the ring for the match to start, and LA Knight began with the advantage before the champion gained the upper-hand. Even though he was performing in his home state, the crowd booed Paul while clearly making it known it wanted LA Knight to win. The crowd advantage appeared to help the challenger get back on the attack, and he had an impressive elbow drop in a move we hadn't seen from the wrestling veteran. But Paul showed off the aerial skills he's known for with a wild backflip off the top rope outside the ring.

Paul landed his coveted knockout punch, but LA Knight kicked out. He countered with a Superplex off the top rope, and Paul also successfully kicked out. Paul tried to get brass knuckles from his associates ring-side, and LA Knight tried to eliminate the chance by taking them out. But it was artist Machine Gun Kelly that had the brass knuckles as a neckless, and he gave them to Paul. He sneaked in a hit to the head, and he went for the win, but LA Knight recovered, executed a BFT and got the pin to win his first singles title in WWE.

Analysis: LA Knight finally gets his moment. He exploded onto the scene last year and instantly became a fan favorite, even getting a WWE title shot, but there was no solid momentum for him to build off of. Time was running out for him to capture a championship, and if he didn't win Saturday, it might've been the end of his stardom. Logan Paul has been impressive in the ring, but he wasn't a great champion since he barely defended the title, plus there's his out-of-the-ring, social media issues. It was the perfect opportunity to take the title off of Paul and give it to someone that not only needed it, but deserved it. The LA Knight reign is here, yeah.

Intercontinental Championship match: Sami Zayn (c) vs. Bron Breakker

Bron Breakker tried to end the match off the bat with a spear, but Sami Zayn was smart enough to get out of the way and let the eager star hurt himself.

Still, Breakker is unlike any star WWE has seen, and he recovered quickly by showcasing his power and speed on the champion. Zayn went for a Helluva Kick, but Breakker countered with a spear. He knew it might take more, and he bounced off the ropes with his incredible speed and hit another deadly spear on Zayn to get the pin in relatively quick fashion and become the new Intercontinental Champion.

Analysis: Bron Breakker has been built up as the future of the next generation, and now he finally has championship gold to begin that climb to the top of the mountain. It's unfortunate this match was done in quick fashion knowing Zayn can put on a classic, and it made him look more like a punching bag, but Breakker needed to be put over a certified star to show he will be a problem in the future for the entire roster. It's a major win for someone that needed it more than the champion did. This Intercontinental title run will be crucial to his development, but Breakker is on the right path toward unimaginable success.

Damian Priest livid after Dominik Mysterio turns on Rhea Ripley

The World Heavyweight Champion has another issue to deal with before his match against Gunther.

Damian Priest stormed into The Judgment Day locker room after seeing Dominik Mysterio turn on Rhea Ripley and kiss Liv Morgan. The three other members said they would go find Mysterio and deal with him.

Women's World Championship match: Liv Morgan (c) vs. Rhea Ripley

""Mami"" and Dom are no more.

Liv Morgan kept away from Rhea Ripley to start, playing cat-and-mouse for several minutes. When they finally met in the ring, Ripley launched a full assault on the champion. She went for a quick finish with a Riptide, but Morgan got out of it to end the threat. Morgan pushed Ripley into the turnbuckle and she hit the surgically repaired shoulder she just recovered from. Ripley told the referee ""it's out"" about her right shoulder, but didn't want the match to end, and Morgan went on offense with repeated shots to the injured shoulder. When she had a free moment, Ripley popped her shoulder back in place in a painful moment.

With Ripley's shoulder feeling better, she was able to get back to delivering blows, but Morgan was countering nearly everything. She tried to bring a chair into the fold, and Ripley hit a Riptide. She wasn't done, and tried to hit Morgan with the chair, but Dominik Mysterio stopped her. It distracted Ripley, and Morgan kicked Ripley into Mysterio and executed an Ob-Liv-ion. But somehow, Ripley kicked out.

But Mysterio got the referee's attention, and with him not looking, Morgan hit an Ob-Liv-ion and Ripley's head landed on the chair. Morgan then went for the pin, with the referee paying attention, and Morgan got the win.

And that wasn't all.

Mysterio turned on his ""Mami."" He helped Morgan up and gave her a big smooch, shocking Ripley and the crowd. The two walked away arm-in-arm with a stunned Ripley in disbelief.

Analysis: What a twist that was. After declaring his devotion to Rhea Ripley over Liv Morgan, Dominik Mysterio suddenly switched sides by helping Morgan get the win, on purpose. It being a dirty finish means these two stars will have to tangle again at some point in the future, but what happened post-match was the icing on the cake.

The kiss between the two was a spectacular shot that had everybody in the stadium going wild, and it definitely will add more fuel to what is the best women's rivalry in wrestling this year. Also, this could be the beginning of the end for The Judgement Day. Mysterio will surely be out of the group, or it will begin to crumble altogether, soon.

SummerSlam history

SummerSlam has been a yearly staple for WWE for decades. It first took place in 1988 at Madison Square Garden and it’s been held every year since then. This year will be the 37th edition of SummerSlam.

This year’s edition will be the first time it’s taking place in Cleveland since 1996, when it took place at the Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse.

Cody Rhodes vs. Solo Sikoa match stipulation: What are Bloodline rules?

Bloodline rules are back.

On Friday Night SmackDown just before SummerSlam, Rhodes agreed to the title match against Sikoa being under Bloodline rules.

The match will essentially be a no disqualification match, meaning anything goes. It was the stipulation of the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship match between Rhodes and Reigns at WrestleMania 40, which saw all sorts of surprises with John Cena, The Rock and The Undertaker.

Who is the special guest referee for CM Punk vs. Drew McIntyre?

Seth Rollins will be the special guest referee for the bout between CM Punk and Drew McIntyre. Rollins has history with both stars and he has made it known he doesn’t like either one of them, making it an intriguing addition to the match.

Will Roman Reigns return at SummerSlam 2024?

Will the real “Tribal Chief” stand up?

There’s speculation that Roman Reigns will make his return to WWE on Saturday for the first time since he lost the WWE title at WrestleMania 40 in April. Since then, he’s been absent from programming while Solo Sikoa has taken over as the “Tribal Chief” of The Bloodline.

Sikoa has reigned terror since taking on the leadership role; he’s brought in Tama Tonga, Tonga Loa and Jacob Fatu to the group, and he’s made it known this is his place to run and Reigns no longer is in charge. He even attacked the “Wiseman” and WWE Hall of Famer Paul Heyman after he refused to acknowledge him as the “Tribal Chief.”

With all the turmoil of The Bloodline, fans are hoping Reigns makes his return to WWE Saturday night. Especially since the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship match will be under Bloodline rules, meaning anything goes in the match, it gives a perfect opportunity for Reigns to come back, regardless of how the title fight ends.

Liv Morgan-Rhea Ripley history

Liv Morgan and Rhea Ripley’s rivalry has been red hot in recent months, but the Women’s World Championship match on Saturday is years in the making.

Morgan and Ripley were tag team partners in 2022 and even challenged for the Women's Tag Team Championship at WrestleMania 38. They were unsuccessful, and not long afterward, Ripley attacked Morgan and joined The Judgement Day. They would cross paths again at the 2023 Royal Rumble when Ripley eliminated Morgan to win the women’s Royal Rumble match.

Things picked up in July 2023 when Ripley attacked Morgan and Raquel Rodriguez, who were Women’s Tag Team Champions at the time, which led to them dropping the titles. The next week Ripley and Morgan would face each other, but Ripley attacked her prior to the match with a steel chair, injuring Morgan’s shoulder that would need surgery.

Morgan returned at the 2024 Royal Rumble, and at the Raw after WrestleMania 40, she attacked Women’s World Champion Ripley as part of her “Liv Morgan revenge tour” to get back at the champion. Ripley’s shoulder was injured and she was forced to vacate the title, much to the joy of Morgan.

It took time, but Morgan claimed the Women’s World Championship at King and Queen of the Ring, thanks to the inadvertent help of Dominik Mysterio, the on-screen love interest of Ripley. Over the next few months, Morgan spent time seducing Mysterio, hoping to get him on her side as Ripley was out. Ripley returned in July and Mysterio sided with “Mami” instead of Morgan, much to the dismay of the champion, and setting the stage for their match at SummerSlam.

Joe Tessitore to begin WWE commentary in September

ESPN broadcaster Joe Tessitore will make his debut as WWE commentator on Sept. 2 when he takes over the Monday Night Raw duties, Michael Cole announced Saturday. Cole will be moving to Friday Night SmackDown, meaning as of now, it'll be Tessitore and Pat McAfee on the call for Mondays.

CJ Perry, fka Lana, has high praise for Liv Morgan

One of the stories dominating WWE is the relationship between Women's World Champion Liv Morgan and Dominik Mysterio since Rhea Ripley was injured, and one former WWE star said the title holder is in the ""perfect"" role for it.

CJ Perry, formerly known as Lana from her time in WWE, is close friends with Morgan and raved about her performance since she injured Ripley in April and became champion in May.

""She's in the perfect casting. She's an incredible worker, she's an incredible athlete,"" Perry told USA TODAY Sports at 2024 ESPY Awards. ""At the end of the day, professional wrestling is scripted television, where we want to believe what you're doing is real, and she's the hot girl. We love her.”

Bron Breakker poised to be a major WWE star

Cody Rhodes says prior to his entrance music “Wrestling has more than one royal family,” and while it’s true, there’s another WWE star making a solid case for his family to be in the picture.

Son of Rick Steiner and nephew of Scott Steiner – both WWE Hall of Famers – Bron Breakker has exploded onto the scene ever since he arrived at the company in 2021. He won the NXT Championship twice and the NXT Tag Team Championship, and since his callup to the main roster, he’s become someone with unlimited potential. He’s been nothing but dominant since his arrival, and he’ll have another major match in his young career Saturday when he challenges Sami Zayn again for the Intercontinental Championship.

Even though he isn’t exactly a “genetic freak” like his uncle, Breakker has proven there is no star like him.

“With what I'm doing, I'm not so sure anyone's ever done it before,” Breakker told USA TODAY Sports.

Forecasting the direction The Bloodline and undisputed WWE champion Cody Rhodes are headed post-SummerSlam is far from simple.

We know Roman Reigns will be involved, based on his return Saturday in Cleveland, but we do not know when or where, with Survivor Series making the most sense.

As of now, The Head of the Table is not featured on any marketing materials for Bash in Berlin and there is no reason to think he is going to make that trip for a show that is going to be primarily focused on world heavyweight champion Gunther.

So where does that leave The Bloodline and Rhodes?

Why not book the two in the same match with the emphasis not only on their ongoing feud but, also, with the potential to plant the seeds for the expected program between The American Nightmare and The Viper?

Solo Sikoa wasted no time taking the title of Tribal Chief in the absence of Reigns and recruiting new members into The Bloodline. Although they've been a dominant force on Friday nights in recent months, it was always more a matter of when and not if Reigns would return to claim his rightful throne.

SummerSlam always made the most sense for that to be where he finally resurfaced, and the moment didn't disappoint.

It would have been entirely possible for Reigns to refuse to reveal where his allegiance lies at the event and instead have a simple showdown with Sikoa to tease that they could patch things up. Reigns decisively attacking Sikoa was the right route to take.

On his first night as a babyface in over four years, Reigns' direction was established: eliminating every member of The Bloodline until arriving at Sikoa."

New rivalries that will heat up after SummerSlam 2024

1. Roman Reigns vs Solo Sikoa

The most shocking incident fans witnessed was the comeback of Roman Reigns in WWE after five months. Cody Rhodes vs Solo Sikoa match was going on for the Undisputed WWE Championship, In the middle of the fight Reigns music hit and the most anticipated return took place in SummerSlam. Reigns was seen wearing an OTC written T-shirt which means ‘Orginal Tribal Chief’. Reigns was angry and hit his signature Spear on Sikoa who was competing for the WWE title and then Rhodes beat him and retained the title. The Tribal family members Reigns and Sikoa were seen in a future feud after the SummerSlam.

2. Finn Balor vs Damian Priest

The second biggest shock for the fans was Finn Balor betraying his Judgement Day member Damian Priest. Priest was defending his WWE World heavyweight title against Gunther, Priest was commanding the bout and hit his signature chokeslam to Gunther when he was about to pin him, Balor pulled his leg and shocked everyone with his move and ultimately Priest lost his title and Priest was seen in heartbreak after the match and will look to take revenge from Balor.

3. Rhea Ripley vs Dominik Mysterio

Dominik Mysterio accompanied Rhea Ripley in the match against Liv Morgan for the WWE Women’s Championship. Mysterio was supporting his friend Ripley in the match but in the middle of the fight, Mysterio threw a chair in the ring, which was later used by Morgan and pinned Ripley and retained her title. Following the win Mysterio was seen kissing Morgan after the win and Ripley’s heart was broken after seeing the betrayal from his old friend."

It was a night of betrayal, shocks and surprises as WWE SummerSlam unfolded in front of 57,000 fans in Cleveland on Saturday.

All eyes were on CM Punk as he wrestled his first televised singles match in over a decade, going toe-to-toe with British star Drew McIntyre to conclude one of the hottest feuds of the year.

But it was “Dirty” Dominik Mysterio who set the tone for the evening long before those two stepped into the ring, turning on Rhea Ripley and The Judgement Day after the Women’s World Championship match opened the show.

The Judgement Day imploded further as the penultimate match of the night concluded, with Finn Balor betraying Damian Priest.

However, the biggest shock of the night came in the main event, which saw Cody Rhodes face Solo Sikoa for the Undisputed Universal Championship - amid rumours of a Roman Reigns return.

After a gruelling battle, “The American Nightmare” secured the three count to defend his title, as the “Tribal Chief” made his first appearance since WrestleMania, returning to attack his own Bloodline.

Who else is rumoured to make an appearance?

WWE star-turned-actor John Cena at the Oscars in March (Academy Awards 2024/ ABC)

WrestleMania 30 saw WWE pull out all the stops, with Hulk Hogan, The Rock and “Stone Cold” Steve Austin appearing together in one segment. While there have been controversies surrounding Hogan in recent years, some fans have speculated that the wrestling legend could feature at WrestleMania 40.

Meanwhile, John Cena has expressed a desire to be involved in some way. As recently as WrestleMania 38 in 2022, Austin competed against Kevin Owens – in the icon’s first match since 2003 – so the “Rattlesnake” could yet appear in Philadelphia, whether in a match or simply on the microphone.

What is WrestleMania?

WrestleMania is an annual event that is put on by the WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment). It is the biggest show of the year for the company, which in turn is the biggest in professional wrestling. Since 2020, WrestleMania has played out as a two-night event. The WWE tends to reserve its highest-profile match-ups – and in some cases, its highest-profile stars – for WrestleMania.

For example, WWE star-turned-actor Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson will feature on Night 1 this year, in his first WWE match for eight years. His last match was a six-second win over Erick Rowan, as Johnson set a record for the shortest match in WrestleMania history. In the run-up to WrestleMania 40, The Rock has been heavily involved in the WWE’s weekly episodic television, for the first time since his rivalry with John Cena concluded at WrestleMania 29 in 2013."

By Colin McGuire, ProWrestling.net Staffer

Welcome to the biggest party of the summer: Roman Reigns’ … er … SummerSlam! In a twist, McGuire’s Mondays now means McGuire’s Hot In Cleveland (sans Betty White) Saturday nights. I’ll spare you more yammering. Let’s go.

6:47 p.m.: And so here we are. I drove all this way for some press box Wing garlic parm wings and a SummerSlam broke out. As Pat McAfee made his entrance for the live crowd, I sat down, so forgive me if I’ve missed anything. Drums are being erected in the ring. Jelly Roll must be imminent.

6:55 p.m.: Ut oh. A “light rain will start in 15 minutes” weather alert just came through on my technological device. No way … right?

6:57 p.m.: As the obligatory shots of people arriving backstage aired on the big screens in the stadium, CM Punk garnered the biggest reaction from the live crowd by my very scientific measurement (Seth and Cody were close seconds). And then … well … Jelly Roll.

7:02 p.m.: At the time of the official tip, there were noticeable swaths of seats empty, but by no means does the stadium look empty from this bird’s eye view. I feel for Jelly Roll, man. Dude sings “God Bless America” and then they ask him to stand in the ring for even longer. Walking around the stadium earlier, I was drenched in sweat. I can’t even imagine how it must feel all the way down there under those lights. Naturally, The Paul Levesque Era’s biggest highlight to date is Trips having the ability to formally introduce Mr. Roll to the masses. Also of note: I had no idea Nasty Boy Knobbs was playing drums for the guy these days.

7:09 p.m.: The press box really loves it some Rhea Ripley.

7:14 p.m.: Boy, you forget how long WWE entrances can feel in person when you haven’t seen them in person for a long time. At this rate – and judging by Liv Morgan’s entrance alone – Cody won’t make it to the ring until Survivor Series. In my frantic rush to get going in time, I left something out. I didn’t know this until I saw it tonight, so maybe I’m late to the party, but WWE does something Taylor Swift-level smart in that it sets up merch stands outside the gates around the venue. I get it. Why leave any dollars on the table if you can take all of the dollars with you. But it does make me wonder: How often might fans wander down to something like this without the intention to get sucked in, see some shirts, feel the atmosphere and pull up StubHub on their phones to see if they can get into this stuff for cheap? Or, for that matter, how many non-paying fans who don’t even go into the event give WWE money by throwing 40 bucks at a Bloodline T-shirt?

7:20 p.m.: The Ref Cam! On the big screen!

7:32 p.m.: The crowd really woke up for the finish of Rhea vs. Liv. The Dom stuff was clever. I can’t and probably won’t ever get used to being in a press box, working, doing media/journalism/whatever you want to call it and the majority of the people in said press box act like they are fans in the crowd. When the kiss between Dom and Liv happened, it felt like I was at a house party. I say that without judgment. Just noting: Tough to get used to. I’m old.

7:40 p.m.: Bron Breakker’s entrance is so underwhelming live. Shoot. It’s so underwhelming on television. WWE should do something about that.

7:48 p.m.: You can’t tell me Bron Breakker is a heel. The stadium, along with the media, erupted in applause when he won (also, did something in that match go awry? That finish felt like it came out of nowhere and it wasn’t long after some miscommunication appeared to happen. Not sure what was shown on television; just speaking to what I saw from up here). People love this guy. Some argue the world of tweeners isn’t a viable place to be in pro wrestling and while that might be true long-term, Breakker is sure doing quite well living in that space currently. My only question: How do you turn him full-on babyface but keep his edge? It’s tricky but not impossible.

7:55 p.m.: One-hour attendance check – those swaths of seats are still not filled and that’s surprising. It looks like we have what we’re going to have for the night, audience-wise. Again, it’s a stadium. And the stadium has more than enough people in it to feel like this is a success. I just sort of expected WWE to draw a little more than what my eye is seeing.

7:59 p.m.: Stephanie McMahon showed up! Not in the box. In the crowd. But that’s fun. I wonder if she’d be up for taking a look at the Pink Floyd “The Wall” exhibit currently up at the Rock Hall across the street. I bet she’s more of a Roger Waters guy than a David Gilmour guy and that’s disappointing.

8:01 p.m.: I just heard someone in the press box say the Hawk Tuah girl is in the building. I present that without comment.

8:04 p.m.: The centuries-old feud between Cleveland, Ohio, and Hagerstown, Maryland, culminates, finally, with this U.S. title match.

8:17 p.m.: Just watching how sweaty Logan Paul is, I’d love to know if these people enjoy performing outside in the middle of August when it rained earlier and might rain later so the humidity is wild. That in mind … wait, oh my God, LA Knight just killed Logan Paul.

8:20 p.m.: LA Knight might have the pop of the night thus far. After all this time, that guy continues to be this weird phenomenon where he’s not Daniel Bryan-over where other people’s segments are hijacked because of him, but he never really seems to lose steam being one of the most over people on in the company, despite losses, questionable programming and sometimes not even making it onto television. It’s quite the sweet spot and I can’t recall another situation like like with a wrestler in recent memory. Whatever it is, good for him on getting some gold tonight. I root for that guy.

8:33 p.m.: Lots and lots and lots and lots of empty seats for this Bayley vs. Jax match. I feel for those women. That said, it’s a little after 8:30 p.m. EST, about an hour and a half into the card, and we’ve seen only three complete matches. I can understand if the crowd is feeling a little restless. That said (again), since there is so much space between these matches with video packages, et al, why couldn’t you go grab a hot dog or use the bathroom or buy your shirt then? Why skip a match when there are only seven of them?

8:45 p.m.: Bayley’s powerbomb woke up a live crowd that desperately needed to be woken up.

8:51 p.m.: I don’t know about you, but I’m super looking forward to my Friday nights being filled with manufactured tension between Nia Jax and Tiffany Stratton from now until Royal Rumble 2027, at which time somehow Roxanne Perez will be inserted into the program and there will be two other women with MITB briefcases running around WWE programming. Because drama.

8:55 p.m.: How is there still light in the sky? I would have definitely taken the under on when the sun would be completely set and I would have lost money.

9:07 p.m.: CM Punk vs. Drew McIntyre is the match this crowd wanted to see most to this point. We have two more matches after this, but I’d bet this live crowd stays with that opinion by the time the night is over. The only reason anyone cares about the main event is because of the potential of seeing someone who isn’t even wrestling in it. When it comes to only what match these people are up for most, it’s gotta be this. If a stadium can feel electric, this was the closest it’s been all night.

9:17 p.m.: The biggest pop for a friendship bracelet since Travis Kelce … oh, forget it.

9:22 p.m.: I don’t know, man. For two guys who have spent months insisting on making us believe they really hate each other, this Punk/MacIntyre match feels like it lacks something live. I’m not sure how this is coming across on television, but Rollins is more distracting than anything. It kind of takes away from whatever type of blood feud this is supposed to be. Maybe the commentators are doing a better job putting it over on the broadcast, but halfway through the match, it feels like things should be more intense.

9:25 p.m.: OK, maybe a little more than halfway through the match. Maybe through all of the match. Yeah, I expected more.

9:35 p.m.: Wait. What. They just showed a “WWE Legends Suite” on the big screen? What? If I can get five minutes with Bastion Booger, expect a Dot Net exclusive.

9:46 p.m.: Pro wrestling shows at an outside venue are a mixed bag. There is a stark contrast between this Gunther vs. Priest match after the sky has gone totally dark and the Ripley vs. Morgan match that opened the show. It almost feels like two different shows (and, in some ways, the feeling like some matches are opening acts for the entire event). Pro wrestling is best under bright, multicolored lights and a dark backdrop that at least makes it feel like you’re in a room. It took until this, the second-to-last match of the night, to really get that feeling. Punk vs. McIntyre sort of had it towards the end, but Priest vs. Gunther is the first complete package. It’s all to say … are stadium shows really this necessary?

9:51 p.m.: Oh no! I was just alerted to the reality that one, Mr. Bastion Booger passed away in 2010. I meant no harm, fellow Booger-ites. My sincerest apologies. I instead hope to track down Hikuleo, who as we all know, is a star.

9:59 p.m.: Seeing Gunther be happy at ringside and kiss his wife is a shock to the system.

10:05 p.m.: Cleveland sure does love its hometown boys. Wait. The Miz is telling me almost 58,000 people are in this stadium. Oh, but did you know Wembley … never mind.

10:12 p.m.: Fleetwood Mac, Peter Gabriel, Elvis Costello – those are just a few of the fine rock and roll shows I’ve attended while visiting fabulous Cleveland, Ohio, throughout my life. Nothing compares, however, to Jelly Roll choke-slamming Austin Theory.

10:19 p.m.: The way a live crowd stands up after Cody’s opponent’s entrance music ends and turns to the entrance to see when Cody will appear and Cody’s music will start should be studied. That’s some real rock star stuff there, friends.

10:31 p.m.: Cody’s tan is so thick, he looks like a basketball draped in an American flag from the press box.

10:38 p.m.: The vibe at this point is so silly. Nobody cares about a rest hold in a Bloodline Rules match, for God’s sake! Everyone is just sitting on their hands until the nonsense begins. Definite “What are we even doing out here right now” feelings from the crowd. And rightfully so. Come on, guys.

10:49 p.m.: Man, even though everyone was waiting on him, the second Jacob Fatu appeared, it was like 58,000 people collectively lost their breath. I love to see it.

10:53 p.m.: There is Roman Reigns and then there is everybody else.

10:57 p.m.: That’s it and that’s all. A newsworthy SummerSlam for a lot of story reasons, but did it feel like one of the year’s best pro wrestling events? I’m not so sure. Perhaps I’ll have more to say on Monday …"

WWE Summer Slam: Cody Rhodes vs Solo Sikoa WWE Championship match results.,https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2024/8/4/24213117/jacob-fatu-injury-wwe-summerslam-2024-cody-rhodes-solo-sikoa-roman-reigns-return,"During the main event of SummerSlam at Cleveland Browns Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio, Jacob Fatu was running wild on Cody Rhodes, helping Solo Sikoa in his quest to win the WWE championship. He went big with it too, putting Rhodes on the announcer’s table and doing a big dive from the top rope.

When he landed, he instantly grabbed at his leg. It was hard to tell if he was legitimately injured or just doing a great job selling but they weren’t shooting him much anymore and the remainder of the match — which featured the big return of Roman Reigns — played out with him still down outside the ring.

Now, video has emerged of Fatu wearing a walking boot after the event:

It would be a real shame if Fatu is forced to miss significant time. Hell, it would be a shame if he’s forced to miss any amount of time, considering he’s been an absolute force of nature in his brief time with WWE. The prospect of the new Bloodline feuding with Reigns with Fatu as Sikoa’s enforcer is as exciting as it gets.

Let’s hope we don’t have to wait too long for it."

In the main event of the 2024 WWE SummerSlam event, ""The American Nightmare"" Cody Rhodes successfully retained the Undisputed WWE Championship against Solo Sikoa, albeit with an assist from the returning Roman Reigns.

Match coverage courtesy of Mike Hogan of Rajah.com:

Undisputed WWE Championship ""Bloodline Rules"" Main Event Match: Cody Rhodes(c) vs Solo Sikoa

After a vignette reminding us that this is a Bloodlines Rules match--the same match type Cody won the title off Roman in, at WrestleMania 40--we get Solo Sikoa's solo entrance to a chorus of boos. Commentary are shocked Solo's coming out solo. Solo's all like, yolo. We cut to the back after the lengthy entrance and see Cody in a trailer. The crowd pops and starts to chant for Cody. He gets his dog, Pharaoh--finishing his story as a road companion for Cody, due to his age and health--outside his trailer. Another long shot as Cody makes his way from, literally, his trailer in the parking garage in the back of the arena, through the arena, to the gorilla position. ""The Enforcer"" Arn Anderson greets Cody in the back to a pop from us old timers. Arn tells Cody some encouraging words, and says he refuses to let Cody fall victim to the Bloodline. He states he has some friends still backstage and Cody will have backup. Cody changes from sweats into his patriotic American Nightmare and the crowd erupts into a huge Cody. Cody puts on his famous golden winged helmet and the crowd erupts again! Adrenaline...in my soul... The crowd starts to sing and Cody makes his way out. Whoa-oh! Cody removes his helmet and begins his own long entrance at 10:21pm. We get official announcements and the bell at 10:26pm.

The crowd starts us off with a very loud ""we want Roman"" chant. Solo and Cody circle before locking up. Cody with a side headlock; the hold's broken with a whip from Solo. Both men shoulder thrust, and neither budges. Cody runs off the ropes and again shoulder charges Solo. Solo sends Cody to the mat and raises a finger for acknowledgement. Makes sense--Samantha Irvin didn't announce Solo as the Tribal Chief, after all. Both men spend several more moments, keeping a slow pace as they resort to long stares, side headlocks and jawing off the mouth to eat up time. Cody looks for his drop-down punch but Solo has it scouted, grabbing his wrist and telling him no. Both men lock up, with Cody exiting the ring to compose himself. The champ shakes it off as Solo taunts him from the ring. Cody enters the ring and both men again circle. Slow start to this match. Solo with a kick to the gut, followed by a headbutt and a chop. Cody fires back with a chop of his own. Cody strings together some strikes, then uses a disaster kick to send Solo to the outside. Cody follows it up with a suicide dive wiping out the challenger. Cody looks for another but Solo clocks him with a huge right, dropping the champ on the spot!

Solo takes a stretch in command, taking the action back into the ring. It's evident Solo's studied tape on Cody, as time and time again he stops Cody from performing some of his signature moves. Solo sends Cody flying across the ring before whipping him into the ropes. Again, another Samoan drop-toss sends the champ flying. Solo keeps the pace slow. Solo hints at the Samoan Spike. Cody blocks with a kick to the thumb. Cody kicks Solo in the face; Cody with a Cody Cutter! Cody sends Solo outside. Rhodes begins to work over the challenger, sending him into the Prime Hydration Station (cart). Rhodes takes the action back inside. Sikoa eats a drop-down punch. Cody with his combination of strikes, culminating in a Bionic Elbow. Cody looks for another Cody Cutter but Sikoa catches him and converts it into a sit-out powerbomb for a close cover! Solo takes over for a few more moments, taunting the crowd. Again, Solo waste long moments taunting and working the crowd. Rhodes recovers and looks for a bomb, but Solo escapes. Solo and Cody take turns attempting slams until Solo connects with a huge Urinage side slam. The crowd pops for both men.

Sikoa begins to work on Cody's traps, squeezing them hard as the champ screams. The crowd tries tor ally the champ, who fights to his feet. Rhodes with rights to the gut and face of Sikoa. Solo shuts it down with a Samoan Drop out of nowhere, garnering another two-count. Sikoa strands Cody in a Tree of Woe and hits a stalling headbutt on the vulnerable champ. Solo tells Cody loudly, ""I'm gonna beat your ass in front of your (entire) family."" Solo with another diving headbutt to the strung-up champ. Solo again takes time to taunt Cody and the crowd. Sikoa looks for a third headbutt but Cody moves out of the way and climbs the turnbuckles. Cody with a diving corkscrew moonsault off the top, wiping out Sikoa. Cody begins to rally, pulling the challenger to his feet. Cody with a series of rights, stunning Sikoa. Cody runs off the ropes and right into a spinning slam from Sikoa for another close two.

The back-and-forth continues until Cody begins to chain together enough offense to prompt a Bloodline entrance. The WWE Tag Team Champions begin to destroy Cody Rhodes as the crowd loudly boos and chants ""Yeet!"" Solo covers the decimated Cody, and the ref counts to two before Cody gets an arm up. Kevin Owens' music plays and out comes the Prize Fighter! KO hobbles down to the ring as fast as he can, attempting to make the save at 10:43pm. KO slugs at both Tonga & Tanga. KO drops the challenger! KO unloads into T&T yet again! The crowd loudly chants various things all at once, both for KO, Yeet, and others. Randy Orton's music plays and out comes the Legend Killer! Faces: Cody, Randy, KO; Heels: Solo, Tonga & Tanga. Orton hits the ring and begins RKO'ing anyone Bloodline-adjacent! KO with a stunner! Powerslam from Randy Orton on Solo! KO heads up top and hits the swanton off the top on Solo! Cody pulls Sikoa up and hits the Cross Rhodes for another close fall. Orton & Owens chase off Tonga & Tanga, leaving just the champ and challenger in the ring.

Cody exits the ring and gets steel steps taking them into the ring Rhodes uses the steps to ram Sikoa. Cody yells at Solo, then uses the steps to ram Sikoa into the corner yet again! Cody yells ""go down"" over and over. Rhodes looks for a third strike with the stairs, but Sikoa spears Cody outta nowhere! Sikoa covers and gets two. Sikoa positions the stairs in the corner, sits Cody against them, and begins to pummel the champ. Sikoa backs off across the ring and looks for a charging strike. Rhodes moves, and Sikoa bounces off the ring post and stairs! Cody connects with a Cross Rhodes. Cody with a second Cross Rhodes, but holds on--just like WrestleMania 40, he looks for a triple Cross Rhodes. ""The Samoan Werewolf"" Jacob Fatu attacks the champ from behind, taking him out! Fatu with a huge moonsault off the top on the laid-out champ. Fatu drags Sikoa over to Rhodes, placing Sol on top of the champ. Cody kicks out at two! Fatu pulls Cody up and sends Rhodes outside the ring. Fatu with a Superkick!

Sikoa recovers and begins to order Fatu's carnage. Fatu places Rhodes on the commentary table, enters the ring, and climbs the top turnbuckle. Fatu with a HUGE Snuka-style splash from the top of the turnbuckle to the outside commentary table, driving the champion through the desk! Fatu is down! Solo takes the champ into the ring, then climbs the turnbuckles himself. Solo with a big splash off the top himself, covering for two only. The champ somehow kicks out! Solo wants a Samoan Spike but Cody collapses. Solo pulls Cody up. Cody fires back, slugging the challenger before hitting a Cody Cutter! Without warning we hear the drums--ROMAN REIGNS IS HERE! The crowd goes absolutely ape shit! Roman Reigns takes his time walking to the ring, and commentary geeks out as hard as the 57,000-plus in attendance! Solo is shocked! Cody is shocked! Pat's shocked! Everyone's shocked! Roman enters the ring and hits the Superman Punch on Sikoa! Roman calls for hte spear and the crowd loudly roars ""oo-ah"" in unison! A HUGE spear form Roman nearly cuts Solo in half! Roman turns attention to Cody and the crowd erupts again, this time with a ""holy shit"" chant! Roman exits the ring and begins to make his way up the ramp. Cody is in shock, and Roman pauses one last time to look back at Rhodes. A loud ""thank-you Roman"" chant from the crowd as Cody hits the Cross Rhodes, covers and retains at 10:55pm!

Your Winner AND STILL Undisputed WWE Champion, Cody Rhodes!"

KELLER’S WWE SUMMERSLAM REPORT

AUGUST 3, 2024

CLEVELAND, OHIO AT CLEVELAND BROWNS STADIUM

STREAMED LIVE ON PEACOCK & PPV

Commentators: Michael Cole, Corey Graves, Pat McAfee



Ring Announcer: Alicia Taylor

CLICK HERE TO LISTEN TO OUR POST-SHOW PODCAST

-The pre-show ended with the panel discussing which match they most anticipated. They acknowledged that C.M. Punk vs. Drew McIntyre is a pick of many fans even if there’s no title on the line.

-They went to Michael Cole who commented on clips of various wrestlers arriving at the arena. Cole said Liv and Rhea would kick off the show.

-Jelly Roll sang “God Bless America” live from mid-ring.

-Paul “Triple H” Levesque, WWE’s Chief Content Officer, made his ring entrance to the start the show. In a grinding voice, he welcomed everyone to Summerslam. He threw back to Jelly Roll who performed “Liar.” They interspersed clips of WWE wrestlers and fans with the live performance.

-Miz stood in the stands as host of the show and said he wanted to feel the live energy of the crowd.

(1) LIV MORGAN vs. RHEA RIPLEY (w/Dominik Mysterio) – WWE Women’s Title match

As Ripley and Dom walked out, Cole called Dom “Rhea’s boy toy.” He noted she never lost the title after holding it for 379 days. They went to Cole, Graves, and McAfee at ringside. Cole said over 50,000 were in attendance. He noted the referee is wearing a “referee cam.” It had a hard liquor sponsor. Liv then made her entrance. The bell rang 14 minutes into the hour. Liv ducked out to ringside early and then rolled back into the ring once Rhea went after her. Liv laughed. Rhea returned to the ring. Liv ducked out again.

Once Rhea got in some offense, Dom smiled and applauded. Ripley high-fived Dom, then licked his cheek. Cole said he can’t stand Dom, but he’s doing something right since he has Ripley. Graves said there should be an ordinance against the pheromones that he’s giving off. McAfee’s (odd and disconcerting) obsession with poop came up again. He rambled about a “pieces of crap” and said “people look like after a poop has happened and you get your butt wiped.” He said Dom is “a poop stain.” (Please stop.) Cole chuckled and said he was painting a picture.

Ripley headbutted Liv and drove her into the top turnbuckle. Liv threw Ripley into the corner turnbuckle and the grabbed her shoulder in pain. She said, “It’s out!” The ref asked if he should stop it. She shouted, “No!” Cole said the injured shoulders is probably dislocated. She fought off Liv and then rolled to the floor near Dom. Liv kicked Ripley into the ringside steps. Ripley kept holding her shoulder. Liv stomped on it and rolled her into the ring and scored a two count at 6:00.

Liv leaped at Ripley at ringside, but Dom shoved Ripley out of the way and so Liv landed on him. Ripley threw Liv back into the ring. She kept clutching at her shoulder. Ripley rammed her shoulder into the announce desk to knock it back into socket. Cole said he’s never seen anything like that. McAfee said it was mind-blowing. Graves compared it to something Finn Balor did at a Summerslam years ago. She went on the attack against Liv and scored a two count.

Liv countered a Rip Tide attempt with a DDT for a near fall. Ripley went on a stretch of offense with more two counts. Liv yanked Ripley’s arm over the middle rope and then grabbed a chair. Ripley battled back and finally landed a Rip Tide. Graves said that had to be cathartic. Ripley picked up a chair. Graves said if she swings it, “the gold is gone.” Dom stood on the ring apron and yanked it away from her. The crowd roared. Dom explained she can’t use it or she’ll get DQ’d. Graves said the fans should be applauding. Liv knocked Ripley into Dom, knocking her to the floor. She then hit Oblivion and scored a believable near fall. Fans popped and chanted, “Holy shit!”

Dom ran over and got the ref’s attention. Liv then gave Ripley an Oblivion onto the chair. Liv scored a three count. Cole said, “What the hell?” Dom smiled at ringside.

WINNER: Morgan in 16:00 to retain the Women’s Title.

-Dom then helped Liv up and kissed her. Cole exclaimed, “Dom, you sorry two-timin’ son of a bitch!” McAfee called him a piece of trash. Cole asked if it’s a been a ruse for months. They showed a fuming Ripley in the ring soaking up what happened.

(Keller’s Analysis: Not sure that made any sense. Rhea had multiple chances to win before Dom went far enough to cost her the match. Dom also clearly helped Ripley not get hit by a diving Liv and also helped Ripley not get DQ’d for using a chair. There was no guarantee that Dom would have a chance to actually cost Ripley the match because of how long he waited. The announcers also had to play dumb for way too long after the match considering Dom smiled right after the finish. This was on the lower end of logic and execution for an angle that has been built up for months. The match itself was solid, and Ripley did a great job selling the shoulder.)

-They showed Sami Zayn warming up backstage. [c]

-They cut backstage to the Judgement Day hangout. Damien Priest barged in and grabbed Finn Balor and asked if he knew. Balor said of course he didn’t know. Balor said they should go look for Dom and confront him. J.D. McDonagh told Priest he’s there for him. Priest said, “I’m gonna kill this kid.”

(Keller’s Analysis: Good follow-up to the angle.)

(2) SAMI ZAYN vs. BRON BREAKKER – Intercontinental Championship

The bell rang 43 minutes into the hour. Breakker charged at Sami, who leapfrogged him, so Breakker crashed shoulder-first into the corner. Breakker dropped to the floor and clutched his shoulder. Sami then landed a running flip dive onto Breakker. Sami leaped off the top rope, but Breakker ducked and then clotheslined him.

Breakker gave Sani a Frankensteiner for a near fall at 3:00. McAfee made another reference to poop, saying he “pooped my pants” after Scott Steiner was angry with him for changing the name of the Frankensteiner. Breakker told Sami to quit. Sami slapped him back over and over. Sami set up a Blue Thunder Bomb, but Breaker blocked it. Breakker flipped out of a back suplex but almost landed on his head in the process. The announcers gasped. Sami then gave Breakker a Blue Thunder Bomb for a near fall.

Breakker caught Sami with a knee, but Sami countered with an exploder suplex. When Sami charged, Breakker speared him. Breakker then lowered his straps, ran the ropes, and speared Sami for the three count. “Welcome to the Bron Breakker ear!” exclaimed Cole. Graves said, “Get used to it!”

WINNER: Breakker in 6:00 to capture the Intercontinental Title.

(Keller’s Analysis: Good while it lasted, but it wasn’t formatted to be an epic fight. All in all, a bit anticlimactic given the nature of the feud, but they wanted to put Breakker over strong.) [c]

-A sponsored video clip aired of Drew McIntyre attacking C.M. Punk.

(3) LOGAN PAUL vs. L.A. KNIGHT – U.S. Title match

Logan made his entrance first. He wore Cleveland brown and tore up a fan sign on his way to the ring. He was joined by MGK, a rapped out of Cleveland. Cole said he works with Jelly Roll. Logan arrived in Logan’s stolen sports-drink branded truck. Knight then bashed in the side window. He said he’s now coming for his U.S. Title. Graves said Knight is guilty of vandalism and grand theft auto and he should have been arrested. As Knight began to enter the ring, Logan knocked him to the floor. Logan went after Knight at ringside. Logan sprayed some of his energy drink into Knight’s face after Knight took time to yell at Knight’s crew at ringside.

Logan took the lid off the announce desk and cleared it of monitors, then tried to throw Knight on it. Knight fought back and rammed Logan’s into the table, although Logan’s hand clearly hit each time and his face didn’t connect. Knight then gave Logan leaping neckbreaker on the announce desk. The table didn’t collapse and they both hit hard. Cole said the match may never officially start. Knight threw Logan into the ring and the ref called for the bell 6 minutes into the second hour.

Knight delivered an inverted atomic drop and a clothesline for a two count. Logan made a comeback and threw Knight shoulder-first into the corner (three matches in a row for a variation of that spot). Cole noted Logan’s first match in WWE was at Summerslam 2022 and beat Miz, then beat Ricochet last year at Summerslam. Fans taunted Logan with a chant of “You suck!” Logan landed a splits legdrop for a two count. Knight fought back and they exchanged wild swings. Logan landed a gut-wrench suplex. He followed with an “overbomb” that looked more like Knight countering a powerbomb to land on Logan. Logan scored a two count.

Graves said Logan is controversial and gets the world talking. “You can pick a side, but you can’t question the talent and ability.” McAfee said he loves the business. Knight recovered and surprised a showboating Logan with a quick powerslam. Both were down and slow to get up. Knight landed a Side Effect. Knight landed a top rope elbowdrop for a two count. Knight lifted Logan onto his shoulders, but Logan slipped free and then landed a springboard clothesline to knock Knight off the ring apron to the floor at 7:00. Logan then landed an impressive springboard moonsault onto Knight at ringside.

Back in the ring, they countered each other including Logan scoring a two count with a backslide as a counter to a BFT. Logan nailed Knight with his right hand for a near fall. Logan looked up, wide-eyed in shock. Logan blocked a BFT attempt. Knight leaped and met Logan on the top rope and superplexed him quickly and scored a two count. The crowd popped for the kickout. Fans were standing at ringside.

Logan raked Knight’s eyes. Logan called for help from one of his followers at ringside. Knight slidekicked Logan. Knight yanked one of the hangers-on, Jeff, to ringside and stomped away at him. Logan threw Knight shoulder-first into the ringpost. MGK handed Logan brass knuckes that he had hanging around his neck on a chain. Knight pulled Logan onto the ring apron and went for a suplex, but Logan hit him with the knux. He got rid of the weapon, then went for a springboard flip clothesline. Knight side-stepped him and hit the BFT for the win.

WINNER: Knight in 12:00 to capture the U.S. Title.

(Keller’s Analysis: A lot to like about the match, but it also at times seemed to lose some steam. Besides the official 12 minutes, there was a lengthy brawl beforehand. The finish is a surprise, especially since brass knuckles tend to be decisive. Logan’s gotten some bad publicity lately. I’m curious if WWE officials will be glad he’s out of the mix for a while, assuming he is.) [c]

(4) BAYLEY vs. NIA JAX (w/TIffany Stratton) – WWE Women’s Title match

Jax came out first. McAfee talked about her having an aura. Cole noted Bayley and Jax haven’t had a one-on-one match in over five years. The bell rang 34 minutes into the second hour. Bayley wrapped Jax’s arm around the middle rope early and kicked it. Cole praised her gameplan. Jax shoved her down and then lifted her and set up a powerbomb. Bayley slipped free and hit a jaw-breaker. Jax then gave her a quick Samoan Drop.

Bayley side-stepped a charging Jax. Jax, though, attacked Bayley on the ring apron and went for a legdrop. Bayley moved and kicked Jax into the ringside barricade. Bayley leaped at Jax with a Thesz Press.

Bayley applied an overhead sleeper. Cole and Graves noted Bayley tapped Jax with that in 2015. Jax countered and slammed Bayley to the mat. Then she landed a rolling senton and a legdrop for a near fall. Jax went for a legdrop off the second rope. Bayley moved. Bayley then hit a Bayley-to-Belly for a near fall at 6:00. Jax came back with an Annihilator a minute later for a near fall. Jax rammed Bayley into the mat over and over, then headbutted and tossed her into the corner. Jax said, “I’m so reckless, I’m so clumsy.” Jax charged at Bayley, but Bayley moved and Jax went shoulder-first into the ringpost. (That’s four out of four matches with a spot like that.)

Bayley leaped through the ropes onto Jax’s shoulders. Jax turned it into a slam at ringside. Jax landed a hip attack in the corner back in the ring. She set up another Annihilator. Bayley stood and powerbombed Jax off the second rope, holding Jax up as she walked a few steps out of the corner. That was a feat of strength and balance. Fans chanted, “Holy shit!” Bayley then landed a flying top rope elbow for a near fall at 11:00.

Tiffany Stratton’s music played and she ran out with the briefcase. Bayley knocked her off the ring apron and then scored a two count on Jax with a stack leverage cover. Bayley leaped at Jax, but Jax turned it into a powerbomb. Jax followed with a released powerbomb. She followed with two Annihilators for the win.

Tiffany celebrated with Jax, holding up her custom Money in the Bank briefcase, but wisely not even hinting at a cash-in.

WINNER: Jax in 12:00 to capture the WWE Women’s Title.

(Keller’s Analysis: Good match. It did feel, though, that it wouldn’t end until Tiffany got involved in some way. Some impressive exchanges and big moves in that one definitely got the crowd popping and gasping after being a bit quiet for some of the early methodical action.)

(5) C.M. PUNK vs. DREW MCINTYRE – Seth Rollins Special Referee

Seth came out first. He had glittery pants and a bedazzled sleeveless ref shirt. Cole talked about Jesse “The Body” Ventura’s role as a special referee on two occasions at Summerslams. Drew then made his entrance. He told Seth all he has to do is call for the bell and count to three. Punk walked out in his signature hoodie. Cole said it was Punk’s first one-on-one match in ten-and-a-half years in WWE. He said they teamed together once, but have never wrestled each other. Graves said he’s never seen Punk more pissed off than the last two days and he’ll fight until his heart gives out tonight. Punk got in Seth’s face as soon as he entered the ring. Drew walked up to him. Seth rubbed Punk’s hoodie on his butt before throwing it out of the ring. The bell rang 6 minutes into the third hour.

They met mid-ring and swung away at each other. Seth pulled Punk out of the corner when he didn’t break on his comment. Drew then went after Punk as Punk was complaining to Seth. Seth pulled Drew out of the corner as he was kicking away at him. Seth yelled, “Just like I told him, I run this show.” Punk clotheslined Drew and punched away at him. Drew palmed Punk in the throat and then ran to the ropes. Punk clotheslined Drew over the top rope, then leaped off the ring apron and tackled Drew. McAfee said Punk was looking good. Graves said Punk was trying to add just a little bit of muscle. He said when you do that, though, cardio can drop. Punk took it to Drew in the time keeper’s area. Punk tossed. Then he shoved Drew into the ringpost. Fans chanted, “We want Tables!” Punk rammed Drew’s head into the metal stairs at ringside.

Drew swept Punk’s legs and tripped him on the ring apron. Then he swung his by his legs into the announce desk. Drew. catapulted Punk up from under the ring into the frame of the ring. Seth laughed and applauded. Back in the ring, Drew chopped Punk to the mat as Punk whiffed on a punch. Drew snap-suplexed Punk and went for a cover. Punk rolled out of the cover before Drew secured it. Drew blocked a running knee by Punk and slammed him to the mat for a two count. Drew powered up Punk and landed a sitout powerbomb for another two count.

Drew grabbed a chair from ringside. Seth eyed it. Drew said he should let him use it because “then both of our problems go away.” He said he’d take the industry to new heights. Seth turned his back, but then when Drew wound up, Seth grabbed it. Seth told Drew, “You embarrassed me at WrestleMania.” Drew pie-faced Seth. Seth swung the chair, but Drew ducked. Seth stopped short of hitting Punk. Punk then rolled up Drew as Seth was getting ride of the chair. Drew powered out when Seth turned around. Drew gave Punk a neckbreaker and then kipped up. Graves said this was much more one-sided than anyone expected, noting Drew was overwhelming Punk.

Drew pulled out Punk’s bracelet at 10:00 and signaled for a Claymore, but Punk met him with a kick. Punk then landed three running high knees in the corner and then a clothesline. Punk climbed to the top rope and smiled, then vlew Seth a kiss and landed a flying elbowdrop. He made the cover, but Drew kicked out. Punk went for an Anaconda Vice, but Drew blocked it at first. Punk pushed through and got it applied. Punk then pulled the bracelet off of Drew’s wrist. The fans popped. Drew stood and surprised Punk with a Claymore for a dramatic near fall.

Drew set up a Future Shock DDT, but Punk escaped. Drew charged, but Punk moved, and Drew went into the ringpost shoulder-first. (That’s five out of five matches.) Punk the called for the Go To Sleep. He lifted Drew, winced, and then dropped Drew and looked at Seth who had put on Punk’s bracelet. (Is Punk a cat?) Drew charged at Punk and knocked him into Seth, who rolled to the floor. Drew then hit Punk from behind and set up a Future Shock. Punk blocked it and hit a GTS. Seth was late and counted, but didn’t start until the fans had counted to eight first. Drew kicked out at two.

Punk told Seth, “You’re as good of a referee as you are a wrestler.” He asked if he’s messing with him or kidding him. Punk yelled in Seth’s face. Seth told him to listen to him because this is his ring and his company. “We don’t want you here!” he said. “Not everything is about you!” He told him to focus on his opponent, who’s down for his pickins. Seth called him an asshole. Punk gave Seth a GTS. Seth went down and stayed down as Punk bent over and took his bracelet back. Drew recovered and kicked Punk in the crotch. He followed with a Claymore (without counting beforehand) and made the cover. Seth crawled over and counted slowly to three.

The announcers said Punk couldn’t stay focused. “C.M. Punk cost himself this match tonight,” Cole said. Graves agreed. “Punk was blind with rage and Punk’s emotions got the best of him.” Drew took the bracelet back and put it around his wrist. He put his boot on his chest and raised his arm high with the bracelet on his wrist.

WINNER: McIntyre in 17:00.

(Keller’s Analysis: Given it was Punk’s first singles match in a long time, he put on a solid performance, but he did seem to struggling with cardio or getting his legs under him at times. A lot of the time it was more about Seth and everyone’s emotions than having an all-out fight to win, which maybe was by design to protect Punk a bit. I have mixed feelings about Seth’s storyline role in this. Punk looked undisciplined and unfocused when it appeared he was on the verge of beating Drew but turned to the bracelet. Not that it’s not important to him, but this wasn’t any match or any opponent. It was Drew, who in the last seven months was a much more bitter enemy than Seth. Drew gets credit here for his role in making this as good as it was considering how long it’d been since Punk wrestled, and there’s just no way to really get strong in-ring cardio without wrestling in front of crowds with the adrenaline and no net.) [c]

(6) DAMIEN PRIEST vs. GUNTHER – WWE Heavyweight Title match

As Gunther came out, they showed a skyboc with Diamond Dallas Page, Sean Waltman, and Kevin Nash sitting together. Also, Scott Steiner, Rick Steiner, and Jacqueline. The bell rang 40 minutes into the third hour. Gunther charged. Priest hit him with a forearm to knock him backwards. Priest set up a South of Heaven, but Gunther chopped out of it. Priest gave Gunther a flatliner. Priest played to the crowd and got mild cheers.

Priest went to ringside and leaped at Gunter with a clothesline. Back in the ring, they exchanged strikes. Priest took Gunther down with a head scissors and a Broken Arrow for a near fall at 5:00. Gunther countered a Priest charge in the corner and then landed a running dropkick. He followed with a powerbomb for a near fall. Gunther took some deep breaths. He noticed from looking at the big screen that his chest was bleeding. It looked like a natural surprise reaction. He wiped the blood, then stood. Fans were cheering for something else going on.

They stood and chopped each other. Priest landed South of Heaven for a two count. Priest stood and fans rapid-clapped. He played to the fans and got a surge of cheers. He set up a Razor’s Edge, but Gunther escaped and chopped him. Gunther blocked a Priest kick and then took him down with a running clothesline and then another clothesline for a two count. A “This is awesome!” chant broke out as Gunther assessed the situation. Priest signaled for Gunther to bring it on. Gunther turned to the fans and they booed him. Gunther chopped Priest hard.

The crowd really got into Priest’s comeback a minute later. He turned it up and lifted Gunther and then delivered. Razor’s Edge. Gunther stood quickly and Priest gave him a South of Heaven. Gunther rolled toward the bottom rope. Finn Balor ran out and put Gunther’s leg on the bottom rope. “What the hell?” exclaimed Cole. Priest watched Balor’s interference on replay. Fans chanted, “Holy shit!” They cut to Balor who snarled at Priest. Priest leaned out of the ring toward Balor. Gunther then put Priest in a sleeper. Priest looked out of it but then showed life and leveraged Gunther’s shoulders down. Priest leaned out of the ring and grabbed Balor. Gunther then grabbed Priest and gave him a powerbomb followed by another sleeper for the win. Cole said this night will be remembered as “the implosion of The Judgment Day.”

WINNER: Gunther in 16:00 to capture the WWE Heavyweight Title.

(Keller’s Analysis: They really gave Priest an out in losing there, which didn’t feel like a trapdoor finish as much as making advancing the story of The Judgment Day a priority and giving Priest something to do after the title reign. I’m more understanding of Priest being unfocused because of Balor’s turn than I am Punk losing focus because Seth had the bracelet on his wrist. Punk wanted a win over Drew as much as Priest wanted to retain his title, or at least the stakes in both of their minds were probably emotionally similarly intense. The downside is Gunther’s win wasn’t the focus, but rather “the implosion of The Judgment Day.” Priest won over the crowd more and more as the match progressed. WWE has a solid babyface wrestler in Priest now and he’s coming out of this title reign stronger, even if it wasn’t a stellar reign on usual title reign merits. For whatever it’s worth, this was the first match of the night that didn’t involve a wrestler going shoulder-first into the corner and hitting the turnbuckles or ringpost.) [c]

-A commercial aired for John Cena’s retirement tour.

-Clips aired of the Dom-Liv angle earlier.

-The Miz announced a crowd of 57,719 and said it was a record for Summerslam. He was accompanied by R-Truth in the ring. Austin Theory and Greyson Waller walked out. Theory said they are in the city with the worst NFL team of all time. Cole said he agreed with that. Theory said all the people look like Jelly Roll. Waller said he wouldn’t let Theory disrespect Jelly Roll like that. “He’s incredible, he’s amazing,” he said. “You’re the only man in history to make music worth than R-Truth’s!” Truth then said Waller and Theory are “Ricky and Robert, the Rock ‘n’ Roll Express.” Miz said it’s not them. He pointed at Waller and said he just got his eye fixed, a reference to Robert Gibson. Jelly Roll smashed Theory and Waller with chairs to the back. Jelly Roll then chokeslammed Theory. (Theory sure exposed the nature of that move, which is all the about the recipient leaping. Truth, Miz, and Jelly Roll did fistdrops onto Theory. Truth and Miz helped Jelly Roll stand. They raised their arms and celebrated.

(Keller’s Analysis: Did Miz have any other duties as “host”? Not that I’m complaining.)

(7) CODY RHODES vs. SOLO SIKOA – Undisputed WWE Title match

Solo came out alone. Cole said it took a hell of a lot of guts to make it a Bloodline Rules match because he loses every advantage as champion. They cut to Cody in his bus. He walked out and then took his dog’s leash and walked him through the parking garage with him. Graves said this is Faraoh’s final trip with Cody on the road. Cody then hugged Arn Anderson backstage. Arn said 54,000 people say he’s a great champion. (What about the other 3,000+?) He told Cody he put himself in a tough spot, but he still has pull and a couple of his friends on the way to make sure things remain fair. Cole gave a brief bio on Anderson’s history with the Rhodes family. Cody handed off Faroah to a handler and put on his jacket and a helmet with a skull mask and wings. He then made his entrance.

After formal ring introductions, the bell rang 25 minutes into the fourth hour. Solo had his back turned when the bell rang as he held the red necklace that Cole said represents the Tribal Chief. Fans chanted, “F— you, Solo!” A fan held up a sign that said, “Manifesting the return of Roman Reigns.” Solo countered some of Cody’s signature offense early and then methodically beat on Cody. Graves said he was surprised Cody didn’t try to pick up teh pace. Cody ducked a charging Solo, who landed on the ring apron. Cody landed a Disaster Kick and then he followed with a dive through the ropes, tackling Solo. He showed fire and went for another dive, but this time Solo punched him out of mid-air. He rammed him into the ringside steps.

Solo went on methodical offense with two Samoan Drops and a two count. Graves said Solo’s methodical pace could backfire if he gave Cody too much time to recover. Cody then landed a Cody Cutter. Graves said Solo indeed took long, taking time to “enjoy himself” when he had Cody down. Cody rammed Solo into the ringside stairs and then into the cart with energy drinks on it. Cody landed a Bionic Elbow, but Solo caught him mid-air and hit a powerbomb. Solo landed a hip attack in the corner, then bragged to the crowd at 10:00. Cody kicked Solo and set up a Pedigree, but Solo slipped free and almost hit the ref. Cody rolled him up for a two count. Solo then landed a one-arm slam for a near fall. He applied a nerve hold next.

Solo hung Cody upside down in the corner and landed two running headbutts to Cody’s chest and head. Cody avoided a third headbutt and then landed a top rope moonsault bodypress. Graves said it was ugly but effective. Graves said it reminded him of a Terry Funk moonsault. Cody landed a superplex a minute later. (There was little drama in these first 12 minutes not primarily because of the methodical pace or the length of the show approaching four hours, but because Bloodline Rules hadn’t been factored in at all yet and everybody knows that’s going to happen before the finish.)

At 16:00, Solo set up a Cross Rhodes, but Cody reversed it and it it. Tanga Loa and Tama Tonga then attacked Cody. Solo made the cover, but Cody kicked out. Graves said this could happen all night long. Kevin Owen’s music then played and he ran to the ring. He was quickly outnumbered. Randy Orton’s music played and he ran out next. (One at a time isn’t the best strategy here!) Owens gave Solo a Swanton.

Cody then gave Solo a Cross Rhodes for a near fall. Orton and Owens chased Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa through the crowd, so it was one-on-one. Solo was down and Cody assessed. Cody picked up the top segment of the ringside steps and threw it into the ring. He lifted it and bashed Solo with it twice.

Cody went for a third, but Solo speared Cody and scored a two count. Solo set up the stair segment in the corner and pushed Cody against it. He then charged with a hip attack. Cody moved and Solo hit the stairs. Cody then landed Cross Rhodes twice. As Cody set up a third, Jacob Fatu charged in and attacked Cody. Fatu landed a top rope moonsault. Cole said the referee couldn’t do a damn thing about it. Fatu dragged Solo onto Cody who kicked out at the last split-second. Fans were standing. and watching. Oddly, no “Roman Reigns” or “We Want Roman” chant yet. Fatu superkicked Cody at ringside and then cleared the announce desk. Solo began to recover in the ring and directed Fatu’s attack. Fatu leaped off off the top turnbuckle onto Cody with a frog splash. Fatu grabbed his right ankle in pain afterward. He stood, but his leg gave out. He threw chairs around and let out yells. He yelled at Solo to finish him.

Solo then leaped off the top rope with a splash for a dramatic near fall. That got a bigger pop than previous near falls. When Solo set up a Samoan Spike, Cody collapsed. (Everyone should do that!) Cody then hit Solo with a superkick and a top rope Cody Cutter, getting a surge of energy bordering on a Tommy Dreamer Comeback. Suddenly, the Head of the Table graphic appeared on the big screen and a remix of Roman Reigns’s music played.

Roman walked out at 27:00 “He’s here! He’s here! He’s here! Roman Reigns is here!” exclaimed Cole. “Holy hell, Roman Reigns has returned.” Graves said it’s the first time since losing his crown at WrestleMania. Cole said, “The question is: Why is Roman Reigns here? Who is Roman Reigns here for?” Roman entered the ring and hit Solo with a Superman Punch. Fans roared with cheers as he hit a Spear. “The Revival of the Roman Empire with a spear!” exclaimed Cole. “Holy shit!” chanted the fans. Cody looked at Cody and nodded, then left. Cody soaked up the scene as Reigns walked down the aisle. Reigns paused and watched as Cody picked up Solo and delivered a Cross Rhodes for the win. As Cody celebrated Cole said the real Tribal Chief is back and god help Solo.

WINNER: Cody in 30:00 to retain the Undisputed WWE Championship.

(Keller’s Analysis: Like so many Roman matches, this was paced to tell an elaborate story with the finish mattering more than the quality or pace of the action in the first 80 percent of the match. It worked to a great degree by the finish because the return of Roman was what this was all about and Fatu’s apparently severe leg injury augmented the drama at the end. The crowd never bought into Solo as a threat to win despite a solid performance from him and help from his cohorts. Does Reigns overshadow Cody? How much is he around now? Does he explain himself and say he did it for Cody, against Solo, or for Paul Heyman, or all of the above.)

-They shifted immediately to the post-show outside the arena as fans left the stadium.

WWE SummerSlam 2024: Drew McIntyre beats CM Punk

McIntyre would dominate Punk for most of the match, and Rollins would allude to the ’97 match between Bret Hart and Undertaker with a very similar chair spot.

Punk would become obsessed with the bracelet that McIntyre had, before he got it off of him and Rollins wore it to stop it going missing. Punk would hit a GTS on Rollins and McIntyre would then low blow Punk, hit the Claymore and get the pinfall win.

With a total of six titles on the line, you had to know not everyone would play fair and, more to that point, that some would be greeted with surprise appearances from those they most fear.

Betrayal owned the day in Cleveland, and it began with Liv Morgan not only retaining her WWE Women’s World Championship against Rhea Ripley, but doing so with the help of Dominik Mysterio going completely “Dirty” in betraying Mami; and that led to Damian Priest putting hands on Finn Balor who then finally had enough and turned on him to cost Priest the WWE Heavyweight Championship.

There was a slew of titles changing hands, factions being destroyed and so much more from what became one of the best WWE events of the entire year.

And with the first of the Big-4 PLEs, now wrapped, let’s take a look at the fallout by way of the most memorable moments from Summerslam.

Trust me, there were PLENTY.

WWE Women’s World Championship

Liv Morgan (c) vs. Rhea Ripley

Result: Morgan wins due to interference

Don't Forget About ... the Revenge Tour reaching its ... climax (ha)... when Dominik Mysterio proved why he is, in fact, “Dirty”, his latest WWE betrayal being nearly as devastatingly impactful as his first one. What this means for the fate of TJD is very obvious, with one of its OG members having defected to go and Liv his best life with the champion — as the little gold digger he's become as of late. Meanwhile, Jey Uso should get the Waffle House order ready.

WWE Intercontinental Championship

Sami Zayn (c) vs. Bron Breakker

Result: Breakker wins clean by pinfall

Don't Forget About ... the Helluva Kick gone wrong. There was plenty of back-and-forth in this match but Zayn, for the first time in a long time, looked mostly overpowered but, despite that reality, he still had an opportunity to put the rookie away after the Exploder into the corner. He took too long loading up for the Helluva Kick though, and got cut in two by a spear instead, and then by another, and that was pretty much that. And newwwww!!!!

WWE United States Championship

Result: LA Knight wins clean by pinfall

Logan Paul (c) vs. LA Knight

Don't Forget About ... the failed assistance of the artist MGK, having accompanied Logan Paul to ringside. It was a foregone conclusion that someone would break out the brass knuckles to try and finish Knight off, and it didn’t come by way of his Prime cohorts but when MGK took off a chain that contained them and handed them to Paul. Things didn’t go how Paul thought they would thereafter, with a BFT planting his face into the mat for the three count and, just like that, Knight has finally, finally acquired gold. YEAH!

WWE Women’s Championship

Bayley (c) vs. Nia Jax

Result: Nia Jax wins clean by pinfall

Don't Forget About ... Tiffany Stratton’s role in this outcome. It was a banger between Bayley and Jax, to say the least, but you felt the entire time that Tiffy Time would make an appearance and impact the match, and that’s precisely what happened. She ran down the ring to try and cash in, again, on Bayley but was immediately dismissed with a punch to the face by the champ. The distraction gave Jax the time to regain her stride and then power bomb Bayley twice followed by not one, but two Annihilators (three total in the match). And new … but wait … and now … when does Tiffy turn on Nia?

Grudge Match

Drew McIntyre vs. CM Punk (special guest referee: Seth Rollins)

Result: Drew McIntyre wins clean by pinfall

Don't Forget About ... the emotions of CM Punk getting the best of him in this match. He was being dismantled for much of the match and finally got things to turn in his favor, but the bracelet that means so much to him did him in, in the end. Having his submission locked in and with McIntyre nearly tapping out, he released the hold to take the bracelet off of McIntyre’s wrist. Later, with another chance to end it, he noticed Seth Rollins was wearing it and, well, he lost it and it cost him dearly. And it’s now time for the Seth Rollins versus CM Punk feud to feed families, but that doesn’t mean he’s done with McIntyre — though there’s also poetic justice in McIntyre now being able to tell Punk, “You did this to yourself.”

WWE Heavyweight Championship

Damian Priest (c) vs. Gunther

Result: Gunther wins due to interference

Don't Forget About ... Liv Morgan’s influence here. If you’ve been reading what I’ve been writing about this storyline over the past several months — reminding you that Liv Morgan once teamed up with Finn Balor (and AJ Styles) to combat The Judgment Day and it was clear Balor had warmed back up to her after she helped them get the tag titles. So when Damian Priest put his hands on Balor after Dom’s betrayal of Ripley, the camel’s back was broken, and so was TJD, for good. Priest’s fury after Balor saved Gunther from a loss helped him escape the first submission move but he didn’t use that energy wisely, so he found himself in a second one and asleep while the title changed hands.

WWE Universal Championship

Cody Rhodes (c) vs. Solo Sikoa

Result: Rhodes retains due to interference

Don't Forget About ... Roman Reigns is BACK. THE END. #AcknowledgeHim"

It was a night of betrayal, shocks and surprises as WWE SummerSlam unfolded in front of 57,000 fans in Cleveland on Saturday (3 August).

All eyes were on CM Punk as he wrestled his first televised singles match in over a decade, going toe-to-toe with British star Drew McIntyre to conclude one of the hottest feuds of the year.

But it was “Dirty” Dominik Mysterio who set the tone for the evening long before those two stepped into the ring, turning on Rhea Ripley and The Judgement Day after the Women’s World Championship match opened the show.

The Judgement Day imploded further as the penultimate match of the night concluded, with Finn Balor betraying Damian Priest.

However, the biggest shock of the night came in the main event, which saw Cody Rhodes face Solo Sikoa for the Undisputed Universal Championship - amid rumours of a Roman Reigns return.

After a gruelling battle, “The American Nightmare” secured the three count to defend his title, as the “Tribal Chief” made his first appearance since WrestleMania, returning to attack his own Bloodline.

There were four title changes on a night of packed action, which also saw Logan Paul, Gunther, Liv Morgan and Rhea Ripley in action.

Check out the full results from SummerSlam below:

Liv Morgan (c) defeated Rhea Ripley (with “Dirty” Dominik Mysterio) by pinfall to defend the Women’s World Championship

Bron Breakker defeated Sami Zayn (c) by pinfall to win the Intercontinental Championship

LA Knight defeated Logan Paul (c) by pinfall to win the United States Championship

Nia Jax defeated Bayley (c) by pinfall to win the Women’s Championship

Drew McIntyre defeated CM Punk by pinfall

Gunther defeated Damian Priest (c) by technical submission to win the World Heavyweight Championship

Cody Rhodes (c) defeated Solo Sikoa by pinfall to defend the Undisputed WWE Championship (Roman Reigns returned to cost Sikoa the match)"
WWE Summer Slam: Cody Rhodes vs Solo Sikoa WWE Championship match results.,https://au.news.yahoo.com/wrestlemania-40-rules-fight-101527861.html,"WrestleMania 40: What are the rules for each fight?

WrestleMania 40 is upon us, with the biggest wrestling show of the year scheduled for Saturday and Sunday in Philadelphia.

The event at Lincoln Financial Field has been built around the return of Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, who is set to compete in a WWE ring for the first time since 2013 – with the exception of a record-breaking, rapid win at WrestleMania in 2016.

Johnson is teaming with his ‘cousin’, WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns, in the main event of night one (Saturday 6 April), with the result of that match against Cody Rhodes and Seth Rollins having major ramifications for night two (Sunday 7 April).

But what are those ramifications? And what are the general rules for WrestleMania matches? That depends on the match type. So, let’s get into it...

How is a wrestling match won/lost?

Most WWE matches are decided by one of the following means: pinfall, submission, countout or disqualification. A pinfall occurs when a wrestler pins their opponent’s shoulders to the mat for a three count – as counted by the referee – while a submission occurs when a wrestler taps out or passes out while in a chokehold or a limb lock.

A countout occurs when a wrestler cannot re-enter the ring before a count of 10, and a disqualification occurs when a wrestler uses an illegal strike – for example a low blow, or using a weapon like a chair to attack their opponent.

These rules apply in one-on-one matches and tag-team matches (which typically pit teams of two against each other, though sometimes teams of three or more).

Other stipulations

A ladder match is won when the prize – often a title belt – hanging above the ring is pulled down (WWE)

Other matches are won by other means. For example: A table match is won when an opponent is driven through a table, and a ladder match is won when a wrestler climbs a ladder and claims the prize hanging above the ring (often a title belt).

The latter example is a relevant to WrestleMania 40, because night one involves a six-team ladder match for the Undisputed Tag-Team Titles. The Judgment Day will defend their four belts against #DIY, The Awesome Truth, The New Day, A-Town Down Under and New Catch Republic. This particular match will only end when both sets of title belts are pulled down, leading fans to speculate that the undisputed titles will be split up – with two belts going to a team on Monday Night Raw, and the other two going to a team on Smackdown Live.

Elsewhere at WrestleMania 40, The Pride will face The Final Testament in a ‘Philadelphia Street Fight’. In that contest, there will be no countouts or disqualifications – so expect plenty of weapons to feature.

What about The Rock and Roman Reigns vs Cody Rhodes and Seth Rollins

The Rock (left) and Roman Reigns (centre) will team up at WrestleMania 40 (WWE via YouTube)

If The Rock and Roman Reigns (the bad guys) beat Cody Rhodes and Seth Rollins in the main event of night one, Rhodes’s match with Reigns on night two will be fought under ‘Bloodline Rules’. The Bloodline is the name of a group led by Reigns and The Rock, which includes their family members Jimmy Uso and Solo Sikoa, and Bloodline Rules are basically the same rules as in a street fight.

In the main event of night two, Rhodes will challenge Reigns for the Universal Championship – just as he did at WrestleMania last year, when Reigns came out on top. Rollins will also fight again on night two, defending his World Heavyweight Championship against Drew McIntyre.

WWE Summer Slam: Cody Rhodes vs Solo Sikoa WWE Championship match results.,https://khelnow.com/wwe/wwe-summerslam-results-cody-rhodes-defeats-solo-sikoa-roman-reigns-returns-202408,"The match was fought under “Bloodline rules”

“The New Tribal Chief” faced Cody Rhodes at SummerSlam. Solo Sikoa came in with high hopes to reclaim the Undisputed WWE Championship for The Bloodline.

When Roman Reigns went on hiatus after losing the Undisputed WWE Title to The American Nightmare at WrestleMania, Sikoa assumed the role of Tribal Chief and made huge modifications to the lethal group. After brutalizing his brother Jimmy Uso and bringing in the violent Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa, sons of the legendary Haku, Sikoa obtained a new enforcer in the form of the ultra-destructive Jacob Fatu.

Solo made it obvious that he intended to challenge for the championship, and when he pinned Rhodes in a Six-Man Tag Team Match at WWE Money in the Bank, it appeared like a confrontation was imminent.

Cody Rhodes retains as Roman Reigns makes his return

SummerSlam 2024 delivered an electrifying main event as Cody Rhodes defended his WWE Undisputed Championship against Solo Sikoa. Cody’s entrance was nothing short of grand, starting from the loading dock, complete with a pep talk from the legendary Arn Anderson, promising some backup.

THIS MIGHT BE THE GREATEST CODY RHODES ENTRANCE EVERRRHOLY AURAAAA#SummerSlam pic.twitter.com/8LDcdcJnJT — #WeWantCody (@WeWantCody_) August 4, 2024

The match kicked off with intense circling and a collar-and-elbow lockup, showcasing the competitors’ raw power. Rhodes took an early advantage with a side headlock and shoulder blocks, but Sikoa proved his resilience, sending Cody to the mat with his own shoulder. The back-and-forth continued, with Rhodes hitting a Beautiful Disaster to knock Solo off the apron, followed by a suicide dive that sent the crowd into a frenzy.

The action spilt back into the ring, where Sikoa delivered a spinning wheel kick and a series of Samoan drops, each bringing him close to a pinfall. Cody’s tenacity shone through as he countered a Beautiful Disaster into a revolution Liger Bomb. Sikoa’s relentless offense, including a Tree of Woe headbutt and multiple Spinning Solos, couldn’t keep the champion down.

The turning point came when Rhodes nailed a superplex, setting up for the Cross Rhodes. Just as Cody was gaining momentum, the Guerrillas of Destiny stormed the ring, attacking Rhodes. The odds seemed stacked against Cody until Kevin Owens made a dramatic entrance, delivering a whirlwind of punches and kicks. However, the numbers game overwhelmed Owens until Randy Orton arrived, hitting RKOs and Stunners to even the score.

Despite the chaos, Rhodes maintained focus, hitting a second Cross Rhodes on Solo. The interference continued as Jacob Fatu blindsided Cody with a Senton Atomico and a double jump moonsault, dragging Solo for a near pinfall. Fatu’s attempt to finish Rhodes through the announce desk backfired, as Cody resiliently kicked out and countered with a Cody Cutter.

The climax saw Roman Reigns make a shocking appearance, delivering a Superman Punch to Solo, prioritizing his own faction over the match. Reigns speared Solo, then turned to Cody, signalling his departure from the chaos. Rhodes, unfazed, stared Reigns down while dragging Solo up for a final Cross Rhodes.

WWE Summer Slam: Cody Rhodes vs Solo Sikoa WWE Championship match results.,https://comicbook.com/wwe/news/wwe-summerslam-2024-arn-anderson-cody-rhodes/,"Arn Anderson has made a surprise appearance during WWE SummerSlam as part of Cody Rhodes' grand entrance. Cody Rhodes is walking into WWE SummerSlam with one of his biggest challenges as the Undisputed WWE Champion yet as he faces off against Solo Sikoa in a Bloodline Rules match. It's gotten even more intense as the weeks have rolled on as it was clear that while Cody was able to defeat Roman Reigns at WrestleMania 40 earlier this year, he still has yet to free himself from the targeting of the Bloodline. But this time around he's got help from some major allies.

Before the match even began, Cody was getting some help from some surprising faces. WWE Hall of Famer Arn Anderson made his return to the WWE as part of Cody's walk to the ring. Heading out to the match in an extended backstage segment, Cody passed by members of his team getting him ready. This included a returning Anderson, who was able to coach Cody ahead of the match one more time to remind him that while he's facing off against the Bloodline, he's got friends and family of his own.

WWE SummerSlam 2024 Match Card and Results

The WWE Hall of Famer was most recently signed to All Elite Wrestling until earlier this Spring. Signing with the company to serve a role as Rhodes' coach on screen, and then had a much less notable role when Rhodes left the company. After announcing that he would be leaving AEW after his contract expired this Spring, fans had been wondering when Anderson would be making a return to WWE and now it seems the time is here as he's supporting Cody once again. It's just a matter of seeing whether or not this relationship continues on screen after the premium live event.

WWE SummerSlam 2024 is now taking place at the Cleveland Browns Stadium in Cleveland, OH, and is now streaming live exclusively with Peacock. The match card and results thus far for the premium live event are as follows:"

1) Roman Reigns returns and takes out Solo Sikoa

2) Dominik Mysterio betrays Rhea Ripley

3) CM Punk takes out Seth Rollins

4) Finn Balor costs Damian Priest the World Heavyweight Championship

5) Bron Breakker wins the WWE Intercontinental Championship

SummerSlam 2024 was filled with excitement. Fans were dearly looking forward to this PLE, especially since Money in the Bank left a lot to be desired. Fortunately, this PLE delivered in loads and has quickly become one of the best WWE events of this year. We saw the Judgement Day implode thanks to a ton of betrayals.We saw Roman Reigns return and even watched championships change hands.Tonight had it all. Let’s take a look back at SummerSlam 2024 by ranking the five most memorable moments from the show.During the starting of the match between Cody Rhodes and Solo Sikoa, Rhodes seemed like the favourite. He caught and landed a Cross Rhodes pretty early into the match, thus changing the entire round for Solo. However, winning was never going to be simple in a Bloodlines Rules match. Rhodes landed his signature move and was immediately attacked by Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa.Fortunately, Kevin Owens and Randy Orton came to Rhodes’ rescue. But just as he was starting to get going again, Jacob Fatu came in and obliterated Cody, even putting him through the announcer's table. Once Rhodes made his way back to the ring, it seemed like the match was about to come to an end.But right when things were about to come to an end, Roman Reigns’ entry music came on, and the crowd erupted. Reigns slowly walked to the ring while Sikoa sat in a corner, shocked at what he was witnessing. Roman made short work of Solo and landed a Superman Punch, followed by a Spear, to end the night for Sikoa.Cody Rhodes then won the match via pinfall. In one night, it seems like Sikoa has lost both, a chance to win the Undisputed WWE Championship and the Bloodline. Reigns’ return is a huge event and will completely shake up the WWE in the coming weeks.Rhea Ripley vs. Liv Morgan started exactly as anyone would expect it to. Ripley was simply too strong for Morgan and kept throwing her around the ring. However, it only took one shot for Morgan to get back into the fight. Liv reversed one of Ripley’s moves and ran her into the turnbuckle, which resulted in Ripley’s shoulder popping out of its joint.Despite having a dislocated shoulder, Ripley continued to fight. Dominik Mysterio helped Rhea find her feet again and even saved her from one of Morgan’s splashes. It was at this time that Ripley said enough was enough and rammed her shoulder into the announcer’s table to put it back into place.Morgan was clearly scared at the sight of Ripley popping her own shoulder back in place. She continued her assault on Liv and was even willing to beat her with a steel chair. But Dom interfered and told Rhea that she couldn’t win the title if she used a chair on Liv. However, Dom was being dirty as usual. He took the chair from Rhea and discreetly planted it near her feet.This allowed Morgan to slam Ripley into the steel chair, and that’s exactly what she did. Morgan went on to win the match via pinfall. Then, in a moment that Ripley surely didn’t see coming, Dominik abandoned her and kissed Rhea Ripley . This is surely the most shocking moment in this storyline so far.Tonight was a night full of distractions for CM Punk. If he wasn’t so fixated on his bracelet, Punk could’ve easily beat McIntyre at SummerSlam, even with Seth Rollins as the guest referee. Punk delivered a flying elbow to McIntyre and then attempted a pin, but Drew kicked out at the very last moment. Punk was relentless, though, and went straight to an Anaconda Vice submission after trying to pin his opponent.However, before CM Punk could lock in the submission hold, he spotted his bracelet on McIntyre’s arm and got distracted while taking it off. Punk’s fixation with the bracelet allowed McIntyre to escape and land a Claymore. But, even Drew couldn’t get the three counts.CM Punk made a recovery and tried to land a GTS on McIntyre. Unfortunately, before he could execute the move, he was distracted by his bracelet again. This time, the bracelet was on Seth Rollins’ arm. This led to an argument between the two that only grew wilder near the end of the match.After he got fed up, Rollins erupted and mouthed off to CM Punk, but he wasn’t having any of it and hit Seth with a GTS. While Punk was busy with Rollins, McIntyre recovered and hit Punk with another Claymore. CM Punk couldn’t recover after this and lost the match via pinfall. The chemistry between the three men in the ring was off the charts, making this one of the most memorable SummerSlam matches.Even in the leadup to their fight, Damian Priest looked like he would fare better than Gunther, and that ended up being the case. Even though Gunther put up an incredibly entertaining performance, he never looked like he would end up winning the World Heavyweight Championship.But the unthinkable happened yet again. Priest landed his signature move on Gunther, and it seemed like his path to victory was all clear. But right as he pinned Gunther down for the three count, Finn Balor betrayed Priest and helped Gunther out. This infuriated Damian, and he could not focus on the match again.Gunther took advantage of the situation and caught Priest in a powerbomb before choking him out for the win. First there was Dominik Mysterio and now Finn Balor. From the looks of it, The Judgement Day is all but over.Sami Zayn already knew that he would not be able to outlast Bron Breakker in a contest of strength. So, Zayn decided to strategize in order to get the win against Bron. While the night started off well for Sami, his intelligent strategizing could only do so much in the face of Breakker’s undeniable strength.Regardless of what kind of move Sami used or how devastating his reversals were, Breakker just kept getting back up again and again. He was dominant throughout the night, but couldn’t maintain his momentum. Zayn got a golden opportunity to land his finishing move near the end of the fight.However, right as Zayn began to hype up the crowd, he took his eyes off Breakker. Bron recovered and caught Sami Zayn with a spear to end the match. Breakker won via pinfall to become the new WWE Intercontinental Champion, and it has been a long time coming, to say the least. Surely, this is just the first of many championships befitting a wrestler like Bron Breakker."

In a match that had many close calls and interferences, it seemed like Rhodes was about to lose his title as Solo had Jacob Fatu at ringside. That's when Reigns' music hit and he made his return amidst a thunderous reaction from the crowd, who were present inside the Cleveland Browns stadium. The Tribal Chief would then come into the ring and hit his signature Superman Punch-Spear combo on Solo to put him down.

Rhodes would then pick up the win with a Cross Rhodes to continue his title reign as Solo was left irate outside the ring and shouting at Reigns. It remains to be seen how the new Bloodline will react to Reigns' return and next week's SmackDown could provide the answers.

SummerSlam 2024 results

SummerSlam 2024 would see a lot of shocking results, including 4 new champions being crowned at the event. The show started with Rhea Ripley and Liv Morgan facing off for the Women's Heavyweight title and Dominik Mysterio would turn on Ripley. He would then go on to align himself with Morgan.

The destruction of the Judgement Day wasn't over as Finn Balor would also turn on Damian Priest and allowed Gunther to pick up his maiden World Championship in WWE in the form of the World Heavyweight title. This was one of the 4 title changes of the night as LA Knight would defeat Logan Paul to win the US Championship, Bron Breakker dominated Sami Zayn to win the Intercontinental title and Nia Jax dethroned Bayley as the WWE Women's Champion.

CM Punk's first singles match back in WWE ended in a loss as Drew McIntyre was able to beat him with Seth Rollins as the special guest referee. Both men delivered a classic in the ring and it was Punk getting distracted by attacking Rollins that would eventually cost him the match.

Each participant gave their all, resulting in a memorable event. The night featured six championship matches and a singles bout between CM Punk and Drew McIntyre, all filled with unpredictable outcomes that thrilled the Cleveland crowd.The electrifying closing moments have made SummerSlam 2024 the best edition yet.Initially, Liv tried to evade Mami's attacks by rolling out of the ring. Morgan then began playing a game of cat and mouse, which angered Rhea Ripley. After Liv's mind games, the action returned to the ring. Dom cheered as Mami delivered a series of clotheslines followed by a suplex. After a few minutes, the momentum shifted in Liv's favor as she targeted Rhea Ripley's injured shoulder. The action continued, and during the closing moments, Rhea brought a steel chair to attack Liv Morgan. However, Dom stopped Ripley, reminding her she couldn't win that way. Morgan seized the distraction to hit Oblivion for a close two-count. Dom then distracted the referee, allowing Morgan to hit a second Oblivion on the chair to secure the win.Sami Zayn and Bron Breakker clashed once more for the Intercontinental Title in a match that was spectacular from start to finish. Both competitors gave their all to secure the victory, making it a memorable bout. They unleashed powerful moves on each other, but in the end, Bron Breakker landed two running Spears to win the Intercontinental Title.The match between Logan Paul and LA Knight was electrifying, with both competitors giving their all to claim the gold. Before the bell rang, Logan Paul ambushed LA Knight, and the action quickly spilled outside the ring. Among the crowd were Logan Paul's friends, including the famous pop artist Machine Gun Kelly. After a few intense minutes outside, both superstars re-entered the ring and, as soon as the bell rang, exchanged heavy blows.

WWE Summer Slam: Cody Rhodes vs Solo Sikoa WWE Championship match results.,https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2024/8/4/24212862/wwe-summerslam-2024-recap-reactions-romans-reigns-return-cody-rhodes-rhea-ripley-dominick-mysterio,"There’s a moment in westerns and comic books when the biggest bad guy in the land turns over a new leaf, if only slightly. And it’s usually because an even bigger threat emerges that makes switching sides necessary. The Kingpin has a great line in the Spider-Man animated series from the 1990s about no profit being gained from the end of the universe. While he has no love for Spider-Man or his general do-gooder cause, he acknowledged (pun intended) something bigger than both men threatening to rip a part reality. Even if it’s simply self-preservation, Wilson Fisk does the right thing.

Where am I going with this? For all intents and purposes, Roman Reigns is WWE’s Kingpin. He ruled the land with an iron fist for almost four years, amassed incredible power, and showed no remorse towards anyone who dare come for the king. And then along came Cody Rhodes, who, with a lot of help, took his shot and didn’t miss. Roman went home defeated, while his head goon rebuilt the empire into something more dangerous than anything the Original Tribal Chief ever imagined. Oh, and lest we forget what Solo Sikoa and crew did to Paul Heyman. If there’s anything that painted the new Bloodline as more dangerous than its 1.0 incarnation, it’s the way they assaulted a man old enough to eat dinner at 5 p.m. while thumbing through his AARP magazine.

So when Solo Sikoa demanded his match with Cody Rhodes for the Undisputed WWE championship invoke Bloodline Rules, it became a big neon sign pointing to the bad guy coming back to town reclaim his kingdom, one square foot at a time. And he’d start with Solo.

Bloodline Rules matches have their own rhythm. There’s an inherent wonky logic because if there are no rules, the interferences should start as soon as possible. But it’s an accepted wonkiness that rarely, if ever, detracts from the proceedings. And it’s up to the wrestlers to keep the match interesting until the shenanigans start. Cody and Solo did that. They wrestled a clean match with a couple near falls while illustrating Solo’s savviness. He countered Cody in big spots, proving they might be equals after all. This, along with the announcers reminding us that he pummeled John Cena, not only worked for this match but future Solo bouts with Roman. He looked like a man who belonged in the ring with the champion, therefore he can hang with the guy the champion defeated.

Then the appearances happened. First, Tama Tonga & Tonga Loa. Then Kevin Owens, followed shortly by Randy Orton. And after the good guys chased those bad guys back to the locker room, out came the big gun: Jacob Fatu.

As a quick aside, here’s hoping Jacob is okay. He jumped off the top rope and put Cody through the announce table, but looked like he hurt his ankle. And I don’t mean “hurt.” He reacted like a man who really injured himself, so hopefully he’s just a really good actor.

But I digress. after Jacob did his dirt and it looked like Solo might capitalize, a remixed version of Roman’s theme played throughout Cleveland Browns stadium and the crowd erupted. I can’t remember the last time that stadium sounded so joyous, on the count of the Browns, well, being the Browns. While I think that was the wrong time to debut a new theme for Roman, it still worked in the arena given they saw the LED screens light up with his logo. That was a massive pop for a guy who is instantly the biggest face in the company.

Roman’s Superman Punch to the side of Solo’s jaw got the crowd even more hype. The former champ reluctantly looked on as Cody pinned Solo and retained his championship.

There’s a lot of layers here. Besides the obvious, there’s Roman’s reluctance. I don’t get the feeling he helped Cody so much as he stopped Solo. There’s a lot of tension between these two even in that moment, and that story is nowhere near finished. Before that, it’s Roman vs. the new Bloodline. Does he do it by himself? Or does he recruit Jimmy & Jey Uso? Even still, they’re still outnumbered. And is Roman a changed man? The biggest villain becoming the biggest hero without explanation isn’t unprecedented, but Roman’s crimes are particularly heinous. I’m curious about how they play this and what eventually unfolds. But for this event, it was an incredible moment that gave me actual goosebumps.

Well done, boys. Well done.

B-Sides

Well, it finally happened. After months and months, in about 15 minutes, the obvious became reality. Despite how much I hoped against it, Dirty Dom showed Rhea Ripley why he earned that moniker.

Dom isn’t leaving Cleveland with the same woman with whom he walked into the building.

And all it took was 15 minutes.

Putting my devastation aside, let’s get into a few beats of the match itself. It started with a cat and mouse game that fed into Liv Morgan wanting no part of Rhea in a one-on-one fight. That little game ended when Rhea outsmarted her. which is when the match started in earnest.

Rhea dominated the opening minutes, showing off and even licking her man (lucky guy). But Liv gained control when she targeted Rhea’s rehabbed shoulder. And from that point, Rhea wrestled the match with what she called a dislocated shoulder. Can a one armed woman win a championship?

There’s a scene in Skyfall when Silva’s men destroy James Bond’s Aston Martin. The look James gives says it all, but for the benefit of those without the movie committed to memory, the bad guy’s men clearly pissed him off with that move. Well, we got the equivalent of that with this match. While Rhea stood outside the ring begging Dom not to stop this match and nursing her hurt shoulder, Liv went airborne. Dom pushed his woman out of the way and sacrificed himself. Rhea looked like she saw red. She admonished Liv for doing that to her Dom Dom, and it motivated her to pull a Martin Riggs:

She popped her arm back in the socket on the commentator table! And everything looked great for Rhea from that point forward. She found her rhythm, and kept Liv on defense. But Liv kept working on her shoulder, which I liked. Just because Rhea popped it back in the socket doesn’t mean it’s 100 percent. Liv looked smart throughout this part of the match, while Rhea looked powerful and resilient.

Then the match turned on this moment:

Dom was right, but it was all part of his ruse. His hustle. His ploy, if you will. It led to the great finish that creates another layer to this story. Dom’s aligned with Liv, Rhea is not only angry but heartbroken, and she’s motivated beyond just wanting a championship. This is a love story, complete with betrayal and cheating.

I harped on the 15 minutes thing because it’s amazing what you can do in a short time when the emotional investment is there.

As part of the Judgment Day drama, the other big story is Finn Balor betraying Damian Priest. As a result, Damian lost his championship, and GUNTHER’s reign began.

They telegraphed this but not in a terrible way at all. Just seed sowing over weeks and more at the event when Damian, once again, came at Finn sideways once they couldn’t find Dom.

Finn stabbed his best friend in the back, we have a new champion, and WWE’s other dominant faction is a mess.

Rhea vs. Liv felt like an efficient quick match. Bron Breakker vs. Sami Zayn on the other hand, felt incredibly rushed. It started with Sami dodging Bron’s spear, and ended with him taking two of them right to the gut.

I’m happy Bron finally got this championship, but I expected a longer match for the end of Sami’s reign, which started with a huge victory at WrestleMania over GUNTHER. Especially given the build, which painted Sami as an “underdog” who keeps showing he’s anything but that when it’s game time.

Alas. I love the destination even if the journey left me feeling empty.

Cain’s feelings about Logan Paul echo my own. In fact, I really didn’t want to write about the guy because it felt like giving him oxygen. But the unfortunate part about him, and one reason he moves through spaces like WWE unimpeded, is that the dude can go in the ring. I don’t remember him wrestling a match that I didn’t like, and that includes this one with LA Knight. And that is the last good thing I’ll say about the former United States champ.

The whole thing flowed perfectly from start to finish. It began as a brawl, with LA taking it to Logan and getting physical out of the ring as well as inside. It transitioned into a God honest wrestling match, which showcased the Megastar’s expanded offense, including a top rope elbow where he stood on the second rope, jumped to the top rope, and dove onto the opponent.

And of course, we got some outside shenanigans from the former champ’s crew, which included MGK of all people. Seriously, MGK?

In the end, the former champ, with MGK’s help, cut corners with brass knuckles but LA avoided disaster. One BFT later, we have a new champ. And thank whatever deity you pray to for that. Fantastic match but I’m glad Cleveland gave Logan nothing but disrespect even when he did something dope.

The thing about villains is they lie. They lie a lot. And they often tell tales to each other, so they’re equal opportunity fibbers. So color me shocked we got some true honor amongst thieves between Tiffany Stratton. WWE smartly played off expectations and inverted the usual logic. When Tiffany’s music played and she waked to the ring with the briefcase in hand and a ref in tow, it looked like she might break her word. But it was all part of the plan.

This was a solid, physical match that focused on Bayley’s skill vs. Nia’s raw power. And whether or not that skill could overtake all that power.

Short answer? No. But Bayley showed power of her own on a really nice top rope Powerbomb that put Nia flat on her back. And, not for nothing, but she kicked out of one Annihilator. But Tiffany’s distraction, combined with two Powerbombs followed by two more Annihilators gave the Queen her well-deserved championship.

The story now is how long do the thieves honor each other? It’s not a question of if Tiffany betrays Nia since we all know the answer to that. But how do you do it while giving Nia a nice reign and not make it feel like a repeat of her story with Alexa Bliss from many moons ago.

Interesting convo in the Cageside offices about this match. Particularly how this is the best way to use CM Punk e.g., matches steeped in drama rather than leaning towards in-ring moves. Entirely character-based matches and not about his athleticism. Punk’s no spring chicken and with his injury history, focusing on what he still does incredibly well makes the most sense in the world. That’s why this match between Drew McIntyre and CM Punk succeeded with flying colors.

Drew dominated early. Yes, Punk had his moments, but Drew really controlled the flow leading to the match’s first turning point. The Scotsman saw his chance to finish Punk for good, and grabbed a chair. While Seth Rollins asserted his ref authority early with both men, establishing that fairness he talked about along with the fact that he’s an equal opportunity hater. So when Drew tried convincing Seth to turn his back and let him do his best Aaron Judge impression with the chair, it looked like Seth might give in to Drew’s pretty sound logic. But he didn’t, and instead they recreated a moment from SummerSlam ‘97. I’m sure Punk rocking Bret Hart colors had nothing to do with that. And before anyone reading this clutches their pearls, I say that with my tongue practically dug into my cheek.

But that Bret Hart allusion is instructive. Despite the win, Bret let his emotions rule him during that match. His hatred towards Shawn Michaels often took him out of the game He won because Shawn also let his emotions run wild, so he had a little help.

Punk wasn’t so lucky.

After Seth stopped the chair attack and almost nailed Punk, the Chicagoan mounted his comeback. After some back and forth, with Punk showing his guts (not literally!), he locked Drew into the Anaconda Vice. Rather than keep the hold. he relented to get his bracelet off Drew’s wrist. The bracelet, in that moment, became more important than the victory. So when Punk spotted Seth wearing the bracelet after nailing Drew with a GTS, merely because the special ref wanted it off the mat, he lost his cool. Now, to be fair, Seth missed the three-count, so Punk had a great reason to come at Seth for being late on the count and not doing his job well. But seeing the bracelet kept him from focusing on Drew and continuing the attack.

And Seth told him as much. During a very verbose back and forth where Punk clowned Seth’s “Sabu pants” (I cackled), Seth let it all fly. Not everything is about Punk. He doesn’t belong in WWE. Nobody wants him there. He’s unfocused on the real problem lying near his feet. Punk said it’s not always about him, but it’s never about Seth. That’s when he lost the match. He put Seth in a GTS, which gave Drew all the recovery time in the world. One Claymore Kick and a somewhat reluctant three-count from Seth gave Punk a loss at “the biggest party of the summer.”

Everyone involved did this thing beautifully. It wasn’t the smoothest match, but all the storytelling made it worth the price of admission.

SummerSlam is one for the books. The excitement came at the end for me, but this was an “A” show with logical storytelling. Everything set up either weeks or months ago came to a head. The right people won, and there’s a lot of fallout leading into the fall. Raw and SmackDown are must see television this week, with the Blue brand getting the edge in that department because of Roman. There’s nothing wrong with predicable storytelling if it makes sense. Swerving for the sake of it usually upends weeks of booking, and paints you into a corner. WWE is making those mistakes right now, and SummerSlam might be their finest example of that this year.

Grade: A

What say you, cagesiders? How does Roman handle his comeback and will he get more soldiers in his battle?"

Roman Reigns returned at WWE SummerSlam. He attacked Solo Sikoa during his match against Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes. Reigns’ interference helped Rhodes score the win.

Speaking at the WWE SummerSlam Post-Show, Cody Rhodes was asked to share his thoughts on Roman Reigns returning and interfering in the match.

“I don’t want to fill the room with positive platitude and hot air about the real ‘Tribal Chief,’ Roman Reigns returning,” Cody Rhodes said. “But without a doubt, that probably would have gone a different way. I probably wouldn’t be sitting here with the North Star of the industry had it not been for Roman Reigns. I’ve got quite a list of people who I owe one. I might owe him more than one. No love lost. That’s as much a shoot as it gets.

“There’s a unique relationship, I suppose. Haven’t seen or spoken since WrestleMania. I think the WWE fans, wrestling fans, WWE Universe, they wanted him, and SummerSlam delivered and gave him, and that I’m always very happy about.”

WWE Summer Slam: Cody Rhodes vs Solo Sikoa WWE Championship match results.,https://tjrwrestling.net/review/tjr-wwe-summerslam-2024/,"It’s WWE SummerSlam featuring six huge title matches, plus the CM Punk-Drew McIntyre grudge match.

This year’s WWE SummerSlam has a unique lineup because there are seven matches advertised for the show and all seven of them are singles matches. I would have liked to see a bit of a variety to shake things up, but I am looking forward to the show. Most WWE PLEs in the Triple H Era of booking have five matches, so at least they have seven total matches at SummerSlam, which is one of the biggest shows of the year.

It’s a stadium show taking place in Cleveland at the Cleveland Browns NFL stadium and there are going to be over 50,000+ fans in attendance. It’s always cool to see such a big crowd. I’m happy for Cleveland getting a WWE stadium show.

There was a pre-show WWE SummerSlam Countdown for three hours starting at 4 p.m. ET, but I don’t watch those. The main show started at 7 p.m. ET and it should be a fun night. Near the end of the Countdown show, they showed many wrestlers arriving earlier in the day and walking around backstage to prepare for the show. That was followed by Jelly Roll singing “God Bless America” at the end of the Countdown show. Let’s get to it.

WWE SummerSlam

From Cleveland Browns Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio

Saturday, August 3, 2024

It was a packed house at Cleveland Browns Stadium and here comes the WWE Chief Content Officer, Paul “Triple H” Levesque to welcome us to the show.

Triple H walked out to a huge ovation. He stood in the long aisle rather than go down to the ring. Triple H: “Cleveland, are you ready? Then, for the thousands in attendance, for the millions watching around the world…welcome to SummerSlam!” The crowd cheered. Triple H cued up Jelly Roll for a song.

Jelly Roll was in the ring with his band singing the song “Liar.” I don’t know much about Jelly Roll, but I’ve heard some of his songs in the last few months and he is a really good singer. He’s also a legit lifelong WWE fan, so that’s pretty cool. He had a nice performance here.

The Miz was in the crowd reminding us that he is the host of SummerSlam. The Miz said that he is in the Dawg Pound because he wanted to feel the energy of the Cleveland crowd. The Miz said that the biggest party of the summer starts right now.

Rhea Ripley was shown walking backstage where she got a hug from Dominik Mysterio and they made their way to the ring. Ripley made her entrance trying to win back the Women’s World Title that she held for 379 days before she had to give up the title due to an injury. There’s a long aisle way since it’s a stadium show with 50,000+ fans in attendance.

The commentary team for SummerSlam is Michael Cole, Corey Graves, and Pat McAfee on hand to call the 37th SummerSlam. There’s a referee cam on referee Eddie Orengo, so that’s something new for the show.

Liv Morgan was up next as the Women’s World Champion who likes to tell us to watch her. The ring announcer Samantha Irvin did the championship introductions when both women were in the ring. Cole mentioned that Ripley’s last singles loss was 26 months ago against Liv Morgan, so that’s a cool stat. It was about 14 minutes into the show when the match began.

WWE Women’s World Championship: Liv Morgan vs. Rhea Ripley (w/Dominik Mysterio)

The match started with Morgan running away from Ripley repeatedly. Ripley managed to get a hold of Morgan leading to multiple clotheslines by the powerful Ripley. There was a half-n-half suplex from Ripley leading to Morgan bailing to the floor again. Ripley licked Dominik’s cheek in front of Morgan. Ripley worked over Morgan with punches and a chop to the chest. Ripley sent Morgan into the steel steps and then they went back into the ring. Ripley nailed Morgan with a headbutt and a slam that sent Morgan back first into the turnbuckle. It was like a Riptide into the turnbuckle. Ripley tried a Riptide, Morgan slipped out of it and Morgan sent a charging Ripley into the turnbuckle. Morgan sent Ripley’s right shoulder into the turnbuckle. Ripley shouted “it’s out” referring to her shoulder. Ripley told the referee that she didn’t want to stop. Ripley left the ring, so Morgan kicked Ripley in the shoulder and the back of Ripley’s shoulder went crashing into the steel steps. Back in the ring, Morgan got a two count. Morgan kicked Ripley repeatedly in the right shoulder and then Morgan rammed Ripley’s shoulder into the mat. The fans chanted “Let’s go Rhea” and “Let’s go Liv” as Morgan grounded Ripley by working on the right arm. Morgan hit double knees to the right shoulder, but Ripley came back with a kick to knock Liv down. Morgan went for a suicide dive, Dominik shoved Ripley out of the way and Morgan dove onto Dominik to knock him down on the floor. Ripley banged her shoulder against the commentary table and then pulled on her right arm so the shoulder was back in the joint. That’s a good spot.

Analysis: Great job by Ripley selling the right shoulder injury and then doing the spot to pop it back in place. It’s really creative to even do a spot like that.

Ripley continued on offense with a dropkick that sent Morgan into the turnbuckle. Ripley slammed Morgan face first into the mat for two. Ripley went for a lifting move, but Morgan countered with a DDT. Morgan charged right into a kick by Ripley. Ripley applied the Prism Lock submission while continuing to favor the right arm. Live countered that to send Ripley into the turnbuckle. Morgan came back with Crucifix Driver into a pin for two. Morgan applied an armbar on the right arm, but Ripley was blocking it. Ripley managed to get back to her feet and hit a Powerbomb for two. Ripley trash talked Morgan, who came back with a headbutt and Liv pulled on Ripley’s right arm against the middle rope. Morgan grabbed a chair from ringside. Morgan brought the chair into the ring while Ripley shoved her shoulder into the turnbuckle a few times to get her strength back. Ripley kicked Liv so the chair was knocked out of Liv’s hand. Ripley hit a Riptide slam. No cover. Ripley grabbed the steel chair so Dominik grabbed it out of her hands. The fans booed while Dominik said that you can’t win the title like this, which is true. Morgan dropkicked Ripley in the back to knock Dominik off the apron. Morgan hit Oblivion for one…two…and no! Ripley kicked out. Huge pop for that. Dominik slid the chair into the ring, he distracted the referee and Morgan capitalized with Oblivion onto the steel chair. Morgan sent the chair out of the ring. Morgan covered Ripley for the pinfall win! It went 15:55.

Winner by pinfall: Liv Morgan

Analysis: **** It was a great match with a lot of drama throughout the match and then the finish with Dominik screwing over Ripley to help Morgan get the win. My prediction was that Dominik would “accidentally” cost Rhea the match and that’s kind of how it was done, but then we saw after the match that Dominik was definitely on Liv’s side. Ripley did an awesome job of selling the right shoulder injury throughout the match, she was dominant at times and then she lost because of Dominik screwing her out of the win. I didn’t expect a title change here. I figured Liv would keep the title in a cheap way and that’s what happened. Liv and Rhea work really well together. Liv is having the best run of her career while Ripley is an awesome performer.

After the match, Dominik Mysterio had a smirk on his face while Morgan celebrated with the Women’s World Title. They showed replays of what happened. Dominik picked up Morgan and Dominik kissed Morgan on the lips. Cole: “Dominik, you sorry two-timing son of a bitch!” The fans were booing loudly while Dominik put his arm around Liv’s shoulder and walked away with her. It’s weird that Dominik wears his wedding ring, but he is doing that too. Anyway, the fans were booing Dominik and Morgan while Pat called Dominik a “piece of s**t” to describe Dirty Dom. The fans were booing loudly for this.

Analysis: There’s the heel makeout session for Liv and Dominik to celebrate the win. Liv had an expression on her face like she didn’t know Dominik was going to help her win, but as a heel, she could just be fooling us. Anyway, I’m interested to see how things go from here because I assume Dominik will be out of The Judgment Day group now and paired with Morgan, which is certainly an interesting duo going forward. Also, I liked how the announcers reacted to Dom’s actions.

There were some commercials promoting various WWE things.

Sami Zayn was shown getting ready for his match.

A video package aired about the Sami Zayn-Bron Breakker match for the Intercontinental Title.

The Judgment Day’s clubhouse was shown with Damian Priest asking Finn Balor, JD McDonagh, and Carlito where Dominik was. Priest asked Balor if he knew Dominik was going to do that. Balor said he didn’t know. Balor, JD & Carlito left to go look for Dominik. Priest said “I’m going to kill this kid” about Dominik.

Analysis: It’s smart to do a backstage segment like that right after the match. The Judgment Day is featured so much so we should get their reaction as soon as possible.

Bron Breakker was up first looking ready to go. Sami Zayn was up next as the Intercontinental Champion and he got a big ovation. Graves noted that the IC Title has changed hands 15 times at SummerSlam.

Intercontinental Championship: Sami Zayn vs. Bron Breakker

Bron went for a Spear right away, so Zayn did a leapfrog to avoid it. Bron was down on the floor leading to Zayn diving onto him on the floor. Back in the ring, Zayn went for a Helluva Kick and Bron avoided it. Bron got some offense going with a leaping clothesline that Pat correctly called a Steiner Line. They battled by the turnbuckle, Zayn was seated on the top rope and Bron hit a Frankensteiner for two. Zayn hit a few slaps to the face, then he did a leapfrog over Bron and Zayn hit a clothesline. Zayn did a lift, Bron flipped over to land on his knees and Bron went for a bulldog off the turnbuckle, but Zayn countered with a Blue Thunder Bomb for two. Zayn hit an Exploder Suplex into the turnbuckle. Zayn charged for more, but Bron came back with an impressive Spear to knock Zayn down. Bron was selling a right shoulder injury. Bron ran the ropes very quickly leading to another Spear for the pinfall win at 5:40.

Winner by pinfall AND NEW Intercontinental Champion: Bron Breakker

Analysis: **1/2 This wasn’t about going out there to have some classic match. Their match at Money in the Bank was better. This was about crowning Bron Breakker as a new, dominant Intercontinental Champion. Zayn hit some of his signature moves and some nearfalls, but Bron was too much for him. That first Spear that Bron did might have been better than the second one just because of how explosive it looked. I’m happy for Bron while Sami had a good four-month run as IC Champion.

Bron Breakker celebrated with the Intercontinental Title. Great moment for him.

There were commercials for various WWE things including the WWE 2K24 video game.

The fans voted for the Slim Jim Savage Moment of the Summer. The winner was Drew McIntyre beating up CM Punk on Smackdown in Chicago and taking his bracelet from him.

Stephanie McMahon was shown sitting at ringside. She was clapping. The fans cheered.

It’s Logan Paul-LA Knight for the US Title up next, so here’s a video package.

Logan Paul was up first as the United States Champion, who was booed by the Cleveland crowd even though he’s from a suburb of Cleveland. Rapper MGK was there as well, so he slapped hands with Paul and MGK walked down to the ring with Paul. I thought Paul might get more of a special entrance, but it wasn’t that special other than MGK joining him.

LA Knight was shown arriving in Logan Paul’s Prime truck. Knight was in ring gear. Knight smashed some of the windows in the truck. Knight spoke into the camera saying he’s coming for the US Title with everybody saying “LA Knight…yeah.” That led to LA Knight making his entrance to a big pop.

Paul attacked Knight before he finished his entrance. Knight got back up and whipped Paul into the barricade. Knight threw Paul into the Prime hydration station and rolled the cart into Paul. Knight taunted MGK, who was in the front row with Paul’s buddies. Paul spit some Prime drink into Knight’s face. Paul worked over Knight with punches. Paul cleared off the commentary table. Knight got back up and rammed Paul into the commentary table with Paul’s hands hitting the table repeatedly. They shot it from the wrong angle. Shoot it from a different angle and it will look better. Knight had Paul on his shoulders and Knight lifted up Paul leading to a neckbreaker on the table. The table didn’t break. Knight sent Paul into the ring and the bell rang to start the match. Yeah.

Analysis: That’s a unique way to do about five minutes of action before the bell rang.

United States Championship: Logan Paul vs. LA Knight

Knight nailed Paul with an atomic drop followed by a clothesline for two. Knight went for an elbow drop, but Paul got his knees up to block it. Paul sent Knight shoulders-first into the ring post. Paul did it again sending Knight into the ring post. Paul decked Knight with a clothesline. Paul nailed a big boot to the face followed by a split-legged leg drop but that doesn’t get the win, brother. Paul hit a gutwrench suplex. Paul bounced off the ropes leading to Knight hitting a powerslam. Paul had some bruising under the right eye already so maybe a black eye forming for him. Knight worked over Paul with punches and kicks against the turnbuckle. Knight hit a running knee attack against the turnbuckle. Knight hit a Side Effect slam like Matt Hardy. Knight jumped off the top with an elbow drop for two. Paul came back with a springboard punch or clothesline that knocked Knight off the apron to the floor. Paul hit an amazing springboard moonsault onto Knight on the floor! Wow. That was so good. It was so quick and he did it perfectly. It looked like a rough landing for Paul’s knees, but he appeared to be okay. Back in the ring, Knight went for BFT, Paul avoided it and got a backslide pin. Paul nailed Knight with a punch to the jaw for one…two…no. Knight sold it great and then kicked out at the last moment. Paul went up top, he jumped off with a Frog Splash and Knight avoided it. Knight went for BFT, but Paul shoved him off to avoid it. Paul went up top, Knight jumped up to the top and Knight hit a superplex off the top for two. That was a rough landing for Paul because Knight didn’t get him up fully, but the good thing is they appeared to be okay.

Paul eye-gouged Knight by the ropes. Paul spoke to his buddies at ringside, so Knight kicked Paul to knock him down. Knight grabbed two of Paul’s buddies at ringside and stomped on them. Paul nailed Knight from behind and sent Knight into the ring post. MGK handed Paul the brass knuckles that MGK was wearing around his neck. Knight lifted up Paul, so Paul hit Knight with the brass knuckles to the face. Paul went for the clothesline like a Buckshot Lariat, Knight avoided it and LA Knight hit the BFT (Blount Force Trauma) for the pinfall win! The match went about 12:03.

Winner by pinfall AND NEW United States Champion: LA Knight

Analysis: ***1/4 A pretty good match with some fun moments. There were a couple of rough landings for Paul and he had bruising on his face, but kudos to him for getting through the match. I liked the finish because even though Paul hit Knight with the brass knuckles to the face, it wasn’t a big punch and Knight was able to overcome it to hit the BFT for the win. It wasn’t at the same level as some of Paul’s best matches, but still a solid match to give Knight his first championship on the WWE main roster.

LA Knight celebrated with the US Title while Paul looked sad at ringside.

There was a video featuring Apollo Crews and Baron Corbin that was promoting Manscaped. Otis walked in there with Akira Tozawa and Maxxine Dupri. Otis started using one of the shavers. It was just a way to get an advertisement on a show with a lot of ads.

A video package aired about the WWE Women’s Championship match between champion Bayley and Queen of the Ring Nia Jax.

Nia Jax made her entrance as the Queen of the Ring so she wore a cheap looking queen’s crown on her way to the ring. Bayley was up next as the WWE Women’s Champion with the fans cheering her. Cole spoke about how they have met eachother plenty of times over the last decade, but they haven’t met in a singles match in five and a half years. Samantha Irvin did the in-ring championship introductions.

WWE Women’s Championship: Bayley vs. Nia Jax

Bayley trapped Jax against the ropes leading to a kick to the right arm. Bayley hit a jawbreaker to get out of a Jax move, but Jax came back with a Samoan Drop. Jax tossed Bayley across the ring. Jax connected with a body slam along with an elbow drop. Jax trapped Bayley against the turnbuckle followed by a brief Stinkface move. Bayley got out of a Jax submission move and Bayley hit a belly-to-back suplex. Jax sent Bayley into the top rope like a stun gun, but Bayley came back with a jumping forearm smash. Bayley sent a charging Jax to the floor. Jax missed a leg drop on the apron, so Bayley kicked Jax into the barricade. Bayley jumped off the steel steps to dive onto Jax leading to Bayley punching Jax a few times. Bayley went up top, but Jax was there to trip up Bayley on the turnbuckle. Jax powered out of a guillotine choke attempt by Bayley. Jax hit a senton splash and a leg drop for two. Jax went to the middle turnbuckle and jumped off with a leg drop, but Bayley moved out of the way so Jax hit the mat. Bayley hit the Bayley to Belly move for two. That was Bayley’s old finisher that only gets two counts now. Bayley charged at Jax, who hit a uranage slam. Jax set up for the Annihilator splash and connected for two because Bayley managed to kick out of that. Jax was shocked while the announcers were shocked too. Jax headbutted Bayley a few times and sent her into the corner. Jax charged, Bayley moved and Jax went shoulder-first into the ring post.

It’s Tiffy Time! Tiffany Stratton ran down to the ring with the Money in the Bank briefcase while referee Dan Engler ran down to the ring with her. Stratton went on the apron, but Bayley punched her down before there was an official cash in. Jax got a rollup. Bayley hit a running knee to Jax’s face. Jax caught a running Bayley and hit a Powerbomb. Jax hit another Powerbomb. Jax hit the Annihilator splash. Jax went to the middle turnbuckle and hit a second Annihilator splash for the pinfall win. It went 12:30.

Winner by pinfall AND NEW WWE Women’s Champion: Nia Jax

Analysis: ***1/2 I liked the match. Jax has really improved over the last year while Bayley is awesome and always has good matches. They worked well together with some creative nearfalls that were believable. Bayley hitting that Powerbomb was impressive. The Tiffany Stratton spot was a way to distract Bayley because she had to knock Stratton off the apron. That allowed Jax to recover with two straight Powerbombs followed by the Annihilator two more times for the win. Jax had to hit the Annihilator three times to win this match, so that puts over Bayley as a tough champion to beat.

After the match, Nia Jax celebrated the championship win while her friend Tiffany Stratton celebrated with her. Jax hugged her mom at ringside and The Rock’s mom, who is Jax’s aunt, was also there at ringside for a hug.

There were a couple of commercials.

It was mentioned by Cole that NXT moves to The CW on October 1st.

A video package aired for the outstanding CM Punk-Drew McIntyre rivalry. The video package was terrific. It covered the story well and I liked the song choice they went with. That match is next.

Seth “Freakin” Rollins aka Seth Franklin Rollins (real people know) made his entrance wearing a ridiculous black and white jacket since he’s the referee. Rollins was wearing a referee camera on his left ear as well. Rollins had a referee tank top shirt that was bedazzled along with shiny silver-colored pants. Seth certainly likes to stand out with his gear.

Drew McIntyre made his entrance looking angry as the Scottish Warrior wearing a long black and green jacket. It was 9:00 p.m. ET as Drew made his entrance so the stadium was dark and that made the entrances look cooler. Drew: “Bring that bitch out here.”

CM Punk got a big ovation for his first televised singles match in nearly 11 years. Punk was wearing a “Best in the World” hoodie on his way to the ring. Punk suffered a torn triceps at the Royal Rumble in late January. It’s been over six months since then, so it’s good to see Punk back in action after a long layoff.

CM Punk vs. Drew McIntyre (Seth “Freakin” Rollins is the special guest referee)

The rules are likely going to be relaxed in this match with Rollins as the referee, which was covered on Raw this week.

Rollins separated the two men and then he called for the bell. Punk had tape on his right arm where he had the surgery earlier this year. Punk and Drew got into a slugfest right away. Punk stomped on Drew repeatedly, so Rollins pulled Punk away because it was a five count. Drew punched and stomped on Punk repeatedly, so Rollins pulled Drew back after the five count. Punk came back with a kick along with a clothesline. Drew hit a thrust to the throat and a hard chop. Punk clotheslined Drew over the top to the floor. Punk jumped off the apron to knock Drew down on the floor. Punk sent Drew into the ring post. Rollins was doing a very slow count as Punk sent Drew over the barricade at ringside. Punk elbowed Drew in the head. Rollins was sitting on the top rope while the fight continued on the floor, so there was no count. Punk sent Drew into the steel steps. After Punk got some offense by sending Drew into the steps a few more times, Drew caught Punk on the floor and sent Punk into the apron. Drew swung Punk into the commentary table. Drew sent Punk under the ring and did a catapult to send Seth’s sternum into the steel bar. Rollins was clapping about it. Back in the ring, Drew hit a snap suplex. Drew covered, but Punk kicked out at one. Punk tried to come back with punches, but Drew was back up with a hard chop. Drew hit a belly to belly suplex across the ring. Rollins didn’t count right away so he told Drew he had a bad knee. Drew slapped Punk in the head, Punk slapped back and Punk hit some kicks. Drew gave Punk a Powerbomb for just a one count while Rollins told Drew that he counted that time. Drew hit a sitout Powerbomb for two because Rollins did a proper count that time.

Drew brought a steel chair into the ring. Drew told Rollins to just turn around to let Drew take care of this. Drew went for a chair shot, but Rollins took the chair from him. Rollins charged with the chair, Drew avoided it and Rollins stopped himself from hitting Punk. That led to Punk getting a rollup for two because Rollins was slow to count due to turning his back to them. Drew came back with a neckbreaker. Drew took out Punk’s bracelet that he stole and Drew put it on his hand. Punk was back with a jumping side kick along with a neckbreaker. Punk hit a running high knee followed by another running knee in the corner. Punk hit a third running knee followed by a clothesline. Punk went up top, blew a kiss to Rollins and jumped off with an elbow drop. Punk covered Drew for a two count. Punk went for the Anaconda Vice submission, Drew tried to fight it and then Punk got it locked in. Punk took the bracelet off Drew’s left hand, so the fans cheered that. When Punk turned around, Drew was backup and Drew hit a Claymore Kick for one…two…no because Punk got the left shoulder up. Nice nearfall there! Drew went for the Future Shock DDT, but Punk got out of it and Punk sent Drew into the ring post. Punk set up for the Go To Sleep and then Punk was looking at Rollins, who put the bracelet on his left hand. Punk wondered why Rollins had the bracelet on while Rollins said that he was just keeping it safe since he’s the referee. Drew got back up to punch Punk in the back and Punk crashed into Rollins, who bumped to the floor. Drew went for the Future Shock DDT, Punk got out of it and Punk hit the GTS. The crowd was counting up to six when Rollins got into the ring to count the pin for one…two…no because Drew got his shoulder up.

Punk got in Rollins’ face and yelled at him about being slow with the count. Rollins said that we don’t need or want Punk here. Rollins said that not everything is about Punk. Rollins said it’s not always about you, asshole. Punk picked up Rollins and hit him with the GTS. Punk: “It ain’t always about me, but it’s never about you.” Punk got his bracelet back. When Punk turned around, Drew hit Punk with a low blow like Punk did to Drew in the past. Drew was back up and hit the Claymore Kick so Rollins counted the pin for the one…two…and three! Rollins did a count that was at a regular speed although there was a bit of a delay before the third count. It went 17:04.

Winner by pinfall: Drew McIntyre

Analysis: ****1/4 I thought it was a great match that was heavy on storyline with Drew and Punk each having moments where they got mad at Rollins, who really played his role well. I figured one of the two guys would attack Rollins and that’s what happened when Punk hit Rollins with the GTS. That ended up costing Punk the match because Drew was able to hit the low blow cheap shot and the Claymore Kick. The stuff with the bracelet was a bit much because it’s such a cheap thing, but I know for Punk it’s the sentimental value that matters to him. I’m glad Punk got through the match and hopefully he can stay healthy for a long time. Drew was awesome in the match as usual. I think there will be a McIntyre-Punk rematch soon perhaps inside Hell in a Cell at the Bad Blood PLE in October, but we might see Punk against Rollins at the Bash in Berlin PLE later this month. A triple threat with those three guys is also a possibility as well.

After the match, Drew McIntyre grabbed the bracelet off Punk’s arm and Drew put it back on his arm. Drew put his foot on Punk’s chest and posed as the victor of the match. Referees checked on Punk in the ring as Drew walked away.

There were some more commercials about various WWE things. There is a Damian Priest documentary that airs on Peacock on Monday, August 5th.

Damian Priest was in the locker room getting ready. Finn Balor walked in saying they looked everywhere and couldn’t find him. Priest said he probably left. They both said sorry about what happened earlier. Balor said that The Judgment Day comes first. Balor said he knows Priest doesn’t want him out there, but if he changes his mind, just say the word.

The video package aired for the Damian Priest-Gunther match for the World Heavyweight Title coming up next.

Gunther made his entrance alone wearing a long jacket as usual. The stats noted that Gunther was 6-0 since losing the Intercontinental Title and we know he won King of the Ring to earn this title match. Gunther beat Sheamus, Kofi Kingston, Jey Uso and Randy Orton to win the King of the Ring tournament. They showed some legends watching the show from the Legends Suite.

Damian Priest of The Judgment Day made his entrance as the World Heavyweight Champion. The storyline going into the match has seen Gunther come across as more of a pure heel by mocking Priest for being street trash. Priest has been a heel for over two years, but he has been cheered of late. Priest has been the World Champion for 118 days since cashing in Money in the Bank at WrestleMania 40 four months ago. Ring announcer Samantha Irvin did the in ring championship introductions.

WWE World Heavyweight Championship: Damian Priest vs. GUNTHER

Gunther had scars on his chest from his battle with Finn Balor from last Monday on Raw. Referee Chad Patton was wearing the referee cam.

Priest was very aggressive right away with some punches and elbow smashes. Gunther left the ring, so Priest nailed him with a jumping punch to the back. Gunther sent Priest back-first into the ring post and then a suplex onto the ring apron. Gunther nailed Priest with a hard chop. Gunther was in control in the ring with a body slam. Priest came back with punches and the dreaded ear clap move. Gunther countered a suplex leading to a chop and butterfly suplex across the ring. Gunther with a chop, Priest with a punch and Gunther nailed a boot to the face. Gunther went to the turnbuckle, so Priest punched him a few times. Gunther was seated on the turnbuckle and Priest hit a jumping kick to the head. Priest did a Frankensteiner off the turnbuckle followed by the Broken Arrow slam for two. Priest worked over Gunther with kicks to the body. Gunther came back with chops, so Priest chopped Gunther and Priest hit a kick that knocked Gunther down. Gunther’s chest was bleeding. Gunther chopped Priest a few more times, but Priest blocked a chop and hit a forearm to the jaw. Priest connected with a superkick that knocked Gunther down. Priest charged, Gunther moved and Priest hit the turnbuckle. Gunther hit a running dropkick followed by a Powerbomb for two. Gunther was looking at his bloody chest. Gunther worked over Priest with palm strikes to the head. Priest hit a spinning kick. Priest hit a South of Heaven move that’s a Chokeslam for a two count. Priest signaled for the Razor’s Edge, but Gunther blocked it and delivered a chop. Priest went for a kick, Gunther blocked that and hit an overhead suplex. Gunther hit two clotheslines in a row for a two count.

Gunter was in control with a boot to the head while Priest was on his knees. Priest told him to bring it, so Gunther chopped Priest to knock him down. Gunther chopped Priest again. Finn Balor showed up on ringside to encourage his buddy Priest. Gunther continued the attack with more chops to Priest. Priest fought back with punches until Gunther stopped that with a boot to the face. Gunther wiped the blood off his chest and rubbed it over his hair. Gunther kicked Priest in the head along with a running kick to the ribs. Balor was encouraging Priest, so Gunther kicked Balor to knock Finn down. Priest slowly got back up as the fans cheered and Priest hit a stiff clothesline. Priest hit another clothesline. Priest hit connected with the Razor’s Edge, but Gunther got back up quickly. Priest hit South of Heaven near the ropes, so when Priest covered, Balor put Gunther’s left leg on the bottom rope! They showed a replay of what Balor did. The announcers said that Priest never saw it because of how he covered, but Priest saw the replay on the video screen. Balor had a smirk on his face. Priest tried to go after Balor, but Gunther grabbed Priest and applied a sleeper hold on the mat. Gunther held onto the choke hold on the mat while Priest sold it like he was out and that’s when Priest fought back to get out of it. Priest covered Gunther for two. Priest grabbed Balor around the throat. Gunther picked up Priest and hit a Powerbomb. Gunther applied a sleeper hold on the mat with a body scissors around the waist. The referee raised Priest’s hand, Priest was out and Gunther wins! Yes! GUNTHER is the new World Heavyweight Champion! It went 16:40.

Winner by submission AND NEW World Heavyweight Champion: GUNTHER

Analysis: ****1/4 I liked the match quite a bit and the result made me very happy as a huge GUNTHER fan. The obvious story is that The Judgment Day had a rough night because of this match and the Ripley/Morgan match. They have teased issues between Priest and Balor for a long time with Balor coming across as a guy who is jealous of Priest, so we saw it come into play here. They had a very physical match with a lot of hard strikes and big moves by both guys. It was probably one of Priest’s best singles matches of his career. For Gunther, it was the usual excellent performance in a PLE match. I think the right guy won the match because it’s time for Gunther to be a World Heavyweight Champion and I hope he has a long title reign. I thought Priest has been good as a face in the past, so we’ll see how he does in that role again since he’ll likely be feuding with Balor soon.

After the match, Gunther kissed his wife at ringside and greeted some friends. Gunther walked over to the commentary table and stood on the table with the World Heavyweight Title around his waist.

Analysis: I’m so happy for Gunther. He’s one of the best all-around performers in wrestling today and having him as the World Champion is a great thing for WWE.

There was a quick video about John Cena’s 2025 Farewell tour.

The Smackdown on USA Network premiere is on Friday, September 13th.

A replay was shown of Dominik Mysterio costing Rhea Ripley her match with Liv Morgan earlier in the night. Pat McAfee narrated the clips in his unique way.

Let’s Hear From The Miz & R-Truth

The Awesome Truth duo of The Miz & R-Truth were in the ring for a promo. The Miz said that this show set the record for an American SummerSlam attendance record with 57,791 in the crowd.

Grayson Waller and Austin Theory aka A-Town Down Under showed up at ringside for the interruption. They trashed The Miz for being disgusting like the fans. Theory trashed the Cleveland Browns as the worst NFL team of all-time. Ouch. Theory said that the fans look like Jelly Roll. Waller said that Jelly Roll said that he’s the only man to make music worse than R-Truth. That led to Truth saying that we are in the home of the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame. Truth thought that Theory and Waller were the Rock N Roll Express. Miz tried to correct Truth. Jelly Roll was in the ring with a chair. Theory and Waller were kicked in the gut so they could bend over. Jelly Roll hit both Waller and Theory with chair shots to the back. Jelly Roll gave Theory a Chokeslam. The trio of Miz, Truth & Jelly Roll each hit the Five Knuckle Shuffle fist drops on Theory. The fans loved it.

Analysis: That was fun. Jelly Roll did a good job and probably got to live out a dream by doing moves in a WWE ring.

This Monday on Raw: Wyatt Sicks trio of Rowan, Lumis & Gacy vs. Chad Gable & The Creed Brothers.

The WWE Bash In Berlin PLE takes place on Saturday, August 31st. That’s four weeks away. I love 1 p.m. ET start times.

It’s main event time with Cody Rhodes facing Solo Sikoa in a Bloodline Rules Match. A video package aired to set it up.

Solo Sikoa was up first for the main event as the challenger. He made his entrance alone without any members of The Bloodline joining him. It was Solo’s first match at a SummerSlam and he’s in the main event of the show. Good for him.

The Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes was shown on his extravagant bus where he walked his beloved dog Pharoah on a leash. I saw Cody mention recently that this was Pharoah’s final trip on the road (Graves mentioned it as well) and Cody left Pharoah with WWE Hall of Famer Arn Anderson, who gave Cody some words of encouragement. Arn said that 54,000 people think that Cody is a damn fine WWE Champion. Arn said that those four guys are coming for Cody. Arn said that he’s got a little influence, had a few conversations and told Cody that he has a few friends that are on the way.

As Cody kept on walking, he left Pharoah with a friend and was given his American Nightmare jacket. Cody put on some headgear and made his way into the arena.

Analysis: I love seeing stuff like that. It’s a PLE main event so giving Cody a special entrance like that is nice to see. It showed us Cody walking from his bus towards the building while showing some people who mean a lot to him. That was cool to see Arn again and seeing him give some words of encouragement to Cody. Nice touch.

What an arrival for the Undisputed WWE Champion at #SummerSlam! pic.twitter.com/ppePo27mVE — WWE (@WWE) August 4, 2024

Cody Rhodes made his entrance as the Undisputed WWE Champion. The fans were very loud throughout the entrance while singing the song and getting loud for the “WHOA-OH” part as usual. Cody has been WWE Champion for 118 days, this was his fourth (televised) title defense as champion and he has a 2-2 career record at SummerSlam. They have put stats up for every entrance tonight and that’s good to see. Ring announcer Samantha Irvin did the championship introductions and she was fantastic as usual. The crowd is ready to go for this match.

Undisputed WWE Championship Bloodline Rules Match: Cody Rhodes vs. Solo Sikoa

A Bloodline Rules Match means that anything goes.

The match started with neither man getting the advantage while Solo blocked a Cody punch that Cody loves to do. Solo knocked Cody down near the turnbuckle, so Cody bailed to the floor to avoid the hip attack. Back in the ring, Solo headbutted Cody followed by a chop. Solo punched Cody and told him to sit his ass down. Solo sent Cody over the top to the apron, but Cody fought back and Cody hit a Disaster Kick. Solo was on the floor, so Cody hit a suicide dive onto Solo on the floor. Cody ran the ropes leading to Solo punching Cody to stop that. Back in the ring, Solo did an impressive counter leading to a spinning heel kick. Solo connected with a Samoan Drop. Solo hit another Samoan Drop for two. Solo wanted a Samoan Spike, Cody blocked that with a kick to the thumb and a kick to the face. Cody jumped off the ropes with a Cody Cutter followed by a clothesline over the top to the floor. Cody sent Solo into the Prime bottle at ringside. Cody had a drink and then hit Solo with the bottle. Back in the ring, Cody hit his up punch followed by the Dusty combo leading to the bionic elbow. Cody went for a springboard attack, but Solo caught him and Solo hit a Powerbomb for two. Solo was booed heavily as he hit a running hip attack on Cody against the turnbuckle. Cody got a rollup for two. Solo hit the Spinning Solo lifting uranage slam for a two count. That was a finishing move earlier in Solo’s career in the NXT days. Solo did the deadly trapezius muscle squeeze, Cody broke free and Solo hit another Samoan Drop for two. Solo set up Cody upside down against the turnbuckle leading to Solo hitting a running headbutt. Solo hit another headbutt while Cody was upside down against the turnbuckle. Cody avoided a third headbutt attempt. Cody went up top and jumped off with a cross body block onto Solo. Cody charged at Solo, who hit him with a spinning Bossman Slam for two. Solo took a long time going to the turnbuckle, so Cody met him there. Cody jumped to the top rope and connected with a superplex. Cody and Solo exchanged punches. Cody went for a move off the ropes, Solo caught him teasing a Cross Rhodes, but Cody turned it around and Cody hit Cross Rhodes. That’s when the interference began.

Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa went into the ring to attack Cody. They hit a corner attack on Cody. They hit a double team neckbreaker on Cody leading to Solo getting a two count. The music of Kevin Owens hit as Owens ran down to the ring and went after The Bloodline in the ring. Owens superkicked Solo to knock him down. Owens punched Tama and Loa repeatedly. Tama was back up with punches on Owens. The fans were chanting “Randy” and right on cue here’s the return of Randy Orton to a thunderous ovation as Orton’s music played. Orton punched Tama at ringside and threw him into the barricade. Orton went into the ring and hit Loa with an RKO. Owens hit Tama with a Stunner. Orton hit a powerslam on Solo. Owens went up top and hit a Swanton Bomb on Solo. Cody hit Cross Rhodes on Solo for just a two count because Solo got his right shoulder up. Orton and Owens went fighting with Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa to the backstage area. Cody tossed the top half of the steel steps into the ring. Cody hit Solo with the steel steps two times while Solo was up against the turnbuckle. Solo was able to get back up and hit a Spear for two. It was about 20 minutes into the match. Solo setup Cody against the steel steps. Solo charged with a running hip attack, Cody moved out of the way and Solo’s back hit the steel steps. Cody hit Cross Rhodes once, Cody hit Cross Rhodes twice and here comes Jacob Fatu. Jacob jumped off the top with a twisting body attack on Cody to knock him down. Jacob did a double jump moonsault onto Cody. Jacob put Solo on top of Cody for one…two…and no because Cody got his left shoulder up. Solo told Jacob to put Cody through the table.

Jacob Fatu sent Cody out of the ring and Jacob superkicked Cody to knock him down on the floor. Jacob superkicked Cody onto the commentary table. Jacob went up top and Jacob jumped off the top with a Superfly Splash that put Cody through the table. Jacob was selling a right leg injury because he had a rough landing when he hit the table. Back in the ring, Solo went up top and hit an Uso Splash for two. They replayed Jacob Fatu’s splash on Cody and you could see Jacob grab his right knee right away because his knee hit the table hard. Cody was back up with a superkick. Cody went to the turnbuckle and jumped off with a Cody Cutter!

A graphic appeared saying “Head of the Table” as the familiar music of the real Tribal Chief played and Roman Reigns walked out wearing an “OTC” shirt since he’s the Original Tribal Chief. The fans popped loudly for Reigns as he slowly walked down to the ring while both guys were down in the ring.

Roman Reigns went into the ring and nailed Solo Sikoa with a Superman Punch. Huge pop from the crowd. The fans loved it. Reigns nailed his cousin Solo with a Spear. Reigns looked over at Cody, who was seated up against the ropes. Reigns looked out at the crowd as they chanted “holy shit” for his return. Reigns nodded at Cody as a sign of respect. The fans chanted “Thank You Roman” for Reigns. Cody picked up Solo, Cody hit Cross Rhodes and Cody pinned Solo while looking at Reigns and the referee counted one…two…and three to give Cody the win. This match went 29:10.

Winner by pinfall: Cody Rhodes

Analysis: ***3/4 It wasn’t an epic match necessarily, but I enjoyed it immensely for all of the big moments in a long match that had so many crazy things happen. The return of Roman Reigns as a babyface is something that the fans wanted to see and Reigns didn’t hesitate in terms of who he was going to attack. It was about Reigns getting revenge on cousin Solo Sikoa for taking over as Tribal Chief even though we will probably find out that Reigns didn’t want that to happen. I hope Jacob Fatu isn’t legitimately hurt because he’s such a talented guy. The crowd reaction for the match was interesting because they were quiet for a lot of it in the first half since they knew there was going to be a lot of interference, so once the interference started, that’s when the crowd reactions grew. It was also very loud once Roman Reigns made his entrance, which is not a surprise since WWE fans were chanting “We Want Roman” for months. I’m happy Cody is still the champion and it was a great showing by him as usual while Solo did his part well too.

Cody Rhodes was handed the WWE Championship while Roman Reigns looked on approvingly from the aisle. They showed some replays.

Cody Rhodes celebrated on the turnbuckle while staring at Roman Reigns. Solo Sikoa was screaming at ringside about what happened. Reigns pointed at his shirt that said “OTC” meaning Original Tribal Chief. Cole said that the real Tribal Chief is back and God help Solo Sikoa. Cody continued to celebrate. The show ended there right at 11:00 p.m. ET so it was four hours long.

Analysis: I liked the Cody Rhodes-Roman Reigns staredown that was done in a way where it was between two guys who respect eachother. It wasn’t a staredown between rivals. It was between two guys who had a history, but now Roman is a babyface too, so they’re on the same side against Solo Sikoa’s version of The Bloodline. We could see Cody & Roman as a babyface superteam down the road at something like WarGames or even before that. There are a lot of possibilities there.

The runtime of SummerSlam was 4:00:00 on WWE Network/Peacock.

Five Stars of the Show

Gunther Cody Rhodes Drew McIntyre/CM Punk Liv Morgan/Rhea Ripley LA Knight

Welcome back Roman Reigns too.

===

Final Thoughts

I’m going 8.5 out of 10 for this show.

Excellent show from top to bottom. I enjoyed it a lot. It was such a strong show storyline-wise. They did a nice job of coming up with creative finishes for most of the matches. I know that some fans complain about finishes that aren’t clean. To me, what matters is if the finish fits the story and I think on this show, a lot of the finishes made sense. I didn’t mind any of the finishes. Regarding Drew McIntyre-CM Punk, it was clever because it sets up Punk against Seth Rollins while we could also get a Drew/Punk rematch soon too.

Welcome back to Roman Reigns. It wasn’t the best Cody Rhodes WWE Title match because the fans knew there was going to be interference and they waited until the interference started to really start reacting to the match. I liked how Roman Reigns made his choice clear right away by nailing Solo Sikoa with a Superman Punch and Spear. Cody Rhodes getting the win thanks to Reigns was the right finish because it establishes Reigns as a new babyface after four years of being a heel.

I don’t think there was any one match that stood out as the best of the night. If you see my ratings, I had several of them around four stars and then a couple of them above that. Bad night for The Judgment Day since Dominik Mysterio cost Rhea Ripley her match and Finn Balor cost Damian Priest his match. Now we get to see what happens to that group that has dominated Raw for over two years. Booking finishes that keep people watching is the right way to do it.

Congratulations to all the new champions. There were six title matches and four title changes. I’m most happy about Gunther and Bron Breakker winning gold. Lastly, I’ll just say it’s up there with one of the best WWE PLE’s this year. SummerSlam was a great success.

Here are my rankings of WWE PLE’s in 2024 so far:

WrestleMania 40 – 8.5 (out of 10)

SummerSlam – 8.5

Backlash France – 8

Clash at the Castle – 8

Money in the Bank – 7.75

Royal Rumble – 7.75

King And Queen Of The Ring – 7.75

Elimination Chamber – 7.5

Roman Reigns returns in WWE SummerSlam 2024 (Credit: X)

New Delhi: Cody Rhodes defeated Solo Sikoa to retained his Undisputed WWE title but Rhodes got plenty of help from Kevin Ownes and Randy Orton to handle Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa. But the limelight was grabbed by Reigns when he came to destroy Solo Sikoa and he also came wearing a T-shirt with written three-letter OTC which means ‘Original Tribal chief’.

Sikoa was dominating with headbutts and kicks but Rhodes gave Samoan a drop and sent Sikoa into the canvas. Then the Bloodline family intervenes in the match but Rhodes hits Cross Rhodes to both Tonga and Loa. Reigns is the fourth-time World Champion, he held the Undisputed WWE Championship for 1,316 days which was the fourth largest in WWE history and longest in the Modern Era.

Gunther defeated Damian Priest

Gunther beat Priest and became the new WWE World Heavyweight Champion. Priest started the match with a forearm smash to Gunther and struck a couple of punches in the corner. Priest was dominating in the match until Gunther went outside the ring and regrouped and then came back with a flying sled off the steel ring steps. Gunther then attacked Priest’s neck and gave Bodyslam to the floor. Priest then hit a spinning roundhouse kick and gave a south of heaven chokeslam but Gunther kicked out for a count of two and survived. Gunther then came back and gave back-to-back suplexes.

Finn Balor was seen outside the Ring and helping his friend Priest and motivating him. Priest exchanged some chops and connected his other south-of-heaven chokeslam, Balor was also involved in the match as he put Gunther’s foot on the bottom rope but Gunther applied his sleeper hold but Priest refused to quit but Gunther gave a Powerbomb and again gave sleeper hold in which Priest passes out and tapped. Gunther becomes the new WWE World Heavyweight Champion via referee stoppage."

Roman Reigns Makes Shock Return At WWE SummerSlam, Takes Out Solo Sikoa To Help Cody Rhodes Retain

Roman Reigns, who was nowhere to be seen following WrestleMania 40, returned at WWE SummerSlam 2024 and attacked Solo Sikoa in the match against Cody Rhodes."

In the closing moments of WWE SummerSlam, Roman Reigns made his long-awaited return to WWE. He interfered in the Undisputed WWE Championship match between Cody Rhodes and Solo Sikoa. Reigns came in and hit Sikoa with a Superman Punch and a Spear. Rhodes then took advantage of the situation and pinned Sikoa with a Crossrhodes to secure the successful defense.

Reigns then stared down Rhodes after the bell, and he also looked back at The Bloodline, who remained at ringside.

Fans had not seen Roman Reigns since Rhodes beat him to win the title at WWE WrestleMania 40.

WWE Summer Slam: Cody Rhodes vs Solo Sikoa WWE Championship match results.,https://wrestlingrumors.net/derekstoughton/roman-reigns-returns-at-summerslam-2024/,"He’s back. Roman Reigns returned to WWE at SummerSlam 2024, appearing in the main event between Cody Rhodes and Solo Sikoa for the WWE Undisputed Championship.

You can see the return below:

Rhodes and Sikoa were battling for the championship in a Bloodline Rules match. After Randy Orton and Kevin Owens returned, taking out Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa, Jacob Fatu interfered, attacking Rhodes. After Fatu splashed Rhodes through a table, he seemed to injure himself and was out of the equation temporarily. Once Rhodes and Sikoa were down in the ring, Reigns returned, attacking Sikoa with a Superman Punch and a spear, allowing Rhodes to hit Cross Rhodes, and make the cover to retain his championship.

Editor’s Opinion:

This was the perfect time for The Tribal Chief to return, as SummerSlam’s conclusion always has major returns and moments to get the fans fired up for WWE programming in the fall. Reigns’ return opens up a ton of avenues for the story and can build up to several PLEs for the rest of 2024. Either way, I am so happy to see one of the greatest of all-time back in WWE, and can’t wait to see what happens next!

WWE SUMMERSLAM RESULTS – 8/3/24

The “Countdown to WWE SummerSlam 2024” pre-show kicks off outside in sunny Cleveland, OH., where Michael Cole welcomes us to the panel. Joining him are Pat McAfee, Wade Barrett and Big E.

Following their opening banter, they send things to Byron Saxton and Jackie Redmond, who check-in from outside of Cody Rhodes’ “American Nightmare” bus and The Judgment Day Clubhouse.

Also checking in is Cathy Kelley, who talks about CM Punk being eerily calm during her discussion with him ahead of tonight’s big event. She also plugs the Michael Cole sit-down interview with Punk, which is already available on WWE’s YouTube channel.

We head into a number of promotional video packages in between additional banter and hype from the pre-show panelists. We then see a lengthy hype video package promoting The Miz as a darling son of Cleveland in an attempt to ensure he gets a favorable crowd reaction tonight.

We then see footage of him on The Miz Express tour bus, which Cole calls the SummerSlam Express bus. Live outside the arena in Cleveland, R-Truth, DIY, Miz and Maryse come out of the bus, interact with the fans waiting to get in, and then we return to the panelists for some more time-killing chit-chat.

Cathy Kelley is live in The Judgment Day Clubhouse with “Dirty” Dominik Mysterio. He talks about The Judgment Day having a big night with Damian Priest and Rhea Ripley in title matches. Dom-Dom says they’ll return on Raw with all the gold and then asks her to leave.

Byron Saxton takes it from there for some interaction with crowds waiting outside the building in Cleveland, OH. He also introduces the winner of the SummerSlam t-shirt design contest, which we see.We catch up with Bron Breakker entering the building, who vows Sami Zayn’s Intercontinental Championship reign ends tonight.

The panel goofs around for a bit again and throw it over to The Miz. The WWE SummerSlam 2024 host awkwardly stumbles through his words trying to interview a random shy kid in the “Fan Zone” with Peter Rosenberg. Back to the panel for a few and then we see Michael Cole’s lengthy sit-down interview with Seth “Freakin'” Rollins.

They promote him joining the panel later in the pre-show. We move on to a walk-and-talk with Peter Rosenberg and Damian Priest in Bronx, and inside Yankees Stadium. After that wraps up, footage of GUNTHER crashing Damian Priest Live on Friday in Cleveland.

Back at the panel, Cole tags out and Jackie Redmond tags in as the panel host. Also swapping out is Pat McAfee, and swapping in is Peter Rosenberg. The talk shifts to Cody Rhodes vs. Solo Sikoa for the first time on the pre-show, and the elaborate “Road to” pre-match video package for it airs.

We return to Big E. with a selfie stick in a sea of fans. He also teases the possibility of fans seeing someone they haven’t seen in quite a while tonight. Wonder if another chief is in the house? The talk at the panel shifts to the Liv Morgan vs. Rhea Ripley match for the women’s world title.

We see a sit-down interview between Redmond and Ripley. Then we shoot to backstage interviews with WWE Women’s World Champion Liv Morgan, as well as “Queen” Nia Jax and 2024 Ms. Money In The Bank Tiffany Stratton. After that wraps up, we shoot inside Cleveland Browns Stadium for the first time, where Michael Cole is standing in the middle of the ring.

He talks about the Punk-McIntyre bout and sends things to his sit-down interview with CM Punk himself. When that’s in the rear-view mirror, we head back to the pre-show panel, where the panelists are joined by the one-and-only Seth “Freakin'” Rollins.

“The Visionary” and “The Revolutionary” of WWE settles in with his zebra-colored, referee-style suit and bowtie, and talks about what exactly Rollins Rules means. Essentially, it’s anything goes and he may or may not get involved himself at some point, from the sounds of it.

WWE Hall of Fame legend Sean Waltman joins the panel for the next few segments with the panelists and then we shoot to a Pat McAfee sit-down interview with Jelly Roll, the artist who did the themes for tonight’s show and an apparent big deal in modern music. Don’t ask me!

We also see a video package on iconic entrance themes and the rest of the top-ten countdown of all-time SummerSlam moments feature. A video package airs promoting “The Last Time Is Now: John Cena Farewell Tour 2025,” complete with an official graphic for the tour that will travel the globe over the next year.

WWE also promotes the move of SmackDown from FOX to the USA Network in September, and then ESPN analyst Joe Tessitore appears alongside Michael Cole. They announce that Cole will move to the SmackDown commentary team, and that Tessitore will be leading the commentary crew on Monday night’s for Raw starting September 2 in Denver, CO.

WWE Women’s World Championship

Liv Morgan (c) vs. Rhea Ripley

Soon after this, the “Countdown to WWE SummerSlam 2024” pre-show wraps up. “WWE Then. Now. Forever. Together.” flashes on the screen and then we shoot into the cold open for tonight’s premium live event. Inside the jam-packed Cleveland Browns Stadium, WWE SummerSlam 2024 Host The Miz has some fun in the crowd to start the show.

Backstage, we see Rhea Ripley walking the halls with “Dirty” Dominik Mysterio. The camera follows them all the way to Gorilla position and through the curtain, all the way down to the ring. Liv Morgan is introduced next and out comes the reigning, defending WWE Women’s World Champion. It’s time for our first match of the evening.

The bell sounds and off we go. Morgan quickly gets out of the ring and taunts her from ringside. Ripley goes outside and chases her, but Morgan gets in the ring and laughs at her. Ripley looks frustrated. Ripley gets in the ring, but Morgan quickly gets out. Ripley shouts at her and goes outside, but Morgan gets in the ring.

Ripley is not happy. Ripley gets in the ring, and once again, Morgan gets out. Ripley fakes getting out of the ring, so Morgan gets in the ring and finds herself face-to-face with her challenger. Ripley blocks a right hand and hits a pair of short-arm clotheslines. Ripley ducks an attack and hits a third short-arm clothesline. Ripley connects with a half-and-half suplex, sending Morgan in a heap to ringside.

Ripley goes outside and high-fives Mysterio before licking his cheek in front of a jealous Morgan. Ripley attacks Morgan and bounces her off the barricade before chopping her chest. Ripley bounces Morgan’s face off the ring steps a few times before putting her in the ring. Ripley sizes Morgan up on the mat and goes for a clothesline, but Morgan ducks it. Ripley quickly rebounds with a vicious head-butt.

Ripley hits a Rip Tide into the top turnbuckle. Ripley goes for a Rip Tide in the center of the ring, but Morgan slides off and retreats to the corner. Ripley approaches, but Morgan pulls her into the second turnbuckle. Morgan grabs Ripley and shoves her recently healed shoulder into the ring post. Ripley’s shoulder appears to be dislocated and her right arm is dangling. Ripley shouts, “It’s out!” The referee asks if she wants to stop the match, but Ripley refuses.

Ripley gets out of the ring, but Morgan attacks her at ringside and big boots her into the ring steps. Morgan stomps Ripley and puts her in the ring for a two-count. Morgan stomps her down before wrenching the injured arm and slamming her down. Morgan covers for a two-count. Morgan pulls Ripley’s hair and shouts, “This is my revenge tour!” Morgan applies an armbar to Ripley’s injured shoulder. Morgan gets up and kicks away at the shoulder.

Morgan applies an overhead wristlock and comes off the ropes with a codebreaker to the shoulder. Ripley manages to get to her feet and big boots Morgan down. Ripley goes to ringside, and Mysterio checks on her. Mysterio then pushes Ripley out of the way and takes a suicide dive from Morgan. Ripley attacks Morgan and puts her in the ring. Ripley paces at ringside before slamming her shoulder into the commentary table to pop her shoulder back into place!

Morgan looks shocked. Ripley gets in the ring and unloads on Morgan with stiff forearm shots, followed by a kick to the head. Ripley viciously dropkicks her into the corner. Ripley lifts Morgan and slams her down onto the mat for a two-count. After some more back-and-forth action, we see Ripley hit a Rip-Tide and have this one finished off, when she is given a chair by Dom-Dom. She goes to use it, but when she goes to swing it, Dom-Dom grabs it and stops her.

The crowd gasps. Ripley looks pissed. Dom-Dom tries explaining he just doesn’t want her to win it this way. Morgan ends up hitting her finisher and retaining her title. Ripley is pissed. Outside of the ring, Dom-Dom shrugs his shoulders and then he and Morgan have a big make-out session as an enraged Ripley watches on from in the ring.

Winner and STILL WWE Women’s World Champion: Liv Morgan

WWE Intercontinental Championship

Sami Zayn (c) vs. Bron Breakker

After we see Sami Zayn stretching and warming up backstage, and a shot of Bron Breakker getting ready, we head into the in-depth pre-match video package that tells the story leading up to our second match of tonight’s premium live event, which is for the WWE Intercontinental Championship.

When the package wraps up, we see an enraged Damian Priest asking The Judgment Day guys where Dom-Dom is. Finn Balor comes in and Priest snatches him up by his shirt. He asks if Balor knew about this. Balor insists he didn’t, and they all assure him they too want to find that dirt bag. They head off to do exactly that and Balor assures him they’ll find him. Uht oh.

Back inside Cleveland Browns Stadium, it’s time for the dogs to get ta’ barkin’, as former multiple-time WWE NXT World Champion Bron Breakker makes his way out and heads to the ring. After he settles inside the squared circle, Sami Zayn’s catchy-ass entrance tune hits and the crowd in Cleveland goes bonkers as he makes his way to the ring for his latest title defense in a rematch against Breakker.

Breakker starts off charging across the ring as soon as the bell sounds. Zayn side-steps him and Breakker crashes shoulder-first into the steel ring post with authority. Zayn enjoyed some offensive control for a few minutes from there, but it wasn’t long before Breakker took over.

He hit a few vicious spears, turning Zayn inside-out in the process, and scores the pin fall for the relatively easy victory to become your brand new WWE Intercontinental Champion. The crowd ate up Breakker as the new champ afterwards, with a lot of barking and clearly excited fans in the background of the camera shot, as Breakker holds the I-C title high in the air.

Winner and NEW WWE Intercontinental Champion: Bron Breakker

WWE United States Championship

Logan Paul (c) vs. LA Knight

A very skinny Stephanie McMahon-Levesque is shown sitting ringside at WWE SummerSlam 2024 in Cleveland, OH., with the crowd giving her a big reaction.

Our third title bout in three matches is up next, as it’s time for the WWE United States Championship to be put up for grabs by Logan Paul, as he defends it against “The Mega Star” LA Knight next.

The elaborate pre-match video package for that one airs now. When it wraps up, the reigning and defending U.S. Champion is introduced first. Out comes Logan Paul, who is met by Cleveland music star Machine Gun Kelly.

Logan Paul and MGK head to the ring together and settle inside the squared circle. After that, we see LA Knight with Logan Paul’s PRIME hummer once again. Inside the big host venue for “The Biggest Party of the Summer,” out comes “The Mega Star” for his big title opportunity.

Paul immediately attacks him as he’s getting in the ring. They continue to brawl at ringside while still wearing their entrance attire. The match finally gets going in the ring and Knight takes over control of the offense. After a few more minutes, things slow down a bit.

We see Paul hit an absolutely insane springboard moonsault to the floor on Knight. His leg almost buckled under him on the landing. Yikes. Back in the ring, Paul decks Knight with a KO shot and covers him, but only gets two and looks shocked. Knight hits an insane top-rope brainbuster.

The action spills out to the floor again. Knight beats down Paul and has two of his friends yapping in his face over the barricade. Knight no-look yanks them both over it to the floor at ringside and stomps them both as fans chant “YEAH! YEAH!” Paul attacks him from behind.

MGK sneaks the brass knuckles to him. He KOs Knight with them. He drops them and heads to the ring apron for a buckshot lariat, but Knight counters and pins him for the win. We have a new WWE United States Champion, and he’s “The Mega Star.”

Winner and NEW WWE United States Champion: LA Knight

WWE Women’s Championship

Bayley (c) vs. Nia Jax

After a goofy-ass sponsored segment with Baron Corbin helping to shave Apollo Crews head, and Otis coming in with Akira Tozawa and Maxxine Dupri to grease up his big gross stomach, we shoot to the pre-match video package for our next match, which features yet another title on-the-line.

The WWE Women’s Championship is up next, as Bayley defends her title against 2024 WWE Queen of the Ring winner Nia Jax. “Queen” Nia comes out with her crown on to a bunch of boos. Bayley comes out to a huge pop and settles in the ring. The bell sounds and off we go.

We see some good back-and-forth action for several minutes, and then things start to pick up. Bayley takes Nia off the ropes for a huge power bomb for a close near fall. Bayley seemed to have things finished up and out came Tiffany Stratton to cash in her Money In The Bank briefcase.

When she goes to cash it in, however, she gets bumped and then Bayley hits a running kick to Nia. Nia recovers and takes Bayley out with two power bombs. She drags her lifeless body to the corner and hits two Annihlators for the pin fall victory.

We have a new WWE Women’s Champion. She and Stratton celebrate after and then Jax hugs some family members, including The Rock’s mom, at ringside.

Winner and NEW WWE Women’s Champion: Nia Jax

CM Punk vs. Drew McIntyre

A video package airs promoting WWE NXT moving from the USA Network to The CW starting on October 1. We then set the stage for our next match of the evening, which is the one the majority of fans tuning into tonight’s show are most looking forward to.

“The Best in the World” CM Punk has his first televised singles match in WWE in over a decade next, as he squares off against bitter-rival “The Scottish Warrior” Drew McIntyre, with Seth “Freakin'” Rollins serving as the special guest referee.

The pre-match video package airs to tell the story leading up to this one. When it wraps up, we return inside Cleveland Browns Stadium where we hear, “BURN IT DOWN!!” as “The Visionary” and “The Revolutionary” of WWE makes his way out.

Seth “Freakin'” Rollins comes to the ring in special referee attire that has to be seen to be believed. Very Seth Rollins-esque stuff, as you come to expect from the WWE veteran at this point in his legendary career. He settles in the ring to a big pop from the fans singing along with his music.

Thankfully, the wild zebra-colored gear Rollins wore to the ring was just his entrance attire. He takes it off and has a bedazzled sleeveless referee shirt and silly-ass shiny pants. The theme for Drew McIntyre hits and out comes “The Scottish Warrior.”

McIntyre and Rollins glare at each other for quite a bit and the camera closes in on this to soak up the moment. McIntyre is overheard telling Rollins all he has to do is ring the bell and count to three. The theme for CM Punk hits and out comes “The Best in the World” to a rock star reaction in the home of the Rock ‘N’ Roll Hall of Fame.

This one has “big fight feel” written all over it, and on a night with an insane boxing pay-per-view stacked mega-card, where Martin Bakole breaks through as a new Heavyweight star, Eminem puts on a concert and the pound-for-pound king of boxing takes a big challenge up in weight, as well as a stacked UFC card on ABC from Abu Dhabi, that’s saying a lot.

Punk and McIntyre are staring darts through each other. Punk takes his jacket off and throws it and it ends up around Rollins’ shoulders. Rollins semi-no-sells it, dramatically picking it up and throwing it out of the ring. He then ends up jawing with Punk. He jaws with McIntyre as well. Meanwhile, the crowd is chanting “CM Punk! CM Punk!” like crazy.

The bell sounds and Punk and McIntyre charge at each other, meeting in the middle and wildly trading strikes, ala the infamous Don Frye vs. Yoshihiro Akiyama fight from the old PRIDE FC days. The good old days. Punk gets McIntyre down and stomps away at him. McIntyre gets back up and does the same to Punk.

Punk takes McIntyre down and unloads on him with shots. McIntyre gets back up and shoves Punk and chops him. McIntyre goes to hit the ropes, but Punk follows him in and clotheslines him out to the floor. He runs off the ring apron and hits a flying clothesline on the floor.

Now we see CM Punk send McIntyre sailing over the ring barricade and into the timekeepers area. He follows him over and beats him up some more before launching him back over to the floor at ringside. He runs McIntyre face-first into the steel ring post, as we see Seth Rollins laying across the top-rope, Shawn Michaels heel style.

McIntyre takes back over control of the offense when the action spills out to the floor again. He hoists Punk up and swings him by his feet, slamming him face-first into the commentary desk over and over again. McIntyre continues to beat down Punk on the floor, as Rollins once again watches on without a car in the world, smiling and laughing at certain violent points in the action.

After some more back-and-forth action, we see McIntyre go to ringside and grabs a steel chair. Rollins looks at McIntyre, but he doesn’t take the chair away. McIntyre tells Rollins to let it happen. Rollins turns his back on this. McIntyre goes to hit Punk with the chair, but Rollins shows he has a conscience and takes the chair away. Rollins argues with McIntyre. McIntyre shoves him, so Rollins charges with the chair and nearly hits Punk before putting the brakes on.

Rollins throws the chair out of the ring. As he’s doing that, Punk has McIntyre rolled up. Rollins sees it too late, and McIntyre kicks out. Punk had him pinned for a while. McIntyre hits Punk with a swinging neckbreaker and kips up. McIntyre goes into his trunks and pulls out the bracelet with Punk’s wife and dog’s names on it. McIntyre puts it on and goes for a Claymore Kick, but Punk kicks him down. Punk then drops him with a swinging neckbreaker.

Punk gets to his feet and hits McIntyre with a running knee in the corner. Punk backs up and hits a second running knee to the face. Punk backs up and hits it a third time before hitting a clothesline. Punk heads to the top rope for a diving elbow drop. Punk covers for a near fall. Punk quickly transitions into an Anaconda Vice attempt. McIntyre fights it, but Punk eventually locks it in. As he applies the hold, Punk pulls his bracelet off McIntyre’s wrist.

Punk picks it up and turns into a Claymore Kick! McIntyre covers for a near fall. We see some more back-and-forth action and then Punk has Drew down and out and calls for the GTS. Rollins distracts Punk and Punk notices Rollins has his bracelet on. Punk decks McIntyre and approaches Rollins and doesn’t look happy. McIntyre attacks Punk from behind, sending him crashing into Rollins. With Rollins bumped and all of a sudden down and helpless from one shot like a wimpy referee and not a future WWE Hall of Famer, Punk recovers and hits the GTS on McIntyre.

He goes for the cover, but Rollins is still out and unable to make the count. When he finally does recover and begin to count, McIntyre kicks out. Punk yells at Rollins. Rollins reminds him about Rollins’ Rules. Punk yells that this isn’t about him. He hits Rollins with a GTS. McIntyre low-blows Punk and hit a Claymore. He wakes Rollins up and covers Punk. Rollins counts 1. Rollins counts 2. He looks hesitant, but ultimately counts three. McIntyre takes the bracelet back off Punk’s arm and puts it on his own. He stands on Punk’s chest with one foot and raises his hand in victory.

Winner: Drew McIntyre

WWE World Heavyweight Championship

Damian Priest (c) vs. GUNTHER

Backstage, we see Finn Balor catch up with Damian Priest. They talk about the Dominik Mysterio situation and how Priest wants to go this one alone, but that if he wants Balor, all he has to do is call for him. Priest thanks him, grabs his title belt and heads out to get ready.

The pre-match video package airs now to set the stage for our next match of the evening, which features the WWE World Heavyweight Championship on-the-line. When it wraps up, the theme for the 2024 WWE King of the Ring hits and out comes “The Ring General” GUNTHER. He settles in the ring.

Damian Priest’s entrance tune hits next and out comes what GUNTHER calls “Street Trash,” the reigning and defending WWE World Heavyweight Champion and as of right now, the leader of The Judgment Day. He heads to the ring alone as promised and settles inside for the pre-match ring introductions.

The bell sounds and off we go. GUNTHER and Damian Priest stare each other down. They trade chops early on and almost immediately GUNTHER’s chest is ripped open and bleeding. We see GUNTHER fight back and take over for what feels like forever. It seems like he’s got Priest dead to rights.

Finn Balor makes his way down to the ringside area. GUNTHER notices him and heads over and big boots him in the face through the ropes to knock him down. Priest recovers and saw what just happened and looks pissed and ready to defend his friend. He goes to work on GUNTHER as the crowd explodes.

Now we see Priest have GUNTHER finished off and in the weirdest situation ever, Priest purposely rolls GUNTHER closer to the ropes where Balor was at ringside to set up the finishing sequence. Balor throws GUNTHER’s leg on the ropes to screw Priest over.

Priest sees this on the replay and Balor does the slow turn evil facial expression for a close-up. Priest goes to rush at Balor to make him pay, but GUNTHER grabs Priest from behind and locks him in a sleeper hold. Priest fades. Balor gets close to the ring to see Priest go out, which brings Priest back to life.

He fights free and charges right back at Balor again. GUNTHER once more capitalizes and hits a big power bomb and another sleeper hold. GUNTHER wins. We have a brand new WWE World Heavyweight Champion, and his name is “The King General” GUNTHER.

Winner and NEW WWE World Heavyweight Champion: GUNTHER

Jelly Roll Helps Awesome Truth Take Out A-Town Down Under

Michael Cole and the commentary crew run through highlights of tonight’s matches and key moments thus far, focusing a lot of Dominik Mysterio screwing over Rhea Ripley and locking lips with Liv Morgan afterwards, and the continuation of the crumbling of The Judgment Day as we know it, with Finn Balor turning on Priest.

Back live, WWE SummerSlam 2024 host The Miz and his pal R-Truth are shown in the ring for a special attendance announcement. The Miz reveals that tonight’s show has broken the all-time American attendance record with 57,791 fans inside Cleveland Browns Stadium tonight.

As they go to wrap up, they are cut off by former tag-team champions A-Town Down Under. Austin Theory and Grayson Waller join them in the ring to taunt them and the city of Cleveland, as well as the artist who performed the theme songs for tonight’s show, Jelly Roll, who is shown in the crowd reacting.

R-Truth is confused and thinks he is talking to Ricky Martin and Robert Gibson, the Rock ‘N’ Roll Express. Obviously there is so much wrong with that. Anyways, Jelly Roll appears behind A-Town Down Under in the ring with a chair and helps Awesome Truth take them out and leave them laying.

Jelly Roll and Awesome Truth do John Cena’s “You Can’t See Me” five knuckle shuffle routine for an explosive pop.

WWE Universal Championship (Bloodline Rules)

Cody Rhodes (c) vs. Solo Sikoa

It’s main event time!

“The Biggest Party of the Summer” hits the final stretch, as we set the stage and prepare for our main event of the evening, as “The American Nightmare” Cody Rhodes defends his WWE Universal Championship against “The Tribal Chief” of The Bloodline 2.0, Solo Sikoa, in a Bloodline Rules match.

WWE Raw on SyFy is promoted for tomorrow night in Baltimore, MD., with the focus being on the in-ring debut of The Wyatt Sicks against Chad Gable and The Creed Brothers, as well as the fallout from tonight’s WWE SummerSlam. A commercial for WWE Bash In Berlin airs next for the show on August 31 in Germany.

Up next, the in-depth pre-match video package airs to tell the story leading up to tonight’s main event of the evening, the Bloodline Rules bout between Rhodes and Sikoa for the Universal title. When it wraps up, we return inside the show venue in Cleveland.

Solo Sikoa makes his way out first, by himself oddly enough, with “The Tribal Chief” boa around his neck. He looks ready for action and all business as he heads to the ring to a ton of boos from the record-setting Cleveland crowd. The leader of The Bloodline 2.0 settles inside the squared circle for what could be an interesting match, depending on who may or may not show up at the end.

All the way from his “American Nightmare” tour bus, where he walks his dog on a leash into the building with him, is the reigning and defending WWE Universal Champion Cody Rhodes. He gets the Goodfellas single-camera kitchen scene shot of the evening. The long single camera shot follows him all throughout the backstage area, where he shakes hands with and hugs Arn Anderson, who gives him a classic Arn pep talk.

He settles inside and the final ring introductions are given before the bell sounds to get this one started. Things start off competitive, with Cody getting to shine coming out of the gate. It isn’t long, however, before Solo takes over and much like GUNTHER vs. Damian Priest, we see the champion on the defensive and fighting from underneath throughout the majority of the contest.

As soon as Cody finally starts to shift the offensive momentum into his favor several minutes into the bout, we see the Bloodline Rules play a factor, as Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa hit the ring and blatantly attack Cody in front of the referee with double-team action. Solo goes for the immediate follow-up cover, but Cody kicks out.

They go to continue the numbers game beat down until out of nowhere, Kevin Owens’ theme hits and “The Prize Fighter” runs down to the ring to a huge crowd reaction from the Cleveland fans. Owens ends up getting gobbled up as well, which leads us to our second in-match surprise, the theme for Randy Orton hits and “The Viper” heads to the ring.

This is almost identical to the last Bloodline Rules Universal title match on a big four PLE. That’s not necessarily a good thing, either. Cody goes for the follow-up cover after Solo is laid out, but he gets a shoulder up. Orton and Owens brawl with Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa through the crowd out of the picture. Cody grabs the top half of the ring steps and brings them into the ring.

When he goes to use them, however, Solo charges at him and spears him for a close two-count. Solo sets the steps in the corner with the steps part facing out. He sits Cody up against them and charges across the ring for a hip attack, but Cody moves and Solo violently crashes into the steps. Cody hits a Cross-Rhodes. And another. He goes for the third, but Jacob Fatu hits the ring out of nowhere and lays Cody out.

Fatu decks Cody and then hits a big top-rope moonsault. He takes him out to the floor and clears off the commentary desk. He super kicks Cody onto the top of the table and heads back to the top-rope again. He leaps off with a big splash that puts Cody through the table. Solo goes to pick the bones, bringing Cody into the ring and hitting a top-rope splash of his own for a close two-count. Cody is the modern day Super Cena, folks.

Solo stands over Cody and signals for the Samoan Spike. Cody springs to life out of nowhere and super kicks him, leaps to the top rope in a single bounce (see, Super Cody like Super Cena, or Superman, whatever). The theme for Roman Reigns hits out of nowhere and the crowd goes absolutely insane inside the jam-packed record sold out crowd inside Cleveland Browns Stadium. The real “Tribal Chief” emerges and the crowd roar grows.

Michael Cole pulls a Bobby Heenan and questions who Roman Reigns is coming down to attack. Corey Graves plays the Dusty Rhodes role, pretending it’s a dumb question and saying of course he’s coming for revenge on Cody, the guy who beat him and took his title the last time we saw him. Of course, Reigns, the Hulk Hogan in this scenario, hits the ring.

He attacks the other guy, Solo Sikoa, to the “shock” of ..well, Michael Cole. And to an equal extent, Cody himself. Cody, still shocked at what he just saw, finishes Solo off for the win to retain. Reigns keeps looking back at the ring as he walks off, and Cody keeps looking back out at Roman as well. Your winner and still WWE Universal Champion, “The American Nightmare” Cody Rhodes. That’s how WWE SummerSlam 2024 goes off the air. Thanks for joining us!

Winner and STILL WWE Universal Champion: Cody Rhodes

WWE Summer Slam: Cody Rhodes vs Solo Sikoa WWE Championship match results.,https://411mania.com/wrestling/join-411s-live-wwe-summerslam-2024-coverage/,"Keep Refreshing For The Latest Results

Hello everyone and welcome to 411mania’s LIVE coverage of WWE SummerSlam. I’m Robert Winfree and I’ll be your host for the evening. As the WWE machine keeps on rolling we’ve got a decent little PPV card tonight. There are two big questions I’m going to ask you all, is it more likely that Roman Reigns returns tonight or that Judgement Day really start blowing up? Roman’s return is inevitable but could be held off until closer to Survivor Series because we all know the two Bloodline versions are going to meet in War Games, while Judgement Day is very close to just running it’s course and there’s a chance tonight to really start that process of ending it instead of letting it peter out. To that end there’s a couple of title matches involving members of that group, World Heavyweight Champion Damien Priest defends that belt against Gunther and Rhea Ripley tries to reclaim the World Women’s title from Liv Morgan. Priest losing to Gunther is definitely on the table because Gunther is awesome, while the potential for Soiled Dominick Mysterio turning on Rhea kicking off the real destruction of the group shouldn’t be ignored either. We’ve also got the US title on the line between Logan Paul and LA Knight, a heated feud between Drew McIntyre and CM Punk to maybe wrap up and evolve into something involving Seth Rollins, Nia Jax trying to win the women’s title from Bayley, and a surefire mess of a match when Cody Rhodes defends the WWE title against Solo Sikoa in a Bloodline Rules bout. Cody’s lost his friends and allies over the last few weeks so we’ll have to see if anyone comes to his aid against this new Bloodline version, really you only have to deal with Jacob Fatu because the others are forgettable but he’s more than a handful to try and neutralize. Well that’s the preamble, let’s get to the action.

Michael Cole, Pat McAfee, and Cory Graves are calling the action for us as we’re in Cleveland, Ohio, USA.

Triple H comes out first and he’s got a mic, he hangs out at the top of the ramp and asks if the crowd is ready. Seems like they are, so for the thousands in attendance and millions watching around the world he welcomes us to SummerSlam.

The Miz is hosting, for some reason, and tries to get the show going now that we’ve had a live music number from Jelly Roll.

In the back Rhea Ripley walks, finds Dominik Mysterio and he accompanies her out to the ring. Yeah, he’s stabbing her in the back tonight.

Match #1 – Women’s World Title Match: (c) Liv Morgan vs. Rhea Ripley w/ Dominik Mysterio

Liv bails early and looks to take a powder. Ripley chases Liv around for a bit but can’t quite catch her. In fact these two don’t make contact until the 2 minute mark. Ripley lays in clotheslines early including a ripcord clothesline but one Rainmaker never ends a real match. Half nelson suplex from Ripley and Liv rolls out of the ring. Ripley licks Dom in front of Liv then stomps on her and lays in strikes. Liv gets bounced off of the ring steps a few times. Back into the ring now Ripley lays in a headbutt, looks for Riptide and sort of hits it into the corner. Another Riptide but this time Liv escapes it and hides in a corner. Liv avoids a charge and Ripley goes shoulder first into the corner, and Liv tries to post Ripley but they mess that up and Ripley complains that her shoulder is out. OK, that’s probably gimmicked but they still botched the post spot. Ripley rolls out of the ring but Liv kicks her into the ring steps. There’s definitely something odd looking about Ripley’s shoulder but I don’t think it’s a legit injury. Back in the ring Liv begins working over Ripley’s right arm.

Split chants from the crowd as Liv starts again going for the arm of Ripley. More kicks to the arm from Liv then a Codebreaker to the bad arm. Ripley with a boot to drop Liv and put both women down. Ripley rolls out of the ring and hangs out with Dom, Dom pushes Ripley out of the way when Liv dives and she wipes out Dom. Some jaw jacking now, then Ripley rams her shoulder into the announce table to reset her shoulder and she charges at Liv in the ring. Ripley with some striking based offense including a dropkick. Ripley wants a Riptide but Liv counters into a DDT for a 2 count. They trade kicks then Ripley yanks Liv off the top rope and locks in the Prism Lock but her right arm is still compromised so Liv can roll through and sends Ripley back into the corner shoulder first. Crucifix Driver from Liv gets 2 then into an armbar, Ripley fights to keep her arm from extending and ultimately hoists Liv up then slams her way free for a 2 count.

Headbutt from Liv to try and fight back, then she snaps Ripley’s arm over the middle rope. Liv heads over to get a chair, she brings it into the ring as Ripley resets her shoulder again. Ripley kicks Liv down before she can use the chair, hits a Riptide but doesn’t go for a cover. Ripley reaches for the chair, she goes to hit Liv with it but Dom yanks the chair away from her. Dom tells her to just win the title and Liv then kicks Ripley into Dom then hits ObLIVion for a near fall. Dom slides the chair into the ring again and distracts the ref, Liv then spikes Ripley with ObLIVion onto the chair and pins to retain the title.

OFFICIAL RESULT: Liv Morgan retained the title in 15:53

Rating: 3 stars

Thoughts: Ripley still looked strong while Liv held her own with guile and a bit of luck. The story of Ripley dealing with a shoulder injury made a lot of Liv’s offense make sense.

Post match Dom helps Liv to her feet and kisses her then leaves with the champion as Ripley looks to have a mild breakdown in the ring.

In the back we see Sami Zayn warming up, saying goodbye to the Intercontinental Title.

In the back we find Judgement Day and Priest storms in looking for Dom. Finn Balor calms things down and says he, JD, and Carlito will go find Dom so Priest can focus on Gunther. Priest threatens to murder Dom.

Back to the ring, here comes Bron Breakker.

Match #2 – Intercontinental Title Match: (c) Sami Zayn vs. Bron Breakker

Sami avoids a Spear and Bron posts himself right off the bat. Sami with a dive to the outside and he’s getting pumped up. Back in the ring Sami heads up top but misses a flying nothing and Bron catches him with a clothesline. Sami tries a Helluva Kick but Bron evades that one and tries a military press but his shoulder is messed up, because two of those in a row is a thing. Clothesline from Bron and he starts laying in some corner offense. Sami catches Bron and tries an exploder suplex but Bron blocks it and puts Sami on the top rope, he climbs up there with Sami and eventually hits a nice avalanche Frankensteiner for a 2 count. Some strikes from Bron and he tells Sami to give up. Sami clearly wont do that and lays in some slaps then drops Bron with a clothesline. Bron blocks a Blue Thunder Bomb then sort of flips out of it, he almost spiked himself but then tries the Steiner Bulldog only to get countered with a Blue Thunder Bomb from Sami for a 2 count. Jumping knee from Bron drops Sami, but then Sami catches Bron with the Exploder suplex into the corner. Sami wants the Helluva Kick but Bron cuts him in half with a Spear. Bron can’t cover because of the shoulder but he pulls the straps down, hits the ropes and hits another Spear to get the win.

OFFICIAL RESULT: Bron Breakker won the title in 5:42

Rating: 2.5 stars

Thoughts: I’m not sure if it was just the 5 minute time or what but this just didn’t really click for me. For a 5 minute match it was fine but never really got into a higher gear.

Apparently there’s been a Slim Jim vote going on for a savage moment of the summer. It goes to Drew laying out a bloody CM Punk off camera on Smackdown then stealing his bracelet. OK then.

Stephanie McMahon is in the crowd, got a decent pop but nothing great.

Logan Paul comes out and Machine Gun Kelly is there to accompany him. LA Knight is in the back and has arrived in the Prime truck, and he breaks out the windows before walking towards the ring while talking. He’s coming for the US title just like he told you. Knight gets a big pop from the crowd as his music hits.

They start brawling on the floor before the bell rings. Logan gets launched into the barricade then Knight tosses him into the Prime cart, and rams the cart into Logan for good measure. Logan spits Prime into Knight’s face and rams him into the barricade. Logan clears off the announcers table but Knight starts bouncing him off of the table then whacks Logan with a Prime bottle. They fight onto the table and Knight with a Torture Rack into a neckbreaker on the table which does not give. They get in the ring and finally we start.

Match #3 – US Title Match: (c) Logan Paul w/ Machine Gun Kelly vs. LA Knight

Knight unloads on Logan with strikes in the corner. Logan lands a kick but runs into a Manhattan Drop then Knight with a discus clothesline for a 2 count.

Mounted punches from Logan then he plays with the crowd and does a Hogan pose then lands a big boot and a split leg drop for a 2 count. They start shoving then trade punches from their knees. Punches go back and forth as they stand then Knight lays in a series of jabs only to get caught with a gutwrench suplex from Logan.

Knight looks for that Torture Rack neckbreaker but Logan fights free and sends Knight to the apron then hits a springboard clothesline. Logan sets for a dive, and hits a springboard moonsault off the top rope onto Knight and both men are down on the floor. Back in the ring Logan sets for the Power of the Punch, but Knight avoids it and tries Blunt Force Trauma but Logan counters into a backslide for 2, then Logan hits the Power of the Punch but only a near fall. Now Logan goes up top, misses a Frog Splash then Knight avoids a punch, but Logan grabs the ropes to avoid a Blunt Force Trauma. Logan back up top, but Knight runs and jumps up there with him to hit an avalanche Brainbuster for only a near fall. Not sure why Logan didn’t get all the way over on that one, that’s usually a superplex but that one was much more like a brainbuster. Logan rolls out of the ring then rakes the eyes of Knight and asks for the brass knux. Knight with a diving baseball slide through the ropes then staggers over to Logan’s goons. Knight yanks those two goofs over and stomps on them for a bit before Logan comes back over and runs Knight into the ring post. Logan still wants the knux, MGK gives him some from a necklace he was wearing. Cheap shot with the knux from Logan, then a Buckshot Lariat but Knight avoids it and hits Blunt Force Trauma to win.

OFFICIAL RESULT: LA Knight won the title in 12:03, toss in another couple of minutes for the pre-match stuff if you’d like

Rating: 3.5 stars

Thoughts: Logan’s athleticism is still pretty ridiculous. They told a solid story of Knight being resilient and hip to almost all of Logan’s tricks by this point.

Logan is a sad panda after that and Knight celebrates with the belt.

In the back Apollo Crews is getting his head shaved and Baron Corbin joins in. Otis, Maxxine, and Akira Tozawa show up and they all shill merchandise. I’m not sure this was a worthwhile use of time.

Nia Jax heads to the ring.

Match #4 – WWE Women’s Title Match: (c) Bayley vs. Nia Jax

Bayley with punches right away then a slap. Jax doesn’t like that and sends Bayley to the apron but Bayley comes back in and starts attacking the arm of Jax. Lots of arm work tonight. Jax with a Doctor Bomb attempt but Bayley counters into a jawbreaker only to run into a Samoan Drop. Now Jax starts tossing Bayley around then hits a scoop slam. Elbow drop from Jax then she spanks Bayley before sitting on her in the ropes. Bayley tries to fight back but Jax clubs her down in the corner and lands a Stink Face. Cobra Clutch from Jax for a rest hold, Baley fights free and hits a back suplex to put both of them down. Jax with a Stun Gun to Bayley but Bayley then hits the ropes and lands a jumping elbow and both women are down.

Bayley off the steps and takes down Jax and lands some punches. Back in the ring Bayley heads up top but Jax rattles the ropes and crotches Bayley up there. Jax then hits a stalling suplex, but Bayley tries to counter into a guillotine choke but Jax powers through and drops Bayley with a gordbuster. Rolling senton then a leg drop from Jax all results in a 2 count. Jax goes up top, that’s an odd decision, but off the second rope she tries a leg drop only for Bayley to roll away. Bayley to Belly suplex from Bayley gets a 2 count. Jax blocks the Rose Plant, Bayley then gets caught with an ST-Joe out of the corner. Jax tries the Annihilator and hits it but only a near fall and Jax is in disbelief. Some slams from Jax as she’s pissed, then she lands a series of headbutts. Jax with some trash talk but misses a corner charge and posts herself then rolls to the floor. Bayley with a suicide dive but Jax catches her and hits a Samoan Drop on the floor.

Back in the ring Jax takes her sweet time but hits a corner splash then a hip attack. Jax wants another Annihilator but Bayley recovers and attacks her on the ropes then hits a falling powerbomb. Bayley heads up top now for an elbow drop which connects but only a 2 count on the cover. Tiffany Stratton’s music hits and she runs down with a ref and her briefcase. Bayley attacks Tiffany to avoid the cash in, then rolls up Jax for 2. Knee from Bayley, but she runs into a pop up powerbomb. Jax with a Jackknife powerbomb then an Annihilator, and a second for good measure to get the pin.

OFFICIAL RESULT: Nia Jax won the title in 12:31

Rating: 3 stars

Thoughts: The closing stretch pulled this across the three star line, this was just slow and plodding for most of the run time. Bayley had a good title win at Mania but her actual title run was kind of just meh, losing here isn’t the worst thing for her.

Jax and Tiffany celebrate surname supremacy over the mono named wrestlers.

Seth Rollins heads to the ring as our guest referee.

Match #5 – Special Guest Referee Seth Rollins: Drew McIntyre vs. CM Punk

Seth takes his sweet time ringing the bell, and Drew and Punk start throwing hands right away with Punk getting the better of things. Seth pulls Punk out of corner stomps after a 5 count. Now Drew with corner offense on Punk and unloads with stomps but again Seth counts and the pulls Drew away from Punk. Boot from Punk then a diving clothesline and mounted punches. Cross chop from Drew then a regular chop and a headbutt. Punk clotheslines Drew out of the ring then heads to the apron and jumps at Drew. Drew gets bounced into the ring post and Punk lands more punches before sending Drew into the time keeper’s area. They continue brawling on the floor, Seth no longer counting. Punk shoves Drew into the ring post and the crowd want tables. Punk slams Drew’s head into the ring steps a few times, Seth conveniently tying his shoes and not seeing anything. Drew sweeps Punk’s legs on the apron then picks him up and swing him into the announcers table a couple of times. Seth meanders onto the apron to watch things. Drew with a catapult to Drew under the ring, this amuses Seth who is in fact a spotlight hog.

They head back into the ring and Drew chops Punk down. Snap suplex from Drew, Seth doesn’t even get down for a count before Punk kicks out and Seth eggs Drew on to homicide. Drew stomps on Punk’s head and arm a bit then Punk fights back with punches only to get chopped down again. Belly to belly throw from Drew but again Seth doesn’t even get down for a count. They trade slaps now, Punk with a flurry of strikes then tries a knee in the corner but Drew counters with a powerbomb but only a 1 count. Drew hauls Punk up for a sit out powerbomb and a 2 count, a more appropriate count from Seth that time. Drew heads out of the ring to get a chair, Seth sees it and considers but Drew tells him to turn around and let him do this. Seth thinks about it and turns around but then takes the chair from Drew.

Punk with a swinging neckbreaker then the high knee in the corner, and another one then a third for good measure. Clothesline from Punk then he goes up top for an elbow drop which connects, but the cover only gets 2.

Punk tries an Anaconda Vice, it’s in then Punk releases it to take his bracelet back. That means Drew can come at Punk and hit a Claymore but only a near fall, fair count from Seth for what it’s worth. Drew is pissed and tries a Future Shock DDT but Punk escapes and Drew posts himself trying to chase him down. Punk wants Go To Sleep, but sees that Seth has put on the bracelet and drops Drew to argue with Seth. Seth just pulled it off the mat, but he and Punk bicker then Drew shoves Punk into Seth and Seth takes the ref bump. Punk hits Go To Sleep but no ref to make the count, Seth does get in and by then Drew can kick at 2. Now Punk complains about the count, the count was fair again to my eye, and now Punk and Seth bicker. Seth tells Punk they don’t want or need him here, he’s being fair here and tells him to focus on Drew not get distracted. Punk then picks up Seth for a Go To Sleep which connects and takes the bracelet back. Drew then takes Punk to dick kick city, kills him with a Claymore and covers Punk but Seth is slow to count though when he does get over there it’s a 3 count.

OFFICIAL RESULT: Drew McIntyre won in 17:00

Rating: 4 stars

Thoughts: I debated between 3.5 and 4 here, the drama here stretched this out more than I would have preferred, but Drew and Punk sold this with the hatred it deserved and I’d like to see this one again under circumstances more favorable to just wrestling. Maybe a little generous but I’ll let this one get to 4 stars.

Post match Drew takes the bracelet again, puts it on his wrist and kisses it then stands on Punk and poses.

In the back Balor couldn’t find Dom, Priest apologizes for how he acted before and Balor is sorry too. Judgement Day comes first, and he says if Priest decides he wants him out there just say the word.

Match #6 – World Heavyweight Title Match: (c) Damian Priest vs. Gunther

They start trading strikes right away then Priest tries South of Heaven but Gunther fights free with a chop and uppercut. Elevated Flatliner from Priest and Gunther rolls out of the ring to recover. Priest follows and jumps off the steps to land a clubbing blow. Gunther shoves Priest into the ring post then hits a back suplex onto the apron. Gunther shoves Priest into the edge of the ring then lands a chop. Both men head back into the ring and Gunther begins targeting the lower back of Priest with a scoop slam. Priest fights back with punches then he avoids a boot and boxes the ears of Gunther, but Gunther avoids a suplex and chops the lungs out of Priest then hits a butterfly suplex for a 1 count. They trade strikes again with Gunther landing a boot then he climbs up top for a Splash but Priest hits him on the top rope.

Gamen giri from Priest stuns Gunther and Priest climbs up with Gunther for an avalanche hurricanrana then a Falcon Arrow for a 2 count.

Priest begins laying in kicks to the chest and leg. Gunther fights back with a chop, they start trading strikes again and they’re just chopping the heck out of each other and Priest fires up with a flurry of chops then a head kick. Gunther’s chest is bleeding now, and he starts chopping away at Priest again but Priest catches one and resumes landing kicks. Another chop from Gunther, then Priest with a superkick. Priest misses a corner splash and Gunther with a shotgun dropkick then a folding powerbomb for a 2 count. Gunther realizes he’s bleeding and gets a little fired up, he and Priest start trading strikes this time it’s Gunther who wins and tries a powerbomb but Priest flips free and hits a tornado kick then South of Heaven for a 2 count. Priest wants the Razor’s Edge, but Gunther blocks that and they start trading strikes again before Gunther grabs a Sleeper but Priest slings him free only for Gunther to catch a kick and hit a leg capture suplex. Gunther with a couple of lariats but only a near fall off of that flurry of offense. I do really like Gunther’s lariat, one of the better ones going right now.

They trash talk a bit then Gunther boots Priest in the face. Priest shakes it off and calls on for more from Gunther, who obliges with a chop. Another chop from Gunther, and Finn Balor has joined this at ringside. Gunther chops away at Priest again but Balor is rallying Priest as Gunther with another sickening chop. Priest fires up with strikes before Gunther boots him down again. Gunther wipes his own blood into his hair, he cares not for blood. More stomps to Priest then a punt to the ribs. Gunther talks to Balor for a bit then kicks him in the head just because he can. That pisses Priest off and Priest pulls down the straps as he stands then clotheslines the snot out of Gunther. Another clothesline from Priest, then a Razor’s Edge connects. Priest with South of Heaven again, but Gunther rolls to the ropes and Balor makes sure Gunther’s boot is on the ropes, he was close enough anyway for that to be the case. Well Priest saw the replay on the big screen and looks over at Balor, who slowly turns to face him with an evil look on his face. Priest gets caught by Gunther with a Sleeper. The Sleeper is in and Priest fades while staring at the malicious face of Balor, Priest is nearly out but he rallies into a pin for 2. Priest attacks Balor but Gunther grabs him and hits a powerbomb then another Sleeper Hold and this time Priest goes out.

OFFICIAL RESULT: Gunther won the title in 16:39

Rating: 4 stars

Thoughts: Unsurprisingly great, Gunther is one of the very best in the world between the ropes and Priest has grown to be more than capable of holding his own. They told a good story of Gunther trying to out physical Priest, Priest rallying with fire and strikes before Balor made the difference. Best match of the night, if I gave quarter stars this would have earned one.

Gunther gets a kiss from his wife who’s ringside before celebrating.

Well it’s main event time, and we had Dom turn and Judgement Day implode so do we think Roman actually returns to cap it off?

Miz and R-Truth are in the ring now, Miz decides to waste time by playing with the crowd. Truth asks how many people are in here? Miz knows, a record for SummerSlam of 57,791. Truth plays with the crowd, but here’s Austin Theory and Grayson Waller to make everything worse. They make fun of Miz as host, Waller and Theory then insult the Cleveland Browns for cheap heat. Why are we doing this again? This is a waste of time. Jelly Roll gets brought up and they make fun of music. Truth is amused by this and brings up the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and calls Theory and Waller the Rock and Roll Express, Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson while Jelly gets in the ring with a chair. Jelly gets to hit both of them with his chair and Truth sets up Jelly to hit a chokeslam on Theory with one hand. Bless Theory for making that look good. Jelly then wants the 5 Knuckle Shuffle, Truth and Miz join in and 15 knuckles hit Theory in the face. Well the crowd liked that but this was a time waster that we didn’t need.

Alright, main event time. Solo Sikoa comes out by himself but we all know things wont stay that way very long. We see Cody Rhodes in his trailer, he walks through the back and brings his dog Pharaoh with him for a bit. There’s a series of black SUVs he walks by, very similar to those that Roman favors when he travels. Cody finds Arn Anderson and hugs him, Arn is proud of him and says he’s in a really tough spot tonight. Know that Solo has backup, but Arn still has some influence and says Cody still has friends on the way. Well passing Cody the Glock would have been more helpful but that was heartwarming. Cody leaves his dog with a PA and gets his fancy jacket then heads to the ring.

Match #7 – Bloodline Rules Undisputed WWE Title Match: (c) Cody Rhodes vs. Solo Sikoa

Our longest break between matches here, 28 minutes and change. Cody plays with the crowd just a bit then ties up with Solo, he grabs a side headlock then hits a shoulder block but can’t drop Solo. Solo then hits a shoulder block to drop Cody. “We want Roman” chant already. Cody avoids an attack, then they tie up again with Cody grabbing a side headlock and kicks Solo but Solo blocks the drop down punch. Solo is well prepared it seems, at least for the usual Cody stuff. Cody eats a back elbow but then avoids a hip attack by rolling out of the ring. Solo allows Cody to recover, he feels incredibly confident. Cody gets into the ring and Solo kicks him then starts laying in headbutts and chops. Cody is willing to chop with Solo though and they trade some strikes but that favors Solo. Next Cody skins the cat then low bridges a charging Solo and Disaster kicks him to the floor then follows with a suicide dive. Cody tries another suicide dive but Solo intercepts him with a right hand then bounces Cody into the ring steps. They head back into the ring and Cody lands some punches then Solo avoids a snap powerslam and lands a jumping kick for a 2 count. Again Solo is ready for the usual Cody spots.

Solo hits a Samoan Drop. Solo with another Samoan Drop for a 2 count. Cody avoids a Samoan Spike and kicks the arm of Solo then hits a Cody Cutter. Cody clotheslines Solo out of the ring then follows him out there. Some ringside brawling from Cody as he tosses Solo around then they head back into the ring. Cody up top, misses a flying nothing but hits the drop down right hand. Jabs from Cody then the Bionic Elbow but when he tries a Disaster Kick Solo counters with a sit out powerbomb for a 2 count. Headbutt from Solo and he lays in some punches in the corner to set up a hip attack which connects. Solo says the title is his and demands the crowd acknowledge him, they mostly ignore him. Cody tries a Pedigree but Solo blocks so Cody with a School Boy for 2 but Solo then hits the Spinning Solo for a near fall. No one is biting on these near falls, we’re only 10 minutes in and we all know how many shenanigans are about to start happening in then ear future.

Nerve hold from Solo, Cody fights free with punches but runs into another Samoan Drop because Solo’s move set isn’t exactly deep. Solo puts Cody in the tree of woe then hits a running headbutt to the inverted Cody. The crowd is just kind of apathetic to this portion of the match, Solo hits another running headbutt but Cody wont give up. Solo tries a third but misses as Cody sits up, Cody then hits a moonsault, well sort of a moonsault, and both men are down. Commentary accurately says that was a Terry Funk style moonsault. Cody with punches then runs into a Black Hole Slam for another 2 count. Solo heads up top but takes too long, Cody meets him up there with punches but Solo headbutts him down then Cody jumps back up for a superplex and again both men are down.

They start trading punches on their knees as they fight up to a vertical base, the crowd is sort of waking up now that we’re past the 15 minute mark. Cody with a flurry of strikes but a Cody Cutter is countered and Solo wants Cross Rhodes but Cody counters into Cross Rhodes. Naturally that means Tama Tonga and botch machine Tonga Loa are here to attack Cody. Cody takes some tandem offense as the crowd wants Jey Uso to show up. They drag Solo into a cover for a 2 count that again no one was biting on. Kevin Owens is here though, he heads to the ring and begins laying into Tonga and Loa, a superkick to Solo for good measure. Owens takes down Tama then attacks Loa. The odds do catch up to Owens eventually but Randy Orton shows up as well. Randy’s run to the ring is kind of hilarious but he’s all business and slams Tama into a barricade. RKO to Loa, then Tama takes a Stunner. Solo gets a snap powerslam from Randy then a Swanton Bomb from Owens. Cody with Cross Rhodes but Solo kicks at 2 very weakly. Again, not many biting because we haven’t seen the real star of the Bloodline yet. Randy and Owens fight the Guerillas of Destiny to the back leaving Cody and Solo alone for the moment. Cody heads out of the ring and gets the ring steps then throws them into the ring. Cody whacks Solo with the steps once, and tells Solo to go down but he wont so Cody hits him again. Now Cody charges but Solo explodes with a Spear for a near fall.

Solo doesn’t know what more he can do, so he sets up the stairs in the corner then wants to hip attack Cody against them but Cody evades and Solo takes the bump. Cody with Cross Rhodes, he holds on for a second on which connects then goes for a third but he’s Jacob Fatu with a Whisper in the Wind. The Samoan Werewolf and real star of the new Bloodline is here and hits a double jump moonsault on Cody. Fatu drags Solo onto Cody but Cody kicks at 2. Solo with some direction to Fatu, he wants more violence and Fatu knocks Cody out of the ring then superkicks him. Fatu clears off the announce table and sets Cody on it, then Fatu goes up top and wants to Splash Cody through the table and connects. Fatu immediately begins selling his right ankle, hopefully he didn’t get hurt but he looks legitimately pissed and yells at Solo to finish it. Back in the ring Solo with a Splash for another near fall.

Replay on that splash shows the Fatu caught his ankle on the edge of the table, that might be legit but hopefully it’s just temporary. Cody with a superkick then a top rope Cody Cutter and everyone’s down. Roman’s music hits and the place goes NUTS, slightly new intro to it too. And the Head of the Table is in fact here, to a heroes welcome as he walks to the ring. Of course the question is “who’s side is he on?” Roman stares daggers at the ring and charges into it then wipes out Solo with a Superman Punch. Spear to Solo as well and this place loses it’s mind. Roman stares down the sitting Cody but just leaves, then pauses on the entrance ramp to watch as Cody hits another Cross Rhodes and gets the pin.

OFFICIAL RESULT: Cody Rhodes retained the title in 29:15

Rating: 4 stars

Thoughts: Overbooked as expected, and frankly a little overlong with the crowd not really caring about a large chunk of the match because they were more focused on who was coming out of the entrance area. There’s also the question about how injured Jacob Fatu might be, because I can’t believe he was originally written to not interact with Roman at all. But conquering hero Roman is going to be a heck of a thing to see now that everyone loves him.

Cody and Roman can’t stop looking at each other as Cody celebrates, while Solo and Fatu lose their minds with Solo yelling that Roman will never come back from this. Roman heads to the back after pointing to his OTC shirt, because he’s the Only Tribal Chief, and Cody celebrates as we end the show."

WWE Summer Slam: Cody Rhodes vs Solo Sikoa WWE Championship match results.,https://www.pinkvilla.com/sports/is-jacob-fatu-actually-injured-after-summerslam-2024-announcer-table-splash-on-cody-rhodes-find-out-1335470,"The Biggest Party of the Summer ended with a banger when former WWE Undisputed Champion Roman Reigns returned to WWE television after losing his championship to The American Nightmare, Cody Rhodes, at the WrestleMania 40 PLE.

Roman Reigns made his return in the ending sequence of Solo Sikoa vs. Cody Rhodes’s WWE Undisputed Championship match. Solo Sikoa almost won the match after his enforcer, The Samoan Werewolf Jacob Fatu, jumped from the top rope onto Cody Rhodes on the announcer's table.

The spot was pretty wild, and Jacob Fatu looked in extreme pain. It looked like the splash went wrong; his knee connected to the concrete awkwardly, and Jacob Fatu could not even move; he just sat at ringside holding his leg. Fans were legitimately worried about Jacob’s health.

During the post-SummerSlam 2024 press conference, Triple H was asked if talents competing on the card are safe. Triple H gave an update on Jacob Fatu and even revealed that Logan Paul was also hurt during his match.

Triple H said, “Unfortunately, (Jacob Fatu) got a little bit banged up in that last match. The only two real Logan's (Paul) a little banged up, as he should be, and Jacob's a little banged up. I'll see where that nets out here in a little bit. Hopefully, nothing serious, but it was bugging him a little bit, the leg, so we'll see where he is.""

There are still no updates on Jacob Fatu or Logan Paul. Are they seriously hurt or not? Logan Paul’s injury does not seem severe, but the way Jacob Fatu wasn’t able to move his body suggests he could be seriously injured.

In the main event, The American Nightmare, Cody Rhodes and Solo Sikoa were all set to lock horns in the ‘Bloodline Stipulation’ match. WWE booked the match pretty well from the start when Cody Rhodes walked all through his vanity with his dog. Finally, WWE legend Arn Anderson gave some advice to Cody Rhodes before the match.

The match between self-proclaimed Tribal Chief Solo Sikoa and Cody Rhodes was a whooping one with close falls, and it almost looked like the match had come to an end. At one point in the match, the Tonga brothers launched a brutal onslaught on Cody Rhodes, and just like at WrestleMania XL, Cody Rhodes had some backup of his own, and Kevin and Randy made a save.

In the final moments of the match, Jacob Fatu attacked Cody Rhodes and splashed him through the table. Taking advantage of the attack, Solo Sikoa almost pinned Cody Rhodes, and music echoed throughout the arena. The whole crowd went wild when they saw Roman Reigns back. The Tribal Chief attacked Solo Sikoa, allowing Cody Rhodes to win Solo and retain the championship.

The t-shirt of Roman Reigns had “OTC’ written on it at the end. Roman Reigns even pointed it out on his shirt, claiming he is the OTC. WWE fanatics are now wondering what ‘OTC stands for. The OTC word from Roman Reigns stands for “Orginal Tribal Chief” or “Only Tribal Chief”. WWE’s merchandise sales are definitely going to go off the charts!

The rivalry between Roman Reigns and Solo Sikoa is going be a major focus point of the whole WWE as Solo and Roman Reigns will lock horns for the title of “The Tribal Chief”. WWE fanatics are going to see endless twist-and-turn reunions, betrayals and much more.

From start to finish this match has a very electric crowd. At times even giving 50/50 split moments of chants for Liv and Mami. The dynamic between Liv and Rhea is well thought out as Liv attempts to avoid contact. Rhea has to fake Liv out to get Liv stuck in the ring. While Rhea dominates Liv in her parts of the match, Liv gets control and continues to further damage Rhea’s shoulder. Even having moments of her shoulder potentially be out of place and Rhea having to put it back in. While Rhea does wonders to make every part of it look real, it tells a story. Liv is able to dominate when Rhea is clearly injured in the moment.

Dominik tries to aid Rhea by stopping Rhea’s emotions to get the better of her with the chair. After Liv hit an Oblivion and Rhea kicked out, Dominik slides the chair into the ring. The ref is distracted as Liv gets a second Oblivion, this time spiking Rhea on the chair. Liv defeats Rhea before Dominik helped her up and kissed her passionately. Rhea, a broken mess in the ring, visibly heartbroken and crying. Liv and Dom leaving to the back.

Results: Liv Morgan by Pinfall via Oblivion On A Chair

While this goes shorter than it legitimately felt, its a full on sprint. From Breakker having to sell his shoulder worked. Sami Zayn was able to avoid the storm of Bron. Breakker got his tremendous frankensteiner. Sami countered a bulldog into a blue thunder bomb. Its a near 6 minute sprint that felt much longer. Breakker has to sell his shoulder from start to finish and ultimately it takes two spears to put away Sami Zayn. One rough spot with a landing but the system explains itself.

Welcome to heat, because Logan Paul is the hometown villain. The only people cheering Logan were his posse. This match has a pre match brawl before the bell rang. Seeing the torture rack neckbreaker on the announce table looked stiff in every way and added to it. These too dislike each other. From several BFT counters to LA Knight hitting a middle to top rope springboard elbow. Knight also got the jumping superplex but it was a tremendous brainbuster.

This is a match that has hatred written all over it. Logan attempts to cheat as Machine Gun Kelly hands him a brass knuckle necklace. Paul connects with a punch but the buckshot lariat is countered right into the BFT.

While the finish was tremendous and a perfect ending, the near no sell of the brass knuckles is interesting. Great match altogether.

Bayley Vs Nia Jax works with the story they told. Nia Jax bringing up the words that Bayley had called her. The Anniahilator being kicked out of. Bayley hitting that tremendous power bomb on Nia. Nia and Bayley effectively use the dynamic and the naturally build styles. From Nia being the powerhouse she is. Tiffany Stratton runs down to fake a cash in, distracting Bayley to aid Nia Jax. They dominantly had Nia defeat Bayley which was very solid.

The story of the match was simple. Working with the dynamics that were provided. Seth laying down the law. Trying to gaslight Drew to take the match further. The crowd sang Seth’s theme in the first part of the match and it was great. Punk has his limitations but they are worked around. Drew has the bracelet and it becomes a key part of the match. From Seth having it on his wrist as he picked it up as the ref. Punk loses focus and gives Seth a GTS. Drew low blows Punk similarly to how Punk kicked him in Scotland. Before hitting him with a claymore that Seth had to count the pin for.

Its a very well told match, but there are a couple rough moments and not much for innovative spots.

This was definitely the most unpredictable match. Because both stars needed to win this match. Damian Priest was getting the support, the fan reactions. Gunther had the heat from just being the heel he is. This is a hard hitting match that say Damian make Gunther bleed from his chops. It was stiff, it had moments of it looking like a proper scrap. Finn Balor put Gunther’s leg on the ropes and it made sense that Damian found out by seeing the replay. Filled with rage Damian breaks out of a sleeper hold just to grab Finn by the neck. Gunther powerbombs and locks in a successful sleeper to win. Tremendous match to end a stellar reign.

Gotta hope Jaco Fatu is okay. This is exactly what was expected when they put that stipulation. The match went the length it went. Solidly worked and wrestled. No complaints there. Tama and Tonga run down to the ring to attack Cody. Cody kicks out. Kevin Owens and Randy Orton make the save. Cody attempts to use some stairs but Sikoa counters with a spear. Sikoa attempted a hip attack into them but failed. Jaco Fatu comes out and brutalizes Cody. Cody is splashed through the announce table similar to how Jacob debuted. Fatu looked visibly mad at how it happened, hopefully he isn’t hurt. Solo and Cody continue and Roman Reigns returns. Roman superman punches and spears Solo Sikoa, before giving Cody a nod of respect.

Dominik Mysterio escorts Rhea Ripley out the ring and the biggest party of the wrestling summer is under way!

Women’s World Championship Match: Liv Morgan(c) vs Rhea Ripley w/ Dominik Mysterio

The longshot that opens our event carries all the way down to the ring. The former women’s champion is welcomed with a great pop, and commentary–Michael Cole, Corey Graves, and Pat McAfee–run down the recent history of these two. We’re reminded that Liv injured Rhea (legitimately) and has spent months trying to sour the relationship between Rhea & Dom. We get a decent pop for both superstars from the Dog Pound and, at 7:15pm, we get our bell. Our first match is underway! Liv immediately digs deep in the Heel Tactics 101 playbook, slipping outside to avoid Rhea. We’re reminded that this is Ripley’s first match since WrestleMania–and as a reminder, Morgan legitimately injured Rhea the following week. Liv continues the stall tactics, repeatedly fleeing outside the ring and back in as Ripley charges her. The cat-and-mouse tactics continue for the first several long moments. Finally, Ripley fake-outs Liv and slips in at the same time as Morgan. Finally, ninety seconds or so in, Ripley grabs Morgan and its on!

Ripley with several ripcord clotheslines to a pop from the crowd. The mulleted Dom Mysterio stalks Liv outside the ring, grinning as Rhea takes the action outside. She taunts Liv, kissing Dom on the cheek to a mix of “aww’s” and “boo’s” from the crowd. Ripley slows the pace drastically, working Liv at ringside with slow strikes as the ref gives her plenty of lateral with the count-out. Rhea sends Liv into the steel steps over and over, then finally whips her into the ring. Ripley follows, continuing to slowly stalk the champ. The crowd peters out a bit until Ripley connects with a wicked headbutt to the champ! The challenger looks for Riptide and hits it on the top turnbuckle. Ripley sets up for another Riptide in the center of the ring but Morgan twirls out of it, eliciting boos before scrambling to the corner to catch a breather. Ripley closes the distance but Morgan sends her into the turnbuckle and proceeds to take control. Morgan sends Rhea into the corner, and Ripley is heard yelling “oh god oh god it’s out, it’s out!” The ref forces some space and checks on the challenger. Ripley refuses to give up, and the match continues. Corey Graves mentions a “lump” can be seen by “the naked eye.”

The champ takes over for several long moments, transitioning to working holds and targeted strikes to continue to weaken Ripley’s right shoulder. Commentary continue to question the challenger’s shoulder. Finally, Rhea gets some degree of separation with a side kick. She heads outside and talks to Dom. Dom sees motion from the ring and shoves Ripley out of the way–just in time to take a suicide dive for Mami! See, secret service? That’s how you do it! (Send your hate in, I’m ready for it–sorry boss!) Ripley moves about the ringside, then begins to slam her shoulder against the commentary table, popping it back in to a huge pop from the crowd! Ripley enters the ring and unloads on the champ, staggering and rocking the champion with a flurry of strikes! Ripley with a Riptide for a close two count! The crowd’s on their feet as Ripley looks for another Riptide. The champ rallies, countering the move into a spike DDT! The champ covers for a two of her own!

Morgan looks for a Bulldog off the top rope but Rhea moves, letting Morgan splat against the ring. Rhea looks for a submission but, due to the weakened right arm, can’t lock it in fully and Morgan escapes. Morgan with a Crucifix Driver for a close cover! Morgan immediately slaps on an arm bar, screaming as she wrenches the arm back, attempting to cinch the move in. Ripley continues to fight it, eventually powering out of the hold after several long moments. The action continues back and forth for another two minutes, noting really to note here. Morgan finally grows frustrated and exits the ring, retrieves a steel chair, and enters the ring. Ripley’s shoulder is, once again, out of socket. She shoves it repeatedly into the turnbuckle and sets it back. Rhea rips the chair away and hits a Riptide in the middle of the ring! The crowd is hot as Rhea considers her options. Ripley gets the steel chair and sadistically smiles over Morgan. Ripley smacks the chair against the mat.

Suddenly, Dom grabs the chair from the apron! He gets massive boos but he yells at Rhea a basic fact–she can’t win the title if she loses via DQ! The two continue to discuss this until Morgan shoves Rhea into the chair and Dom! Liv hits her finisher to a huge reaction! Liv covers for the one, two–no! Rhea kicks out! The crowd is on fire, a loud “holy shit” chant erupts! Dom hops up on the apron and tells the ref there’s a chair on the mat. This distracts the ref, allowing Liv–whether Dom’s intention or not, we don’t know–to hit another Oblivion! Liv covers and picks up the win at 7:31pm! The crowd boos loudly and commentary questions what’s going on.

Your Winner AND STILL Women’s World Champion, Liv Morgan! (16 minutes)

After the Match, Backstage with the Judgment Day

Afterwards, the crowd continues to boo–until we cut to Liv. Dom helps Liv up to her feet and the two kiss to MASSIVE boos! We’re shown Rhea, clearly upset in the ring, and the crowd showers the loudest boos of 2024 down as Liv & Dom make the long, long, long route to the back! They flip off the crowd, Pat yells loudly that Dom is a “piece of shit,” and Cole says he’ll go check on Rhea as we cut to a vignette for a documentary. We get hype for the forthcoming Intercontinental Match, then cut backstage. Damian Priest approaches Finn Balor and JD, and angrily demands to know where Dom is. They don’t know–so he sends them off to find out, calling Dom a prick in the process.

Intercontinental Championship Match: Sami Zayn(c) vs Bron Breakker

Pre-match, we get a video hyping the recent feud between El Generico and Scott Steiner, Jr these two Superstars. At 7:40pm, the challenger makes his way out first. Bron Breakker gets an okay pop from the Dog Pound. Maybe he should woof more so they make the connection? Loud boos begin to filter in. While this long entrance takes place, it’s dab time! What are you smoking, drinking or partaking in tonight? Weigh in below in our comments section, home of wonderful Rajahmaniacs just like you. Finally the champ makes his way out. Sam Zayn gets a great pop and the Cleveland crowd sing along to his theme (albeit weakly). We finally get our bell at 7:44pm. Breakker immediately goes for a shoulder charge, but the champ is ready and scoots out of the way. Sami again uses his wits, dodging another strike from the challenger. It doesn’t last for long, as Breakker quickly connects with a pair of moves. Breakker goes old school and looks for gorilla press, but the champ escapes. Breakker drops the champ with a wicked leaping clothesline–the Steiner line, I think–and the crowd dog-barks to show the challenger that they’ve made the connection.

The ref warns Bron as he slowly works over the champ in the corner. Bron breaks the hold, then pushes back in. Sami looks for an Exploder but Bron blocks it. Breakker and Zayn move to the middle corner turnbuckle, briefly struggling. Breakker is sent off, but immediately runs up the turnbuckles and hits a Frankensteiner outta nowhere for a close call! The crowd’s waking up! Neither men holds the lead for long, with both men hitting big moves to pop the crowd over and over. Sami looks for a Blue Thunder Bomb but can’t put Bron away! Bron takes over with a suplex followed by a slam! Sami takes control again, whipping Breakker into the corner. Sami looks for a Helluva Kick but Bron intercepts him with a spear mid-air! The crowd is on fire! Breakker drives Zayn into the mat, hard, and puts it away in quick fashion at 7:49! Short match!

Your Winner AND NEW Intercontinental Champion, Bron Breakker!

Slim Jim’s Save Moment of the Summer

And the winning moment is…Drew McIntyre dropping CM Punk at Smackdown before stealing his charm bracelet? …okay. If I had to watch it, you have to read it.

United States Championship Match: Logan Paul(c) vs LA Knight

We get a lengthy package hyping the lengthy reign of Logan Paul and his feud with LA Knight, leading up to this–Paul’s third title defense. The champion is out first, accompanied by Machine Gun Kelly, and the Cleveland natives get Dom-level boos. We cut to the back, where LA Knight cuts a quick promo and slightly vandalizes the Prime van in the back. Finally, we get the challenger’s entrance to a huge pop from the Dog Pound crowd! The Megastar makes his way down and our introductions are under way! Before we get the bell, LA attacks Logan as soon as he reaches the ring. Both men brawl outside, with Logan sending LA into the post. Knight counters a whip and sends Paul into the barricade, hard, before slamming him into the ring apron. Knight sends Paul into a “Prime Hydration Station”–a car with some Prime bottles on it. Knight pulls Paul to his feet, and Paul spits Prime into Knight’s eyes. Paul pulls off his vest to boos and begins to strip the commentary table. The match is still not yet under way. The brawling continues for several minutes until both men roll in the ring. The ref calls for the bell at 8:07pm.

Knight starts the match, officially, off strong. A clothesline rocks the champ and Knight covers for two. The crowd remains firmly behind the Megastar. The pace once again slows, and commentary does a great job recapping the feud between these two during this phase. Knight looks for a back drop but Paul flips out of it and drops the challenger. The crowd very loudly chants “fuck you Logan!” Paul sends Knight’s left shoulder into the ringpost. Again, the pacing is very, very slow right now. Knight is sent back to the canvas, and the champ mount-and-pounds him briefly. Paul takes time to taunt the crowd, who again rip off another denigrating “you suck” chant. Paul eats it up laughing and posing for his hometown (is he really from Cleveland?) Knight with a split-leg drop for a short two. The champ takes a very lengthy turn in control, and the crowd tries to rally behind the challenger.

With a Powerslam out of nowhere, the Megastar takes a turn on control. The crowd again loudly rallies behind Knight. LA uses the ropes to pull himself up then charges Paul, ramming him into the corner. Knight unloads big rights on the champ, then uses a choke hold to slam Logan back into the corner! Knight continues his “smashmouth” style, battering the champ with running knees and fists in the corner. Knight pulls Logan up and hits a modified Side Effect! Knight climbs the middle turnbuckle, soaks in some love from the crowd, and hits a high-reaching middle-buckle elbow drop for a close cover! The champ takes control a few moments later, using a leaping clothesline to send Knight out of the ring. Paul rips off a huge high-risk move, hitting a moonsault off the top rope to the outside, taking out the challenger! Dude’s athletic AF! Paul takes it back inside and looks for the KO Punch on Knight. Knight counters, looks for the BFT; Paul converts it into a backslide for a close call. Knight escapes; the champ connects with the Knockout Punch! Champ covers! Challenger kicks out just at 3! This match continues!

Paul ascends the turnbuckles and looks for a Frog Splash. Knight moves, Logan rolls through. Knight looks for a BFT but Paul grabs the ropes, preventing the move! Paul again goes up top. Knight charges in and hops up to the top rope, then hits a Superplex off the top! The crowd is on their feet! Knight covers, hooking the leg for another close fall! Finally the match is picking up pace. We get replays of the Superplex–almost a super Brainbuster, as Corey Graves points out. Logan slips outside. Knight follows, and Logan rakes the challenger’s eyes without the ref seeing! We see “that goof, Jeff” who’s been helping Paul win matches. Paul begins to approach Jeff on the outside of the ring, but eats a baseball slide from Knight! Knight attacks Jeff and the entire Prime Hydration entourage! Knight stomps a mudhole into Jeff as the crowd chants “no! no! no!” hahaha! Knight with a big right to Logan as he tries to help. Knight heads inside the ring, and Logan recovers. Logan gets with MGK, who hands Logan brass knuckles and a chain! The crowd boos loudly! Knight grabs Logan from behind; Logan waits until Knight lifts him over the ropes then clocks him in the face with brass knuckles! Logan flips over the rope, looking for his finisher–and runs right into a BFT! Knight covers! Knight picks up the win and the crowd erupts at 8:19pm! LA takes some time to celebrate and soak in the love from the Dog Pound.

Your Winner AND NEW United States Champion, LA Knight (YEAH!) (15 minutes)

WWE Women’s Championship Match: Bayley(c) vs Nia Jax

After a very, very lengthy vignette hyping the next match (ten minutes since last match ended), we get the entrance for “Queen” Nia Jax. The crowd boos her the entire time, as they should. We’re reminded that this is the first time ever Nia Jax has competed at SummerSlam. Wow. She poses with her crown on in the ring, then we get the entrance for Bayley. The crowd shows the Hugger some much-deserved love. We get our official introductions then the bell at 8:34pm. The first three and a half minutes are iconic Nia Jax offense. A very slow pace, a few powerful tosses, a lot of strutting and posing. Bayley looks to get some offense in, but the powerhouse Jax continues to dominate. Oh, finally, a move worth mentioning–Jax positions the champ with the champ’s torso on the apron.

Jax goes for a leg drop but the champ moves, and Jax lands on the hardest part of the ring! Bayley starts to string some moves together at ringside before sending the challenger inside. Bayley heads up top, but Jax is up too fast and drops the champ on the ropes. Jax places the champ in a vertical suplex position on the top turnbuckle (while Jax is grounded). Jax looks for a stalling suplex but Bayley converts it into a guillotine! Jax eventually powers out of it, but not before we’re reminded that Bayley used this same move nine years ago in NXT to defeat Jax. Okay. Jax positions Bayley in the corner and looks for an Annihilator (sort of like the Banzai drop) off the middle rope. Bayley moves, then hits the Bayley-to-Belly Suplex for a short cover attempt. Bayley goes for the Rose Plant but Jax escapes. Jax with a big Urinage slam on Bayley, leaving the champ down. Jax drags Bayley back to the corner and looks for another middle rope Annihilator. Jax connects and covers! Bayley kicks out, and Jax looks stunned. Jax takes several long moments, too long. Jax eventually sets Bayley up in the corner and attempts a shoulder charge. Bayley easily moves out the way, and the challenger’s shoulder connects with the post. Bayley takes a few precious seconds to recover.

Bayley with a suicide dive through the middle ropes, landing on Jax’s back. Jax immediately turns and drops back, slamming the champ into the hard entrance ramp. The ref begins a countout. The crowd very weakly attempts to rally the champ. Jax with a big splash in the corner. Jax slaps her cheeks and hits another rear thrust into the corner. Jax looks for another Annihilator but Bayley pops up and punches Jax in the butt. Bayley slips under Jax’s legs and hoists her up, off the middle turnbuckle, and slowly walks across the ring before hitting a huge powerbomb in the middle of the ring! The crowd with a LOUD “holy shit” chant! Bayley ascends the turnbuckles then hits the flying elbow for a close cover!

Without warning, Tiffany Stratton streaks to the ring! Stratton hops up on the apron but before she can cash in, Bayley clotheslines her off! Bayley turns and drops Jax, covering for two. Bayley runs off the ropes, looking for a Rose Plant. Jax counters it into a powerbomb! Jax pulls the champ up and hits another powerbomb! Jax drags Bayley to the corner and hits two back-to-back Annihilators! The crowd is hot for this even if they don’t like it! Jax covers and picks up the win at 8:47pm!

Your Winner AND NEW WWE Women’s Champion, Nia Jax!

Singles Match: CM Punk vs Drew McIntyre (Special Ref: Seth Rollins)

After another video package showing the build to this match, we get special guest referee Seth Rollin’s entrance. As usual, the crowd sings “the Architect” to the ring–complete with HBK-inspired special guest ref gear! Next up, we get the entrance for Drew McIntyre. The crowd mostly boos the “Scottish Psychopath,” who still seems to be out of fucks to give. Last, but never least, we get the entrance for “the greatest in the world” CM Punk. The crowd eats it up as Living Color’s “Cult of Personality” screams across the Cleveland Browns Stadium’s speakers. Both men square off and the crowd is on fire, brothers. We’re reminded this is CM Punk’s first singles match in the WWE since 2014, and his first match since injuring himself at the Royal Rumble. They loudly cheer as both men approach until, finally, they unload on each other! Rollins has to separate both men a few times, warning both that he’s in charge. McIntyre takes an early lead, chopping Punk. Punk fires back with a clothesline that sends McIntyre over the top rope. Punk with a leaping strike to drop Drew at ringside. Punk chains together offense, sending Drew over the barricade then back to the ringside area. Drew fires back with a big strike. Seth lounges, laying across the top ropes in the corner, watching the action–he’s not even doing a count out! Punk pummels Drew, seated upon the floor by the ring steps, and Rollins laughs. The crowd loudly chants “we want tables.”

Drew takes control, however, to the chagrin of the crowd. McIntyre pounds away at Punk, quickly reddening the Chicago-made star’s back. Drew takes it back into the ring and continues to brutalize Punk with stiff shots and strong slams and suplexes. McIntyre looks for a cover but Punk kicks out before Rollins can even get into position. Rollins reminds Drew that “you said you were gonna kill him,” encouraging further chaos. Gotta love it. McIntyre slowly stomps Punk on the mat. CM throws fists, but Drew shuts it down with a big fist. Drew with a belly-to-belly suplex toss, covers, and immediately breaks it. Drew says something to Seth, accusing him of purposefully being out of position despite the pin attempt immediately being broken. The crowd again begins to sing Rollins’ theme. Punk starts to throws strikes, hitting his signature combination. Drew breaks it with a modified powerbomb slam. Drew covers for the shortest one, ever. Drew with a big sit-out powerbomb for a two count. Drew exits the ring, retrieves a steel chair, and enters the ring with it.

Rollins acknowledges that Drew has a chair. Drew tells Rollins to “just turn around” and not look. McIntyre pleads with Seth, stating “just let me do it” as “the problem” (meaning Punk) won’t “go away.” Seth turns his back and Drew hoists the chair, ready to strike! Seth rushes over and snatches it away, deciding against the use of foreign weapons. Drew isn’t happy about it but continues his offense. Another powerbomb! Drew takes his time, moving to the corner. He pulls out CM Punk’s bracelet, stolen weeks ago by Drew, and puts it on. Drew looks for a Claymore but Punk dodges it!

Punk begins to get some offense in, finally showing life. Punk with a running knee to Drew in the corner. Punk with another running knee in the corner! The crowd loudly chants for Punk. Punk with another running knee to Drew in the corner! Drew wobbles out of the corner, only to eat a clothesline from Punk. CM climbs the turnbuckles and poses for the crowd before blowing a kiss. Elbow drop off the top to McIntyre! Punk covers for two. Punk immediately switches to an Anaconda Vise! Drew tries to fight it off but CM cinches it in! Punk uses the vise to hold Drew down and takes back his bracelet to a huge pop! The dog chants Punk’s dogs name. Drew pops up and hits a Claymore outta nowhere for a close cover! Punk barely kicks out and the crowd is on fire. Another loud “CM Punk” chant erupts. McIntyre slows down, killing another minute as he contemplates what to do next. McIntyre sets up the Future Shock DDT but Punk escapes, sending McIntyre into the post!

Punk raises his hands, calling for the Go to Sleep (GTS). Rollins distracts Punk, talking to him–not sure about what. Rollins has Punk’s bracelet! He has it on! Punk drops McIntyre and approaches Rollins angrily. McIntyre attacks Punk from behind, sending him crashing into Rollins. Rollins is wiped out! Punk recovers and hits the GTS on McIntyre and covers. The crowd loudly counts to eight before Rollins gets back in the ring and counts the cover. McIntyre kicks out! Punk yells at Rollins that he’s as horrible a ref as he is a wrestler, then Punk sarcastically explains how to do a ref count. Punk gets in Rollins face and continues to disrespect Rollins’ rightful authority as ref. Rollins reminds Punk it’s Rollins’ ring with “Rollins’ rules.” He asks Punk if he understands. “It’s not always about you, asshole!” Punk snaps and hits the GTS on Rollins! The crowd erupts! Punk stands over Rollins. “It ain’t always about me, but it’s never about you,” he taunts. Punk turns his attention to McIntyre–McIntyre kicks Punk in the junk! McIntyre with a Claymore! Rollins starts to recover as McIntyre screams at him to wake up. Rollins with a very, very slow count. McIntyre picks up the win at 9:24pm.

Your Winner, Drew McIntyre!

World Heavyweight Championship Match: Damian Priest(c) vs Gunther

We get another lengthy vignette hyping this match. Prior to the match, we see Damian Priest backstage with Finn Balor. Priest apologies for his ‘tude earlier in the night and Finn reminds him it’s all good–he’s got his back, they’re the Judgement Day after all. Finally at 9:34pm–again, ten minutes after the last match ended–we get our first entrance. Out comes the King of the Ring ’24, my favorite cousin 847 times removed, “the Ring General” Gunther, comes out to a mild heel reaction. Up next, our World Heavyweight Champion Damian Priest makes his entrance to a great pop. Question–did the IWC forget how horrid some of these new themes are? Y’all best get back on that or we’re stuck with this band another 3 years. Priest pays homage to the Undertaker, in that it takes him forever to get to the ring. Go grab snacks, kids, you’ve got time. Finally we get the official announcements and, for the sixteenth time, the world heavyweight title will be defended here at SummerSlam. We get the bell at 9:40pm. The Champ opens up with a huge right, rocking the challenger! This will be a physical match! Priest unloads with brutal strikes and a huge slam, and Gunther rolls out of the ring. Priest pursues, using the steel steps to gain slight elevation as he strikes Gunther across the skull with a clubbing blow. Gunther rams Priest into the ring post, then uses a back drop across the apron to stun the champ.

Gunther uses an arm lock to block Priest. Priest again attempts a high-risk move, climbing up top and hitting a Hurricanrana to Gunther! Priest with a Broken Arrow! Priest covers for a close two.

Gunther rises and hits a vicious series of chops across Priest’s chest. Priest finally blocks one, then unloads with more kicks. Both men continue to unload into each other, neither man now unable to take a lead for more than a few seconds. The champ looks for a splash in the corner but Gunther dodges. Gunther with a mule dropkick! Gunther hits a big powerbomb and covers for a two. Gunther’s chest is bleeding and red. The crowd begins to pop as the camera zooms in on Gunther’s brutalized chest. The crowd with another loud dueling chant. Gunther rises to his feet and gets a huge pop from the crowd! Again, Gunther and Priest exchange chops.

Gunther slaps on a sleeper but Priest immediately escapes. Gunther with I believe an exploder. Gunther with a big clothesline. Gunther with another clothesline, followed by a cover for two! Both men are battered, exhausted, and giving it their all for us tonight, folks. Again, the Cleveland crowd pops for the combatants and rips off a “this is awesome” chant in appreciation. The ref checks on both men. Gunther rises first, and Priest tells him to “bring it.” Gunther with a big kick to the face of the champ. Priest again calls for more! Gunther with a big chop that drops the champ. Gunther taunts the crowd before taunting the champ. Gunther with a huge blow that again drops the champ. Finn Balor comes to ringside and begins smacking the apron and stairs, trying to rally the champ and the crowd alike. Gunther holds Priest by an arm, while Priest is still knelt and vulnerable, and delivers a brutal chop that drops the champ yet again. Balor again tries to rally Priest.

Gunther with another chop heard across the arena. Priest tries to throw fists, only to be shut down by another huge kick to the chin from Gunther. Gunther stomps on the back of Priest’s head, then yells at him more. Another kick to the head from Gunther. A running kick to the ribs from the challenger! Again, Balor tries to cheer on Priest.

Priest is fading! Balor stares at Priest with an ugly look on his face. Maybe he’s constipated. Priest holds on as long as he can but after about 40 seconds, he manages to get a second wind. Priest tries to fight back. Priest rolls over, pinning Gunther for another two! Priest thrusts through the ropes, grabbing Finn by the neck! Gunther uses the distraction to powerbomb Priest! Gunther slaps on the sleeper in the middle of the ring again and Priest is fading! The ref checks, Priest is out–we have a new champ at 9:57pm!

Your Winner AND NEW World Heavyweight Champion, Gunther!

The Miz & R-Truth Announce Attendance, A-Town Down Under Interrupt

57,791 people in attendance here in Cleveland set the new SummerSlam attendance record. Before the Miz & R-Truth can do much, A-Town Down Under arrive to boos. Waller & Theory tell us Cleveland has the worst NFL team of all time; the Falcons beg to differ. Austin Theory says Clevelanders all look like Jelly Roll. Grayson Waller refuses to let Theory disrespect Jelly Roll by comparing him to Cleveland. Waller goes on to say Jelly Roll did something special–he made worse music than R-Truth. R-Truth asks us if we’re in the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame’s home city, which we are. R-Truth announces Ricky Morton & Robert Gibson as the Rock n’ Roll Hall of Fame…but it’s Grayson Waller and Austin Theory. Jelly Roll enters the ring with a steel chair. A-Town Down Under call him “Jelly Swoll” and he smacks them with the chair. R-Truth and the Miz lend a helping hand. Jelly Roll hits a chokeslam, then calls for the Five Knuckle Shuffle. All three faces do the taunt and move to a huge pop!

Undisputed WWE Championship “Bloodline Rules” Main Event Match: Cody Rhodes(c) vs Solo Sikoa

After a vignette reminding us that this is a Bloodlines Rules match–the same match type Cody won the title off Roman in, at WrestleMania 40–we get Solo Sikoa’s solo entrance to a chorus of boos. Commentary are shocked Solo’s coming out solo. Solo’s all like, yolo. We cut to the back after the lengthy entrance and see Cody in a trailer. The crowd pops and starts to chant for Cody. He gets his dog, Pharaoh–finishing his story as a road companion for Cody, due to his age and health–outside his trailer. Another long shot as Cody makes his way from, literally, his trailer in the parking garage in the back of the arena, through the arena, to the gorilla position. “The Enforcer” Arn Anderson greets Cody in the back to a pop from us old timers. Arn tells Cody some encouraging words, and says he refuses to let Cody fall victim to the Bloodline. He states he has some friends still backstage and Cody will have backup. Cody changes from sweats into his patriotic American Nightmare and the crowd erupts into a huge Cody. Cody puts on his famous golden winged helmet and the crowd erupts again! Adrenaline…in my soul… The crowd starts to sing and Cody makes his way out. Whoa-oh! Cody removes his helmet and begins his own long entrance at 10:21pm. We get official announcements and the bell at 10:26pm.

The crowd starts us off with a very loud “we want Roman” chant. Solo and Cody circle before locking up. Cody with a side headlock; the hold’s broken with a whip from Solo. Both men shoulder thrust, and neither budges. Cody runs off the ropes and again shoulder charges Solo. Solo sends Cody to the mat and raises a finger for acknowledgement. Makes sense–Samantha Irvin didn’t announce Solo as the Tribal Chief, after all. Both men spend several more moments, keeping a slow pace as they resort to long stares, side headlocks and jawing off the mouth to eat up time. Cody looks for his drop-down punch but Solo has it scouted, grabbing his wrist and telling him no. Both men lock up, with Cody exiting the ring to compose himself. The champ shakes it off as Solo taunts him from the ring. Cody enters the ring and both men again circle. Slow start to this match. Solo with a kick to the gut, followed by a headbutt and a chop.

Cody looks for another but Solo clocks him with a huge right, dropping the champ on the spot!

Solo takes a stretch in command, taking the action back into the ring. It’s evident Solo’s studied tape on Cody, as time and time again he stops Cody from performing some of his signature moves.

Solo and Cody take turns attempting slams until Solo connects with a huge Urinage side slam. The crowd pops for both men.

Sikoa begins to work on Cody’s traps, squeezing them hard as the champ screams. The crowd tries tor ally the champ, who fights to his feet. Rhodes with rights to the gut and face of Sikoa. Solo shuts it down with a Samoan Drop out of nowhere, garnering another two-count. Sikoa strands Cody in a Tree of Woe and hits a stalling headbutt on the vulnerable champ. Solo tells Cody loudly, “I’m gonna beat your ass in front of your (entire) family.” Solo with another diving headbutt to the strung-up champ. Solo again takes time to taunt Cody and the crowd. Sikoa looks for a third headbutt but Cody moves out of the way and climbs the turnbuckles. Cody with a diving corkscrew moonsault off the top, wiping out Sikoa. Cody begins to rally, pulling the challenger to his feet. Cody with a series of rights, stunning Sikoa. Cody runs off the ropes and right into a spinning slam from Sikoa for another close two.

The back-and-forth continues until Cody begins to chain together enough offense to prompt a Bloodline entrance. The WWE Tag Team Champions begin to destroy Cody Rhodes as the crowd loudly boos and chants “Yeet!” Solo covers the decimated Cody, and the ref counts to two before Cody gets an arm up. Kevin Owens‘ music plays and out comes the Prize Fighter! KO hobbles down to the ring as fast as he can, attempting to make the save at 10:43pm. KO slugs at both Tonga & Tanga. KO drops the challenger! KO unloads into T&T yet again! The crowd loudly chants various things all at once, both for KO, Yeet, and others. Randy Orton‘s music plays and out comes the Legend Killer! Faces: Cody, Randy, KO; Heels: Solo, Tonga & Tanga. Orton hits the ring and begins RKO’ing anyone Bloodline-adjacent! KO with a stunner! Powerslam from Randy Orton on Solo! KO heads up top and hits the swanton off the top on Solo! Cody pulls Sikoa up and hits the Cross Rhodes for another close fall. Orton & Owens chase off Tonga & Tanga, leaving just the champ and challenger in the ring.

Cody exits the ring and gets steel steps taking them into the ring Rhodes uses the steps to ram Sikoa. Cody yells at Solo, then uses the steps to ram Sikoa into the corner yet again! Cody yells “go down” over and over. Rhodes looks for a third strike with the stairs, but Sikoa spears Cody outta nowhere! Sikoa covers and gets two. Sikoa positions the stairs in the corner, sits Cody against them, and begins to pummel the champ. Sikoa backs off across the ring and looks for a charging strike. Rhodes moves, and Sikoa bounces off the ring post and stairs! Cody connects with a Cross Rhodes. Cody with a second Cross Rhodes, but holds on–just like WrestleMania 40, he looks for a triple Cross Rhodes. “The Samoan Werewolf” Jacob Fatu attacks the champ from behind, taking him out!

Solo takes the champ into the ring, then climbs the turnbuckles himself. Solo with a big splash off the top himself, covering for two only. The champ somehow kicks out! Solo wants a Samoan Spike but Cody collapses. Solo pulls Cody up. Cody fires back, slugging the challenger before hitting a Cody Cutter! Without warning we hear the drums–ROMAN REIGNS IS HERE! The crowd goes absolutely ape shit! Roman Reigns takes his time walking to the ring, and commentary geeks out as hard as the 57,000-plus in attendance! Solo is shocked! Cody is shocked! Pat’s shocked! Everyone’s shocked! Roman enters the ring and hits the Superman Punch on Sikoa! Roman calls for hte spear and the crowd loudly roars “oo-ah” in unison! A HUGE spear form Roman nearly cuts Solo in half! Roman turns attention to Cody and the crowd erupts again, this time with a “holy shit” chant! Roman exits the ring and begins to make his way up the ramp. Cody is in shock, and Roman pauses one last time to look back at Rhodes. A loud “thank-you Roman” chant from the crowd as Cody hits the Cross Rhodes, covers and retains at 10:55pm!

Your Winner AND STILL Undisputed WWE Champion, Cody Rhodes!

WWE Summer Slam: Cody Rhodes vs Solo Sikoa WWE Championship match results.,https://emeatribune.com/wwe-summerslam-2024-grades-results-roman-reigns-returns-cody-rhodes-retains-undisputed-wwe-championship/,"Solo Sikoa came out first, without any of his fellow Bloodline members. After Cody Rhodes agreed this would be a “Bloodline Rules” match on SmackDown, Tama Tonga, Jacob Fatu and Tonga Loa would undoubtedly get involved.

Rhodes entrance began in his trailer, and as he exited he was met by his dog Pharaoh. Rhodes was then met by wrestling legend Arn Anderson, who teased some help coming for Rhodes during the match. Rhodes was given his American Nightmare jacket and a winged eagle skull mask as he went through Gorilla and emerged.

Rhodes and Sikoa circled before engaging in a collar-and-elbow tie-up — the first such start of a match tonight. Sikoa looked powerful early, unfazed by a couple of shoulder tackles and thwarting Rhodes’ patented drop-down slap. While Sikoa’s power was evident in the early stages, Rhodes’ speed and wit was on display.

Action spilled outside the ring as Rhodes landed a Disaster Kick and suicide dive on Sikoa, but the challenger was not down for long, as he met a second dive attempt with a blow to the head before both men returned to the ring.

As Rhodes went for his scoop powerslam, Sikoa faked him out, unveiling another layer of his ring psychology. Sikoa kept up the offensive with a pair of near-falls and teasing the Samoan Spike, but Rhodes countered with two kicks and a Cody Cutter. Rhodes stayed on the offensive, sending Sikoa outside the ring briefly.

After some quick offense, Rhodes played the hits, landing his drop-down slap and the Bionic Elbow before a Disaster Kick attempt was countered with a powerbomb and near-fall from Sikoa. The momentum swung back into the Tribal Chief’s favor, who landed a huge running maneuver on Rhodes in the corner and a spinning uranage for yet another near-fall.

Sikoa tied Rhodes up in the Tree of Woe and connected on a pair of flying headbutts. Sikoa taunted before going for a third headbutt, allowing Rhodes to evade the maneuver and land a top-rope cross body. Rhodes’ brief rally was snuffed out by another spinning uranage. Sikoa took his time, taunting as he went to the top rope, allowing Rhodes to recover for a massive superplex.

Both men exchanged blows as they battled to their feet. Rhodes gained the upper hand and landed a CrossRhodes. This brought out the first interference on behalf of the Bloodline, as Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa emerged to assault Rhodes. Sikoa attempted to make the cover, but Rhodes kicked out. As the Bloodline attack continued, Kevin Owens rushed to Rhodes’ aid.

Owens briefly battled the Bloodline but was overwhelmed, drawing out Randy Orton. Orton swung things back into the babyfaces’ favor, as him and Owens took out all three members of the Bloodline. Rhodes recovered to hit a CrossRhodes on Sikoa, but the challenger kicked out at two. The four interlopers exited, battling through the crowd.

Rhodes tossed steel steps into the ring, using them to hit Sikoa in the head twice, but the challenger was held up by the turnbuckle. As Rhodes with for a third blow, Sikoa delivered a huge spear for a near-fall. Sikoa set up the steel stairs and went for another rear-view on Rhodes against the stairs. The champion moved out of the way and began to set up a triple CrossRhodes. After the second finisher, Jacob Fatu broke into the match and took out Rhodes.

Fatu dragged Sikoa to cover Rhodes, but the champion kicked out at two. Fatu continued his assault on Rhodes outside the ring, setting up Rhodes on the announce table. Fatu climbed to the top turnbuckle and landed a frogsplash on Rhodes through the table. Sikoa put Rhodes back into the ring and hit a frogsplash of his own, but Rhodes was resilient as ever, kicking out again.

Rhodes rebounded with a superkick and a top-rope Cody Cutter. As both men were laid out in the ring, Roman Reigns’ music hit and the former champion and Bloodline leader emerged for the first time since losing to Rhodes at WrestleMania 40.

Reigns ran into the ring and delivered a Superman Punch and spear to Sikoa before staring down and nodding at Rhodes. Reigns then exited without saying a word. Rhodes, not taking his eyes off Reigns, delivered CrossRhodes to Sikoa and pinned him to retain his title.

Cody Rhodes def. Solo Sikoa in 29:13 to retain the Undisputed WWE Championship.

WWE SummerSlam 2024 Results: Liv Morgan Defeats Rhea Ripley.,https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/2024/08/03/wwe-summerslam-live-match-results-winners-highlights-analysis-at-cleveland-browns-stadium/74659913007/,"WWE delivered the biggest party of the summer with SummerSlam 2024.

Roman Reigns made his long-awaited return and put Solo Sikoa in his place, providing Cody Rhodes with an unexpected assist. The Judgment Day imploded, first with Dominik Mysterio betraying Rhea Ripley in her championship match, before he left arm and arm with Liv Morgan. Then it was Finn Balor, who cost Damian Priest in his world title bout against Gunther.

Meanwhile, Drew McIntyre finally got the upper hand on nemesis CM Punk, who was wrestling in his first televised WWE singles match in over 10 years.

In total four new champions were crowned, including Nia Jax (women's championship), LA Knight (U.S. championship) and Bron Breakker (Intercontinental championship).

The fallout from SummerSlam 2024 will be felt for a while as rivalries will continue to heat up into the fall.

Here's a recap of SummerSlam with all the highlights and grades from every match:

WWE SummerSlam post show, press conference

Roman Reigns returns, takes out Solo Sikoa in match vs Cody Rhodes

During a chaotic match between Cody Rhodes and Solo Sikoa for the Undisputed WWE championship that featured run-in after run-in, Roman Reigns made his long-awaited return at SummerSlam.

At the time, both Rhodes and Sikoa were down in the ring.

What was Reigns going to do? Was he coming for his longtime rival in Rhodes or Sikoa, the man who has called himself the new Tribal Chief in the absence of Reigns?

Reigns, last seen at WrestleMania after losing his title to Rhodes, gave everyone that answer quickly. Sikoa a Superman punch and then speared him to a thunderous ovation.

Rhodes then finished the job and delivered a final Cross Rhodes on Sikoa for the win.

Rhodes was in shock that the man he fought at the last two WrestleMania's was giving him an assist. But for Reigns, it's likely more about giving Sikoa a reminder about who runs The Bloodline. Reigns has led The Bloodline faction since 2020 and did so as the champion. But after Reigns left the scene after WrestleMania, Sikoa self-appointed himself the Tribal Chief and brought in several new family members.

Reigns has clearly been watching and disapproves with how Sikoa has been running things. The next chapter in The Bloodline is upon us with the return of Roman Reigns.

Watch out Sikoa, Jacob Fatu, Tama Tonga, Tonga Loa and the rest of WWE, the Head of the Table is back.

Grade: A+

Watch Cody Rhodes' SummerSlam entrance: Cody Rhodes' dog, Arn Anderson

Cody Rhodes' entrance is always memorable. His entrance at SummerSlam might be the best for who was involved. His dog, Pharaoh and Arn Anderson, a contemporary of Rhodes' late father, Dusty Rhodes, who gave Rhodes a pep talk.

Watch it here:

Who is Cody Rhodes' dog, Pharaoh?

Pharaoh is Rhodes' longtime companion on the road. Rhodes' dog has joined him on the road for years across his time in AEW and WWE.

Rhodes posted on social media this week that due to Pharaoh's age — he's 13 — he will no longer travel with him.

Rhodes said Pharaoh is ""still thriving but slowing down a bit.""

""These days he's more comfortable keeping eyes on Libby Curls and hard napping at the house,"" Rhodes wrote ""... He's been a constant for me and hands down the most loyal friend.""

Pharaoh waited for Rhodes as he got off his bus prior to his SummerSlam match against Solo Sikoa on Saturday night.

SummerSlam attendance

The Biggest Party of the Summer delivered the largest attended SummerSlam in WWE history.

SummerSlam host The Miz, along with his tag team partner R-Truth, announced the SummerSlam attendance of 57,791, a new record.

Gunther is new World Heavyweight champion thanks to Finn Balor costing Damian Priest

The Judgment Day is toast.

And so is Damian Priest's title reign.

The beneficiary was Gunther, the Ring General who won his first world championship.

Hours after Dominik Mysterio cost Rhea Ripley her match against Liv Morgan, Finn Balor did the same toward Damian Priest in his fight with Gunther.

For those keeping score at home, that's two members of The Judgment Day, a long-running faction in the WWE that has held many championships over the last few years, ruining the chances for its own members.

But this has been building for some time. And at the center of it was Finn Balor, whose jealousy of Damian Priest reared its ugly head again.

Balor came out amid an extremely physical match between Priest and Gunther. Would Balor help his longtime friend Priest retain the title he has held since WrestleMania?

He did anything but that.

After Priest gave Gunther the South of Heaven power bomb, the champion rolled his challenger over to the side of the ring where Balor was positioned. Wrong move.

As the ref was counting Balor put Gunther's leg on the rope, ending the count. Priest initially couldn't see that Balor was responsible, but he saw it on replay. Balor had his back toward him initially and had a smirk on his face like Mysterio earlier in the night.

The ultimate betrayal.

Priest was furious. He then tried to grab Balor by the neck through the ring ropes. But all that did was give Gunther the opening he needed. He then put Priest in a sleeper to secure the win.

It's a huge moment for Gunther, who has been one of WWE's most dominant superstars over the last few years.

Like with Mysterio and Ripley, the fallout of The Judgment will be felt for a while. Balor has some serious explaining to do.

Grade: B+

Drew McIntyre finally stands tall over CM Punk in wild match at SummerSlam with Seth Rollins as special guest referee

CM Punk's first televised singles match in over 10 years didn't end how he planned.

After months of getting the upper hand in his heated rivalry with Drew McIntyre, the Scottish Warrior finally got the better of Punk.

He returned the favor on Punk by delivering a low blow on him with special guest referee Seth Rollins out of the picture. It was reminiscent of when Punk gave McIntyre a low blow back at Clash at the Castle earlier this summer to cost him in his championship match.

In the end, CM Punk let his hatred for Rollins get in the way.

As WWE announcer Michael Cole said before the match, McIntyre vs. Punk had a ""big fight feel."" It's been WWE's best storyline and it's had long-term storytelling even as one of its main characters, CM Punk, has been out of action with an injury.

The match turned when Punk was going for his finishing move - the Go To Sleep - on McIntyre. It was then that Punk saw that Rollins was wearing Punk's coveted bracelet that has the names of those close to him. Rollins was wearing it after it got loose from McIntyre, who had stolen it, making this feud even more personal.

He got in Rollins' face and the ref later was knocked out of the ring. Punk eventually got McIntyre down with his signature move but Rollins wasn't in position for the count.

Punk was livid and the two were face to face, exchanging words.

Punk then picked up Rollins and delivered GTS on his longtime rival as the match further broke down.

With Punk distracted with Rollins, McIntyre gained the upper hand when he first executed a low blow and then his finisher Claymore.

Rollins, still down, had enough energy to crawl over to make the three count.

McIntyre finally overcame CM Punk by winning at his own game. The feud between all three of these has been going on for much of the year. But if this match proved anything it's that the rivalry among all three will continue.

The CM Punk-Seth Rollins singles match, which was supposed to happen at WrestleMania this year, will be must-watch when that happens.

Grade: A

Nia Jax wins women's championship over Bayley at SummerSlam, Tiffany Stratton provides distraction

The queen is now a champion.

Queen of the Ring Nia Jax has her first women's championship in six years after she powered her way to a victory over Bayley at SummerSlam.

Bayley, who won the title back at WrestleMania, appeared to have the match in her favor when Nia Jax's new friend Miss Money in the Bank winner Tiffany Stratton came down to the ring. She had her Money in the Bank briefcase with her and a ref as if she intended to use her MITB contract make the match a triple threat.

But her appearance was just intended to offer a distraction. She did her job. Bayley turned her back on the Irresistible Force, who then gave her two sit-down powerbombs.

She wasn't done.

Jax then got up to the top rope and crashed down on Bayley with back-to-back annihilators.

That was more than enough for the win.

Jax and Tiffany Stratton celebrated in the ring together, Jax with her new title and Stratton with her briefcase.

Jax and Stratton are friends now but don't be surprised if Miss Money in the Bank eventually cashes in on Jax later this fall.

Bayley delivered a noteworthy performance and had the crowd on their feet when she delivered a power bomb of her own from the corner to the middle of the ring on the much bigger Jax.

Bayley then delivered a beautiful flying elbow from the top rope. But Jax kicked out, setting off the wild finish.

Grade: A-

LA Knight defeats Logan Paul to win US championships, overcomes brass knuckles assist from Machine Gun Kelly

Ohio native Logan Paul had his usual entourage for his match against LA Knight at SummerSlam.

But it wasn't enough to win this time, despite his usual antics.

LA Knight overcame it all to defeat Paul and capture his first singles championship in the WWE.

Machine Gun Kelly greeted Paul, who was wearing Cleveland Browns colors, when he entered the stadium. The two walked to the ring together but this wasn't the last we'd see MGK.

LA Knight brought the aggression before the match even started. Before coming out to the ring he smashed the windows of Paul's huge Prime-themed vehicle in the parking garage.

When LA Knight finally made his way out he and Paul fought outside the ring, including on top of the announcer's table before the match even started.

When the bell finally rang, the physicality continued. Paul thought he had the match a couple times, once after he drilled LA Knight with one of his signature right hands and later after he struck him with brass knucks, which were provided to the champ by MGK.

But that wasn't enough to keep LA Knight down.

Did the fans at Cleveland Browns Stadium like this result? One word: Yeah!

Grade: B+

Stephanie McMahon is at SummerSlam

Stephanie McMahon, the daughter of former WWE CEO Vince McMahon, is ringside at SummerSlam. Stephanie McMahon has had several roles in WWE over the years, including as the company's longtime chief brand officer. She left the company in January 2023. She's married to Paul ""Triple H"" Levesque, a WWE legend and the company's current chief content officer.

She was last seen on WWE TV at WrestleMania in April.

Bron Breakker defeats Sami Zayn at SummerSlam to win WWE Intercontinental championship

There's a section at Cleveland Browns Stadium called the Dawg Pound.

Bron Breakker and the dogs were barking on Saturday night at SummerSlam.

Breakker overpowered Sami Zayn to win the Intercontinental championship, his first singles title on the main roster.

Breakker, who fell short of the title at Money in the Bank in July against Zayn, won the match with a huge spear as the champion was going for a Helluva Kick.

It was a quick match following the explosive opener and it's clear these two could have given more of a show. But WWE brass likely wanted to show the dominance of Breakker. Mission accomplished. The sky is the limit for the 26-year-old Breakker, who is the son of Rick Steiner and nephew of Scott Steiner.

Grade: C

Is The Judgment Day over?

DominikMysterio costing Rhea Ripley her match isn't sitting well with fellow Judgment Day members.

During a break, World Heavyweight champion Damian Priest was furious in the group's Clubhouse. He questioned Finn Balor if he knew Mysterio was going to turn on Ripley.

Balor denied it. The tension is building between The Judgment Day.

Dominik Mysterio gets dirty, turns on Rhea Ripley to help Liv Morgan retain women's championship

Dominik Mysterio has turned on his Mami, Rhea Ripley.

And he helped Liv Morgan in the process retain her women's championship and defeat Rhea Ripley in the first match at SummerSlam.

Things heated up late in the encounter when Morgan brought a steel chair into the ring. She was going to use it on Ripley, but her strike was blocked before the challenger executed a Rip Tide on the champion.

She didn't go for the pin, however. She wanted to make Morgan pay for her deeds over the last few months, including injuring her with a steel chair four months ago. As she was going up to hit her with a chair, Mysterio, who was ringside, grabbed it from behind to stop her. Ripley would have been disqualified had she used it. But it was all a ruse. It was just the beginning of Mysterio's involvement.

As Mysterio and Ripley were arguing at the top of the ring, Morgan hit her finishing move, Oblivion. It wasn't enough to get the pinfall as Ripley kicked out at two.

But moments later, with the steel chair still in the ring, Mysterio again jumped to the top of the ring to distract the referee. This allowed Morgan to hit her finisher on Ripley on the steel chair.

Mysterio's intentions were crystal clear this time. He was done with Mami. The camera showed him with a smirk on his face as Morgan received her title back.

And as Morgan left the ring, Mysterio gave her a big kiss. Unlike a few months ago when Morgan pursued him to make Ripley jealous while she was out with an injury, it was Mysterio who initiated it.

Dirty Dom did Mami dirty.

Ripley was heartbroken in the ring. Mysterio and Morgan walked to the back arm in arm. Mysterio had his arm raised. and Morgan raised her title belt.

This match was the perfect opener and had the fans wanting more and intrigued by what is to come. But they were also crushed for Ripley.

This drama between Ripley, Morgan and Mysterio is far from over. Mysterio better be ready for the fallout from not only Ripley but also his fellow Judgment Day members or whatever is left of it.

Watch Rhea Ripley put her shoulder back into place during SummerSlam match

Liv Morgan vs Rhea Ripley starts SummerSlam

The women's world championship between Liv Morgan and Rhea Ripley kicks off SummerSlam. It's one of the more personal matches on the SummerSlam card

And Dominik Mysterio, the son of Hall of Famer Rey Mysterio, is ringside with Ripley. Mysterio has been the love interest of Morgan as she has sought revenge on anything that belonged to Ripley, who put her out of action in 2023.

After Morgan put Ripley on the shelf after WrestleMania, she has had her eyes on stealing Mysterio away from Ripley.

Mysterio and Ripley have been a pair within The Judgment Day for over a year.

And not to be forgotten, this match is for the women's title, a championship that Ripley has never lost. She was forced to vacate the title after her injury in April.

WWE SummerSlam matches 2024

Seven matches are on the SummerSlam card.

SummerSlam history in Cleveland

This is Cleveland's second time hosting SummerSlam. It last hosted the event in 1996 when SummerSlam was held at Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse.

WWE chronicled its history with Cleveland in this video posted on its social media accounts:

Jelly Roll at SummerSlam: Country singer plays ""Liar"" in the WWE ring

Triple H welcomed the crowd to SummerSlam before turning it back over to Jelly Roll, who then played ""Liar"" with his whole band in the ring as a video package previewing SummerSlam played across the screen.

Watch Jelly Roll sing ""God Bless America"" at SummerSlam

Country superstar Jelly Roll kicked things off with ""God Bless America.""

SummerSlam host The Miz rides into SummerSlam with Maryse and R-Truth

SummerSlam host The Miz, along with his wife, former WWE superstar Maryse make their grand entrance ahead of the event via The Miz Express bus.

The Miz is a Cleveland native.

Oh, and his former tag team partner R-Truth provided his usual laughs as he came off the bus. He called the tag team of Johnny Gargano, who was wearing a Cleveland Browns jersey, and Tommaso Ciampa, who are known as DIY, D-Generation X. D-X, of course, is not Gargano and Ciampa. D-X is the Hall of Fame group of Triple H, Shawn Michaels, Road Dogg, X-Pac and others.

Gargano is also a Cleveland native.

Jelly Roll will perform at SummerSlam

WWE has a long history of connecting with music stars for their big events.

The two worlds collide again at SummerSlam when country music star Jelly Roll will perform at Cleveland Browns Stadium.

Jelly Roll just tore the house down at Milwaukee's Harley Fest last week. He caught up with WWE's Chief Content Officer Paul ""Triple H"" Levesque inside the stadium on Saturday afternoon.

""When we can all get together — we love his music and he loves our product and we share that passion together it's the absolute best,"" Triple H said in the video with Jelly Roll.

Jelly Roll was beaming.

""We're watching every week,"" he said. ""Crazy. Awesome.""

Triple H makes way to SummerSlam

Paul ""Triple H"" Levesque is ready for ""an epic night"" at SummerSlam.

Seth Rollins arrives for SummerSlam, has interview with Michael Cole

Seth ""Freakin"" Rollins has arrived for SummerSlam. He doesn't have a match, but he has an important job as the special guest referee of the Drew McIntyre vs. CM Punk match.

Rollins lost his world title match against McIntyre at Money in the Bank last month thanks in part to the interference of CM Punk. Rollins and Punk go way back and were rumored to be in line for a match at WrestleMania this year had Punk not been injured.

WWE SummerSlam 2024 predictions

Drew McIntyre defeats CM Punk

This is the only match that isn't for a championship. But it might be the most anticipated. The match has been over six months in the making ever since CM Punk was injured at the hands of McIntyre at the Royal Rumble in late January. Punk has been rehabbing his injury but his presence has been felt, costing McIntyre matches and championship opportunities at every turn. Oh, and then there is special guest referee Seth Rollins, who has a long history with both superstars. And then there is the extra excitement of seeing CM Punk in an actual match. It will be his first televised singles match in WWE since January 2014. Rollins will clearly get involved. I see him costing Punk the match and McIntyre gets revenge on Punk and a much-needed win.

Cody Rhodes defeats Solo Sikoa to retain the Undisputed WWE Championship

While we probably won't see the likes of John Cena and The Undertaker like we did at WrestleMania in the last Bloodline Rules match involving Cody Rodes and The Bloodline, expect a lot of interferences and a chaotic finish again. And expect Cody Rhodes to come out on top and continue a title reign that he began at WrestleMania 40. The big question is whether Roman Reigns will return as well as The Rock in the aftermath to set Solo Sikoa and the new Bloodline straight.

Gunther defeats Damian Priest to win the World Heavyweight Championship

I've gone back and forth on this one but am now leaning toward The Ring General winning his first world title. I see fellow Judgment Day member Finn Balor costing Priest the title. Gunther lost his Intercontinental championship at WrestleMania, ending his historic title reign. At WWE's second biggest premium live event, Gunther won't lose again. A rivalry between Balor and Priest has been building and a feud into the fall between them should be hot as The Judgment Day further fractures.

Liv Morgan defeats Rhea Ripley to retain the Women's World Championship

The Liv Morgan Revenge Tour has been sizzling since she won the women's world title. She took out Ripley this spring and now Mami is looking for her own revenge. Ripley got Dominik Mysterio back in her clutches, but something tells me that Dirty Dom will provide an unlikely assist to Morgan to help her retain her title. But this rivalry will be far from over after SummerSlam.

Bron Breakker defeats Sami Zayn to win the Intercontinental Championship

In a rematch of Money in the Bank, Bron Breakker breaks through for his first singles championship on the WWE main roster. He came up just short at WWE's last premium live event to fan favorite Zayn. But come SummerSlam Breakker's power will be too much for Zayn, who won the IC title back at WrestleMania.

LA Knight defeats Logan Paul to win the United States Championship

Whose time is it? LA Knight's!

The Megastar has been one of the most popular superstars for well over a year now. And SummerSlam is the perfect time to put the title on him.

Nia Jax defeats Bayley to win the WWE Women's Championship

The winner of the Queen of the Ring earlier this summer has been a dominant force since she returned to WWE last fall. There aren't too many wrestlers who get heat like Nia. Bayley, meanwhile, has been a popular babyface since she made her turn earlier this year. Tiffany Stratton and her Money in the Bank also looms large. Nia's strength will be the difference and she'll capture her first individual title since 2018."

After a second song from Jelly Roll, Rhea Ripley made her way out to challenge Liv Morgan for the women's world title. Dominik Mysterio accompanied Mami as usual.

Morgan rolled out of the ring to play some mind games, but The Eradicator gave chase. The champion smiled as Ripley looked frustrated at not being able to catch her. She finally faked Morgan out and got her hands on her.

Dom cheered as Mami hit a series of clotheslines followed by a suplex. Ripley sold an injured shoulder as if it was dislocated so she could pop it back in eventually.

Morgan began focusing on the injury. Dom sacrificed himself to save Ripley from a suicide dive, but seeing him hurt upset her more. She popped her shoulder back in and went after the champ.

With the exception of the dislocated shoulder being a bit cheesy, most of this bout was entertaining. We saw a lot of storytelling, so they were taking their time and making each move count instead of trying to go 100 mph.

Dom stopped Ripley from using a chair and reminded her she couldn't win that way. Morgan used the distraction to hit Oblivion for a close two-count. Dom distracted the ref, and Morgan ended up hitting a second Oblivion on the chair to get the win.

Dom smiled knowing his evil plan had worked.

A lot of this was overbooked and overdramatic, but it was done in such a way that it was easy to have fun with it.

Ripley looked like she wanted to kill Dom after he kissed Morgan, so Raw should be very interesting on Monday.

Result: Morgan defeated Ripley

After months of animosity, Women’s World Champion Liv Morgan wanted no part of challenger Rhea Ripley early in the match.

Once Ripley caught Morgan, it was all one-way traffic, with Morgan on the backfoot. Ripley looked to wrap up the match early when she hit a Riptide onto the top turnbuckle, but her second attempt failed.

Just as Mami looked dominant, Morgan threw Ripley into the ring post, with the challenger’s shoulder appearing to pop out and Ripley screaming “it’s out.”

In an intense moment, Ripley threw herself into the announce table, resetting her shoulder back into place to the shock of Morgan and the WWE Universe.

After coming up just short when he challenged Sami Zayn for the Intercontinental Title at WWE Money in the Bank, Bron Breakker swung for the fences at the opening bell by immediately trying to hit a Spear. Zayn, however, moved out of the way and caused Breakker to crash shoulder-first into the ring post.

Breakker fought through the pain, but Zayn landed a Blue Thunder Bomb and exploder suplex.

As Zayn went for the Helluva Kick, Breakker struck with the Spear prior to connecting with a second momentous Spear, winning the Intercontinental Title for the first time in his career.

Action was at a premium between United States Champion Logan Paul and LA Knight, as Paul hit the ring with Machine Gun Kelly, and The Megastar smashed a window on The Maverick’s Hummer and dropped him with a neckbreaker on the announce table – and all of that occurred before the match began.

Once the bell rang, Paul hit a huge springboard moonsault from the ring to the outside, wowing the WWE Universe with his freakish athleticism.

Knight impressed as well, hitting a huge fisherman’s superplex and nearly winning the match in extraordinary fashion.

Irate at Paul’s entourage, Knight pulled The Maverick’s buddies over the ringside barricade and stomped them before Paul threw The Megastar into the ring post.

After MGK gave Paul his brass knuckles, Paul blasted Knight with the weapon before readying for a springboard somersault clothesline. Just as The Maverick was about to clobber his challenger, Knight countered with the BFT before scoring the pinfall to claim his first championship in WWE.



Nia Jax def. Bayley to win the WWE Women’s Championship

Queen Nia Jax can add another piece of gold to her trophy cabinet after dethroning Bayley to win the WWE Women’s Title.

Bayley hit a huge Bayley-to-Belly, and Jax landed an Annihilator, but both kicked out of the devastating maneuvers.

In fact, The Role Model became the first Superstar to kick out of the Annihilator, leaving the Queen exasperated.

In an awesome moment, Bayley summoned all her strength to carry Jax halfway across the ring and drop her with a powerbomb. Bayley immediately followed with the Flying Elbow, but once again Jax kicked out.

With both Superstars exhausted, Ms. Money in the Bank Tiffany Stratton ran down to the ring, seemingly looking to cash in her contract. Bayley blasted Stratton with a right hand when she hopped onto the apron, but the distraction resulted in Jax hitting two Annihilators to crown herself WWE Women’s Champion.



Drew McIntyre def. CM Punk with Special Guest Referee Seth “Freakin” Rollins

At each other’s throats for months, CM Punk and Drew McIntyre had a chance to finally unload on one another.

As soon as the bell rang, Special Guest Referee Seth “Freakin” Rollins had to get out of dodge as Punk and McIntyre viciously pummeled each other.

McIntyre landed the first big blow when the fight spilled to ringside, hitting a catapult to send Punk throat-first into the steel rungs under the ring.

The Scottish Warrior kept up the onslaught by delivering several powerbombs before bringing a steel chair into the ring. Just as McIntyre was about to use the weapon, Rollins took it away.



Rollins looked to hit McIntyre with the steel chair, but McIntyre ducked. Luckily, Rollins stopped himself before he connected with Punk.

As Rollins thew away the weapon, Punk rolled up McIntyre, but Rollins was slow to the count, allowing McIntyre to kick out.

Punk eventually let his emotions get the better of him as he took back the bracelet that McIntyre stole from him by removing it from The Scottish Warrior’s wrist.

His emotional act nearly cost him, as McIntyre clobbered Punk with the Claymore, but Punk kicked out.

As Punk was about to hit McIntyre with the GTS, Punk saw that Rollins had his bracelet on his wrist. McIntyre used the fracas to hit Punk into Rollins. Punk’s GTS attempt was successful, but Rollins was again slow to the count, allowing McIntyre to kick out once more.

Punk became incensed at The Visionary as the two engaged in a war of words that ended in a GTS from Punk to Rollins.

With Rollins out of the equation, McIntyre booted Punk below the belt before nailing the Claymore. Rollins then reluctantly counted the three, and McIntyre left the victor and with Punk’s bracelet back on his wrist.

Gunther def. Damian Priest to win the World Heavyweight Title

World Heavyweight Champion Damian Priest and Gunther engaged in a physical battle in their first one-on-one meeting.

Priest took the fight to The Ring General, leaving Gunther’s chest bloodied after leveling him with chop after chop.

As Gunther looked to have Priest down and out, Finn Bálor came down to encourage his Judgment Day brother, though Gunther soon booted him in the face through the ropes.

Gunther looked like a gladiator with his scarred chest as he berated Priest and continued to pummel him.

Priest eventually found his next gear, rallying to hit Gunther with the Razor’s Edge and the South of Heaven Chokeslam.

Priest had Gunther pinned, but Bálor shockingly put Gunther’s foot on the ring ropes to break up the three-count.

As Priest locked eyes with Bálor, Gunther synched in the Sleeper Hold while Priest began to fade with Bálor watching. Priest escaped the Sleeper, but Gunther locked it back in after the champion tried to attack Bálor, causing Priest to pass out and winning his first World Heavyweight Title.

Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes def. Solo Sikoa in a Bloodline Rules Match

Cody Rhodes once again had to endure Bloodline Rules in an Undisputed WWE Championship match, this time against self-proclaimed Tribal Chief Solo Sikoa.

Sikoa dominated Rhodes in the early goings, hitting a Spinning Solo and two running headbutts.

As The American Nightmare landed the Cross Rhodes, Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa arrived to try to help Sikoa win the title.

With Rhodes down, Kevin Owens and Randy Orton entered the fray, taking Loa and Tonga out of the equation as they fought to the backstage area.

Rhodes used the ring steps on Sikoa, but Sikoa caught him with a huge Spear for a long two-count.

As Rhodes fought back, he was readying for the third Cross Rhodes until Jacob Fatu assaulted him.

Fatu delivered a devastating frog splash onto Rhodes through the announce table, and Sikoa hit another huge splash, but Rhodes once again kicked out.

Just as Sikoa looked dominant, Roman Reigns made his shocking return to a thunderous ovation from the WWE Universe.

As the Cleveland faithful anticipated what Reigns would do, The Head of the Table hit the ring and blasted a shellshocked Sikoa with a Superman Punch and a Spear before giving a subtle nod to Rhodes and leaving the squared circle.

Moments later, Rhodes blasted Sikoa with a Cross Rhodes to win his second Bloodline Rules Match and retain his Undisputed WWE Championship.

Reigns, who was halfway up the entranceway, locked eyes with the victorious Rhodes as SummerSlam concluded."

WWE Bash in Berlin 2024 Predicted Matches

World Heavyweight Championship Match: GUNTHER vs. Drew McIntyre

GUNTHER, fresh off his victory over Damian Priest, will likely defend his World Heavyweight Championship against Drew McIntyre.

- Advertisement -

McIntyre’s win over CM Punk at SummerSlam sets him up as a formidable challenger, and if they are going to be in the Hell in a Cell structure at Bad Blood (which we’re predicting), then he will probably need to interfere here to set up that blow off match.

WWE Women’s Championship Match: Nia Jax vs. Michin

Nia Jax begins her reign as WWE Women’s Champion by facing a fresh challenger, Michin.

With Michin’s impressive performances on NXT and SmackDown recently, she emerges as a strong option for Jax’s first challenger.

This match offers a fresh dynamic while keeping the door open for a potential rematch between Jax and Bayley at Bad Blood.

WWE Tag Team Championship Match: Cody Rhodes and Randy Orton vs. The Bloodline

Cody Rhodes continues his feud with The Bloodline, teaming up with Randy Orton to challenge for the WWE Tag Team Championship.

We could easily see Randy turning on Cody here, setting up a future match between them and a potential program between now and the Royal Rumble.

Intercontinental Championship Match: Bron Breakker vs. Ilja Dragunov

Bron Breakker, the new Intercontinental Champion, will likely face Ilja Dragunov.

Considering Dragunov’s history in Germany with the wXw promotion and his involvement in the Sami Zayn/Breakker feud, this makes all of the sense in the world and needs to happen.

Mixed Tag Team Match: Damian Priest and Rhea Ripley vs. Dominik Mysterio and Liv Morgan

Following the shocking betrayals within The Judgment Day at SummerSlam, we think that Damian Priest and Rhea Ripley will seek revenge against Dominik Mysterio and Liv Morgan.

Getting this match on the card could then set up two singles matches between Balor/Priest and Morgan/Ripley at Bad Blood, with the women’s match potentially being in the HIAC.

We will check back when the WWE Bash in Berlin match card is finalized and will grade our own predictions.

Reigns returned to WWE for the first time since losing to Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania 40 in April, aiding his former rival in defeating the replacement Tribal Chief, Sikoa, in the main event of SummerSlam.

Cleveland hosted a dramatic event chock-full of betrayal, tension and misdeeds. Rhodes successfully defended his undisputed WWE championship in Saturday's main event thanks to Reigns' unlikely assistance. Drew McIntyre scored vengeance against CM Punk with Seth Rollins serving as a distraction, and the Judgement Day imploded from multiple betrayals.

Beyond those storyline developments, there were four title changes on the show, notable since WWE has not seen most of its main roster championships switch hands since WrestleMania.

2024 WWE SummerSlam results, grades



Women's World Championship -- Liv Morgan (c) vs. Rhea Ripley: SummerSlam's opening match had two primary subplots: The love triangle involving Dominik Mysterio and a cat-and-mouse game. Morgan was apprehensive about a straightforward fight, preferring to flee and find openings. Both superstars flirted with Dominik to try and get under their rival's skin. Ripley eventually got her hands on Morgan but her offense was short-lived. The champion hurled Ripley into the corner post, aggravating her previously legitimate shoulder injury. Ripley, in character, claimed, ""My shoulder is out,"" but refused to concede. Mysterio, who accompanied Ripley to the ring, showed his allegiance by throwing himself in front of Morgan's suicide dive. A bizarre spot saw Ripley ram her shoulder into the announcers' table to pop it back into place. Morgan looked horrified as Ripley stormed the ring.

Morgan countered Riptide with a DDT before Ripley locked in a one-arm Prism Lock. Morgan's brightest moment was a crucifix driver and armbar. The shoulder spot became a recurring bit. Ripley repeatedly rammed her shoulder into the turnbuckle to put it back in place. Morgan tried to get herself disqualified -- titles don't change hands via DQ or countout -- by hitting Ripley with a steel chair. Ripley countered Morgan by hitting her with a Riptide. Ripley picked up the chair instead of going for the pinfall. Mysterio tried to talk some sense into Ripley, during which Morgan pushed Ripley into Mysterio and hit Oblivion. Ripley kicked out at two, but a second distraction by Mysterio allowed Morgan to hit her finisher on a steel chair. Post-match, Mysterio handed Morgan the title and kissed her, confirming his betrayal of Ripley. Mysterio flipped off the SummerSlam crowd as a seething Ripley looked on. An angry Damian Priest interrogated Judgement Day about Mysterio's actions shortly after the mach.

Morgan vs. Ripley was arguably SummerSlam's second-best storyline coming in, behind CM Punk vs. Drew McIntyre. This is an instance where a deceptive finish was welcome, perfectly playing into the soap opera-heavy story. Ripley looked strong and sympathetic in defeat, Morgan and Mysterio elevated their profiles in victory. It's not a five-star athletic match but an excellent representation of this type of pro wrestling. Morgan (c) def. Ripley via pinfall to retain the title. Grade: A

Intercontinental Championship -- Sami Zayn (c) vs. Bron Breakker: Saturday's sophomore match was the antithesis of the opening contest, which was a fast-paced workhorse match. Both men made crucial mistakes early by going for signature moves. An overzealous Breakker hurt his shoulder spearing the ring post, and Zayn whiffed on a Helluva Kick. The challenger hit a nice Frankensteiner off the top ropes, an ode to his uncle Scott Steiner. The champ hit Breakker with a Blue Thunder Bomb and an exploder suplex in what felt like 5 minutes into the match.

Zayn lined Breakker up for a match-ending Helluva Kick but was intercepted by a nasty spear. The Cleveland crowd barked in favor of Breakker as the challenger followed up with an even meaner spear to win the intercontinental title. Blink and you missed most of this match. The crowd had no time to be bored, but the short runtime left something to be desired from two superstars with more to give. On the plus side, it sets up a trilogy match that hopefully will be granted more time. Breakker def. Zayn (c) to win the title. Grade: B-

United States Championship -- Logan Paul (c) vs. LA Knight: Paul was accompanied by musician Machine Gun Kelly. Knight rolled up in Paul's Prime-branded Hummer that he stole on SmackDown, busting out the blue-tinted windows with a steel pipe. Fists started flying before the match. Knight repeatedly slammed Paul's head into the announce table before planting the champ with a burning hammer neckbreaker onto the table. Knight rolled his opponent into the ring and the match was underway. The match was evenly contested throughout. The crowd was clearly behind the challenger despite Paul being born nearby.

Knight nearly won after landing a big top-rope elbow drop, but Paul answered nicely with a springboard clothesline. Paul's athleticism is remarkable, and he often delivers a memorable spot. Saturday's might have been his best yet. Paul executed an incredible spinning springboard moonsault to the outside. Paul subsequently countered Knight's signature BFT with a haymaker punch. The commentators made a big deal of Paul's titanium fist but Knight kicked out at the last moment. The moonsault wasn't the match's only huge spot. Knight landed a gnarly avalanche brainbuster that was legitimately scary to witness. Fortunately, Paul seemed unharmed. MGK slipped brass knuckles to Paul in the closing moments. The champion cracked Knight with the foreign weapon but couldn't seal the deal. Knight flawlessly countered a Buckshot Lariat into a BFT to win the title.

Knight and Paul had fantastic chemistry. The execution of the counters was terrific and the two major spots looked beautiful. Knight was overdue for a singles title reign, his first main roster belt in a 21-year-long career. The U.S. title has a good chance of being on par with the intercontinental title under Knight's watch. Knight def. Paul (c) via pinfall to win the title. Grade: A

WWE Women's Championship -- Bayley (c) vs. Nia Jax: Jax entered the ring wearing her crown, a reminder that she earned this title shot by winning the Queen of the Ring tournament in May. David vs. Goliath showdown. The champion's speed and experience provided her with windows of opportunities, but Jax's sheer strength often gave her the edge. Jax relied primarily on power moves, including her signature Samoan drops inside and outside the ring. Jax was gobsmacked when Bayley kicked out of her Banzai drop finisher, dubbed the A-Nia-Later.

Bayley showed plenty of underdog spirit but also shrugged off her label as the undersized champion. Bayley slid underneath as Jax set up for a second A-Nia-Later, lifting up the challenger with a powerbomb. It won't have the cultural impact of Hulk Hogan power-slamming Andre the Giant, but Bayley's feat was praiseworthy as she walked around with Jax on her shoulders. Ultimately, Bayley could not overcome the power disadvantage. Tiffany Stratton teased a Money in the Bank cash-in, giving Jax the space to hit two powerbombs and two mores A-Nia-Later to become champion. Jax and Stratton celebrated post-match.

This match won't get a lot of love compared to tonight's heavy-hitters, but it was a solid showing. Bayley's powerbomb was legitimately impressive, and Jax continued to grow as a performer. Having Jax as champion and Stratton as Ms. Money in the Bank will create an interesting dynamic for their partnership moving forward. Jax def. Bayley (c) via pinfall to win the title. Grade: B

CM Punk vs. Drew McIntyre (Seth Rollins as special guest referee): The tension between Punk, McIntyre and Rollins was palpable. Punk and McIntyre brawled off the bat. Each man's refusal to adhere to five counts implored Rollins to get physically involved. The action spilled outside as Punk repeatedly rammed McIntyre's head into steel steps. McIntyre retaliated by swinging Punk into the announce table. While Rollins diligently applied the rules early, he ignored countouts to let McIntyre and Punk beat each other. McIntyre manhandled Punk through the middle portion, chucking Punk around and slapping him in the face. The dynamic between Rollins and the competing superstars was a primary factor in the match. McIntyre compelled Rollins to turn a blind eye to using a steel chair. Rollins snatched the chair from McIntyre, prompting McIntyre to pie-face the referee. Rollins attempted to hit McIntyre with the chair but nearly struck Punk instead. Punk pieced together a flurry of signature moves -- including a top rope elbow drop and Anaconda Vice, setting up a crucial theme in the match.

Punk made a rare psychological error, retrieving the sentimental bracelet McIntyre stole from him instead of completing the submission. McIntyre took advantage by cracking a distracted Punk with a Claymore but only managed a two count. Notably, Rollins took the bracelet off the mat and wore it around his wrist. Punk lifted McIntyre onto his shoulders for Go To Sleep but was again distracted by the bracelet. Punk saw Rollins wearing the bracelet and dropped McIntyre off his shoulders. Punk accused Rollins of playing mind games, which Rollins staunchly denied. McIntyre shoved Punk into Rollins and set up a Future Shock DDT, the same move that legitimately injured Punk at the Royal Rumble. Punk countered with the Go To Sleep but Rollins was still recovering on the floor. Rollins rolled back in but McIntyre kicked out after a delayed two-count.

An argument ensued between Punk and Rollins, the latter of whom proclaimed that Punk wasn't welcome in WWE after having his buttons pushed. Punk hit Rollins with a GTS before turning his attention to McIntyre. McIntyre kicked Punk in the groin -- a callback to Clash at the Castle where Punk did the same to McIntyre -- and hit a match-ending Claymore. A compromised Rollins made a slow, hesitant three-count to award McIntyre the victory. McIntyre snatched the bracelet post-match as he mocked Punk.

Much like Morgan vs. Ripley, this match prioritized long-running drama over in-ring action. It was an all-around success. Punk's rare tactical errors suggested ring rust, McIntyre finally scored a measure of vengeance on Punk, and Rollins was reintroduced as an integral part of the feud. WWE has many ways to pivot from here. Options are a good thing. McIntyre def. Punk via pinfall. Grade: A

World Heavyweight Championship -- Damian Priest (c) vs. GUNTHER: Priest entered the match as an underdog champion, a stigma emphasized early in the match. GUNTHER overwhelmed Priest with his combination of physical power, technical brilliance and ring generalship. It took a while but Priest turned the tide with a top-rope hurricanrana and his signature Broken Arrow. The next phase of the match was striking-oriented: Priest's MMA-inspired strikes vs. GUNTHER's chops. Priest's dynamic striking was more effective. The champion even managed to make GUNTHER -- arguably WWE's best chopper -- bleed from chops. ""The Ring General"" GUNTHER reputation preceded him. Priest made the mistake of trying a second spinning kick. GUNTHER scouted the move, scooped the leg and planted Priest with a T-bone suplex. GUNTHER followed with a barrage of strikes. Finn Balor tried to will his Judgement Day leader Priest to life as GUNTHER continued to chop the champ's lifeless body.

GUNTHER knocked Balor off the apron, a misdeed that spurred Priest back to life. Priest planted GUNTHER with a Razor's Edge and South of Heaven, but Balor draped GUNTHER's leg over the rope to break the count. Priest wasn't immediately aware of the betrayal but caught the incident on the big screen replay. GUNTHER locked in a rear-naked choke as Priest tried to confront Balor. It appeared that Priest would pass out, but the champ rolled over and nearly pinned GUNTHER. Priest couldn't ignore the treachery and lunged again for Balor. GUNTHER intercepted with a powerbomb and rear-naked choke for the technical submission victory.

The opening match set the table for a complete coup within the Judgement Day. The match was great, but it had some things going against it. The drama-heavy nature of the match was similar to Liv Morgan vs. Rhea Ripley and CM Punk vs. Seth Rollins. There was definitely fan sympathy for Priest, but it didn't feel quite as strong as it did for the night's other heroes. WWE is also heading towards a Bloodline civil war storyline, making a similar storyline involving the Judgement Day not quite as intriguing. Kudos to the parties involved for putting in a hard-hitting effort and doing the best they could within the confines of the story. GUNTHER def. Priest (c) via submission to win the title. Grade: B+

Undisputed WWE Championship -- Cody Rhodes (c) vs. Solo Sikoa (Bloodline Rules): Sikoa notably entered without The Bloodline. Rhodes received encouraging words from the legendary Four Horsemen member Arn Anderson en route to the ring with Arn telling the champ he had friends around. Your mileage will vary on Sikoa as Tribal Chief, but he reminded folks his aura is most potent in singles matches. Sikoa was intimidating, powerful and tactical from the get-go. Sikoa blocked Rhodes' signature fallback mat strike, warning the champ that he's been studied. The main eventers had a back-and-forth match taking place between the ropes and ringside. Sikoa had the better reads for much of the match, allowing him to land big moves. Rhodes capitalized on a small opening to remedy his grief. Rhodes lept onto the corner ropes, intercepting Sikoa with a superplex. Sikoa's hubris got the better of him during a back-and-forth exchange. Sikoa tried to hit Rhodes with his Rhodes' finisher but the champ countered into a Cross Rhodes. The champ didn't have time to capitalize as Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa stormed the ring. The Bloodline dragged Sikoa over Rhodes but the champion kicked out. Queue Kevin Owens and Randy Orton. Rhodes' allies had been absent for weeks after being attacked by The Bloodline but returned on Saturday to even the odds.

The three fan-favorites hit Sikoa with signature moves, yet the challenge managed to shrug his shoulder off the mat for a two-count. Rhodes repeatedly struck Sikoa with steel steps. The champion was prepared to take Sikoa's head off with the stairs, similar to what he did to AJ Styles at Clash at the Castle. Sikoa countered with a spear but was soon after the victim of a pair of Cross Rhodes. The champ lined up Sikoa for a match-ending third consecutive finisher, but Jacob Fatu made his presence known. The Bloodline's new enforcer tore through Rhodes before Sikoa crawled over for the cover. Rhodes managed to kick out at the final moment but it only made things worse. Fatu lunged again, laying Rhodes across the announcers' table and driving him through the table with a top rope splash. It appeared Fatu may have legitimately injured his ankle or knee on the landing. Sikoa rolled Rhodes into the ring and hit a top rope splash, yet the fighting champion kicked out. Rhodes hit a Cody Cutter as both men laid fatigued.

That's when Roman Reigns' music hit, eliciting a huge ovation from the Cleveland crowd. Reigns took his time entering the ring. he came face-to-face with Sikoa, slugging him with a Superman punch and shredding him with a spear. Reigns gave Rhodes an acknowledging nod before exiting the ring. Rhodes hit Sikoa with a match-ending Cross Rhodes and stared down Reigns while covering Sikoa.

Candidly, I was prepared to give this match a lower grade. I was burnt out from the sheer quantity of slow burn dramatic matches on the card. But people mostly remember the finale and SummerSlam's finale was awesome. The live audience came unglued for Reigns, who set the stage for an incredible Bloodline civil war that will probably carry SmackDown into November's Survivor Series PPV. Some logic gaps dragged the match down. The most notable was Fatu's late arrival. There were a few instances where Sikoa could have believably lost, putting Fatu's absence into question. Still, it was a phenomenal conclusion to SummerSlam that sets the scene for the rest of 2024. Rhodes (c) def. Sikoa via pinfall to retain the title. Grade: A"
WWE SummerSlam 2024 Results: Liv Morgan Defeats Rhea Ripley.,https://itrwrestling.com/news/wwe-summerslam-2024-results/,"The WWE SummerSlam PLE featured Cody Rhodes against Solo Sikoa in the main event while Drew McIntyre faced CM Punk.

WWE SummerSlam took place at Cleveland Browns Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio.

It was Michael Cole, Corey Graves and Pat McAfee on commentary. Jelly Roll sang his song “Liar” to start the PLE.

Match #1: Liv Morgan defeated Rhea Ripley to retain the Women’s World Championship. After Morgan brought a steel chair into the ring, Ripley hit a Riptide slam. No cover. Ripley grabbed the steel chair so Dominik grabbed it out of her hands. The fans booed while Dominik said that you can’t win the title like this, which is true. Morgan dropkicked Ripley in the back to knock Dominik off the apron. Morgan hit Oblivion for two. Dominik slid the chair into the ring, he distracted the referee and Morgan capitalized with Oblivion onto the steel chair. Morgan sent the chair out of the ring. Morgan covered Ripley for the pinfall win.

After the match, Dominik Mysterio had a smirk on his face while Morgan celebrated with the Women’s World Title. Dominik picked up Morgan and Dominik kissed Morgan on the lips. Cole: “Dominik, you sorry two-timing son of a bitch!” The fans were booing loudly while Dominik put his arm around Liv’s shoulder and walked away with her. The fans were booing Dominik and Morgan while Pat called Dominik a “piece of s**t” to describe Dirty Dom. The fans were booing loudly for this.

Following some videos and commercials, The Judgment Day’s clubhouse was shown with Damian Priest asking Finn Balor, JD McDonagh and Carlito where Dominik was. Priest asked Balor if he knew Dominik was going to do that. Balor said he didn’t know. Balor, JD & Carlito left to go look for Dominik. Priest said “I’m going to kill this kid” about Dominik.

Match #2: Bron Breakker defeated Sami Zayn by pinfall to win the Intercontinental Championship. Breakker hit two Spears in a row to get the win. It was the shortest match on the show that went about six minutes.

Stephanie McMahon was shown sitting at ringside. She was clapping. The fans cheered.

Logan Paul and LA Knight fought around the ringside area repeatedly for about five minutes before their match started. Knight gave Paul a neckbreaker on the commentary table, but the table didn’t break.

Match #3: LA Knight defeated Logan Paul by pinfall to win the United States Championship. Paul had rapper MGK at ringside and MGK handed Paul some brass knuckles. Paul hit Knight in the head with the brass knucks, but it was like a jab rather than a big punch. Paul went for a Buckshot Lariat, Knight avoided it and Knight hit Blount Force Trauma aka BFT for the pinfall win.

Match #4: Nia Jax defeated Bayley by pinfall to win the WWE Women’s Championship. Tiffany Stratton ran down to the ring with a referee to tease cashing in Money in the Bank, but Bayley punched Stratton to knock her off the apron. Jax hit Bayley with two Powerbombs.

Match #5:Drew McIntyre defeated CM Punk by pinfall in a match with Seth “Freakin” Rollins as the special guest referee. Punk hit Drew with a GTS and Rollins was knocked off the apron to the floor, so when Rollins finally got back in the ring, Drew kicked out at two. Punk got in Rollins’ face and yelled at him about being slow with the count. Rollins said that we don’t need or want Punk here. Rollins said that not everything is about Punk. Rollins said it’s not always about you, a**hole. Punk picked up Rollins and hit him with the GTS. Punk: “It ain’t always about me, but it’s never about you.” Punk got his bracelet back. When Punk turned around, Drew hit Punk with a low blow like Punk did to Drew in the past. Drew was back up and hit the Claymore Kick so Rollins counted the pin for the one…two…and three! Rollins did a count that was at a regular speed although there was a bit of a delay before the third count.

After the match, Drew McIntyre grabbed the bracelet off Punk’s arm and Drew put it back on his arm. Drew put his foot on Punk’s chest and posed as the victor of the match. Referees checked on Punk in the ring as Drew walked away.

Damian Priest was in the locker room getting ready for his match. Finn Balor walked in saying they looked everywhere and couldn’t find him. Priest said he probably left. They both said sorry about what happened earlier. Balor said that The Judgment Day comes first. Balor said he knows Priest doesn’t want him out there, but if he changes his mind, just say the word.

Match #6: Gunther defeated Damian Priest by pinfall to become the new World Heavyweight Champion. Finn Balor made his way down to the ring during the match. Priest hit South of Heaven near the ropes, so when Priest covered, Balor put Gunther’s left leg on the bottom rope! They showed a replay of what Balor did. The announcers said that Priest never saw it because of how he covered Gunther, but Priest saw the replay on the video screen. Balor had a smirk on his face. Priest tried to go after Balor, but Gunther grabbed Priest and applied a sleeper hold on the mat. When Priest got back up, Priest grabbed Balor around the throat. Gunther picked up Priest and hit a Powerbomb. Gunther applied a sleeper hold on the mat with a body scissors around the waist. The referee raised Priest’s hand, Priest was out and Gunther got the win.

The Awesome Truth duo of The Miz & R-Truth were in the ring for a promo. The Miz said that this show set the record for an American SummerSlam attendance record with 57,791 in the crowd. Grayson Waller and Austin Theory aka A-Town Down Under showed up at ringside for the interruption. Waller and Theory kept on insulting the crowd as well as Jelly Roll in the audience. That led to Jelly Roll going into the ring, helping Miz & Truth and Jelly hit Waller & Theory with chairs to the back. Jelly Roll also gave Theory a Chokeslam. The trio of Jelly, Miz & Truth did John Cena’s Five Knuckle Shuffle fist drop on Theory. The fans enjoyed it.

The WWE Bash In Berlin PLE takes place on Saturday, August 31st. That’s four weeks away with a 1 p.m. ET start time.

Who Won The WWE SummerSlam Main Event?

The Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes was shown on his extravagant bus where he walked his beloved dog Pharoah on a leash. I saw Cody mention recently that this was Pharoah’s final trip on the road (Graves mentioned it as well) and Cody left Pharoah with WWE Hall of Famer Arn Anderson, who gave Cody some words of encouragement. Arn said that 54,000 people think that Cody is a damn fine WWE Champion. Arn said that those four guys were coming for Cody. Arn said that he’s got a little influence, had a few conversations and told Cody that he has a few friends who are on the way. As Cody kept on walking, he left Pharoah with a friend and was given his American Nightmare jacket. Cody put on some headgear and made his way into the arena.

Match #7: Cody Rhodes defeated Solo Sikoa by pinfall in a Bloodline Rules Match to retain the Undisputed WWE Championship. After Cody hit Solo with Cross Rhodes, that’s when the interference began. Tama Tonga & Tonga Loa beat up Cody, so Kevin Owens and Randy Orton made the save. Those four guys went fighting to the back. After Cody hit Solo with the Cross Rhodes two more times, Jacob Fatu showed up for an attack. Jacob went up top and Jacob jumped off the top with a Superfly Splash that put Cody through the table. Jacob was selling a right leg injury because he had a rough landing when he hit the table. Back in the ring, Solo went up top and hit an Uso Splash for two. Cody was back up with a superkick. Cody went to the turnbuckle and jumped off with a Cody Cutter.

A graphic appeared saying “Head of the Table” as the familiar music of the real Tribal Chief played and Roman Reigns walked out wearing an “OTC” shirt since he’s the Original Tribal Chief. The fans cheered loudly for Reigns as he slowly walked down to the ring while both guys were down in the ring. Roman went into the ring and nailed Solo Sikoa with a Superman Punch. The fans loved it. Reigns nailed his cousin Solo with a Spear. Reigns looked over at Cody, who was seated up against the ropes. Reigns looked out at the crowd as they chanted “holy s**t” for his return. Reigns nodded at Cody as a sign of respect. The fans chanted “Thank You Roman” for Reigns. Cody picked up Solo, Cody hit Cross Rhodes and Cody pinned Solo while looking at Reigns and the referee counted one…two…and three to give Cody the win.

Cody Rhodes celebrated on the turnbuckle while staring at Roman Reigns. Solo Sikoa was screaming at ringside about what happened. Reigns pointed at his shirt that said “OTC” meaning Original Tribal Chief. Cole said that the real Tribal Chief is back and God help Solo Sikoa. Cody continued to celebrate. The show ended there.

KELLER’S WWE SUMMERSLAM REPORT

AUGUST 3, 2024

CLEVELAND, OHIO AT CLEVELAND BROWNS STADIUM

STREAMED LIVE ON PEACOCK & PPV

Commentators: Michael Cole, Corey Graves, Pat McAfee



Ring Announcer: Alicia Taylor

CLICK HERE TO LISTEN TO OUR POST-SHOW PODCAST

-The pre-show ended with the panel discussing which match they most anticipated. They acknowledged that C.M. Punk vs. Drew McIntyre is a pick of many fans even if there’s no title on the line.

-They went to Michael Cole who commented on clips of various wrestlers arriving at the arena. Cole said Liv and Rhea would kick off the show.

-Jelly Roll sang “God Bless America” live from mid-ring.

-Paul “Triple H” Levesque, WWE’s Chief Content Officer, made his ring entrance to the start the show. In a grinding voice, he welcomed everyone to Summerslam. He threw back to Jelly Roll who performed “Liar.” They interspersed clips of WWE wrestlers and fans with the live performance.

-Miz stood in the stands as host of the show and said he wanted to feel the live energy of the crowd.

(1) LIV MORGAN vs. RHEA RIPLEY (w/Dominik Mysterio) – WWE Women’s Title match

As Ripley and Dom walked out, Cole called Dom “Rhea’s boy toy.” He noted she never lost the title after holding it for 379 days. They went to Cole, Graves, and McAfee at ringside. Cole said over 50,000 were in attendance. He noted the referee is wearing a “referee cam.” It had a hard liquor sponsor. Liv then made her entrance. The bell rang 14 minutes into the hour. Liv ducked out to ringside early and then rolled back into the ring once Rhea went after her. Liv laughed. Rhea returned to the ring. Liv ducked out again.

Once Rhea got in some offense, Dom smiled and applauded. Ripley high-fived Dom, then licked his cheek. Cole said he can’t stand Dom, but he’s doing something right since he has Ripley. Graves said there should be an ordinance against the pheromones that he’s giving off. McAfee’s (odd and disconcerting) obsession with poop came up again. He rambled about a “pieces of crap” and said “people look like after a poop has happened and you get your butt wiped.” He said Dom is “a poop stain.” (Please stop.) Cole chuckled and said he was painting a picture.

Ripley headbutted Liv and drove her into the top turnbuckle. Liv threw Ripley into the corner turnbuckle and the grabbed her shoulder in pain. She said, “It’s out!” The ref asked if he should stop it. She shouted, “No!” Cole said the injured shoulders is probably dislocated. She fought off Liv and then rolled to the floor near Dom. Liv kicked Ripley into the ringside steps. Ripley kept holding her shoulder. Liv stomped on it and rolled her into the ring and scored a two count at 6:00.

Liv leaped at Ripley at ringside, but Dom shoved Ripley out of the way and so Liv landed on him. Ripley threw Liv back into the ring. She kept clutching at her shoulder. Ripley rammed her shoulder into the announce desk to knock it back into socket. Cole said he’s never seen anything like that. McAfee said it was mind-blowing. Graves compared it to something Finn Balor did at a Summerslam years ago. She went on the attack against Liv and scored a two count.

Liv countered a Rip Tide attempt with a DDT for a near fall. Ripley went on a stretch of offense with more two counts. Liv yanked Ripley’s arm over the middle rope and then grabbed a chair. Ripley battled back and finally landed a Rip Tide. Graves said that had to be cathartic. Ripley picked up a chair. Graves said if she swings it, “the gold is gone.” Dom stood on the ring apron and yanked it away from her. The crowd roared. Dom explained she can’t use it or she’ll get DQ’d. Graves said the fans should be applauding. Liv knocked Ripley into Dom, knocking her to the floor. She then hit Oblivion and scored a believable near fall. Fans popped and chanted, “Holy shit!”

Dom ran over and got the ref’s attention. Liv then gave Ripley an Oblivion onto the chair. Liv scored a three count. Cole said, “What the hell?” Dom smiled at ringside.

WINNER: Morgan in 16:00 to retain the Women’s Title.

-Dom then helped Liv up and kissed her. Cole exclaimed, “Dom, you sorry two-timin’ son of a bitch!” McAfee called him a piece of trash. Cole asked if it’s a been a ruse for months. They showed a fuming Ripley in the ring soaking up what happened.

(Keller’s Analysis: Not sure that made any sense. Rhea had multiple chances to win before Dom went far enough to cost her the match. Dom also clearly helped Ripley not get hit by a diving Liv and also helped Ripley not get DQ’d for using a chair. There was no guarantee that Dom would have a chance to actually cost Ripley the match because of how long he waited. The announcers also had to play dumb for way too long after the match considering Dom smiled right after the finish. This was on the lower end of logic and execution for an angle that has been built up for months. The match itself was solid, and Ripley did a great job selling the shoulder.)

-They showed Sami Zayn warming up backstage. [c]

-They cut backstage to the Judgement Day hangout. Damien Priest barged in and grabbed Finn Balor and asked if he knew. Balor said of course he didn’t know. Balor said they should go look for Dom and confront him. J.D. McDonagh told Priest he’s there for him. Priest said, “I’m gonna kill this kid.”

(Keller’s Analysis: Good follow-up to the angle.)

(2) SAMI ZAYN vs. BRON BREAKKER – Intercontinental Championship

The bell rang 43 minutes into the hour. Breakker charged at Sami, who leapfrogged him, so Breakker crashed shoulder-first into the corner. Breakker dropped to the floor and clutched his shoulder. Sami then landed a running flip dive onto Breakker. Sami leaped off the top rope, but Breakker ducked and then clotheslined him.

Breakker gave Sani a Frankensteiner for a near fall at 3:00. McAfee made another reference to poop, saying he “pooped my pants” after Scott Steiner was angry with him for changing the name of the Frankensteiner. Breakker told Sami to quit. Sami slapped him back over and over. Sami set up a Blue Thunder Bomb, but Breaker blocked it. Breakker flipped out of a back suplex but almost landed on his head in the process. The announcers gasped. Sami then gave Breakker a Blue Thunder Bomb for a near fall.

Breakker caught Sami with a knee, but Sami countered with an exploder suplex. When Sami charged, Breakker speared him. Breakker then lowered his straps, ran the ropes, and speared Sami for the three count. “Welcome to the Bron Breakker ear!” exclaimed Cole. Graves said, “Get used to it!”

WINNER: Breakker in 6:00 to capture the Intercontinental Title.

(Keller’s Analysis: Good while it lasted, but it wasn’t formatted to be an epic fight. All in all, a bit anticlimactic given the nature of the feud, but they wanted to put Breakker over strong.) [c]

-A sponsored video clip aired of Drew McIntyre attacking C.M. Punk.

-They showed Stephanie McMahon in the crowd waving. Then they showed scenes of Cleveland’s waterfront. [c]

(3) LOGAN PAUL vs. L.A. KNIGHT – U.S. Title match

Logan made his entrance first. He wore Cleveland brown and tore up a fan sign on his way to the ring. He was joined by MGK, a rapped out of Cleveland. Cole said he works with Jelly Roll. Logan arrived in Logan’s stolen sports-drink branded truck. Knight then bashed in the side window. He said he’s now coming for his U.S. Title. Graves said Knight is guilty of vandalism and grand theft auto and he should have been arrested. As Knight began to enter the ring, Logan knocked him to the floor. Logan went after Knight at ringside. Logan sprayed some of his energy drink into Knight’s face after Knight took time to yell at Knight’s crew at ringside.

Logan took the lid off the announce desk and cleared it of monitors, then tried to throw Knight on it. Knight fought back and rammed Logan’s into the table, although Logan’s hand clearly hit each time and his face didn’t connect. Knight then gave Logan leaping neckbreaker on the announce desk. The table didn’t collapse and they both hit hard. Cole said the match may never officially start. Knight threw Logan into the ring and the ref called for the bell 6 minutes into the second hour.

Knight delivered an inverted atomic drop and a clothesline for a two count. Logan made a comeback and threw Knight shoulder-first into the corner (three matches in a row for a variation of that spot). Cole noted Logan’s first match in WWE was at Summerslam 2022 and beat Miz, then beat Ricochet last year at Summerslam. Fans taunted Logan with a chant of “You suck!” Logan landed a splits legdrop for a two count. Knight fought back and they exchanged wild swings. Logan landed a gut-wrench suplex. He followed with an “overbomb” that looked more like Knight countering a powerbomb to land on Logan. Logan scored a two count.

Graves said Logan is controversial and gets the world talking. “You can pick a side, but you can’t question the talent and ability.” McAfee said he loves the business. Knight recovered and surprised a showboating Logan with a quick powerslam. Both were down and slow to get up. Knight landed a Side Effect. Knight landed a top rope elbowdrop for a two count. Knight lifted Logan onto his shoulders, but Logan slipped free and then landed a springboard clothesline to knock Knight off the ring apron to the floor at 7:00. Logan then landed an impressive springboard moonsault onto Knight at ringside.

Back in the ring, they countered each other including Logan scoring a two count with a backslide as a counter to a BFT. Logan nailed Knight with his right hand for a near fall. Logan looked up, wide-eyed in shock. Logan blocked a BFT attempt. Knight leaped and met Logan on the top rope and superplexed him quickly and scored a two count. The crowd popped for the kickout. Fans were standing at ringside.

Logan raked Knight’s eyes. Logan called for help from one of his followers at ringside. Knight slidekicked Logan. Knight yanked one of the hangers-on, Jeff, to ringside and stomped away at him. Logan threw Knight shoulder-first into the ringpost. MGK handed Logan brass knuckes that he had hanging around his neck on a chain. Knight pulled Logan onto the ring apron and went for a suplex, but Logan hit him with the knux. He got rid of the weapon, then went for a springboard flip clothesline. Knight side-stepped him and hit the BFT for the win.

WINNER: Knight in 12:00 to capture the U.S. Title.

(Keller’s Analysis: A lot to like about the match, but it also at times seemed to lose some steam. Besides the official 12 minutes, there was a lengthy brawl beforehand. The finish is a surprise, especially since brass knuckles tend to be decisive. Logan’s gotten some bad publicity lately. I’m curious if WWE officials will be glad he’s out of the mix for a while, assuming he is.) [c]

(4) BAYLEY vs. NIA JAX (w/TIffany Stratton) – WWE Women’s Title match

Jax came out first. McAfee talked about her having an aura. Cole noted Bayley and Jax haven’t had a one-on-one match in over five years. The bell rang 34 minutes into the second hour. Bayley wrapped Jax’s arm around the middle rope early and kicked it. Cole praised her gameplan. Jax shoved her down and then lifted her and set up a powerbomb. Bayley slipped free and hit a jaw-breaker. Jax then gave her a quick Samoan Drop.

Bayley side-stepped a charging Jax. Jax, though, attacked Bayley on the ring apron and went for a legdrop. Bayley moved and kicked Jax into the ringside barricade. Bayley leaped at Jax with a Thesz Press.

Bayley applied an overhead sleeper. Cole and Graves noted Bayley tapped Jax with that in 2015. Jax countered and slammed Bayley to the mat. Then she landed a rolling senton and a legdrop for a near fall. Jax went for a legdrop off the second rope. Bayley moved. Bayley then hit a Bayley-to-Belly for a near fall at 6:00. Jax came back with an Annihilator a minute later for a near fall. Jax rammed Bayley into the mat over and over, then headbutted and tossed her into the corner. Jax said, “I’m so reckless, I’m so clumsy.” Jax charged at Bayley, but Bayley moved and Jax went shoulder-first into the ringpost. (That’s four out of four matches with a spot like that.)

Bayley leaped through the ropes onto Jax’s shoulders. Jax turned it into a slam at ringside. Jax landed a hip attack in the corner back in the ring. She set up another Annihilator. Bayley stood and powerbombed Jax off the second rope, holding Jax up as she walked a few steps out of the corner. That was a feat of strength and balance. Fans chanted, “Holy shit!” Bayley then landed a flying top rope elbow for a near fall at 11:00.

Tiffany Stratton’s music played and she ran out with the briefcase. Bayley knocked her off the ring apron and then scored a two count on Jax with a stack leverage cover. Bayley leaped at Jax, but Jax turned it into a powerbomb. Jax followed with a released powerbomb. She followed with two Annihilators for the win.

Tiffany celebrated with Jax, holding up her custom Money in the Bank briefcase, but wisely not even hinting at a cash-in.

WINNER: Jax in 12:00 to capture the WWE Women’s Title.

(Keller’s Analysis: Good match. It did feel, though, that it wouldn’t end until Tiffany got involved in some way. Some impressive exchanges and big moves in that one definitely got the crowd popping and gasping after being a bit quiet for some of the early methodical action.)

(5) C.M. PUNK vs. DREW MCINTYRE – Seth Rollins Special Referee

Seth came out first. He had glittery pants and a bedazzled sleeveless ref shirt. Cole talked about Jesse “The Body” Ventura’s role as a special referee on two occasions at Summerslams. Drew then made his entrance. He told Seth all he has to do is call for the bell and count to three. Punk walked out in his signature hoodie. Cole said it was Punk’s first one-on-one match in ten-and-a-half years in WWE. He said they teamed together once, but have never wrestled each other. Graves said he’s never seen Punk more pissed off than the last two days and he’ll fight until his heart gives out tonight. Punk got in Seth’s face as soon as he entered the ring. Drew walked up to him. Seth rubbed Punk’s hoodie on his butt before throwing it out of the ring. The bell rang 6 minutes into the third hour.

They met mid-ring and swung away at each other. Seth pulled Punk out of the corner when he didn’t break on his comment. Drew then went after Punk as Punk was complaining to Seth. Seth pulled Drew out of the corner as he was kicking away at him. Seth yelled, “Just like I told him, I run this show.” Punk clotheslined Drew and punched away at him. Drew palmed Punk in the throat and then ran to the ropes. Punk clotheslined Drew over the top rope, then leaped off the ring apron and tackled Drew. McAfee said Punk was looking good. Graves said Punk was trying to add just a little bit of muscle. He said when you do that, though, cardio can drop. Punk took it to Drew in the time keeper’s area. Punk tossed. Then he shoved Drew into the ringpost. Fans chanted, “We want Tables!” Punk rammed Drew’s head into the metal stairs at ringside.

Drew swept Punk’s legs and tripped him on the ring apron. Then he swung his by his legs into the announce desk. Drew. catapulted Punk up from under the ring into the frame of the ring. Seth laughed and applauded. Back in the ring, Drew chopped Punk to the mat as Punk whiffed on a punch. Drew snap-suplexed Punk and went for a cover. Punk rolled out of the cover before Drew secured it. Drew blocked a running knee by Punk and slammed him to the mat for a two count. Drew powered up Punk and landed a sitout powerbomb for another two count.

Drew grabbed a chair from ringside. Seth eyed it. Drew said he should let him use it because “then both of our problems go away.” He said he’d take the industry to new heights. Seth turned his back, but then when Drew wound up, Seth grabbed it. Seth told Drew, “You embarrassed me at WrestleMania.” Drew pie-faced Seth. Seth swung the chair, but Drew ducked. Seth stopped short of hitting Punk. Punk then rolled up Drew as Seth was getting ride of the chair. Drew powered out when Seth turned around. Drew gave Punk a neckbreaker and then kipped up. Graves said this was much more one-sided than anyone expected, noting Drew was overwhelming Punk.

Drew pulled out Punk’s bracelet at 10:00 and signaled for a Claymore, but Punk met him with a kick. Punk then landed three running high knees in the corner and then a clothesline. Punk climbed to the top rope and smiled, then vlew Seth a kiss and landed a flying elbowdrop. He made the cover, but Drew kicked out. Punk went for an Anaconda Vice, but Drew blocked it at first. Punk pushed through and got it applied. Punk then pulled the bracelet off of Drew’s wrist. The fans popped. Drew stood and surprised Punk with a Claymore for a dramatic near fall.

Drew set up a Future Shock DDT, but Punk escaped. Drew charged, but Punk moved, and Drew went into the ringpost shoulder-first. (That’s five out of five matches.) Punk the called for the Go To Sleep. He lifted Drew, winced, and then dropped Drew and looked at Seth who had put on Punk’s bracelet. (Is Punk a cat?) Drew charged at Punk and knocked him into Seth, who rolled to the floor. Drew then hit Punk from behind and set up a Future Shock. Punk blocked it and hit a GTS. Seth was late and counted, but didn’t start until the fans had counted to eight first. Drew kicked out at two.

Punk told Seth, “You’re as good of a referee as you are a wrestler.” He asked if he’s messing with him or kidding him. Punk yelled in Seth’s face. Seth told him to listen to him because this is his ring and his company. “We don’t want you here!” he said. “Not everything is about you!” He told him to focus on his opponent, who’s down for his pickins. Seth called him an asshole. Punk gave Seth a GTS. Seth went down and stayed down as Punk bent over and took his bracelet back. Drew recovered and kicked Punk in the crotch. He followed with a Claymore (without counting beforehand) and made the cover. Seth crawled over and counted slowly to three.

The announcers said Punk couldn’t stay focused. “C.M. Punk cost himself this match tonight,” Cole said. Graves agreed. “Punk was blind with rage and Punk’s emotions got the best of him.” Drew took the bracelet back and put it around his wrist. He put his boot on his chest and raised his arm high with the bracelet on his wrist.

WINNER: McIntyre in 17:00.

(Keller’s Analysis: Given it was Punk’s first singles match in a long time, he put on a solid performance, but he did seem to struggling with cardio or getting his legs under him at times. A lot of the time it was more about Seth and everyone’s emotions than having an all-out fight to win, which maybe was by design to protect Punk a bit. I have mixed feelings about Seth’s storyline role in this. Punk looked undisciplined and unfocused when it appeared he was on the verge of beating Drew but turned to the bracelet. Not that it’s not important to him, but this wasn’t any match or any opponent. It was Drew, who in the last seven months was a much more bitter enemy than Seth. Drew gets credit here for his role in making this as good as it was considering how long it’d been since Punk wrestled, and there’s just no way to really get strong in-ring cardio without wrestling in front of crowds with the adrenaline and no net.) [c]

(6) DAMIEN PRIEST vs. GUNTHER – WWE Heavyweight Title match

As Gunther came out, they showed a skyboc with Diamond Dallas Page, Sean Waltman, and Kevin Nash sitting together. Also, Scott Steiner, Rick Steiner, and Jacqueline. The bell rang 40 minutes into the third hour. Gunther charged. Priest hit him with a forearm to knock him backwards. Priest set up a South of Heaven, but Gunther chopped out of it. Priest gave Gunther a flatliner. Priest played to the crowd and got mild cheers.

Priest went to ringside and leaped at Gunter with a clothesline. Back in the ring, they exchanged strikes. Priest took Gunther down with a head scissors and a Broken Arrow for a near fall at 5:00. Gunther countered a Priest charge in the corner and then landed a running dropkick. He followed with a powerbomb for a near fall. Gunther took some deep breaths. He noticed from looking at the big screen that his chest was bleeding. It looked like a natural surprise reaction. He wiped the blood, then stood. Fans were cheering for something else going on.

They stood and chopped each other. Priest landed South of Heaven for a two count. Priest stood and fans rapid-clapped. He played to the fans and got a surge of cheers. He set up a Razor’s Edge, but Gunther escaped and chopped him. Gunther blocked a Priest kick and then took him down with a running clothesline and then another clothesline for a two count. A “This is awesome!” chant broke out as Gunther assessed the situation. Priest signaled for Gunther to bring it on. Gunther turned to the fans and they booed him. Gunther chopped Priest hard.

The crowd really got into Priest’s comeback a minute later. He turned it up and lifted Gunther and then delivered. Razor’s Edge. Gunther stood quickly and Priest gave him a South of Heaven. Gunther rolled toward the bottom rope. Finn Balor ran out and put Gunther’s leg on the bottom rope. “What the hell?” exclaimed Cole. Priest watched Balor’s interference on replay. Fans chanted, “Holy shit!” They cut to Balor who snarled at Priest. Priest leaned out of the ring toward Balor. Gunther then put Priest in a sleeper. Priest looked out of it but then showed life and leveraged Gunther’s shoulders down. Priest leaned out of the ring and grabbed Balor. Gunther then grabbed Priest and gave him a powerbomb followed by another sleeper for the win. Cole said this night will be remembered as “the implosion of The Judgment Day.”

WINNER: Gunther in 16:00 to capture the WWE Heavyweight Title.

(Keller’s Analysis: They really gave Priest an out in losing there, which didn’t feel like a trapdoor finish as much as making advancing the story of The Judgment Day a priority and giving Priest something to do after the title reign. I’m more understanding of Priest being unfocused because of Balor’s turn than I am Punk losing focus because Seth had the bracelet on his wrist. Punk wanted a win over Drew as much as Priest wanted to retain his title, or at least the stakes in both of their minds were probably emotionally similarly intense. The downside is Gunther’s win wasn’t the focus, but rather “the implosion of The Judgment Day.” Priest won over the crowd more and more as the match progressed. WWE has a solid babyface wrestler in Priest now and he’s coming out of this title reign stronger, even if it wasn’t a stellar reign on usual title reign merits. For whatever it’s worth, this was the first match of the night that didn’t involve a wrestler going shoulder-first into the corner and hitting the turnbuckles or ringpost.) [c]

-A commercial aired for John Cena’s retirement tour.

-Clips aired of the Dom-Liv angle earlier.

-The Miz announced a crowd of 57,719 and said it was a record for Summerslam. He was accompanied by R-Truth in the ring. Austin Theory and Greyson Waller walked out. Theory said they are in the city with the worst NFL team of all time. Cole said he agreed with that. Theory said all the people look like Jelly Roll. Waller said he wouldn’t let Theory disrespect Jelly Roll like that. “He’s incredible, he’s amazing,” he said. “You’re the only man in history to make music worth than R-Truth’s!” Truth then said Waller and Theory are “Ricky and Robert, the Rock ‘n’ Roll Express.” Miz said it’s not them. He pointed at Waller and said he just got his eye fixed, a reference to Robert Gibson. Jelly Roll smashed Theory and Waller with chairs to the back. Jelly Roll then chokeslammed Theory. (Theory sure exposed the nature of that move, which is all the about the recipient leaping. Truth, Miz, and Jelly Roll did fistdrops onto Theory. Truth and Miz helped Jelly Roll stand. They raised their arms and celebrated.

(Keller’s Analysis: Did Miz have any other duties as “host”? Not that I’m complaining.)

(7) CODY RHODES vs. SOLO SIKOA – Undisputed WWE Title match

Solo came out alone. Cole said it took a hell of a lot of guts to make it a Bloodline Rules match because he loses every advantage as champion. They cut to Cody in his bus. He walked out and then took his dog’s leash and walked him through the parking garage with him. Graves said this is Faraoh’s final trip with Cody on the road. Cody then hugged Arn Anderson backstage. Arn said 54,000 people say he’s a great champion. (What about the other 3,000+?) He told Cody he put himself in a tough spot, but he still has pull and a couple of his friends on the way to make sure things remain fair. Cole gave a brief bio on Anderson’s history with the Rhodes family. Cody handed off Faroah to a handler and put on his jacket and a helmet with a skull mask and wings. He then made his entrance.

After formal ring introductions, the bell rang 25 minutes into the fourth hour. Solo had his back turned when the bell rang as he held the red necklace that Cole said represents the Tribal Chief. Fans chanted, “F— you, Solo!” A fan held up a sign that said, “Manifesting the return of Roman Reigns.” Solo countered some of Cody’s signature offense early and then methodically beat on Cody. Graves said he was surprised Cody didn’t try to pick up teh pace. Cody ducked a charging Solo, who landed on the ring apron. Cody landed a Disaster Kick and then he followed with a dive through the ropes, tackling Solo. He showed fire and went for another dive, but this time Solo punched him out of mid-air. He rammed him into the ringside steps.

Solo went on methodical offense with two Samoan Drops and a two count. Graves said Solo’s methodical pace could backfire if he gave Cody too much time to recover. Cody then landed a Cody Cutter. Graves said Solo indeed took long, taking time to “enjoy himself” when he had Cody down. Cody rammed Solo into the ringside stairs and then into the cart with energy drinks on it. Cody landed a Bionic Elbow, but Solo caught him mid-air and hit a powerbomb. Solo landed a hip attack in the corner, then bragged to the crowd at 10:00. Cody kicked Solo and set up a Pedigree, but Solo slipped free and almost hit the ref. Cody rolled him up for a two count. Solo then landed a one-arm slam for a near fall. He applied a nerve hold next.

Solo hung Cody upside down in the corner and landed two running headbutts to Cody’s chest and head. Cody avoided a third headbutt and then landed a top rope moonsault bodypress. Graves said it was ugly but effective. Graves said it reminded him of a Terry Funk moonsault. Cody landed a superplex a minute later. (There was little drama in these first 12 minutes not primarily because of the methodical pace or the length of the show approaching four hours, but because Bloodline Rules hadn’t been factored in at all yet and everybody knows that’s going to happen before the finish.)

At 16:00, Solo set up a Cross Rhodes, but Cody reversed it and it it. Tanga Loa and Tama Tonga then attacked Cody. Solo made the cover, but Cody kicked out. Graves said this could happen all night long. Kevin Owen’s music then played and he ran to the ring. He was quickly outnumbered. Randy Orton’s music played and he ran out next. (One at a time isn’t the best strategy here!) Owens gave Solo a Swanton.

Cody then gave Solo a Cross Rhodes for a near fall. Orton and Owens chased Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa through the crowd, so it was one-on-one. Solo was down and Cody assessed. Cody picked up the top segment of the ringside steps and threw it into the ring. He lifted it and bashed Solo with it twice.

Cody went for a third, but Solo speared Cody and scored a two count. Solo set up the stair segment in the corner and pushed Cody against it. He then charged with a hip attack. Cody moved and Solo hit the stairs. Cody then landed Cross Rhodes twice. As Cody set up a third, Jacob Fatu charged in and attacked Cody. Fatu landed a top rope moonsault. Cole said the referee couldn’t do a damn thing about it. Fatu dragged Solo onto Cody who kicked out at the last split-second. Fans were standing. and watching. Oddly, no “Roman Reigns” or “We Want Roman” chant yet. Fatu superkicked Cody at ringside and then cleared the announce desk. Solo began to recover in the ring and directed Fatu’s attack. Fatu leaped off off the top turnbuckle onto Cody with a frog splash. Fatu grabbed his right ankle in pain afterward. He stood, but his leg gave out. He threw chairs around and let out yells. He yelled at Solo to finish him.

Solo then leaped off the top rope with a splash for a dramatic near fall. That got a bigger pop than previous near falls. When Solo set up a Samoan Spike, Cody collapsed. (Everyone should do that!) Cody then hit Solo with a superkick and a top rope Cody Cutter, getting a surge of energy bordering on a Tommy Dreamer Comeback. Suddenly, the Head of the Table graphic appeared on the big screen and a remix of Roman Reigns’s music played.

Roman walked out at 27:00 “He’s here! He’s here! He’s here! Roman Reigns is here!” exclaimed Cole. “Holy hell, Roman Reigns has returned.” Graves said it’s the first time since losing his crown at WrestleMania. Cole said, “The question is: Why is Roman Reigns here? Who is Roman Reigns here for?” Roman entered the ring and hit Solo with a Superman Punch. Fans roared with cheers as he hit a Spear. “The Revival of the Roman Empire with a spear!” exclaimed Cole. “Holy shit!” chanted the fans. Cody looked at Cody and nodded, then left. Cody soaked up the scene as Reigns walked down the aisle. Reigns paused and watched as Cody picked up Solo and delivered a Cross Rhodes for the win. As Cody celebrated Cole said the real Tribal Chief is back and god help Solo.

WINNER: Cody in 30:00 to retain the Undisputed WWE Championship.

(Keller’s Analysis: Like so many Roman matches, this was paced to tell an elaborate story with the finish mattering more than the quality or pace of the action in the first 80 percent of the match. It worked to a great degree by the finish because the return of Roman was what this was all about and Fatu’s apparently severe leg injury augmented the drama at the end. The crowd never bought into Solo as a threat to win despite a solid performance from him and help from his cohorts. Does Reigns overshadow Cody? How much is he around now? Does he explain himself and say he did it for Cody, against Solo, or for Paul Heyman, or all of the above.)

WWE SummerSlam 2024 Results: Liv Morgan Defeats Rhea Ripley.,https://www.app.com/story/sports/pro-wrestling/2024/08/03/wwe-summerslam-2024-results-winners-highlights-roman-reigns/74660369007/,"SummerSlam is in the books and it was a goodie! Four new champions, CM Punk returns to the ring and Roman Reigns returns.

Triple H up next

First he thinks the sponsors and the media before getting into the events of SummerSlam. Biggest he thinks the fans of Cleveland for helping them put on a great show. The fans were allowed at most times in Cleveland should get credit. He said they continue to set records in attendance and revenue from PLEs. He then thanked Jelly Roll for making the show extra special not only singing, but getting involved physically. Triple H really says nice things about Sami Zayn. Good to hear. He also says Bronn Breakker is a star and he's 100% right. Triple H then runs down the show and sing the Praises of just about everyone who competed. They all deserve it he's not lying in any way. Triple H runs down the rest of the year PLEs and says fans have a lot to be excited for.

The first question compares the main roster right now to NXT when Triple H ran it. It's a great question because the WWE main roster PLEs have been top notch since Wrestlemania 40. Even before that they were great but the new format of running a few matches but making them all important has made the shows more enjoyable from where I sit. To ask why WWE has been working with TNA Wrestling. Triple H says we're open for business. He said they're going to look at what's best for WWE and if it benefits them he will work with anyone. He said working with other promotions gives his younger guy reps and that's how you get better. He said for other people to grow they need to create opportunities. And working in for a live crowds does just that. He's asked if Stephanie McMahon has a role in a company after she appeared on camera. He said she does not but he loves to see her around and that she loves the business. I'm not sure if he delayed his answer but you can tell he loved having her there. That's pretty adorable! He said we'll see what the future holds and he expects to see her around because she loves being around wrestling. Long time wrestling reporter Bill Apter was asked where John Cena was. Triple H says he'll be back by the Royal Rumble to begin his Last Dance. He said he's looking forward to crafting the story and praised Cena for his incredible career. He was asked if SummerSlam will be two nights from here on out. He says as they continue to grow he'll take it step by step. He said he's excited about the opportunity to see what happens.

Bronn Breakker up next

Bronn Breakker talks about having his dad Rick Steiner and at two nights match uncle Scott Steiner. He said he was happy to have them there it's such a big moment of his career. Breakker looks very happy about his championship win, he can't stop smiling. You're always trying to BigE really says some nice things about the new Intercontinental Champion and since the sky is the limit for him. Big E would know, he was quite the champion. Monday night he wants to elevate the IC championship that'll be tough considering with the past two Champions have done. But for him the sky is the limit as Big E said. Breakker then talks about Sami Zayn giving him a chance and says he respects him. It was a great answer for a young guy and he's going to do wonders for the championship.

Cody Rhodes up next

It sounds like Cody Rhodes will be the final wrestler taking part in a presser. I was hoping we'd get Roman Reigns but I understand why we don't. I assume we'll find out why he did what he did on SmackDown. It'll be a long six days! The first question is about Cody's dog. They said this is his final premium live event. I was worried he was sick but luckily it sounds like he just retiring. Congrats Pharaoh! Cody says he is 2-0 in Bloodline rules matches. He credits Roman reigns with helping him keep the championship tonight. Did you ever think that would happen at Wrestlemania 40 when you saw Cody the feet Roman. He said WWE fans wanted Roman and boy was Cody right. Cody is asked they go from here, he said he doesn't know but acknowledged Roman Reigns deserves a rematch. He prayed Roman for being a great wrestler and said wrestling him is hard. Roman might get a title shot but I think he's going to be busy with Solo and Bloodline 2.0 before he turns his attention to the American Nightmare.

They ask Cody about on Anderson. He said Arn is a huge part of his story. He said since his dad can't be with him he's happy to have a guy who was close to his dad you with him. He said Arn is a visionary and brought up the promo in AEW where Arn Anderson talk about appointment gun. He talks about having a hall of famers at tonight's show, then said he hopes we see more of Arn Anderson in the future.

He talks about the future and really seems excited. Cody has been a workhorse since coming back to WWE minus the time on the shelf with his injury. He'd lose a lot of credit for carrying the company doing a very important time. he certainly has help but he's been the man.

LA Knight wins US title! Yeah!

LA Knight is up next. He said he's been drinking Hard Lemonade to prepare for the presser but he looks fine. He's asked about beating a guy who is new to the business while he is a long time veteran. ""The things that I'm looking for maybe not quite getting the recognition of looking for out at the same time if I don't see it the damn sure nobody else can see it so for me and he I don't know if I'm empty headed or what but I don't have to quit."" He talks about never quitting even as a kid. He proved that tonight by winning the US championship. Anyway this is the first time I remember LA Knight doing a presser. He's very well spoken, he gives good interviews and he's truly a star. And we work for this, happy to see it! Knight is asked who is next challenger should be if it's not Logan Paul. He said he just won the damn thing before saying there are many different contenders for the championship. He said anybody who wants to challenge him will get a shot. That was the last question and he's out. Yeah!

Gunther celebrates

They ask Gunther if his championship match with marred by Finn Balor turning on Damian Priest. Gunther says no and he's right. It's not his job to make sure his opponent has friends he can depend on. Priest is great but he lost. Gunther had nothing to do with that.

McIntyre speaks after beating Punk

Drew McIntyre praises CM Punk, and Wade Barrett celebrate with Drew. They show Punk listening to Drew's presser and he looks unhppy. Who can blame him. Not only did he lose but there was no sign of Larry in Cody Rhodes was allowed to bring his dog to the match. Doesn't seem fair to me. McIntyre says it's funny that punk doesn't drink but spends all his time in rehab, alleging he's always hurt. Punk, McIntyre and Rollins have been , incredible, and it appears this feud will continue. We all win.

Tiffany Stratton and Nia Jax start presser

Jax starts by asking where her congratulations is. Jax gets emotional when talking about how she went from unemployed to Queen of the Ring and champion. They asked Nia a question but she defers to Tiffy. She said she helped my Jax win the title. They then talk about Stratton's new pink Money in the Bank briefcase. How long until wrestling dolls come with that?Stratton said she was handpicked to be Nia Jax's bestie. They do look like they're having fun together. Nia really goes out of her way to praise Tiffy. Let's hope it turns out better than last time she had a bestie.

Overall Summerslam thoughts

I was excited going in and the show exceeded my expectations. Roman is back, Judgment Day might be dead, Gunther is a new champion, so is Nia Jax, LA Knight and Bronn Breakker, Dirty Dom has a new girlfriend and nothing has been settled between CM Punk, Seth Rollins and Drew McIntyre. Great night of wrestling and lots of issues to still work out. Great PLE. Only downside, man I like Roman Reigns has a bad guy. He has a lot of work to do to be as good a good guy as he was during the past 4 years and the biggest jerk in the game. If anyone can do it it's him.

Cody Rhodes defeats Solo Sikoa

He needed to help arguably his biggest rival in WWE but Cody Rhodes walks out of SummerSlam with the title. Solo did himself well, look strong and never looked at a place. He's come a long way since making his debut two years ago and he'll continue to be a big player in WWE.

Roman Reigns is back

Roman Reigns' music hit and he's slowly makes his way down the aisle. The head of the table has returned to claim his seat. But he has issues with both guys so who will he go after? It's solo and he hits a Superman punch and the tribal Chief is a good guy. He hits a spear glances over at Cody, acknowledges the crowd and walks to the back. The best wrestler in the past five years has returned and WWE just got even better. But Cody still has work to do.

Cody hits another Crossrhoads and pins Solo. He locks eyes with Roman Reigns as he gets his hands raised. You have to think Roman has issue with Solo but he'll eventually won his belt back. Welcome back Roman Reigns.

Cody Rhodes defeats solo Sikoa

It took some help from Roman Reigns but Cody Rhodes defeated the fake Tribal Chief with help from Roman Reigns. Good match that had some moments but obviously the best part was Roman returning. This will set up roaming against Solo at some point and gives WWE yet another top guy -- actually the top guy. You were missed Roman, welcome back! Score: 88 out of 100.

Solo Sikoa vs. Cody Rhodes, Bloodline Rules!

This is going to be a wild ride! Last Bloodline Rules match was incredible. This should be just as good! Solo lives up to his name, coming out alone. That likely won't last. Cody comes out with his dog. WWE does a great job promoting stars with dogs. If you want to be like them, visit your shelter and get a homeless dog or cat. You won't regret it. Arn Anderson is there! He's giving Cody a pep talk! This is great! Anderson says Cody has friends. Wonder who he is acknowledging? I hope they smash em. Cody has defended the title four times since winning it. Does that mean live events are nontitle or they don't count? Bell rings and we are off! Cody Rhodes hits a couple shoulder blocks but Solo Sikoa shake them off. The fans are really going nuts early in the match. They lock up again Cody goes to slap the Sikoa in the face but he blocks it and they're back to square one. Sikoa takes over on the outside. He Rams Cody's head into the steps and ass fans to acknowledge him. They respond telling him they'd rather not. Sikoa hits a nice spin kick and gets a two count. Then he hits a big back body drop. Cody Rhodes is in trouble. He hits a Samoan drop and shows off the Samoan Spike but Cody avoids it and drills a Cody cutter. Solo is sent to the floor and Cody goes to work ramming him into the barricade and now get hydrated and hits Solo with a drink. Solo hits a power bomb and gets a two count. If Rhodes doesn't start making a comeback, it might not matter that this is Bloodline Rules. Because right now Solo looks like he needs no help. Another Samoan drop in Solo looks to have this match in hand. Of course Cody Rhodes has been down before. I almost feel like I'm waiting for interference instead of enjoying this match. Eric Bischoff said this week that fans wearing clamoring for Roman Reigns to come back. I like Eric Bischoff, I enjoy his podcast and I think he was great in WCW, but he couldn't be more wrong about fans not wanting Roman Reigns back. You want him back, I want him back and anyone who loves wrestling wants him back. He was so good at champion and I can't wait to see what he does tonight. Assuming he comes back.

Solo is really putting on a good match here. He's another guy who's really stepped up. They have an abundance of big guys, many are young and can really go. It's exciting to see where this roster will go because there's no shortage of stars. Cody hits a superplex and both men are looking for a second wind. Crazy how easy these guys jump up to the top rope. I remember when only Rob Van Dam could do that. Now you got 300 pounders doing it and Cody just made it look very easy. Cody hits a Crossrhoads, and two members of the Bloodline interfere. You know how they say the war games have now begun? Well Bloodline Rules has now begun! They hit a double team move but Cody kicks out. And here comes Kevin Owens. Owen goes after all three members of the Bloodline. Only Jacob Fatu is missing. Owen takes control but eventually gets cut off so who's next? It's Randy Orton and he's jogging to the ring to even out the odds. Orton hits an RKO then Owens hits a stunner. I would assume this would bring out Jacob for two because now Orton hit the power slam on Solo followed by a senton on Solo. Cody hits another Crossrhoads in Solo kicked out. Solo ain't no job or he looks good. RKO battles back to the locker room with the two members of the Bloodline as Cody looks to win the match. He brings in the steps and stalks a Solo. Steps in the Solo's face and does it again. He goes for a third with Solo spears him. He's Now setting up the steps in the corner and he does not look like he has good intentions. Cody hits a third Crossrhoads. A fourth. And before you can hit a fifth he gets crushed by a Jacob Fatu flying somersault off the top rope. But Cody kicks out before solo can pin him. Who is coming out next? I think it's the former champion of the winners' bracket.

Jacob Fatu it's a super kick putting Cody on the table and we know Fatu can fly. He just put Cody through a table and it appears he hurt his ankle but he's popping up because he's a warrior. Cody is a warrior too but he can't get up, he was just smushed. Solo hits a frog splash but Cody kicks at out at two. Will Cody get some help? Believe that! Cody hits a super kick and a Cody cutter. And there we have it stand up and throw your ones up. The Tribal Chief has returned!

Awesome Truth appear to talk SummerSlam attendance

It's announced 57,701 people are there. A-Town Down come out to talk trash to the former champs. They rip the Browns, which is fair. Then Jelly Roll. Truth calls A-Town Down the Rock and Roll Express. Jelly Roll hits both members of A-Town Down with a chair and they celebrate!

Gunther defeats Damian Priest to win championship

It took Finn Balor turning on his Judgment Day teammate, but Gunther is your new world heavyweight champion. Glad Balor is getting elevated to a big feud, glad Gunther got the belt and happy for Priest, who isn't a potential star. He's a huge star. Score: 87 out of 100

Gunther vs. Damian Priest

This should be another classic. There are as many top guys in WWE now than ever before. That's a bold statement, but true. And two of the best are ready to battle it out for the title. Challenger is out first, followed by the champ. Priest goes to work on Gunther. They're going back and forth. These are two of the best hosses in the game. So far it's what you would expect, two big dudes pounding on each other. Gunther is bleeding, but he's not backing down, hitting Priest with chops. Priest is doing soccer kicks. For as big as these dudes are, they can move! Fans are quieter for this match, they shouldn't be. Now they're getting behind them. That was fast! Priest hits the chokeslam but can't get the pin. Gunther is pounding Damian, and things look bleak for the champ. Finn Balor comes to ringside. Gunther continues the beatdown. Balor encourages Priest, but Gunther cheapshots the Irishman. Priest with two viscous clothesline. Then a chokeslam. Balor puts Gunther's foot on the rope. That's not nice! Priest sees the replay. Balor and Priest lock eyes, but Gunther pulls him in and chokes him out but he recovers and kicks out. But Gunther hits a powerbomb when Priest attacks Balor and he gets put choked out. We have a new champ.

Drew McIntyre pins CM Punk

Rollins leaves after counting the three. Now Punk has a serious problem. He lost, he's made an enemy out of Rollins, and McIntyre gets the win and takes back the bracelet. How did Larry make that? That's a talented dog. McIntyre puts his foot on Punk's chest and walks out. Punk looked good, there were lots of bells and whistles, and all three men still have issue with each other. Great match. Score: 92 out of 100.

CM Punk vs. Drew McIntyre, Seth Rollins special guest referee

Rollins has a smoking hot referee jacket. He looks like he's ready to do his job! McIntyre out next, and he looks unhappy as always. Crazy that this match is No. 3 on the card. Shows how deep and talented the WWE roster is. I hate to sound like Gorilla Monsoon, but this could be a main event anywhere in the country! McIntyre requests Punk make his entrance and just like that we hear Cult of Personality. Punk says it's clobbering time and he's headed to his first singles match at a WWE PLE in a long time! And they're off beating each other up. Punk takes over and is thrown out of the corner by Seth. As he argued, McIntyre takes over. Punk hits a flying clothesline and is punching him. Drew hits a throat shot and then a nasty chop. Punk throws him out. This is fun. But Punk looks beat up. He hits a flying clothesline off the apron. This is going to be a slobberknocker, JR! Rollins has a wardrobe malfunction and his tending to his shoes as Punk hits some cheapshots on the stairs. Fans are singing Rollins song and this is a giant party in Cleveland. McIntyre swings Punk's head into the announce table, and he has the edge. Rollins is an incredible wrestler, but not very good as a ref. He just let McIntyre slingshot Punk into the ring apron. That's allegedly steel! Punk throws a wild punch ala Terry Funk! Love it! Punk is taking a beating and is thrown across the ring. Rollins didn't make the count. He's struggling in his first night as a ref. We can criticize, but we've never done it! McIntyre gets warned by Rollins, now he's grabbing a chair. Wonder if it's shaved down? Rollins and McIntyre discuss the chair situation, and McIntyre says if he does it, their problems go away. He's got a point. He allows it, then doesn't, grabbing the chair. They're yelling more. Rollins really needs to study before reffing his next match. This isn't his calling. McIntyre puts on Punk's bracelet and calls for the kick, but Punk is the one who delivers a kick. He then hits a neckbreaker and he's in control. Punk is taking over. He's now going for an elbow drop. He blows a kiss to Rollins and delivers it. But Punk kicks out. He goes for the anaconda vice and then he reclaims his bracelet. But turns around and eats a Claymore kick, but kicks out at 2. McIntyre goes for a DDT, but Punk escapes. He goes for a G2S, but sees Rollins wearing the bracelet. He drops McIntyre and goes after Rollins. Rollins is bumped to the outside, Punk hits a Go To Sleep, McIntyre kicks out after a delayed count. Rollins and Punk are arguing again. Rollins hit him in the chest, which is unprofessional. Punk hits a G2S on Rollins, which was uncalled for. Then he puts on the bracelet and goes after McIntyre who kicks him low. Then he hits a Claymore. Rollins counts out Punk. What a match!

Hawk Tuah girl at Summer Slam

The 'Hawk Tuah' girl who went viral with a funny video a few weeks back is at SummerSlam. Haliey Welch is her name and while she went viral for a strange reason, she's made the most out of her new found fame. She's also given back, donating her time and money to animal rescues. Glad she's a wrestling fan!

Nia Jax defeats Bayley for WWE Women's Championship

Bayley took a licking and eventually couldn't keep on ticking. Jax overpowered her and thanks to the Tiffany Stratton failed attempt to cash in, Nia keeps the belt and Tiffy keeps the briefcase. Score: 71 out of 100.

Nia Jax vs. Bayley

The challenging queen is out first. Heavy is the head of she who wears the crown, but in this match, that would be Bayley, right? Bayley starts out hot but Jax overpowers her pretty easily. Jax hits a stinkface in honor of her cousin. Or uncle. Someone in her bloodline did that. Bayley is taking a whooping here, but she fights back with a choke. That's turned into a standing gourdbuster and Jax hits a senton. Wow, that looked painful! But not enough for a three count. Still, Jax has control. She missed a Matt Hardy leg drop, and Bayley hits the Bayley to belly but gets a two count. Three wrestlers used that as a finish, her, Magnum TA and Shane Douglas. Who had the best? Jax back in control now. She goes for a sitdown splash off the second rope, nails it but only gets a two count. I'm not sure I ever saw anyone kick out of that before. Jax is still in control. Bayley hits a dive to the floor, but Jax catches her and hits a Samoan slam on the floor. Bayley is earning her check tonight. Jax goes for another, but Bayley hits a powerbomb out of the corner. Bayley is strong! Macho Man elbow and scores a two count. They're working hard! Wait, it's Tiffy Time! She tries to cash in, but Bayley cuts her off. She then tries to take over on Jax, but she eats a powerbomb. Another powerbomb. Then a sitdown splash. And another. It's over. Queen Nia is the champion!

WWE Judgement Day

Is this the end of the Judgement Day? With Dirty Dom Mysterio turning on Rhea Ripley, someone is obviously out. But what happens to Damian Priest, who still has a huge match tonight? He yelled at the other members of the faction after Ripley was defeated. Will this be the end of the Judgement Day? I hope not, they've been fun, but you have to think they'll at least look different at Monday Night Raw.

Will Roman Reigns come back at SummerSlam 2024?

Nothing is official, but he has to right? Solo Sikoa has run the Tribal Chief down, he's beaten up Paul Heyman, he's called himself the Tribal Chief and he said Roman isn't coming back. If he doesn't, maybe Sikoa is officially the new Tribal Chief. But I think he does. And I think he's the reason Cody Rhodes wins.

LA Knight defeats Logan Paul for US championship

Knight has been hot for more than a year now, and he finally cashes in with a championship. Logan Paul has been a fine champ, but Knight deserved this one. Score: 81 out of 100.

LA Knight vs. Logan Paul with Machine Gun Kelly

Logan Paul is coming out with Machine Gun Kelly. Paul is letting MGK carry the championship to the ring. This is something I bet a lot of old school fans love! LA Knight comes in the Prime Mobile, breaks out the windows and heads to the ring. YEAH! Knight starts off strong outside the ring, bouncing the champ around ringside. Knight continues to pour it on, hitting a TKO neckbreaker on the table. It doesn't break and both men are banged up. YEAH! The two have battled back and forth, lots going on but nobody close to winning. In fact, it's been a very back and forth affair thus far. Paul can really wrestle. Knight can too. Logan Paul is showing courage in this match, unlike this week when he tweeted an incorrect statement about an Olympic boxer, then apologized for being wrong, but wouldn't allow comments and made the tweet about something else completely. Sorry, X. He does hit a springboard moonsault and drilled Knight. Paul hit a big punch and got a two count. Knight beats up Paul's entourage, but MGK is giving Paul brass knuckles. That's unsportsmanlike. He nails a punch, goes for the slingshot clothesline, but walks into a LA Knight finisher and he wins. It's Knight time in Cleveland! New US champion.

Bronn Breakker wins Intercontinental championship

Breakker ends Zayn's title reign that began at Wrestlemania 40. He's also been featured on just about every PLE since winning the title, and has had some amazing matches on Raw. Great run for Sami, but Bronn Breakker is a star and this belt is a stepping stone to bigger things. He's a top guy waiting to happen. Score: 75 out of 100.

Rick Steiner, Scott Steiner must be proud

The Steiner brothers are among the greatest tag teams in wrestling. And tonight, Scott's nephew, Rick's son, Bronn Breakker won his first main roster title. Scott Steiner is an all-time great as Big Poppa Pump, and his nephew has the skills to surpass him. Congrats, Steiners.

Bronn Breakker vs. Sami Zayn

Breakker is out first. Zayn out next and the champion starts out hot, hitting a plancha on the bigger challenger. Breakker is favoring his shoulder, but he is able to dodge a Helluva kick. Breakker hits a FrankenSteiner and he might be the best athlete in wrestling. That's a bold statement, but I can't see anyone his size who can do the things he can do. It's sick. Zayn recovers and hits a Blue Thunder Bomb, but only gets a two count. Breakker hits a spear that is nastier than any other spear you'll see. He hits another and wins the belt.

Damian Priest unhappy with Dom

Damian Priest comes in the Judgment Day locker room and he's livid about what happened. Finn Balor says he had no idea Dom Mysterio was going to do that. Priest stormed off. He has bigger fish to fry, he can't get involved in these affairs of the heart! Good news for Buddy Murphy, I guess, he gets his girl back. It shows that no matter how bad of a guy you are, you can always make a heel turn!

Liv Morgan defeats Rhea Ripley with help from Dirty Dom

It was a good match, both worked hard and the story continues. Score: 86 out of 100

Rhea Ripley vs. Liv Morgan

Rhea comes out with Dirty Dom Mysterio. They look quite the happy couple. I guess Michael Cole likes Rhea's outfit, he said it looks like the Badda Bing. Whataya gonna do? Liv is out and looks very happy for a woman who was recently dumped on national TV. I wonder what helped her get over him. Ripley dominated early, but she hurt her recently healed shoulder and now Liv is going to work. Liv worked on Rhea's arm, but when she went for a suicide dive, Dom took the bullet for Rhea. Oh my god, Rhea just popped her shoulder back in by ramming it into the announce table. That looked so painful. Rhea takes control, and goes to hit Morgan with a chair. Dom stops her! Tells her you can't win the title that way. Dirty Dom has a point. Morgan hits her finisher, but Ripley kicks out! Dom tosses a chair in, Morgan hits her finisher again, this time on a chair, and she wins. Dom helped her, but not obviously. I blame Ripley, she introduced the weapon! Liv Morgan defeats Rhea Ripley. And then Dom gives her a big kiss. Michael Cole with a great call! Ripley is crying, but not tears of sadness. Tears of anger. Liv and Dom walk out together. Ripley looks bad ass with lipstick on her teeth, crying. Pat McAfee doesn't care for Dom, apparently! I thought this finish was too obvious, but I'm happy the feud is continuing.

Is SummerSlam sold out?

WWE is hot right now and its been selling out just about everywhere they go. But is SummerSlam a sellout? It wasn't as of an hour ago, but it was pretty darn close and after walkups, it very well could be.

Triple H welcomes fans

In what is becoming a tradition for big PLEs, Triple H made his way before the crowd prior to the start of SummerSlam. He asked Cleveland if they're ready. They let him know they were on board. He gave a shoutout to Jelly Roll for his performance of God Bless America and then Jelly sang another song. They interviewed him prior to the show, he's a huge WWE fan. Good for him. But if I said I liked this song, I'd be a Liar.

How long is SummerSlam 2024?

Traditional PLEs under Triple H have featured five matches and three hours. With SummerSlam starting at 7 p.m., it's safe to assume with seven matches, we will see a show that will run around four hours.

What will open SummerSlam?

The first match of the night will be Liv Morgan vs. Rhea Ripley. This is a great call. I'd argue this is the hottest feud of the night. I guess Drew McIntyre-CM Punk has the same momentum heading into the show, but Ripley has gotten more popular since her injury and Morgan has been so entertaining as a bad girl. She's been so much fun, and this match is going to be the perfect way to open the night. We'll likely see a surprise in this match, and I know people think Dirty Dom will turn on Rhea, but I'd like to see them stick together and have Rhea be the bad girl.

Jelly Roll to kick off SummerSlam

Pat McAfee interviewed Jelly Roll prior to the show and it was announced that he'll open the show with a song. Pretty cool interview, McAfee is one of the top stars in media, and Mr. Roll is one of the top musical performers right now. Very cool.

SummerSlam 2025 location?

OK, so we know in two years, SummerSlam becomes two nights when it comes to Minnesota, but where will SummerSlam be next year? WWE hasn't released that information, but possibly we'll hear it tonight.

Summerslam Preshow Matches?

Unlike in previous years, this year's preshow is a straight up preview show. It includes interviews and recaps and predictions, but there are no matches scheduled.

Is SummerSlam free on Peacock?

If you want to watch tonight's SummerSlam in the United States, you need Peacock. The NBC streaming service no longer offers a free trial, but if you sign up, you get SummerSlam as well as the Olympics. To watch, you can sign up here.

SummerSlam Match Order

It's hard to predict the order of this. But we'll give it a shot. And we've already established that we've earmarked Cody Rhodes-Solo Sikoa as the main event.

For the opener, we'll go with Rhea Ripley vs. Liv Morgan. I think this has the best story going in, so this has earned a marquee billing. After that, we'll go Logan Paul vs. LA Knight. This keeps the crowd alive with a local guy who sounds like he'll be the bad guy. Thought Cleveland was loyal to their won, but not according to the cheers thus far! Next up, Bayley vs. Nia Jax. The other women's match has the most buzz, this match to me has the least. But Jax has improved a lot this time and Bayley never has a bad match. Next up it's time for Damian Priest vs. Gunther. The only reason this isn't in a main event spot is because of the competition. I could see Bronn Breakker vs. Sami Zyan as the next match, followed by the CM Punk vs. Drew McIntyre match. Pretty outrageous the level of matches on this show, there isn't a bad one listed. Then throw in a segment with the Miz, he should be allowed to come out and put on a little show in his hometown, nobody deserves it more. Then send out the Bloodline!

He's the Miz and he's awesome

I'm glad they found a prominent role for the Miz. I've interviewed him in the past and you can tell he's a good guy. Whatever role they throw at him, he stars. Good guy? He can pull it off. Bad guy? Few are better. Tag team? Sure. World champion? He was good. IC champ? One of the best. Zombie match? He did it! Movies, interviews, MizTV, reality show, he's done it all and done it all well. He's getting his accolades more and more these days, and he's earned it. By my favorite part of the Miz? He's probably the most popular wrestler among his peers. That's great to see.

What will main event SummerSlam?

There are at least three matches that could main event tonight, and I'm excited to see what will. Either big title matches, Cody Rhodes-Solo Sikoa and Damian Priest-Gunther could headline, yet so could CM Punk vs. Drew McIntyre with Seth Rollins serving as ref. It's CM Punk's first singles match on TV in WWE in a long time. Gunther winning the title could be as important a moment in WWE as Brock Lesnar beating the Rock at SummerSlam. Sounds crazy, but why couldn't Gunther grow into that kind of star? And the match with the best storyline is arguably Rhea Ripley vs. Liv Morgan. Probably a long shot to be the main event, but who doesn't want to see that match? I think they'll go with the Bloodline Rules match, and if Roman Reigns returns, I think it's the right call.

Bloodline Rules?

Love the switch to Bloodline Rules. Think it was very stupid of Cody Rhodes to accept it, but it opens up so many possibilities. I predicted a lot of interference earlier, but this makes it legal. And this makes Roman Reigns' return easy to see. I hope that happens, but I hope he stays the Tribal Chief, the guy who was a total jerk. And I think he will. Just good to have him back.

Special guest SummerSlam refs

This is the third time that I can remember when one of the top SummerSlam matches featured a special guest referee. In 1997, Shawn Michaels was the ref in the championship match between the Undertaker and Bret Hart, and a few years later, Jesse Ventura officiated the title match between ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin, Mankind and Triple H. Tonight will be the third with Seth Rollins calling the match between CM Punk and Drew McIntyre. For a minute I felt bad for Rollins, not being in a match, but in this PPV, it's almost like the refs have been bigger. Rollins might be the best all around performer in the sport and any role he gets, he'll star.

SummerSlam will be held Saturday, Aug. 3.

SummerSlam will be held at Cleveland Browns Stadium.

What time does the SummerSlam Preshow start?

The SummerSlam Preshow starts at 4 p.m. It will last three hours.

SummerSlam begins at 7 p.m. after a two-hour countdown show that begins at 5 p.m.

In the United States, SummerSlam will stream live on Peacock. It will also be available on traditional pay per view at a price of $44.99. Internationally, it will be available on WWE Network.

Solo had the match won with Jacob Fatu and himself inflicting a two-on-one assault on Rhodes but just when things appeared bleak for the champion, Reigns' updated music hit. As the 'Head of the Table' logo appeared on the giant screen, Reigns made his way into the arena, making the crowd go absolutely nuts....Read More

It still wasn't known who Reigns would go after but the question was answered as he landed a Superman Punch on his cousin solo and laid him out flat with a thunderous spear. Rhodes picked up the pieces, hitting the Cross Rhodes and picking up the win.

In a crazy start to WWE SummerSlam 2024, Dominik Mysterio assisted Liv Morgan in beating Rhea Ripley and defend her Women's Heavyweight Championship. Moments later, Bron Breakker was crowned the new WWE Intercontinental Champions with a dominating win over Sami Zayn in a match that did nit last beyond 10 minutes. LA Knight ensured a second title changed hands as he defeated Logan Paul to win the United States Championship to end his long reign as the champ.

CM Punk's first televised singles match since his return to the WWE ended in a defeat, with Drew McIntyre picking up the win and Seth Rollins counting the 1, 2, 3. Punk had the match in his grasp at least twice in the match, but let the mind games get the better of him. Later, the Judgment Day continued to implode as Finn Balor cost Damian Priest the World Heavyweight Championship and help crown Gunther as the new champ - his first world title.

Many wouldn't have realised but it's already been four months since WrestleMania. Which can only mean one thing. We are into the biggest part of the summer, and if you're a wrestling fan… Oh yes! You guessed it right. We are here for WWE SummerSlam. WWE's second-biggest Pay Per View of the Year, which if reports are to be believed, like WrestleMania is being considered to evolve into a two-night affair is finally here. And going by the type of matches that are lined-up, you've got to believe this is a mini-WrestleMania of sorts.

WWE has undergone a storyline since Mania 40. In the absence of Roman Reigns, Solo Sikoa has assembled his own faction, known as Bloodline 2.0, comprising his cousins Tama Tonga, Tonga Loa and Jacob Fatu. The four of them together have ran roughshod of Friday Night SmackDown over anyone that's come in their way, including the wiseman and WWE Hall of Famer Paul Heyman. And on WWE's biggest night of the Summer, Solo and his henchmen plan on taking down the biggest thorn in the Bloodline's eyes – the Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes, who beat Solo's cousin four months ago in Philadelphia.

The 37th edition of WWE SummerSlam, was brought to you live from Cleveland, Ohio, only second time the PPV comes to the city and the first since 1996. SummerSlam has had a huge significance in WWE history, leaving behind a slew of memorable matches. The Undertaker vs Stone Cold Steve Austin in 1998. The Rock vs Triple H the same year. The Heartbreak Kid Shawn Michaels' return after 4 years from injury. The two best of their generation AJ Styles and John Cena finally having their singles match. You name it and SummerSlam has delivered. This is the first SummerSlam of the TKO era, and with business booming, nothing can be off the charts.

Below are a few pointers regarding WWE SummerSlam 2024:

- Roman Reigns returned to the WWE for the first time since WrestleMania 40 and speared Solo Sikoa.

- Cody Rhodes pinned Solo Sikoa to retain his Undisputed WWE Championship.

- Liv Morgan defeated Rhea Ripley with assist from Dominik Mysterio.

- Bron Breakker beat Sami Zayn for the WWE Intercontinental Championship.

- LA Knight won the United States Championship, beating Logan Paul.

- Drew McIntyre beat CM Punk after with a low blow and a Claymore Kick.

- Gunther defeated Damian Priest with assist from Finn Balor and won the World Heavyweight title."

CM Punk finally got his in-ring return singles match in WWE, but it did not go his way by any measure.



Most importantly, he lost his first match back, and the story sold was that it was all the fault of The Best in the World, who could not get out of his own way emotionally.



The match itself also did not live up to the massive hype.

Punk looked fragile and out of breath early. Much of the match was highlighted by Drew McIntyre and guest referee Seth Rollins mean-mugging each other.



The dramatics got to be a bit much, especially the hokey inclusion of Punk's family bracelet.

WWE SummerSlam 2024 Results: Liv Morgan Defeats Rhea Ripley.,https://itrwrestling.com/news/multiple-title-changes-take-place-at-wwe-summerslam/,"SummerSlam 2024 changed the face of WWE with multiple new champions being crowned.

SummerSlam opened with betrayal, as Dominik Mysterio turned on Rhea Ripley to help Liv Morgan retain the Women’s World Championship, and that wasn’t the end of the trouble for The Judgment Day.

In the semi-main event, Damian Priest put the World Heavyweight Title on the line against Gunther. During the bout, Finn Balor came to ringside despite Priest having told him he wanted no interference. Rather than help his teammate, though, Balor saved Gunther from a pinfall by putting his foot on the rope.

Priest tried to go after Balor only for The Ring General to grab him and lock in a Sleeper Hold. While it wasn’t enough to take Priest out, another distraction from Balor gave Gunther the opportunity to hit a Powerbomb, followed by another Sleeper. This time, Priest was out cold, and Gunther was crowned the new World Heavyweight Champion.

Earlier in the night, Nia Jax won gold for the first time since 2021 when she defeated Bayley for the WWE Women’s Title. Bayley was able to withstand the power of the Irresistible Force for much of the bout, even kicking out of the Annihilator to the shock of Jax. Later Bayley hit a Powerbomb on her huge opponent, but it wasn’t enough. With Bayley appearing on the brink of victory, Tiffany Stratton came to ringside to cash in her Money in the Bank briefcase, only to be punched off the apron by the champ. The distraction was enough for Jax to regain her bearings, and she finished the match in dominant fashion with two Powerbombs and another Annihilator to become the new WWE Women’s Champion.

Elsewhere, LA Knight captured his first title in WWE with a huge victory over Logan Paul. Paul tried to stack the odds against Knight, hitting him in the face with brass knuckles. However, when the YouTube star went for a Buckshot Lariat, Knight dodged and hit the BFT for the pinfall victory, becoming your new United States Champion. The former champion seemingly didn’t leave the bout unscathed, as Triple H revealed that Logan Paul was “banged up” following his title loss.

The first title change of the night came in the second match when Bron Breakker defeated Sami Zayn for the Intercontinental Championship. Zayn avoided a Spear early in the match and was able to take it to Breakker, hitting a Blue thunder Bomb and Exploder Suplex. However, he made a mistake when he charged at his opponent only to be met with a massive Spear. Breakker followed it with a second Spear for the victory in just over five minutes.

WWE SummerSlam 2024 Results: Liv Morgan Defeats Rhea Ripley.,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/wwe-summerslam-2024-live-updates-210321633.html,"It was a night of betrayal, shocks and surprises as WWE SummerSlam unfolded in front of 57,000 fans in Cleveland on Saturday.

All eyes were on CM Punk as he wrestled his first televised singles match in over a decade, going toe-to-toe with British star Drew McIntyre to conclude one of the hottest feuds of the year.

But it was “Dirty” Dominik Mysterio who set the tone for the evening long before those two stepped into the ring, turning on Rhea Ripley and The Judgement Day after the Women’s World Championship match opened the show.

The Judgement Day imploded further as the penultimate match of the night concluded, with Finn Balor betraying Damian Priest.

However, the biggest shock of the night came in the main event, which saw Cody Rhodes face Solo Sikoa for the Undisputed Universal Championship - amid rumours of a Roman Reigns return.

After a gruelling battle, “The American Nightmare” secured the three count to defend his title, as the “Tribal Chief” made his first appearance since WrestleMania, returning to attack his own Bloodline.

And that’s it for SummerSlam! The show goes off the air as Rhodes celebrates his title win, but Reigns has cast a massive shadow over WWE, drawing suggestions of a Bloodline civil war!

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Roman Reigns returns on entertaining night

04:02 , Ryan Coogan

Great show all around. It feels like every second PPV of the Triple H era automatically becomes a contender for my favorite show of the year, and this is no exception.

What really worked about this SummerSlam in comparison to last year is that there was real movement in the title scene - something that we haven’t had much of lately.

I’m really excited to see how this new status quo manifests in next Monday’s Raw and beyond.

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Roman Reigns hands Cody Rhodes victory in main event

03:58 , Oliver Browning

What an ending! Reigns handed Rhodes the victory after taking out Sikoa. But the “Real Tribal Chief” hasn’t taken his eyes of Rhodes since the bell confirmed his victory.

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Roman Reigns returns in main event

03:56 , Oliver Browning

Reigns goes after his own Bloodline! A Superman Punch flattens Sikoa, before a Spear puts him on his back! But Reigns leaves Rhodes untouched, and the champion takes full advantage, hitting one more Cross Rhodes to win!

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Cody Rhodes vs Solo Sikoa (WWE Undisputed Title)

03:52 , Oliver Browning

AND HERE HE IS! THE HEAD OF THE TABLE IS BACK! Roman Reigns’ music hits after yet another near fall!

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Cody Rhodes vs Solo Sikoa (WWE Undisputed Title)

03:51 , Oliver Browning

Now Jacob Fatu is here! It’s absolute carnage in the ring! After flattening Rhodes, he drags Sikoa onto the champion for the cover... but Cody still kicks out! He’s showing so much heart, but I’m not sure how much more he can take.

A helpless Rhodes is placed on the announce table, before Fatu climbs to the top rope and dives off, sending the champion through the table!

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Cody Rhodes vs Solo Sikoa (WWE Undisputed Title)

03:48 , Oliver Browning

Here come the first surprises of the night! Kevin Owens and Randy Orton come from outta nowhere to even the odds! The pair have come to Cody’s rescue, taking the Bloodline out of the equation. Stunners and RKOs everywhere!

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Cody Rhodes vs Solo Sikoa (WWE Undisputed Title)

03:43 , Oliver Browning

Sikoa looks fantastic out there, he is dominating right now. So much so, that the crowd appear almost silent.

But Rhodes is still looking to build some momentum and swing this one back in his favour. He gets the crowd back into it by hitting a Cross Rhodes on the counter... but here come the Bloodline!

Boos erupt inside the stadium as the WWE Tag Team Champions, Tonga Loa and Tama Tonga, attack Rhodes. It’s all completely legal under Bloodline rules!

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Cody Rhodes vs Solo Sikoa (WWE Undisputed Title)

03:38 , Oliver Browning

Sikoa has Rhodes in big trouble right now. He goes close with a couple of two-counts, the first coming after slamming the champion into the ground with a huge chokeslam.

Cody is showing plenty of guts, as he always does, and the longer this goes on the more frustrated Solo will get.

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Cody Rhodes vs Solo Sikoa (WWE Undisputed Title)

03:35 , Ryan Coogan

Solo has done such a good job of keeping this Bloodline story moving since Roman took a much-deserved leave of absence, but tonight does feel like the time to kick things up a gear.

Place your bets now - do we see a Roman Reigns return? The Rock? Or will it be something really left field?

Recent reports have suggested that WWE is open to bringing Brock Lesnar into the fold, and - here’s a really out there idea - Matt and Jeff Hardy have expressed interest in one more run with the company.

Or maybe this is where we finally see some AEW involvement? Ricky Starks, perhaps? A man can dream.

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Cody Rhodes vs Solo Sikoa (WWE Undisputed Title)

03:27 , Oliver Browning

The main event is now under way! Cody made Sikoa wait a rather long time as he made his champion’s entrance, but the current leader of the Bloodline doesn’t look too fazed.

After a staredown, the pair lock up in the centre of the ring - who will take control of this one?

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Cody Rhodes vs Solo Sikoa (WWE Undisputed Title)

03:24 , Ryan Coogan

What a great surprise it was to see Arn Anderson greet Cody on his way to the ring.

A former member of the Four Horsemen, Anderson was most recently seen in AEW, Cody’s former stomping grounds.

He gave Cody a few words of encouragement, and suggested Cody has “friends” ready to support him. Could we see a few more surprise appearances before the night is over?

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Cody Rhodes vs Solo Sikoa (WWE Undisputed Title)

03:18 , Oliver Browning

The main event is about to begin, and Sikoa makes his way out to the ring first. He is on his own for now and was not accompanied by any members of the Bloodline.

Rhodes, meanwhile, makes his way into the arena from his trailer, with his beloved dog Pharaoh - a rather unique entrance!

There are rumours that we could see Roman Reigns return tonight, so we’ll have to wait and see what unfolds.

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Main event up next as Cody Rhodes defends title

03:10 , Oliver Browning

And just like that, we’ve got one match remaining. The main event will see Cody Rhodes defend the Undisputed WWE Championship against Solo Sikoa in a Bloodline Rules Match.

But before we get to the main event, A-Town Down Under (Austin Theory and Grayson Waller) interrupt The Miz and R-Truth as they announce an official attendance of 57,791.

The heels do some work on the mic, insulting Cleveland and Jelly Roll, who performed earlier. As they turn their backs, the music star whacks them with a chair.

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: The Judgement Day implodes

03:01 , Oliver Browning

The Judgement Day walked into SummerSlam looking rock solid, but they’ve left in tatters. Where do we go from here?!

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Damian Priest vs Gunther (World Heavyweight Title)

02:59 , Oliver Browning

WOW! The Judgement Day has imploded! After fighting out of one hold, Priest begins to fade and is caught by a second sleeper. This time, Gunther locks it in after delivering a powerbomb - and that’s enough to end the match!

Gunther is the new World Heavyweight Champion, but Priest has been screwed by his own stablemate!

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Damian Priest vs Gunther (World Heavyweight Title)

02:57 , Oliver Browning

MORE JUDGEMENT DAY CARNAGE! As Priest mounts a comeback to pin Gunther, Balor grabs the Austrian’s foot and rests it on the rope, breaking the referee’s count!

Unsure of what happened at first, Priest has just watched the replay on the big screen with everyone else, and now realises what has unfolded!

Taking advantage, Gunther locks in a submission hold, but the champion battles out! The crowd are absolutely loving this!

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Damian Priest vs Gunther (World Heavyweight Title)

02:54 , Oliver Browning

Gunther is dripping in blood now! The commentary team has described this as an uncomfortable watch, but this is probably the way the challenger likes it. Even Finn Balor at ringside can’t stop him from laying into the champion now!

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Damian Priest vs Gunther (World Heavyweight Title)

02:52 , Ryan Coogan

We have our first blood! And in a shocking turn of events, it came from a chop delivered from Priest to Gunther instead of the other way around. My entire world is being turned upside down.

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Damian Priest vs Gunther (World Heavyweight Title)

02:48 , Oliver Browning

In a shocking turn of events, it’s Gunther who has been on the receiving end of some NASTY shots! His chest is already looking very raw... the blood is flowing! Priest is doing well so far, proving why he is a deserving champion!

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Damian Priest vs Gunther (World Heavyweight Title)

02:40 , Ryan Coogan

Gunther has the most perfect gimmick in the history of this business: he’s a wrestler who hasn’t been told that wrestling is supposed to be fake. Bad news for Damian Priest, good news for fans of gratuitous chest carnage!

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Gunther faces Damian Priest for World Heavyweight Championship

02:39 , Oliver Browning

It’s time for the penultimate match of the night, as Damian Priest defends his World Heavyweight title against Gunther. The Judgement Day has already been rocked by “Dirty” Dom’s betrayal of Ripley earlier tonight, will that play some part in the outcome of this match?

Any slip up from Priest will be punished by Gunther, who has a chance to win one of the biggest prizes in WWE tonight. If he does, it will surely be a long, long time before anyone can de-throne him! The two men are in the ring and we’re ready to go!

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: LA Knight gets famous Triple H photo

02:34 , Oliver Browning

It feels like we’re flying through this card! Just a reminder that LA Knight won the United States Championship earlier tonight, and fans are going wild for his long overdue “Triple H point” photo!

What a ride it’s been for @RealLAKnight. Congratulations to your NEW #USChampion on an unbelievably well-deserved championship victory at #SummerSlam pic.twitter.com/xJWuoV9R6t — Triple H (@TripleH) August 4, 2024

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: What next for CM Punk after McIntyre defeat?

02:32 , Ryan Coogan

There are so many potential matches that could come out of this.

Seth vs Punk, a Triple Threat between all three, Hell in a Cell. Just keep it going, I can watch these guys go back and forth forever.

CM Punk keeps talking about how much he’s grown, and I think agreeing to lose his first televised singles match in over a decade is the clearest evidence of that we’ve had so far.

Really great work from all involved here, and a great way to set up a rematch down the road.

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: CM Punk vs Drew McIntyre

02:30 , Oliver Browning

That was a lot of fun, but in the end, it was Punk’s issue with Rollins that cost him the match - potentially setting up a future feud between the pair?

Rollins makes himself scarce soon after McIntyre’s win is confirmed, and with Punk flat on his back inside the ring, the Scotsman rubs salt in the wounds by taking the bracelet from his opponent once more.

“CM Punk cost himself this match tonight,” Michael Cole says on commentary.

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: CM Punk vs Drew McIntyre

02:27 , Oliver Browning

With Rollins on the floor, Punk grabs his bracelet back, but his issues with Rollins ultimately cost him here. Watching the argument unfold, McIntyre takes his opportunity and nails Punk with a Claymore!

One... two... two and a half... THREE! McIntyre wins, even with a very, very slow count from the ref!

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: CM Punk vs Drew McIntyre

02:24 , Oliver Browning

There’s another flashpoint here are Rollins grabs Punk’s bracelet - which Drew has been parading for weeks - leading to a staredown between the pair.

McIntyre then knocks the referee out of the ring and is caught off-guard by Punk, who hits his “GTS” finisher for the first time tonight.

Without a referee to count, McIntyre survives, and Punk turns his attention to Rollins, demanding he count to three!

Rollins, though, doesn’t take too kindly to being shouted at, but ends up taking a “GTS” himself!

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: CM Punk vs Drew McIntyre

02:20 , Oliver Browning

Punk has still got it! McIntyre has dominated for much of the match, but we’ve just seen some vintage CM Punk! A couple of running knees in the corner are followed by a clothesline that flattens Drew, before he delivers a flying elbow from the top rope!

He then locks in the Anaconda Vice, but McIntyre survives, and seconds later rocks Punk with a Claymore Kick! The crowd are absolutely loving it, and we don’t look done yet!

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: CM Punk vs Drew McIntyre

02:17 , Oliver Browning

McIntyre is urging Rollins to turn a blind eye to some of his more illegal actions, telling him that he can make the Punk problem “go away”.

The guest referee initially turns his back, but grabs a steel chair from McIntyre’s hands before he can hit Punk! Rollins said ahead of SummerSlam that his aim was to avoid getting involved physically, but it seems that has all gone out the window early on.

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: CM Punk vs Drew McIntyre

02:13 , Oliver Browning

Referee Rollins is... letting quite a lot go! He appears to draw the line at McIntyre smacking Punk’s head against the underside of the steel ring, but then gives him the green light to do it anyway. Brutal.

Punk got some offence in early, but it’s been all Drew for the last few minutes. Rollins also seems to be egging on the Scottish star!

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: CM Punk vs Drew McIntyre

02:10 , Ryan Coogan

It doesn’t matter how many times it happens, there’s something very surreal about seeing CM Punk back in a WWE ring after all these years.

This will be his first singles match in the company since 2013, and they’ve done a great job of making it feel as monumental as it is.

On a card with this many title defenses it’s a real acheivement to make a non-title match feel this big. This feud with McIntyre is an all-timer, and I wouldn’t be upset to see it carry on right through to next year’s WrestleMania!

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: CM Punk vs Drew McIntyre

02:07 , Oliver Browning

And here comes CM Punk, to a huge ovation, and chants that include a word we definitely cannot repeat.

This is his first one-on-one televised match in WWE for over 10 years... and after a bit of back and forth between the trio in the ring, Rollins gets this match under way! Big fight feel here!

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: CM Punk vs Drew McIntyre

02:02 , Oliver Browning

Special guest referee Seth Rollins has made his entrance ahead of Punk and McIntyre... showing off his very impressive fit!

McIntyre, meanwhile, is wearing black with a hint of green. The pair share a quick conversation before Rollins banishes him to his corner.

Next up, it’s the one we’ve all been waiting for, CM Punk vs Drew McIntyre!

This will be Punk’s first televised singles’ match since making his return to WWE last year.

It’s been a long, long time coming, and who better for him to share the ring with than McIntyre? Their feud has been red hot, and it’s likely going to conclude tonight.

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Nia Jax walks out as new women’s champ

01:52 , Ryan Coogan

Glad they’re keeping the wheels spinning a little longer on a potential Tiffy cash in. WWE has a history of women MITB holders pulling the trigger almost as soon as they get the briefcase, but there’s real storyline potential here.

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Bayley vs Nia Jax (WWE Women’s Title)

01:50 , Oliver Browning

But wait! Stratton only serves as a distraction for Jax to take control! Ms Money in the Bank is flattened by a quick punch from Bayley and doesn’t even have time to cash in her briefcase before Nia slams the champion to the floor with a double powerbomb.

She then lands another “Annihilator” from the second rope to secure the victory... and celebrates hand in hand with Stratton!

Jax is the new WWE Women’s Champion!

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Bayley vs Nia Jax (WWE Women’s Title)

01:46 , Oliver Browning

OH MY WORD! In an incredible show of strength, Bayley lifts Jax into the air, takes a few steps across the ring and power-slams her opponent to the floor! But even that is not enough for the three count!

And the drama continues, as Tiffany Stratton comes charging to the ring with her Money in the Bank briefcase!

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Bayley vs Nia Jax (WWE Women’s Title)

01:44 , Oliver Browning

Jax, from the middle rope, connects with her statement “Annihilator”, but Bayley kicks out at two!

That, though, has only angered Jax, who throws the champion into a corner and begins taughting her.

Bayley tries to bounce back with a dive to ringside, but is caught by Jax once again, who tosses her back into the ring.

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Bayley vs Nia Jax (WWE Women’s Title)

01:41 , Ryan Coogan

Nia Jax used to get a lot of flack from certain corners of the wrestling fandom for not being up to the same level of some of the women’s roster, but you can’t deny that she’s been putting the work in since she returned to WWE last year.

Her character work and moveset have both really moved up to a whole new level this year, and a win here would be well deserved.

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Bayley vs Nia Jax (WWE Women’s Title)

01:40 , Oliver Browning

More than 50,000 fans have packed into the Cleveland Browns Stadium for SummerSlam tonight, and they’re enjoying this one!

Jax was in control of the early exchanges, but Bayley is finding her way into this one now. She’s starting to take the fight to the challenger, and the pair engage a short brawl at ringside before stepping back inside the squared circle.

More gold on the line next, as Bayley defends her WWE Women’s Championship against Nia Jax.

This, interestingly, is Nia’s first-ever SummerSlam match, and she wore her Queen of the Ring crown as she made her entrance. Will she walk out with the title belt too?

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: LA Knight crowned new US Champion

01:25 , Ryan Coogan

This has been such a long time coming for LA Knight. I was at Money in the Bank at the O2 last year, and the place came completely unglued from the second his music hit to the second he left the arena. Really pleased to see him finally get his dues.

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Logan Paul vs LA Knight (United States Title)

01:24 , Oliver Browning

Unsurprisingly, there’s been a lot of interference in this one... Machine Gun Kelly has handed a pair of brass knuckles to Paul, after members of his entourage were taken out by LA Knight.

As Paul is dragged back into the ring, he catches his opponent - but not cleanly - with the knuckles.

The shot isn’t enough to keep Knight down, who surprises the champion by springing back to his feet and connecting with his finisher!

This time there is no kick out and we have a new champion, it’s LA Knight... YEAH!!!

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Logan Paul vs LA Knight (United States Title)

01:17 , Oliver Browning

We’re deep into this bout now and Paul hits a “KO Punch” looking for the win! One... two... NO! LA Knight kicks out, but only just!

Both men look like they’re feeling the pain in this one. Seconds after the near fall, LA Knight lands a huge superplex from the top rope, but somehow Paul finds the strength to kick out!

These two are leaving it all in the ring tonight.

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Logan Paul vs LA Knight (United States Title)

01:12 , Ryan Coogan

I’m not sure what they’re doing to those announce tables, but they only seem to break once in every five times they’re supposed to now. Perhaps it’s better than collapsing the second somebody climbs on top of one, but surely there’s a middle ground.I’m also not a huge fan of this “Logan is supposed to be controversial” angle, considering some of his recent Twitter activities.

In wrestling there’s a fine line between effective heel work and causing genuine offense, and Paul has leapfrogged over that line in the past few days.

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Logan Paul vs LA Knight (United States Title)

01:10 , Oliver Browning

As he usually does, LA Knight is playing to the crowd, who chant his name back to him. He’s in control in the early exchanges, but Paul is showing off some of his impressive in-ring ability.

Like Breakker earlier tonight, Knight is looking to win his first title on the main roster, and many fans believe a belt is long overdue.

Paul is also feeding off the crowd tonight, revelling in the “you suck!” chants before attempting a pin, which Knight swiftly kicks out of.

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Logan Paul (C) vs LA Knight (United States Title)

01:04 , Oliver Browning

Paul, an Ohio native, has been accompanied to the ring by rapper Machine Gun Kelly. He was met with more boos than expected from the hometown crowd.

LA Knight, meanwhile, drew a VERY positive reaction from the WWE fans as he rolled up in Paul’s PRIME truck, before smashing one of the windows.

There’s clearly a lot of bad blood between the two as they engage in a brawl at ringside before the bell even rings.

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Stephanie McMahon spotted in crowd

Sunday 4 August 2024 00:59 , Oliver Browning

Stephanie McMahon has been spotted taking in the action at SummerSlam.

Next up is another highly-anticipated match, as Logan Paul puts the United States title on the line against LA Knight.

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Bron Breakker wins first gold on main roster

Sunday 4 August 2024 00:53 , Ryan Coogan

FINALLY they pull the trigger on Bron Breakker.

Him losing at Money in the Bank was one of the more baffling booking decisions this year, and this feels like a much-needed attempt to rectify that. A shame for Sami, but I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s a world title in his future…

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Sami Zayn vs Bron Breakker (Intercontinental Title)

Sunday 4 August 2024 00:50 , Oliver Browning

WOW! After surviving the near fall, Breakker flattens Zayn with back-to-back spears!

One... two... three! And just like that... we have a new Intercontinental Champion!

Breakker gets the job done in less than 10 minutes, total domination!

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Sami Zayn vs Bron Breakker (Intercontinental Title)

Sunday 4 August 2024 00:49 , Oliver Browning

Breakker is looking to win his first title on the main roster, after being called up from NXT in February.

Standing in his way is Zayn, one of WWE’s most notable workhorses.

Breakker came flying out of the blocks and is now screaming in Sami’s face, urging him to quit. That is perhaps a mistake, and has only riled up the champion.

Zayn hits an impressive “Blue Thunder Bomb” for the first near-fall, but Breakker kicks out at two!

Sunday 4 August 2024 00:43 , Oliver Browning

The Judgement Day are reeling from Dom’s betrayal. Backstage, Damian Priest vows revenge as he’s restrained by Finn Bálor and JD McDonagh.

Meanwhile, it’s time for the next match of SummerSlam! Sami Zayn vs Bron Breakker for the Intercontinental Championship is next.

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: ‘Dirty’ Dom turns on Ripley

Sunday 4 August 2024 00:35 , Oliver Browning

With Ripley on her back in the ring, Mysterio slips out and greets Morgan... and the pair share a passionate kiss!

The two-timing “piece of trash” - as described by the commentary team - then makes his way up the ramp arm in arm with Morgan.

Ripley is left heartbroken in the ring as the new couple are showered with boos from the crowd... it’s another huge heel turn from “Dirty” Dom!

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Liv Morgan vs Rhea Ripley (Women’s World Title)

Sunday 4 August 2024 00:32 , Oliver Browning

Interference from “Dirty” Dom costs Ripley!

We knew it wouldn’t be long until he got involved. As Ripley lifted up a steel chair to attack Morgan, Mysterio grabbed it from her.

He was trying to save her from being disqualified, but Morgan took full advantage and attacked Ripley from behind.

With “Mami” stunned, Morgan hit one last move off the ropes for the three count! She has successfully defended her title!

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Liv Morgan vs Rhea Ripley (Women’s World Title)

Sunday 4 August 2024 00:28 , Ryan Coogan

Between this feud, and the Punk vs McIntyre match later on, this whole show is a real masterclass in the wrestling pivot.

Both storylines were derailed by injury earlier in the year, and both ended up being some of the hottest feuds heading into SummerSlam thanks to some clever adaptive storytelling.

It’s been a real high point of the Triple H era - we saw the same thing happen in the lead up to WrestleMania, when the plans for the main event were changed to accommodate fan reaction to the planned Rock vs Roman Reigns match.

We didn’t see this nearly as much under the previous administration, and it’s been a refreshing change of pace for the company.

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Liv Morgan vs Rhea Ripley (Women’s World Title)

Sunday 4 August 2024 00:25 , Oliver Browning

Ripley has fixed her “dislocated shoulder” by driving herself into the announce table, much to the shock of Morgan.

After she popped her shoulder back in, commentator Michael Cole described the action as “the most disgusting thing I’ve ever seen”.

Back in the ring, Morgan counters Ripley’s “Riptide” finisher for a two-count.

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Liv Mogan vs Rhea Ripley (Women’s World Title)

Sunday 4 August 2024 00:22 , Oliver Browning

Ripley and Morgan have been going back and forth in the ring, and the first flashpoint sees “Mami” complain of a dislocated shoulder.

While she confides in Mysterio at ringside, Morgan takes full advantage, driving her shoulder-first into the steel steps.

WWE SummerSlam LIVE: Ripley and Morgan make their entrances as first match begins

Sunday 4 August 2024 00:14 , Oliver Browning

The two stars opening tonight’s action have made their way to the ring. Ripley was accompanied by Mysterio, while Morgan made her way down the ramp showing off her belt.

“Dirty” Dom is watching the action unfold from ringside as his “Mami” looks to end Morgan’s title reign after 70 days.

WWE SummerSlam LIVE

Saturday 3 August 2024 22:00 , Alex Pattle

WWE’s second-biggest event of the year has arrived, as SummerSlam plays out at the Cleveland Browns Stadium.

There are rumours that Roman Reigns, one of the WWE’s most popular stars, could return tonight – featuring for the first time since WrestleMania in April – while numerous big names have been confirmed for the match card.

Ohio’s own Logan Paul will defend the US Title against fan favourite LA Knight, while Cody Rhodes defends the Undisputed WWE Title against Solo Sikoa, and the returning Rhea Ripley challenges Liv Morgan for the Women’s World Title.

Elsewhere, CM Punk competes in his first WWE singles match in 10 years, a grudge match with Drew McIntyre, in which Seth Rollins will serve as the special guest referee.

Sami Zayn, Bayley and Damian Priest will also defend their respective titles, and you can follow all the action live, right here."
WWE SummerSlam 2024 Results: Liv Morgan Defeats Rhea Ripley.,https://www.sportingnews.com/us/wwe/news/wwe-summerslam-2024-preview-results-how-watch-match-card-and-more/43d0fba22803887deb7123e5,"It was definitely time to batten down the hatches when Summerslam 2024 got underway in Cleveland on Saturday, Aug. 3, seeing as their was a twister of turmoil heading that way for the latest WWE premium live event — one that promised all types of turns and plot upheavals from The Bloodline and Cody Rhodes, CM Punk and Drew McIntyre (and Seth Rollins), and a list of other superstars waiting to brawl.

With a total of six titles on the line, you had to know not everyone would play fair and, more to that point, that some would be greeted with surprise appearances from those they most fear.

Betrayal owned the day in Cleveland, and it began with Liv Morgan not only retaining her WWE Women’s World Championship against Rhea Ripley, but doing so with the help of Dominik Mysterio going completely “Dirty” in betraying Mami; and that led to Damian Priest putting hands on Finn Balor who then finally had enough and turned on him to cost Priest the WWE Heavyweight Championship.

There was a slew of titles changing hands, factions being destroyed and so much more from what became one of the best WWE events of the entire year.

And with the first of the Big-4 PLEs, now wrapped, let’s take a look at the fallout by way of the most memorable moments from Summerslam.

Trust me, there were PLENTY.

WWE Women’s World Championship

Liv Morgan (c) vs. Rhea Ripley

Result: Morgan wins due to interference

Don't Forget About ... the Revenge Tour reaching its ... climax (ha)... when Dominik Mysterio proved why he is, in fact, “Dirty”, his latest WWE betrayal being nearly as devastatingly impactful as his first one. What this means for the fate of TJD is very obvious, with one of its OG members having defected to go and Liv his best life with the champion — as the little gold digger he's become as of late. Meanwhile, Jey Uso should get the Waffle House order ready.

WWE Intercontinental Championship

Sami Zayn (c) vs. Bron Breakker

Result: Breakker wins clean by pinfall

Don't Forget About ... the Helluva Kick gone wrong. There was plenty of back-and-forth in this match but Zayn, for the first time in a long time, looked mostly overpowered but, despite that reality, he still had an opportunity to put the rookie away after the Exploder into the corner. He took too long loading up for the Helluva Kick though, and got cut in two by a spear instead, and then by another, and that was pretty much that. And newwwww!!!!

WWE United States Championship

Result: LA Knight wins clean by pinfall

Logan Paul (c) vs. LA Knight

Don't Forget About ... the failed assistance of the artist MGK, having accompanied Logan Paul to ringside. It was a foregone conclusion that someone would break out the brass knuckles to try and finish Knight off, and it didn’t come by way of his Prime cohorts but when MGK took off a chain that contained them and handed them to Paul. Things didn’t go how Paul thought they would thereafter, with a BFT planting his face into the mat for the three count and, just like that, Knight has finally, finally acquired gold. YEAH!

WWE Women’s Championship

Bayley (c) vs. Nia Jax

Result: Nia Jax wins clean by pinfall

Don't Forget About ... Tiffany Stratton’s role in this outcome. It was a banger between Bayley and Jax, to say the least, but you felt the entire time that Tiffy Time would make an appearance and impact the match, and that’s precisely what happened. She ran down the ring to try and cash in, again, on Bayley but was immediately dismissed with a punch to the face by the champ. The distraction gave Jax the time to regain her stride and then power bomb Bayley twice followed by not one, but two Annihilators (three total in the match). And new … but wait … and now … when does Tiffy turn on Nia?

Grudge Match

Drew McIntyre vs. CM Punk (special guest referee: Seth Rollins)

Result: Drew McIntyre wins clean by pinfall

Don't Forget About ... the emotions of CM Punk getting the best of him in this match. He was being dismantled for much of the match and finally got things to turn in his favor, but the bracelet that means so much to him did him in, in the end. Having his submission locked in and with McIntyre nearly tapping out, he released the hold to take the bracelet off of McIntyre’s wrist. Later, with another chance to end it, he noticed Seth Rollins was wearing it and, well, he lost it and it cost him dearly. And it’s now time for the Seth Rollins versus CM Punk feud to feed families, but that doesn’t mean he’s done with McIntyre — though there’s also poetic justice in McIntyre now being able to tell Punk, “You did this to yourself.”

WWE Heavyweight Championship

Damian Priest (c) vs. Gunther

Result: Gunther wins due to interference

Don't Forget About ... Liv Morgan’s influence here. If you’ve been reading what I’ve been writing about this storyline over the past several months — reminding you that Liv Morgan once teamed up with Finn Balor (and AJ Styles) to combat The Judgment Day and it was clear Balor had warmed back up to her after she helped them get the tag titles. So when Damian Priest put his hands on Balor after Dom’s betrayal of Ripley, the camel’s back was broken, and so was TJD, for good. Priest’s fury after Balor saved Gunther from a loss helped him escape the first submission move but he didn’t use that energy wisely, so he found himself in a second one and asleep while the title changed hands.

WWE Universal Championship

Cody Rhodes (c) vs. Solo Sikoa

Result: Rhodes retains due to interference

Don't Forget About ... Roman Reigns is BACK. THE END. #AcknowledgeHim"

Open Extended Reactions

Cody Rhodes retained his Universal WWE Championship over Solo Sikoa on Saturday night in Cleveland, but the biggest moment of the night belonged to Roman Reigns.

Reigns, the former Universal champion, returned from four months off to handle some business with Sikoa, as the ""Original Tribal Chief"" delivered a Superman Punch and spear to his cousin to hand the victory to Rhodes.

What does this mean for The Bloodline? Is Reigns all the way back? We'll have to find out in the coming weeks following Saturday's festivities.

Five other titles were up for grabs in Cleveland Stadium, and four of them changed hands. Here's everything that went down on the seven-match fight card in the 2024 edition of SummerSlam.

For some wrestling fans, star ratings are a way of life. It’s one thing to say that a match is good or bad, but can you actually put a number on it?

The star rating system is a scale ranging from 0 to 5 with increments of 0.25. A 5-star match is as close to perfect as it gets while a 0-star match is a complete dud.

Determining the star rating for a given match is a highly subjective process. In general the goal is to wrap up all the important elements of a match into one simple number. Some factors to consider may include the story and booking of the match, the workrate of the performers, ring psychology, length of the match, audience reaction, and so forth.

The purpose of Cageside Community Star Ratings is for the readers to assign star ratings to every single match on a given WWE pay-per-view event. There is no such thing as a wrong answer, because every wrestling fan consumes this art form in a different way.

The next match up for debate from SummerSlam is Liv Morgan vs. Rhea Ripley.

WWE SummerSlam 2024 Results: Liv Morgan Defeats Rhea Ripley.,https://www.sportingnews.com/au/wwe/news/wwe-summerslam-2024-full-card-results-pro-wrestling/56ac00c624a6a12b9c509ca2,"Cody Rhodes retained the Undisputed WWE Title in front of a record crowd in Cleveland, though re received assistance after the dramatic return of Roman Reigns.

In an action packed 'Bloodline Rules' match, both Rhodes and his challenger Solo Sikoa were joined at various times in the ring by multiple other wrestlers, including The Bloodline to assist Sikoa, as well as Kevin Owens and Randy Orton coming into bat for Rhodes.

Both men were close to pinning down each other in sometimes scarcely believable circumstances, but it would be the return of Reigns, who has been away since Wrestlemania, that would ultimately be the deciding factor in the match.

Reigns, after slowly making his way towards the ring, would hit Sikoa firstly with a Superman punch, followed by a spear; this gave Rhodes the chance to use his Cross Rhodes to finally put Sikoa to bed and successfully pinning him down.

It was a thrilling end to a great night of wrestling action. as over 54,000 fans piled in to Cleveland Browns Stadium, a record for Summerslam.

Four Titles changed hands, including Gunther winning the World Heavyweight Title off Damian Priest after the latter was betrayed by Finn Balor.

It was not the only instance of betrayal in Cleveland, as earlier in the night, as in the Women's World Championship fight, as Dominik Mysterio betrayed Lea Ripley by causing a distraction, allowing Liv Morgan to retain her title; Mysterio and Morgan shared a kiss post-match, confirming Mysterio's new alligegiance.

Nia Jax was able to gain the WWE Women's Title against Bayley, with a little help from a Tiffany Stratton, whilst Bron Breakker and LA Knight were able to defeat Sami Zayn and local hero Logan Paul to win the WWE Intercontinental Title and WWE United States Championship respectively.

The only match without a title on the line was still an eagerly awaited one, as the feud between CM Punk and Drew McIntyre reached its peak in their match with special guest referee Seth ""Freakin"" Rollins.

There were arguments within the match between all three main men, and though Punk looked like he was about to steal a notable victory, some lapses in concentration allowed McIntyre to get the win via pinfall, though we doubt it is the end of the feud at all.

WWE SUMMERSLAM RESULTS – 8/3/24

The “Countdown to WWE SummerSlam 2024” pre-show kicks off outside in sunny Cleveland, OH., where Michael Cole welcomes us to the panel. Joining him are Pat McAfee, Wade Barrett and Big E.

Following their opening banter, they send things to Byron Saxton and Jackie Redmond, who check-in from outside of Cody Rhodes’ “American Nightmare” bus and The Judgment Day Clubhouse.

Also checking in is Cathy Kelley, who talks about CM Punk being eerily calm during her discussion with him ahead of tonight’s big event. She also plugs the Michael Cole sit-down interview with Punk, which is already available on WWE’s YouTube channel.

We head into a number of promotional video packages in between additional banter and hype from the pre-show panelists. We then see a lengthy hype video package promoting The Miz as a darling son of Cleveland in an attempt to ensure he gets a favorable crowd reaction tonight.

We then see footage of him on The Miz Express tour bus, which Cole calls the SummerSlam Express bus. Live outside the arena in Cleveland, R-Truth, DIY, Miz and Maryse come out of the bus, interact with the fans waiting to get in, and then we return to the panelists for some more time-killing chit-chat.

Cathy Kelley is live in The Judgment Day Clubhouse with “Dirty” Dominik Mysterio. He talks about The Judgment Day having a big night with Damian Priest and Rhea Ripley in title matches. Dom-Dom says they’ll return on Raw with all the gold and then asks her to leave.

The panel goofs around for a bit again and throw it over to The Miz. The WWE SummerSlam 2024 host awkwardly stumbles through his words trying to interview a random shy kid in the “Fan Zone” with Peter Rosenberg. Back to the panel for a few and then we see Michael Cole’s lengthy sit-down interview with Seth “Freakin'” Rollins.

They promote him joining the panel later in the pre-show. We move on to a walk-and-talk with Peter Rosenberg and Damian Priest in Bronx, and inside Yankees Stadium. After that wraps up, footage of GUNTHER crashing Damian Priest Live on Friday in Cleveland.

Back at the panel, Cole tags out and Jackie Redmond tags in as the panel host. Also swapping out is Pat McAfee, and swapping in is Peter Rosenberg. The talk shifts to Cody Rhodes vs. Solo Sikoa for the first time on the pre-show, and the elaborate “Road to” pre-match video package for it airs.

We return to Big E. with a selfie stick in a sea of fans. He also teases the possibility of fans seeing someone they haven’t seen in quite a while tonight. Wonder if another chief is in the house? The talk at the panel shifts to the Liv Morgan vs. Rhea Ripley match for the women’s world title.

We see a sit-down interview between Redmond and Ripley. Then we shoot to backstage interviews with WWE Women’s World Champion Liv Morgan, as well as “Queen” Nia Jax and 2024 Ms. Money In The Bank Tiffany Stratton. After that wraps up, we shoot inside Cleveland Browns Stadium for the first time, where Michael Cole is standing in the middle of the ring.

He talks about the Punk-McIntyre bout and sends things to his sit-down interview with CM Punk himself. When that’s in the rear-view mirror, we head back to the pre-show panel, where the panelists are joined by the one-and-only Seth “Freakin'” Rollins.

“The Visionary” and “The Revolutionary” of WWE settles in with his zebra-colored, referee-style suit and bowtie, and talks about what exactly Rollins Rules means. Essentially, it’s anything goes and he may or may not get involved himself at some point, from the sounds of it.

WWE Hall of Fame legend Sean Waltman joins the panel for the next few segments with the panelists and then we shoot to a Pat McAfee sit-down interview with Jelly Roll, the artist who did the themes for tonight’s show and an apparent big deal in modern music. Don’t ask me!

WWE Women’s World Championship

Liv Morgan (c) vs. Rhea Ripley

Soon after this, the “Countdown to WWE SummerSlam 2024” pre-show wraps up. “WWE Then. Now. Forever. Together.” flashes on the screen and then we shoot into the cold open for tonight’s premium live event. Inside the jam-packed Cleveland Browns Stadium, WWE SummerSlam 2024 Host The Miz has some fun in the crowd to start the show.

Backstage, we see Rhea Ripley walking the halls with “Dirty” Dominik Mysterio. The camera follows them all the way to Gorilla position and through the curtain, all the way down to the ring. Liv Morgan is introduced next and out comes the reigning, defending WWE Women’s World Champion. It’s time for our first match of the evening.

The bell sounds and off we go. Morgan quickly gets out of the ring and taunts her from ringside. Ripley goes outside and chases her, but Morgan gets in the ring and laughs at her. Ripley looks frustrated. Ripley gets in the ring, but Morgan quickly gets out. Ripley shouts at her and goes outside, but Morgan gets in the ring.

Ripley is not happy. Ripley gets in the ring, and once again, Morgan gets out. Ripley fakes getting out of the ring, so Morgan gets in the ring and finds herself face-to-face with her challenger. Ripley blocks a right hand and hits a pair of short-arm clotheslines. Ripley ducks an attack and hits a third short-arm clothesline. Ripley connects with a half-and-half suplex, sending Morgan in a heap to ringside.

Ripley goes outside and high-fives Mysterio before licking his cheek in front of a jealous Morgan. Ripley attacks Morgan and bounces her off the barricade before chopping her chest. Ripley bounces Morgan’s face off the ring steps a few times before putting her in the ring. Ripley sizes Morgan up on the mat and goes for a clothesline, but Morgan ducks it. Ripley quickly rebounds with a vicious head-butt.

Ripley hits a Rip Tide into the top turnbuckle. Ripley goes for a Rip Tide in the center of the ring, but Morgan slides off and retreats to the corner. Ripley approaches, but Morgan pulls her into the second turnbuckle. Morgan grabs Ripley and shoves her recently healed shoulder into the ring post. Ripley’s shoulder appears to be dislocated and her right arm is dangling. Ripley shouts, “It’s out!” The referee asks if she wants to stop the match, but Ripley refuses.

Ripley gets out of the ring, but Morgan attacks her at ringside and big boots her into the ring steps. Morgan stomps Ripley and puts her in the ring for a two-count. Morgan stomps her down before wrenching the injured arm and slamming her down. Morgan covers for a two-count. Morgan pulls Ripley’s hair and shouts, “This is my revenge tour!” Morgan applies an armbar to Ripley’s injured shoulder. Morgan gets up and kicks away at the shoulder.

Ripley lifts Morgan and slams her down onto the mat for a two-count. After some more back-and-forth action, we see Ripley hit a Rip-Tide and have this one finished off, when she is given a chair by Dom-Dom. She goes to use it, but when she goes to swing it, Dom-Dom grabs it and stops her.

The crowd gasps. Ripley looks pissed. Dom-Dom tries explaining he just doesn’t want her to win it this way. Morgan ends up hitting her finisher and retaining her title. Ripley is pissed. Outside of the ring, Dom-Dom shrugs his shoulders and then he and Morgan have a big make-out session as an enraged Ripley watches on from in the ring.

WWE Intercontinental Championship

Sami Zayn (c) vs. Bron Breakker

After we see Sami Zayn stretching and warming up backstage, and a shot of Bron Breakker getting ready, we head into the in-depth pre-match video package that tells the story leading up to our second match of tonight’s premium live event, which is for the WWE Intercontinental Championship.

When the package wraps up, we see an enraged Damian Priest asking The Judgment Day guys where Dom-Dom is. Finn Balor comes in and Priest snatches him up by his shirt. He asks if Balor knew about this. Balor insists he didn’t, and they all assure him they too want to find that dirt bag. They head off to do exactly that and Balor assures him they’ll find him. Uht oh.

Back inside Cleveland Browns Stadium, it’s time for the dogs to get ta’ barkin’, as former multiple-time WWE NXT World Champion Bron Breakker makes his way out and heads to the ring. After he settles inside the squared circle, Sami Zayn’s catchy-ass entrance tune hits and the crowd in Cleveland goes bonkers as he makes his way to the ring for his latest title defense in a rematch against Breakker.

Breakker starts off charging across the ring as soon as the bell sounds. Zayn side-steps him and Breakker crashes shoulder-first into the steel ring post with authority. Zayn enjoyed some offensive control for a few minutes from there, but it wasn’t long before Breakker took over.

He hit a few vicious spears, turning Zayn inside-out in the process, and scores the pin fall for the relatively easy victory to become your brand new WWE Intercontinental Champion. The crowd ate up Breakker as the new champ afterwards, with a lot of barking and clearly excited fans in the background of the camera shot, as Breakker holds the I-C title high in the air.

Winner and NEW WWE Intercontinental Champion: Bron Breakker

WWE United States Championship

Logan Paul (c) vs. LA Knight

A very skinny Stephanie McMahon-Levesque is shown sitting ringside at WWE SummerSlam 2024 in Cleveland, OH., with the crowd giving her a big reaction.

Our third title bout in three matches is up next, as it’s time for the WWE United States Championship to be put up for grabs by Logan Paul, as he defends it against “The Mega Star” LA Knight next.

The elaborate pre-match video package for that one airs now. When it wraps up, the reigning and defending U.S. Champion is introduced first. Out comes Logan Paul, who is met by Cleveland music star Machine Gun Kelly.

Logan Paul and MGK head to the ring together and settle inside the squared circle. After that, we see LA Knight with Logan Paul’s PRIME hummer once again. Inside the big host venue for “The Biggest Party of the Summer,” out comes “The Mega Star” for his big title opportunity.

Paul immediately attacks him as he’s getting in the ring. They continue to brawl at ringside while still wearing their entrance attire. The match finally gets going in the ring and Knight takes over control of the offense. After a few more minutes, things slow down a bit.

We see Paul hit an absolutely insane springboard moonsault to the floor on Knight. His leg almost buckled under him on the landing. Yikes. Back in the ring, Paul decks Knight with a KO shot and covers him, but only gets two and looks shocked. Knight hits an insane top-rope brainbuster.

The action spills out to the floor again. Knight beats down Paul and has two of his friends yapping in his face over the barricade. Knight no-look yanks them both over it to the floor at ringside and stomps them both as fans chant “YEAH! YEAH!” Paul attacks him from behind.

MGK sneaks the brass knuckles to him. He KOs Knight with them. He drops them and heads to the ring apron for a buckshot lariat, but Knight counters and pins him for the win. We have a new WWE United States Champion, and he’s “The Mega Star.”

Winner and NEW WWE United States Champion: LA Knight

WWE Women’s Championship

Bayley (c) vs. Nia Jax

After a goofy-ass sponsored segment with Baron Corbin helping to shave Apollo Crews head, and Otis coming in with Akira Tozawa and Maxxine Dupri to grease up his big gross stomach, we shoot to the pre-match video package for our next match, which features yet another title on-the-line.

The WWE Women’s Championship is up next, as Bayley defends her title against 2024 WWE Queen of the Ring winner Nia Jax. “Queen” Nia comes out with her crown on to a bunch of boos. Bayley comes out to a huge pop and settles in the ring. The bell sounds and off we go.

We see some good back-and-forth action for several minutes, and then things start to pick up. Bayley takes Nia off the ropes for a huge power bomb for a close near fall. Bayley seemed to have things finished up and out came Tiffany Stratton to cash in her Money In The Bank briefcase.

When she goes to cash it in, however, she gets bumped and then Bayley hits a running kick to Nia. Nia recovers and takes Bayley out with two power bombs. She drags her lifeless body to the corner and hits two Annihlators for the pin fall victory.

We have a new WWE Women’s Champion. She and Stratton celebrate after and then Jax hugs some family members, including The Rock’s mom, at ringside.

Winner and NEW WWE Women’s Champion: Nia Jax

CM Punk vs. Drew McIntyre

A video package airs promoting WWE NXT moving from the USA Network to The CW starting on October 1. We then set the stage for our next match of the evening, which is the one the majority of fans tuning into tonight’s show are most looking forward to.

“The Best in the World” CM Punk has his first televised singles match in WWE in over a decade next, as he squares off against bitter-rival “The Scottish Warrior” Drew McIntyre, with Seth “Freakin'” Rollins serving as the special guest referee.

The pre-match video package airs to tell the story leading up to this one. When it wraps up, we return inside Cleveland Browns Stadium where we hear, “BURN IT DOWN!!” as “The Visionary” and “The Revolutionary” of WWE makes his way out.

Seth “Freakin'” Rollins comes to the ring in special referee attire that has to be seen to be believed. Very Seth Rollins-esque stuff, as you come to expect from the WWE veteran at this point in his legendary career. He settles in the ring to a big pop from the fans singing along with his music.

Thankfully, the wild zebra-colored gear Rollins wore to the ring was just his entrance attire. He takes it off and has a bedazzled sleeveless referee shirt and silly-ass shiny pants. The theme for Drew McIntyre hits and out comes “The Scottish Warrior.”

McIntyre and Rollins glare at each other for quite a bit and the camera closes in on this to soak up the moment. McIntyre is overheard telling Rollins all he has to do is ring the bell and count to three. The theme for CM Punk hits and out comes “The Best in the World” to a rock star reaction in the home of the Rock ‘N’ Roll Hall of Fame.

This one has “big fight feel” written all over it, and on a night with an insane boxing pay-per-view stacked mega-card, where Martin Bakole breaks through as a new Heavyweight star, Eminem puts on a concert and the pound-for-pound king of boxing takes a big challenge up in weight, as well as a stacked UFC card on ABC from Abu Dhabi, that’s saying a lot.

Punk and McIntyre are staring darts through each other. Punk takes his jacket off and throws it and it ends up around Rollins’ shoulders. Rollins semi-no-sells it, dramatically picking it up and throwing it out of the ring. He then ends up jawing with Punk. He jaws with McIntyre as well. Meanwhile, the crowd is chanting “CM Punk! CM Punk!” like crazy.

The bell sounds and Punk and McIntyre charge at each other, meeting in the middle and wildly trading strikes, ala the infamous Don Frye vs. Yoshihiro Akiyama fight from the old PRIDE FC days. The good old days. Punk gets McIntyre down and stomps away at him. McIntyre gets back up and does the same to Punk.

Punk takes McIntyre down and unloads on him with shots. McIntyre gets back up and shoves Punk and chops him. McIntyre goes to hit the ropes, but Punk follows him in and clotheslines him out to the floor. He runs off the ring apron and hits a flying clothesline on the floor.

Now we see CM Punk send McIntyre sailing over the ring barricade and into the timekeepers area. He follows him over and beats him up some more before launching him back over to the floor at ringside. He runs McIntyre face-first into the steel ring post, as we see Seth Rollins laying across the top-rope, Shawn Michaels heel style.

McIntyre takes back over control of the offense when the action spills out to the floor again. He hoists Punk up and swings him by his feet, slamming him face-first into the commentary desk over and over again. McIntyre continues to beat down Punk on the floor, as Rollins once again watches on without a car in the world, smiling and laughing at certain violent points in the action.

After some more back-and-forth action, we see McIntyre go to ringside and grabs a steel chair. Rollins looks at McIntyre, but he doesn’t take the chair away. McIntyre tells Rollins to let it happen. Rollins turns his back on this. McIntyre goes to hit Punk with the chair, but Rollins shows he has a conscience and takes the chair away. Rollins argues with McIntyre. McIntyre shoves him, so Rollins charges with the chair and nearly hits Punk before putting the brakes on.

Rollins throws the chair out of the ring. As he’s doing that, Punk has McIntyre rolled up. Rollins sees it too late, and McIntyre kicks out. Punk had him pinned for a while. McIntyre hits Punk with a swinging neckbreaker and kips up. McIntyre goes into his trunks and pulls out the bracelet with Punk’s wife and dog’s names on it. McIntyre puts it on and goes for a Claymore Kick, but Punk kicks him down. Punk then drops him with a swinging neckbreaker.

Punk gets to his feet and hits McIntyre with a running knee in the corner. Punk backs up and hits a second running knee to the face. Punk backs up and hits it a third time before hitting a clothesline. Punk heads to the top rope for a diving elbow drop. Punk covers for a near fall. Punk quickly transitions into an Anaconda Vice attempt. McIntyre fights it, but Punk eventually locks it in. As he applies the hold, Punk pulls his bracelet off McIntyre’s wrist.

Punk picks it up and turns into a Claymore Kick! McIntyre covers for a near fall. We see some more back-and-forth action and then Punk has Drew down and out and calls for the GTS. Rollins distracts Punk and Punk notices Rollins has his bracelet on. Punk decks McIntyre and approaches Rollins and doesn’t look happy. McIntyre attacks Punk from behind, sending him crashing into Rollins. With Rollins bumped and all of a sudden down and helpless from one shot like a wimpy referee and not a future WWE Hall of Famer, Punk recovers and hits the GTS on McIntyre.

He goes for the cover, but Rollins is still out and unable to make the count. When he finally does recover and begin to count, McIntyre kicks out. Punk yells at Rollins. Rollins reminds him about Rollins’ Rules. Punk yells that this isn’t about him. He hits Rollins with a GTS. McIntyre low-blows Punk and hit a Claymore. He wakes Rollins up and covers Punk. Rollins counts 1. Rollins counts 2. He looks hesitant, but ultimately counts three. McIntyre takes the bracelet back off Punk’s arm and puts it on his own. He stands on Punk’s chest with one foot and raises his hand in victory.

Winner: Drew McIntyre

WWE World Heavyweight Championship

Damian Priest (c) vs. GUNTHER

Backstage, we see Finn Balor catch up with Damian Priest. They talk about the Dominik Mysterio situation and how Priest wants to go this one alone, but that if he wants Balor, all he has to do is call for him. Priest thanks him, grabs his title belt and heads out to get ready.

The pre-match video package airs now to set the stage for our next match of the evening, which features the WWE World Heavyweight Championship on-the-line. When it wraps up, the theme for the 2024 WWE King of the Ring hits and out comes “The Ring General” GUNTHER. He settles in the ring.

Damian Priest’s entrance tune hits next and out comes what GUNTHER calls “Street Trash,” the reigning and defending WWE World Heavyweight Champion and as of right now, the leader of The Judgment Day. He heads to the ring alone as promised and settles inside for the pre-match ring introductions.

The bell sounds and off we go. GUNTHER and Damian Priest stare each other down. They trade chops early on and almost immediately GUNTHER’s chest is ripped open and bleeding. We see GUNTHER fight back and take over for what feels like forever. It seems like he’s got Priest dead to rights.

Finn Balor makes his way down to the ringside area. GUNTHER notices him and heads over and big boots him in the face through the ropes to knock him down. Priest recovers and saw what just happened and looks pissed and ready to defend his friend. He goes to work on GUNTHER as the crowd explodes.

Now we see Priest have GUNTHER finished off and in the weirdest situation ever, Priest purposely rolls GUNTHER closer to the ropes where Balor was at ringside to set up the finishing sequence. Balor throws GUNTHER’s leg on the ropes to screw Priest over.

Priest sees this on the replay and Balor does the slow turn evil facial expression for a close-up. Priest goes to rush at Balor to make him pay, but GUNTHER grabs Priest from behind and locks him in a sleeper hold. Priest fades. Balor gets close to the ring to see Priest go out, which brings Priest back to life.

He fights free and charges right back at Balor again. GUNTHER once more capitalizes and hits a big power bomb and another sleeper hold. GUNTHER wins. We have a brand new WWE World Heavyweight Champion, and his name is “The King General” GUNTHER.

Winner and NEW WWE World Heavyweight Champion: GUNTHER

Jelly Roll Helps Awesome Truth Take Out A-Town Down Under

Michael Cole and the commentary crew run through highlights of tonight’s matches and key moments thus far, focusing a lot of Dominik Mysterio screwing over Rhea Ripley and locking lips with Liv Morgan afterwards, and the continuation of the crumbling of The Judgment Day as we know it, with Finn Balor turning on Priest.

Back live, WWE SummerSlam 2024 host The Miz and his pal R-Truth are shown in the ring for a special attendance announcement. The Miz reveals that tonight’s show has broken the all-time American attendance record with 57,791 fans inside Cleveland Browns Stadium tonight.

As they go to wrap up, they are cut off by former tag-team champions A-Town Down Under. Austin Theory and Grayson Waller join them in the ring to taunt them and the city of Cleveland, as well as the artist who performed the theme songs for tonight’s show, Jelly Roll, who is shown in the crowd reacting.

R-Truth is confused and thinks he is talking to Ricky Martin and Robert Gibson, the Rock ‘N’ Roll Express. Obviously there is so much wrong with that. Anyways, Jelly Roll appears behind A-Town Down Under in the ring with a chair and helps Awesome Truth take them out and leave them laying.

Jelly Roll and Awesome Truth do John Cena’s “You Can’t See Me” five knuckle shuffle routine for an explosive pop.

WWE Universal Championship (Bloodline Rules)

Cody Rhodes (c) vs. Solo Sikoa

It’s main event time!

“The Biggest Party of the Summer” hits the final stretch, as we set the stage and prepare for our main event of the evening, as “The American Nightmare” Cody Rhodes defends his WWE Universal Championship against “The Tribal Chief” of The Bloodline 2.0, Solo Sikoa, in a Bloodline Rules match.

WWE Raw on SyFy is promoted for tomorrow night in Baltimore, MD., with the focus being on the in-ring debut of The Wyatt Sicks against Chad Gable and The Creed Brothers, as well as the fallout from tonight’s WWE SummerSlam. A commercial for WWE Bash In Berlin airs next for the show on August 31 in Germany.

Up next, the in-depth pre-match video package airs to tell the story leading up to tonight’s main event of the evening, the Bloodline Rules bout between Rhodes and Sikoa for the Universal title. When it wraps up, we return inside the show venue in Cleveland.

Solo Sikoa makes his way out first, by himself oddly enough, with “The Tribal Chief” boa around his neck. He looks ready for action and all business as he heads to the ring to a ton of boos from the record-setting Cleveland crowd. The leader of The Bloodline 2.0 settles inside the squared circle for what could be an interesting match, depending on who may or may not show up at the end.

All the way from his “American Nightmare” tour bus, where he walks his dog on a leash into the building with him, is the reigning and defending WWE Universal Champion Cody Rhodes. He gets the Goodfellas single-camera kitchen scene shot of the evening. The long single camera shot follows him all throughout the backstage area, where he shakes hands with and hugs Arn Anderson, who gives him a classic Arn pep talk.

He settles inside and the final ring introductions are given before the bell sounds to get this one started. Things start off competitive, with Cody getting to shine coming out of the gate. It isn’t long, however, before Solo takes over and much like GUNTHER vs. Damian Priest, we see the champion on the defensive and fighting from underneath throughout the majority of the contest.

As soon as Cody finally starts to shift the offensive momentum into his favor several minutes into the bout, we see the Bloodline Rules play a factor, as Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa hit the ring and blatantly attack Cody in front of the referee with double-team action. Solo goes for the immediate follow-up cover, but Cody kicks out.

They go to continue the numbers game beat down until out of nowhere, Kevin Owens’ theme hits and “The Prize Fighter” runs down to the ring to a huge crowd reaction from the Cleveland fans. Owens ends up getting gobbled up as well, which leads us to our second in-match surprise, the theme for Randy Orton hits and “The Viper” heads to the ring.

This is almost identical to the last Bloodline Rules Universal title match on a big four PLE. That’s not necessarily a good thing, either. Cody goes for the follow-up cover after Solo is laid out, but he gets a shoulder up. Orton and Owens brawl with Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa through the crowd out of the picture. Cody grabs the top half of the ring steps and brings them into the ring.

When he goes to use them, however, Solo charges at him and spears him for a close two-count. Solo sets the steps in the corner with the steps part facing out. He sits Cody up against them and charges across the ring for a hip attack, but Cody moves and Solo violently crashes into the steps. Cody hits a Cross-Rhodes. And another. He goes for the third, but Jacob Fatu hits the ring out of nowhere and lays Cody out.

Fatu decks Cody and then hits a big top-rope moonsault. He takes him out to the floor and clears off the commentary desk. He super kicks Cody onto the top of the table and heads back to the top-rope again. He leaps off with a big splash that puts Cody through the table. Solo goes to pick the bones, bringing Cody into the ring and hitting a top-rope splash of his own for a close two-count. Cody is the modern day Super Cena, folks.

Solo stands over Cody and signals for the Samoan Spike. Cody springs to life out of nowhere and super kicks him, leaps to the top rope in a single bounce (see, Super Cody like Super Cena, or Superman, whatever). The theme for Roman Reigns hits out of nowhere and the crowd goes absolutely insane inside the jam-packed record sold out crowd inside Cleveland Browns Stadium. The real “Tribal Chief” emerges and the crowd roar grows.

Michael Cole pulls a Bobby Heenan and questions who Roman Reigns is coming down to attack. Corey Graves plays the Dusty Rhodes role, pretending it’s a dumb question and saying of course he’s coming for revenge on Cody, the guy who beat him and took his title the last time we saw him. Of course, Reigns, the Hulk Hogan in this scenario, hits the ring.

He attacks the other guy, Solo Sikoa, to the “shock” of ..well, Michael Cole. And to an equal extent, Cody himself. Cody, still shocked at what he just saw, finishes Solo off for the win to retain. Reigns keeps looking back at the ring as he walks off, and Cody keeps looking back out at Roman as well. Your winner and still WWE Universal Champion, “The American Nightmare” Cody Rhodes. That’s how WWE SummerSlam 2024 goes off the air. Thanks for joining us!

Winner and STILL WWE Universal Champion: Cody Rhodes

WWE SummerSlam 2024 Results: Liv Morgan Defeats Rhea Ripley.,https://411mania.com/wrestling/stews-wwe-summerslam-2024-review/,"It’s time for SummerSlam 2024, just a few hours away from my backyard. But here’s the thing: we don’t go to Cleveland because it’s Cleveland.

Boom! Weird Pittsburgh loyalty in the dissing of Cleveland. I’m just kidding, Cleveland. You have a great amusement park.

There are at least two different signs in the SummerSlam pre-show crowd that say “Drew McIntyre Eats Corn The Long Way”, and is that a meme I am unaware of? Did I miss a promo where this became a thing? Someone explain this to me. I feel incredibly lost on this homoerotic diss of Drew.

While we are at it, there is also a pre-show trailer for Alien: Romulus. How are we feeling about this movie, folks? Excited? Kind of tired of Alien movies? What’s the general sentiment on this? I’m going to see it, that’s for sure; but I have the AMC A-List, and I see basically everything. But I’m also not SUPER pumped for Romulus. I have not liked an Alien franchise movie all that much since Aliens, and there have been a lot of bad ones since then. Could this be the turning point? Here’s hoping!

While I wait for your words on that, let’s get into the show notes!

6:37pm: It sounds like we are starting off SummerSlam with Liv Morgan vs Rhea Ripley. Here’s my prediction / fantasy booking for this one to get it on the record: I think Dominik Mysterio ACCIDENTALLY costs Rhea Ripley the match tonight. But not intentionally. He either gets Rhea disqualified or does whatever needs to happen to get Liv to leave the match the match with the title.

This leads to a few weeks before the next PLE with Liv deciding Dom DOES love her, so she goes back to trying to woo him. This drives a further wedge between Rhea and Dom, who spend the next month bickering, with Dom trying to prove his loyalty to Rhea and her not really buying it.

Then at the NEXT PLE event, they do a Dom In A Shark Cage match or what-the-heck-ever between Liv and Rhea. And at that match, Dom INTENTIONALLY helps Liv retain over Rhea, fully solidifying his move to Liv’s side of things.

The biggest problem here is it kind of foregoes the Finn Balor stuff they have been sprinkling in, but I’m not sure what all you do with that besides, what, have Dom go babyface to stay with Rhea and do Dom/Rhea vs Finn/Liv? And Dom as a face just seems… weird!

6:51pm: The second best story going into SummerSlam is that between CM Punk, Drew McIntyre, and Seth Rollins, and they are doing a CM Punk interview with Michael Cole, followed by a short promo by Drew McIntyre. I love the addition of Seth Rollins to this outing because it adds a lot of intrigue. Without Seth, this would be a great match with an easily predictable winner (Drew). With Seth, I am incredibly whetted for this one, because I direly want to know what he is going to do to impact this match and the next several WWE PLEs that will likely feature some combination of these three men. This affair, as strange as it might be to say after the last few months, is just getting started between these three.

6:58pm: So the Cody Rhodes vs Solo Sikoa match is Bloodline rules AND main eventing, which means… Roman is returning, right? You simply can’t have this bout main event over Drew/Punk unless The True Head Of The Table is returning. MORE INTRIGUE. This should be a great card!

7:02pm: Triple-H opens the show and soaks in the cheers. He asks if Cleveland is ready. Then he… introduces Jelly Roll, who just sang “God Bless America”. Jelly starts singing another song. HURRY UP, GUY. I want to see what happens between Liv and Rhea! I have no patience for this!

7:07pm: Okay, Jelly is done singing, and we move on to The Miz live in the crowd. THIS SHOW IS STALLING. But he tells us it starts right NOW, and we cut to Rhea Ripley’s entrance. She comes to the ring with Dom in tow. Rhea singing along to her music during her ring entrance remains one of the more endearing things about her.

7:10pm: REF CAM! Why is this a thing we need? Maybe so we can see what the referees see when wrestlers forget to kick out or they count a pin while someone’s shoulder is a foot off the mat.

7:19pm: After Rhea dominated the first several minutes of the contest, Liv FINALLY gets on the offensive by ramming the injured shoulder into the ring post. Now we have a match! Rhea cries out that “it’s out!”, but refuses to let the referee stop the match.

7:21pm: Hmmmm. Dueling “Let’s Go Rhea” / “Let’s Go Liv” chant. Didn’t expect to hear so much support for Liv!

7:23pm: Rhea blasts her shoulder back into place using the announce table, then she is back on the attack!

7:30pm: Liv wins with interference from Dom just moments after it looked like I was going to be right about her winning due to accidental help from him. But they end up doing the full turn right here tonight, instead. Dom places a chair for Liv, allows her to hit ObLivion onto it, then kisses Liv and leaves with her.

To me? This is less interesting than what I predicted because I thought there was plenty of mileage left on the “will they or won’t they?” story, but this is fine, too. It keeps Dom as a heel. And we can move straight into what is going to happen within Judgment Day and where Finn fits in in all of this…

7:39pm: After a commercial break, we see Judgment Day being not best pleased with Dom’s actions, but also not knowing where he is. Priest thinks that Finn knew about all of this, but Finn vows that he did not. Finn, JD, and Carlito head out to find Dominik.

7:40pm: Time for Bron Breakker vs Sami Zayn. This could get messy for Sami, but also clear him up for a Bloodline feud!

I noted on the Prediction Show I guest starred on that Bron losing to Sami clean was actually a pretty good call last month because it stops Bron from being one of those “winning streak” guys that maybe has nowhere left to go after suffering his first loss well until his career. He got a main roster L out of the way, and now that won’t be the book on him.

7:49pm: After a quick, back-and-forth sprint, Bron Breakker wins after two Spears. I did predict this would be the shortest match on the card. But it was about as good as an 8 minute match gets. Both of these guys are talented entertainers.

7:52pm: There is a movie coming to Amazon Prime starring John Cena AND Awkwafina?! I’m in! Gotta remember to look for this when it comes out; it’s called Jackpot!.

I love Awakwafina. I will hear no slander against her.

7:56pm: Up next it the United States Title match between LA Knight (yes) and noted wannabe-expert on women’s boxing and genetics, Logan Paul.

8:00pm: Dr. Logan Paul, OB-GYN, hits the ring with buddy Machine Gun Kelly. Paul is wearing Cleveland Browns colors despite being the heel (I know he is from here, but still, most heels disavow their hometown).

8:06pm: During the pre-match brawl before the bell rings, LA Knight (yep) hits aTorture Rack hold into a neck breaker on the announce table! Wow! The table does not break, though.

8:08pm: Feminist Icon Logan Paul drives the shoulder of LA Knight (sure) into the ring post, making this the third straight match where someone was driven shoulder-first into that part of the ring. I didn’t put any money on that being the spot of the evening, but… here we are.

8:16pm: It’s supposed to be a Superplex, but LA Knight (oui) hits a top-rope Brainbuster!

8:19pm: LA Knight (uh-huh) gets the pinfall victory over IOC Judge Logan Paul, even though the latter’s foot was about a mile under the ropes, haha. But that’s not our story, so of course we ignore the hell out of it. Knight wins with the worst finishing move in WWE, the BFT, and I can’t fathom how he hasn’t started using another move in place of that.

8:24pm: An advertising segment sees Otis use a manscaper tool to shave his belly. He’s getting massive pops in the ring on Raw as fans desperately want to see him get his hands on Gable, but tonight… this is what he is reduced to.

8:29pm: It’s time for Nia Jax vs Bayley for the Women’s Title. I wonder who will get shot into the ring post first! On the aforementioned prediction show I was on, this is one of the two matches the host, Ian, and I disagreed on. I’m PROBABLY wrong, but I have Bayley winning. This title reign has been absolutely horrible, and it seems like it has not even started yet. It feels too soon to take the belt off of her. It also seems to make more sense to have heel Tiffy Stratton chase a babyface than her buddy.

8:38pm: When did EVERY SINGLE MATCH start getting a different personal sponsor? Every match tonight has had a different advertising theme, and this one is brought to us by something called Valorant. I am… not familiar with that, but it appears to be some sort of video game.

8:42pm: Bayley kicks out of the Annihilator! Wow! Nia goes right back on the attack and keeps kicking her ass for a bit.

8:43pm: NIA JAX GOES SHOULDER FIRST INTO THE RINGPOST.

That makes us four out of four on the evening. This is wild!

8:45pm: Bayley pulls Nia off the ropes, CARRIES HER ACROSS THE RING, and power bombs her! Wow! Hell of a spot.

As I type that, Tiffany Stratton’s music hits, and she charges the ring with a ref coming along with her. Bayley breaks up her cash-in, though. For all the good it does her, as Jax hits multiple power bombs and then multiple Annihilators to get the three-count. This was just a hair away from being an extended squash. Nia controlled a solid 80-90% of the match. What a waste of a title reign this was for poor Bayley. I kind of hate how little they gave her to work with after beating Iyo.

8:55pm: All right, here we go with Drew vs Punk. Seth “Reffin'” Rollins gets brought out first. Seth has Ref Cam, too!

9:00pm: This is just Drew McIntyre’s FOURTH SummerSlam match ever? I never would have guessed. He is currently 2-1, the on-screen graphic informs us.

9:04pm: “CM Punk Orders Boneless Wings” sign. WHAT AM I MISSING ABOUT THESE FOOD-BASED DISS SIGNS?!

9:14pm: Rollins is having a lot of fun and adding some solid glee to the affair. He’s chilling out on the ropes, refusing to count count outs. He almost lets Drew use a chair, but decides against it. They tease the HBK 1997 spot with Rollins almost clobbering Punk with the chair by accident.

9:20pm: Oh, I forgot, this match’s sponsor is C4 Energy Drinks. Seriously… have they been doing this for months, and I just haven’t noticed?

9:21pm: DREW MCINTYRE INTO THE RINGPOST.

Five

Out of

Five.

9:22pm: Punk is about to hit GTS on Drew when he realizes Rollins has put on the Larry & AJ friendship bracelet, haha! Punk and Seth have a face-off, with Drew knocking them into each other. This causes Seth to be late on Punk’s cover after a GTS. Punk GTS’es Rollins, allowing Drew to kick Punk low then hit the Claymore. Seth recovers enough to count the 3, and Drew gets his measure of revenge. He also recovers the friendship bracelet.

9:26pm: I adore how much of this match was about a chintzy little bracelet. Drew started with it. Punk took it off of him. Rollins put it on. Punk took it off of him and put it on. Then after the match, Drew gets it back. BraceletMania running wild!

9:29pm: Finn reports in to Priest that he can’t find Dom. Priest apologizes for blaming Balor. Damien Priest vs GUNTHER is next!

9:33pm: GUNTHER vs Priest is the second and only other match we disagreed on on the prediction show. So either Priest wins and I tie Ian on the night, or GUNTHER wins and I lose by two results, ugh.

9:47pm: After a chop/strike duel, GUNTHER ends up with a split open chest. Looks pretty bad-ass with blood running down his chest. Priest has been dominating the match to this point. Priest goes headfirst into the top off the ringpost to turn the tide, and I won’t count that one! The others were all specifically shoulder-to-the-post spots.

Don’t worry. I’m sure it’s coming.

9:49pm: GUNTHER kicks out of the South Of Heaven! The match continues.

9:52pm: Finn Balor emerges to clap support for Damien, despite the fact that Priest does not want him here. Priest seems okay with his presence, though.

9:53pm: GUNTHER wipes the blood from his chest onto his face, haha. He kicks Balor in the head, incurring the wrath of Damien, who LOWERS THE STRAPS.

9:55pm: After a Razor’s Edge and South Of Heaven, Balor puts GUNTHER’s foot on the rope. Damien sees it on the replay, and Finn makes an exaggerated evil guy face!

9:57pm: GUNTHER wins with a Sleeperhold, and I really need to go back into prognostication retirement apparently!

It appears as though Judgment Day is fully going to be a thing of the past after tonight. We’re going to get the long-awaited Priest/Balor feud now, and I have no idea where GUNTHER goes right away. Feels like the top of the Raw card is pretty well spoken for.

10:04pm: The attendance of the evening is 57,791 according to The Miz and R-Truth. They get cut off by A-Town Down Under. The segment goes on to see Jelly Roll hit Theory and Waller with a chair and then a choke slam.

10:14pm: This brings us to Solo Sikoa vs Cody Rhodes in the Bloodline Rules match. So the Bloodline, in its various forms, is about to go 0-2 in Bloodline Rules matches. Huh.

Will we see Jey Uso get involved in this match? Maybe Sami Zayn? Jimmy Uso? Roman Reigns? As I noted earlier, to not have Roman come back would feel like a letdown here since this is the main event. But we will see!

10:19pm: Arn Anderson is backstage, presumably to tell Cody to shoot the Bloodline with a gun. But aside from that, he tells Cody that he has some friends on the way if Cody needs them. Maybe THEY have the guns.

10:32pm: The early going of this match is pretty slowly paced, with a lot of the story being that Solo has a lot of Cody’s spot’s scouted and countered.

10:41pm: The problem with this match being Bloodline Rules is that it’s fine, but I feel like I’m just waiting for the interference spots.

10:42pm: Oh, here it is, with the G.O.D. showing up after the first Cross Rhodes to Solo. They hit their finisher, but Cody kicks out! This brings out Kevin Owens. After the Bloodline gets the numbers game over on KO, Randy Orton comes out! RKO to Tonga Loa. Stunner to Tara Tonga. Everyone attacks Solo, then Cody hits another Cross Rhodes, but Solo kicks out!

10:48pm: Here comes Jacob Fatu! He attacks Cody mid-Cross Rhodes. Cody kicks out of the attack! Fato splashes Cody through the announce table! Cody kicks out of a top rope splash from Solo!

10:52pm: ROMAN REIGNS’ MUSIC HITS! He is here! Superman Punch and Spear to Solo Sikoa! Then he stares at Cody Rhodes and walks off. Cody hits Cross Rhodes and pins Solo while staring down Roman.

And that is it! That’s SummerSlam 2024 in the books. The Judgment Day is no more. Roman Reigns is back. Two new midcard champions in Bron Breakker and LA Knight (si), and a new women’s champ in Nia Jax.

What did YOU think of the show?"

WWE/Getty Images

Forecasting the direction The Bloodline and undisputed WWE champion Cody Rhodes are headed post-SummerSlam is far from simple.

We know Roman Reigns will be involved, based on his return Saturday in Cleveland, but we do not know when or where, with Survivor Series making the most sense.

As of now, The Head of the Table is not featured on any marketing materials for Bash in Berlin and there is no reason to think he is going to make that trip for a show that is going to be primarily focused on world heavyweight champion Gunther.

So where does that leave The Bloodline and Rhodes?

Why not book the two in the same match with the emphasis not only on their ongoing feud but, also, with the potential to plant the seeds for the expected program between The American Nightmare and The Viper?

Location: Cleveland Browns Stadium, Cleveland, Ohio

Commentators: Michael Cole, Corey Graves, Pat McAfee

It’s another stadium show for one of the biggest events of the WWE year. That should make for a big deal and now we get to see what WWE can do with this stacked of a card. There are seven matches scheduled with six titles on the line, plus a heck of a grudge match. That should be more than enough to carry things so let’s get to it.

Raw Women’s Title: Rhea Ripley vs. Liv Morgan

Ripley, with Dominik Mysterio, is challenging. Morgan hurt Ripley and tried to take Mysterio from her, only to have Mysterio turn her down. The bell rings and Morgan bails outside, then does it again for a bonus. An attempt at a third roll outside is cut off by a head fake and Ripley grabs her for some clotheslines. They go outside for a ram into the steps, allowing Ripley to like Mysterio’s face.

Ripley sends her into the steps a few more times and then Riptides her onto the top turnbuckle. Morgan slips out of Riptide again and sends Ripley’s recently repaired arm into the buckle. Ripley goes down fast and screams “IT’S OUT” but insists that the match keep going. It’s time to go back to the floor where Ripley’s bad shoulder goes into the steps this time, followed by some stomping back inside.

Back in and Morgan cranks on the arm (as you do) before hitting a springboard Codebreaker on said arm. Ripley gets smart by kicking her in the head and going outside, where Dominik shoves her out of the way of Morgan’s dive. Back up and Ripley rams her arm into the announcers’ table to pop it back in, meaning the beating can ensue. Another Riptide attempt is countered into a DDT and they’re both down.

Ripley gets back up and tries the Prism Trap but Morgan slips out and grabs a crucifix bomb for two. A cross armbreaker has the arm in more trouble but Ripley powers out with a spinebuster for two of her own. One heck of a headbutt rocks Ripley, allowing Morgan to snap the arm over the middle rope.

Morgan goes for a chair but walks into a Riptide for her efforts. Ripley picks it up instead, with Dominik cutting her off to save the match. Morgan sends them together and a quick Oblivion connects for two. Then Dominik slides the chair in ala how he “accidentally” helped Morgan win the title, setting up another Oblivion onto the chair for Morgan to retain. This time though, Dominik is smiling.

Result: Liv Morgan b. Rhea Ripley – Oblivion onto a chair (15:53)

Post match Ripley wakes up and Dominik kisses a surprised Morgan, much to Ripley’s dismay.

After some advertisements, Damian Priest storms into Judgment Day’s locker room and wants to hurt Dominik Mysterio. He asks if Finn Balor knew what was coming and seems to accuse Balor of being behind it but Balor denies knowing anything. The rest of the team and Carlito go off to find Dominik, with Priest threatening violence.

We recap Bron Breakker vs. Sami Zayn for the latter’s Intercontinental Title. Zayn survived against Breakker last month but now Breakker is more focused and ready.

Intercontinental Title: Bron Breakker vs. Sami Zayn

Zayn is defending and avoids a charge at the bell, sending Breakker shoulder first into the post. Breakker rolls outside but gets sent back inside, where he has to avoid an early Helluva Kick attempt. Breakker catches him with a running clothesline, which works a bit better. Some right hands in the corner set up a super Frankensteiner for two as Zayn is in early trouble.

Zayn springboards over him and hits a clothesline but can’t hit the Blue Thunder Bomb. Instead Breakker goes up for the Steiner Bulldog, which is reversed into the Blue Thunder Bomb for two. The exploder into the corner connects but Breakker cuts him off with the spear. Another spear gives Breakker the pin and the title at 5:44.

Result: Bron Breakker b. Sami Zayn – Spear (5:44)

Stephanie McMahon is here.

We recap Logan Paul defending the US Title against LA Knight. Paul has frustrated Knight, who keeps coming back and wanting a US Title shot. Knight pinned him in a Money In The Bank qualifying match and that was enough to get the shot here.

US Title: LA Knight vs. Logan Paul

Paul, the hometown boy, is defending, but we cut to the back where Knight smashes the window of the Prime truck that he stole from Paul on Smackdown. It’s a brawl on the floor before the bell with Paul being sent into the barricade. Knight sends him into the hydration station but Paul fights back and clears the announcers’ table. That’s fine with Knight, who hits a torture rack neckbreaker onto the table and NOW we go in for the opening bell.

Knight fires the shoulders into the ribs to start as Graves makes a Major League joke in a nice touch. The jumping elbow hits raised knees and Paul sends him shoulder first into the post. Paul posts him again and hammers away at the head, followed by a big boot and legdrop for two (with the Hogan pose). Knight fights up from his knees but walks into a gutwrench suplex for two more. A powerbomb faceplant gives Paul two but he spends too much time on mockery and walks into a powerslam for two.

Knight slugs away again and stomps away in the corner, setting up a running knee to rock Paul again. A Side Effect of all things sets up a middle rope elbow, only to have Knight jump to the top in an impressive display, for two more. Back up and Paul sends him to the apron for a springboard clothesline to send Knight outside, setting up a springboard spinning moonsault (awesome).

Back in and Paul’s big right hand gets two so it’s time for Paul’s cronies to give him the brass knuckles. That’s broken up and Knight hammers away, but Paul gets the knuckles anyway. They head back inside, where Knight grabs BFT for the pin and the title (his first in WWE) at 12:04.

Result: LA Knight b. Logan Paul – BFT (12:04)

Various wrestlers shill Manscaped products.

We recap Nia Jax challenging Bayley for the Smackdown Women’s Title. Jax is on a roll and won Queen Of The Ring but Bayley isn’t laying down for anyone.

Smackdown Women’s Title: Bayley vs. Nia Jax

Jax is challenging and Bayley slugs away to start fast before tying the arm up in the ropes. Bayley has to escape a powerbomb but Jax runs her over without much trouble. An elbow drop keeps Bayley in trouble but she fights up and hits a belly to back suplex. Back up and Bayley manages to knock her outside, only to get crotched back inside. Bayley manages a guillotine choke (how she beat Jax in NXT) but gets shoved off with straight power.

Jax’s middle rope legdrop misses and a quick Bayley To Belly gets two. Bayley charges into a release Rock Bottom out of the corner and the Annihilator connects for two, leaving Jax stunned. Back up and Bayley sends her shoulder first into the post so Jax needs a breather on the floor.

Bayley’s suicide dive is countered into a Samoan drop on the floor, followed by the running hip attack in the corner. Another Annihilator is broken up though and Bayley manages a heck of a middle rope powerbomb. Bayley’s top rope elbow gets two….and it’s Tiffy Time. Bayley cuts her off but Jax powerbombs Bayley down, setting up a pair of Annihilators to win the title at 12:32.

Result: Nia Jax b. Bayley – Annihilator (12:32)

Post match Tiffany and Jax celebrate with no cash-in attempt.

We recap Drew McIntyre vs. CM Punk. McIntyre injured Punk during the Royal Rumble and then bragged about it. Therefore, Punk has promised, and managed, to ruin McIntyre’s life. McIntyre is obsessed with Punk and stole a personal bracelet of his, meaning it’s time for revenge, with Seth Rollins, who doesn’t like either of them, as the guest referee.

CM Punk vs. Drew McIntyre

Seth Rollins is guest referee and calls for the opening bell after quite the delay. Punk hammers away to start but Rollins pulls him away in the corner. That lets McIntyre get in some stomps of his own, but Rollins breaks that up too. McIntyre strikes away until a clothesline puts him on the floor. Rollins chills on the top rope as Punk posts McIntyre before stopping to tie his shoes as Punk sends McIntyre into the steps. McIntyre fights up and swings Punk into the steps while Rollins conducts the singing crowd.

A catapult sends Punk chest first into the ring structure and it’s time to throw what’s left of Punk back inside. McIntyre powerbombs him for two, with Rollins’ count not sitting well with him. The chair is brought in, with McIntyre saying this makes their problem go away. Rollins takes the chair away and loads up a swing but has to stop himself from hitting Punk by mistake. The chair is thrown out but Rollins misses the rollup on McIntyre. Back up and McIntyre drops him again before pulling out the bracelet.

Punk fires off the running knees in the corner and the top rope elbow gets two. The Anaconda Vice is brought out of mothballs, only for McIntyre to fight out and hit the Claymore for two. The Futureshock is escaped and McIntyre misses a charge into the post. Punk yells at Rollins for picking up the bracelet but McIntyre rams them into each other, sending Rollins outside. The GTS gets a VERY delayed two, with Punk yelling at Rollins and his “stupid Sabu pants”. That means a GTS to Rollins, leaving McIntyre to hit Punk low. Another Claymore finishes for McIntyre at 16:59.

Result: Drew McIntyre b. CM Punk – Claymore (16:59)

Finn Balor comes in to see Damian Priest, saying Dominik Mysterio and Liv Morgan are gone. Priest apologizes for accusing him earlier, with Balor accepting and apologizing for his response. Go take care of Gunther.

We recap Damian Priest defending the Raw World Title against Gunther. Priest cashed in Money In The Bank to win the title at Wrestlemania and has been trying to prove himself as champion since. Gunther on the other hand is the King Of The Ring while coming off the record shattering Intercontinental Title reign. He also doesn’t think much of Priest, referring to him as street trash. It’s a cultural battle along with a title fight.

Raw World Title: Gunther vs. Damian Priest

Priest is defending and there are no seconds. They slug it out to start with Priest knocking him into the corner and grabbing a lifting Downward Spiral to send Gunther outside. Gunther blocks a powerbomb attempt and rams him into the apron, only for Priest to hit an ear clap back inside. Priest’s superplex is broken up with some shots to the ribs but he settles for a super hurricanrana into the Broken Arrow for two.

Priest chops him so hard that Gunther’s chest is bleeding but he’s back with a powerbomb. Gunther sees the blood and chops even harder, only for Priest to kick him in the head and hit the South Of Heaven for two. Back up and Gunther kicks him in the face so Priest tells him to bring it on (oh that’s dumb) so it’s a chop to put him own. Cue Finn Balor to cheer Priest on and Gunther kicks Priest down again.

A running kick to the ribs has Priest in trouble and Gunther kicks Balor in the face too. Priest fights up and hits some clotheslines, setting up the Razor’s Edge. South Of Heaven connects…but Balor puts Gunther’s foot on the ropes. Priest didn’t seem to see what happened but sees the replay on the screen and turns to glare at Balor. The distraction lets Gunther get the sleeper, with Priest flipping backwards for two and the escape. Priest lunges for Balor and Gunther grabs a powerbomb. Another sleeper gives Gunther the title at 16:39.

Result: Gunther b. Damian Priest – Sleeper (16:39)

Here are the Miz and R-Truth to announce the attendance of 57,791. Jelly Roll’s theme song, with the line “YOU AIN’T NOTHING BUT A LIAR” playing just after that number is announced amuses me for some reason. Cue A-Town Down Under to mock Jelly Roll, saying only Cleveland could have this many people who look like Roll (who weighs a good bit over three hundred pounds). Truth thinks he’s talking to the Rock N Roll Express (because of the Rock N Roll Hall Of Fame) but here is Roll in disguise to chair them down. A Five Knuckle Shuffle ensues and Miz and Truth have to help Roll up.

We recap Cody Rhodes vs. Solo Sikoa for the Smackdown World Title. Rhodes thought he defeated the Bloodline at Wrestlemania when he took out Roman Reigns but Sikoa has reformed the team with a much more dangerous lineup. Now it’s a Bloodline Rules match but all of Cody’s friends have been taken out by the Bloodline, meaning he’s all alone.

Smackdown World Title: Cody Rhodes vs. Solo Sikoa

Cody is defending under Bloodline Rules (anything goes). We go to the back where Rhodes gets off his bus, takes his dog Pharaoh, and walks into the arena, where he runs into Arn Anderson of all people. Anderson talks about how proud Dusty Rhodes would be but Cody has four ticked off island boys coming for him. Cody’s friends are on the way though.

Feeling out process to start with Sikoa using the power to take over early on. Sikoa blocks the drop down right hand and Cody isn’t sure what to think. They chop it out until Cody low bridges him to the apron, with a Disaster Kick sending Sikoa out to the floor. Back in and Cody’s snap powerslam doesn’t work so Sikoa hits a spinwheel kick. The Samoan drop gets two but Cody is back up with a Cody Cutter for a breather.

Back up and Sikoa grabs a sitout powerbomb for two, followed by a running Umaga Attack for the same. Spinning Solo sets up the nerve hold and another Samoan drop cuts off the comeback bid. Cody is tied in the Tree of Woe for the running headbutt but another one only hits mat. A top rope moonsault to a standing Sikoa gives Cody a breather but Sikoa plants him back down for two more.

Sikoa goes up, only to get superplexed right back down. Cody slugs away but has to counter Sikoa’s Cross Rhodes attempt into one of his own. Cue Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa so the beatdown can be on, including the double spinning neckbreaker to give Sikoa two. Cue the returning Kevin Owens for the save but the Bloodline fights back, meaning it’s Randy Orton running in (and high fiving fans on the way) for the save of his own.

Cody uses the help to hit Cross Rhodes on Solo, leaving the other four to fight off into the crowd. It’s time to bring in the steps, with Cody getting in some hard shots to the head. Sikoa cuts him off with a spear though and puts Cody up against the steps in the corner. The running Umaga Attack misses though and Cody hits a pair of Cross Rhodes. Cue Jacob Fatu to wreck Cody though, with Sikoa getting two.

Fatu takes him outside for a top rope splash through the announcers’ table….and Fatu can’t stand on his leg. And it doesn’t matter as ROMAN REIGNS is back to a thunderous reaction. The Superman Punch and spear cut Sikoa down and, with a look at Reigns, Cody hits Cross Rhodes to retain at 29:14.

Result: Cody Rhodes b. Solo Sikoa – Cross Rhodes (29:14)

It was a night of betrayal, shocks and surprises as WWE SummerSlam unfolded in front of 57,000 fans in Cleveland on Saturday (3 August).

All eyes were on CM Punk as he wrestled his first televised singles match in over a decade, going toe-to-toe with British star Drew McIntyre to conclude one of the hottest feuds of the year.

But it was “Dirty” Dominik Mysterio who set the tone for the evening long before those two stepped into the ring, turning on Rhea Ripley and The Judgement Day after the Women’s World Championship match opened the show.

The Judgement Day imploded further as the penultimate match of the night concluded, with Finn Balor betraying Damian Priest.

However, the biggest shock of the night came in the main event, which saw Cody Rhodes face Solo Sikoa for the Undisputed Universal Championship - amid rumours of a Roman Reigns return.

After a gruelling battle, “The American Nightmare” secured the three count to defend his title, as the “Tribal Chief” made his first appearance since WrestleMania, returning to attack his own Bloodline.

There were four title changes on a night of packed action, which also saw Logan Paul, Gunther, Liv Morgan and Rhea Ripley in action.

Check out the full results from SummerSlam below:

Liv Morgan (c) defeated Rhea Ripley (with “Dirty” Dominik Mysterio) by pinfall to defend the Women’s World Championship

From start to finish this match has a very electric crowd. At times even giving 50/50 split moments of chants for Liv and Mami. The dynamic between Liv and Rhea is well thought out as Liv attempts to avoid contact. Rhea has to fake Liv out to get Liv stuck in the ring. While Rhea dominates Liv in her parts of the match, Liv gets control and continues to further damage Rhea’s shoulder. Even having moments of her shoulder potentially be out of place and Rhea having to put it back in. While Rhea does wonders to make every part of it look real, it tells a story. Liv is able to dominate when Rhea is clearly injured in the moment.

Dominik tries to aid Rhea by stopping Rhea’s emotions to get the better of her with the chair. After Liv hit an Oblivion and Rhea kicked out, Dominik slides the chair into the ring. The ref is distracted as Liv gets a second Oblivion, this time spiking Rhea on the chair. Liv defeats Rhea before Dominik helped her up and kissed her passionately. Rhea, a broken mess in the ring, visibly heartbroken and crying. Liv and Dom leaving to the back.

While this goes shorter than it legitimately felt, its a full on sprint. From Breakker having to sell his shoulder worked. Sami Zayn was able to avoid the storm of Bron. Breakker got his tremendous frankensteiner. Sami countered a bulldog into a blue thunder bomb. Its a near 6 minute sprint that felt much longer. Breakker has to sell his shoulder from start to finish and ultimately it takes two spears to put away Sami Zayn. One rough spot with a landing but the system explains itself.

Results: Bron Breakker by Pinfall via Spear

MUST WATCH Logan Paul Vs LA Knight – United States Championship:

Welcome to heat, because Logan Paul is the hometown villain. The only people cheering Logan were his posse. This match has a pre match brawl before the bell rang. Seeing the torture rack neckbreaker on the announce table looked stiff in every way and added to it. These too dislike each other. From several BFT counters to LA Knight hitting a middle to top rope springboard elbow. Knight also got the jumping superplex but it was a tremendous brainbuster.

This is a match that has hatred written all over it. Logan attempts to cheat as Machine Gun Kelly hands him a brass knuckle necklace. Paul connects with a punch but the buckshot lariat is countered right into the BFT.

While the finish was tremendous and a perfect ending, the near no sell of the brass knuckles is interesting. Great match altogether.

Bayley Vs Nia Jax works with the story they told. Nia Jax bringing up the words that Bayley had called her. The Anniahilator being kicked out of. Bayley hitting that tremendous power bomb on Nia. Nia and Bayley effectively use the dynamic and the naturally build styles. From Nia being the powerhouse she is. Tiffany Stratton runs down to fake a cash in, distracting Bayley to aid Nia Jax. They dominantly had Nia defeat Bayley which was very solid.

Atmosphere: 1

Storytelling: 1

Psychology: 1

Innovation: 0.50

The story of the match was simple. Working with the dynamics that were provided. Seth laying down the law. Trying to gaslight Drew to take the match further. The crowd sang Seth’s theme in the first part of the match and it was great. Punk has his limitations but they are worked around. Drew has the bracelet and it becomes a key part of the match. From Seth having it on his wrist as he picked it up as the ref. Punk loses focus and gives Seth a GTS. Drew low blows Punk similarly to how Punk kicked him in Scotland. Before hitting him with a claymore that Seth had to count the pin for.

Its a very well told match, but there are a couple rough moments and not much for innovative spots.

This was definitely the most unpredictable match. Because both stars needed to win this match. Damian Priest was getting the support, the fan reactions. Gunther had the heat from just being the heel he is. This is a hard hitting match that say Damian make Gunther bleed from his chops. It was stiff, it had moments of it looking like a proper scrap. Finn Balor put Gunther’s leg on the ropes and it made sense that Damian found out by seeing the replay. Filled with rage Damian breaks out of a sleeper hold just to grab Finn by the neck. Gunther powerbombs and locks in a successful sleeper to win. Tremendous match to end a stellar reign.

Gotta hope Jaco Fatu is okay. This is exactly what was expected when they put that stipulation. The match went the length it went. Solidly worked and wrestled. No complaints there. Tama and Tonga run down to the ring to attack Cody. Cody kicks out. Kevin Owens and Randy Orton make the save. Cody attempts to use some stairs but Sikoa counters with a spear. Sikoa attempted a hip attack into them but failed. Jaco Fatu comes out and brutalizes Cody. Cody is splashed through the announce table similar to how Jacob debuted. Fatu looked visibly mad at how it happened, hopefully he isn’t hurt. Solo and Cody continue and Roman Reigns returns. Roman superman punches and spears Solo Sikoa, before giving Cody a nod of respect.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle launch Parents' Network to address the dangers of online.,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-on-social-media-online-harm-and-the-parents-network/,"On a brilliant summer day near Santa Barbara last week, a group of friends got together, met by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, better known as Harry and Meghan. It was a meeting of an exclusive club, one that no one wanted to join. Most of the parents here have lost a child – directly or indirectly – as a result of exposure to online social media.

Harry and Meghan are trying to give them, and parents like them, someplace to turn for help. It's called The Parents' Network, in association with the couple's charitable Archewell Foundation, and it officially launches today.

Meghan Markle herself knows a thing or two about online bullying, and of course her husband, Harry, is no stranger to that, either … or to unspeakable grief.

Pauley asked, ""The central topic is the loss that these families have suffered, stories that need to be shared, because the parents who are listening who have not suffered a loss think that they couldn't. But they could.""

""They certainly could,"" Harry said. ""And that's, I think, one of the scariest things that we've learnt over the course of the last 16, 17 years that social media's been around, and more so recently, is the fact that it could happen to absolutely anybody. We always talk about in the olden days if your kids were under your roof, you knew what they were up to; at least they were safe, right? And now, they could be in the next-door room on a tablet or on a phone and can be going down these rabbit holes. And before you know it, within 24 hours, they could be taking their life.""

Meghan said, ""Our kids are young; they're three and five. They're amazing. But all you want to do as parents is protect them. And so, as we can see what's happening in the online space, we know that there's a lot of work to be done there, and we're just happy to be able to be a part of change for good.""

""Well, you hope that when your children ask for help, someone, you know, is there to give it,"" said Pauley.

""If you know how to help, right?"" said Harry. ""At this point, we've got to the stage where almost every parent needs to be a first responder. And even the best first responders in the world wouldn't be able to tell the signs of possible suicide. Like, that is the terrifying piece of this.""

It's something Donna and Chris Dawley know all too well; their 17-year old son, C.J., died from suicide after what they believe was depression fueled by social media use.

""We had no idea what happened to our son,"" said Donna. ""You know, he had a beautiful car. He had a job he liked.""

""Sisters that loved him, parents that adored him,"" said Chris.

""And he was happy,"" said Donna. ""He was a happy kid.""

And like so many parents in their place, the Dawleys say a factor in their son's depression and death was his smartphone – a device designed to be so addictive that he couldn't put it down, not even in the minutes before he died. ""He still had it in his hand, the phone; that's how addicted he was,"" said Donna. ""He couldn't even kill himself without posting about it first.""

And like the Dawleys, it's often impossible for parents, or anyone else, to see that someone was so deep in despair that they'd consider taking their own life.

Meghan has been there, as she told Oprah Winfrey in 2021: ""Look, I was really ashamed to say it at the time, and ashamed to have to admit it to Harry especially, because I know how much loss he suffered. But I knew that if I didn't say it, that I would do it … and I just didn't want to be alive anymore.""

Pauley asked her, ""You had an experience that connects you to these families – and I see you touch your husband's hand in just the way I knew that you would be looking after each other if I went places – but the connection that you have with people is they know you had suffered, too, personally. Contemplating killing yourself is what suicidal ideation was. And I'm dancing around this because I could see you're uncomfortable with my even going there...""

""I understand why you are, though – I wasn't expecting it, but I understand why you are, because there is a through-line, I think,"" Meghan said. ""And when you've been through any level of pain or trauma, I believe part of our healing journey (certainly part of mine) is being able to be really open about it. And you know, I haven't really scraped the surface on my experience. But I do think that I would never want someone else to feel that way. And I would never want someone else to be making those sort of plans. And I would never want someone else to not be believed.

""So, if me voicing what I have overcome will save someone, or encourage someone in their life to really genuinely check in on them and not assume that the appearance is good, so everything's okay, then that's worth it,"" Meghan said. ""I'll take a hit for that.""

This in-person gathering was just for the launch – the Parents' Network will meet mostly online. But group facilitator Leora Wolf-Prusan said the important thing is what the group will talk about: ""We're gonna stop expecting you to be 'done' with your grief in a year,"" she told Pauley. ""We're gonna stop telling you that we're tired of hearing the stories of internet harm. Like, we will say your kid's name over and over again, 'cause they existed, and they mattered. And that we know that it wasn't your fault. That's it, right? It wasn't your fault. This happened to you. And now we as a community get to create something with you.""

Some of the group's charter members are Taj and Selene Swanson-Jensen, whose son, Tanner, died from an overdose of drugs pushed online; Brandy and Toney Roberts, who lost their daughter, Englyn, to suicide after online bullying; and Perla Mendoza, whose son, Eli, died when a painkiller he bought online was actually a lethal dose of fentanyl.

Pauley said, ""Thank you for being here. But I have to ask: Why would you do this?""

Taj replied, ""Simple answer: So others don't have to live what we've lived, and will continue to live.""

Participants in the Parents' Network: Perla Mendoza, Brandy and Toney Roberts, and Selene and Taj Swanson-Jensen. Each hopes to help other parents by telling stories of their own loss. CBS News

Perla said, ""I don't expect anything from anyone. This is just a labor of love in honor of my son and all the other children that have lost their lives to fentanyl. This is for the mother who cannot get out of bed, for the dad that won't leave his house. I stand here for them, too. And I hope that one day, when it's my turn to go home, I'll see my son, and he'll tell me, 'Good job, Mama.'""

The idea here is that there is comfort, and power, in numbers, with the goal (as Harry himself once said) of turning pain into purpose.

Meghan said, ""I think you have to start somewhere. I think the simplest thing that anyone watching this or anyone who's able to make change to look at it through the lens of, 'What if it was my daughter? What if it was my son? My son, or my daughter who comes home, who are joyful, who I love, and one day, right under my roof, our entire lives change because of something that was completely out of our control?' And if you look at it through the lens as a parent, there is no way to see that any other way than to try to find a solution.""

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle launch Parents' Network to address the dangers of online.,https://www.msn.com/en-us/video/peopleandplaces/prince-harry-and-meghan-launch-the-parents-network-to-address-dangers-of-social-media/vi-AA1ogp5i,
Prince Harry and Meghan Markle launch Parents' Network to address the dangers of online.,https://www.vanityfair.com/style/story/meghan-markle-prince-harry-interview-parentsnetwork,"During an emotion-packed interview broadcast on Sunday, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle spoke openly about the dangers they believe social media companies such as Meta, X (formerly Twitter), and TikTok have wrought. Any parent’s child “could be in the next-door room on a tablet or on a phone and can be going down these rabbit holes,” Harry said of social media. “And before you know it, within 24 hours, they could be taking their life.”

The Duke of Sussex made that dire warning during a previously publicized interview with Jane Pauley, which ran on CBS This Morning today. During the interview, the royal couple announced the launch of The Parents’ Network, an initiative from their non-profit, the Archwell Foundation that seeks to support parents and guardians who have lost children as a result of social media-based trauma, bullying, or abuse.

According to its newly launched website, parents in the US, UK, and Canada “whose children have suffered from the harmful effects of social media, from facing near-fatal harm, managing ongoing mental health difficulties, or experiencing the tragic loss of a child” will receive “crucial support” via “a no-cost, private community for parents and caregivers bound by shared experiences of social media harms.” The website also offers “parent’s guides"" to popular platforms and access to small, peer-led support groups and expert-led educational events.

The effort is rooted in Meghan Markle’s own experiences as a public figure and spouse of one of the most-watched royal family members on the planet. “When you’ve been through any level of pain or trauma, I believe part of our healing journey—certainly part of mine—is being able to be really open about it,” she said.

“If me voicing what I have overcome will save someone or encourage someone in their life to really, genuinely check in on them and not assume that the appearance is good so everything is okay, then that’s worth it,” she said. “I’ll take a hit for that.”

Markle, who admitted in 2021 that she experienced suicidal ideation due to the pressures of royal scrutiny, said that she “really scraped the surface on my experience,” when working on the couple’s new initiative.

“But I do think that I would never want someone else to feel that way,” she said. “And I would never want someone else to be making those sorts of plans, and I would never want someone else to not be believed.”

In the rare joint interview, the couple said that the goal of The Parents’ Network is to help raise awareness of the silent threat of social media on children’s mental health. “One of the scariest things that we’ve learned over the course of the last 16, 17 years that social media’s been around, and more so recently, is the fact that it could happen to absolutely anybody,” Harry said, referring to cases of self-harm said to be rooted in the use of online platforms.

“Our kids are young; they’re three and five. Amazing. But all you want to do as parents is protect them,” Markle said. “And so, as we can see what's happening in the online space, we know that there’s a lot of work to be done there, and we are just happy to be able to be a part of change for good.”

According to Harry, a key issue for new efforts is helping parents understand when their kids are struggling with social media. “At this point, we’ve got to the stage where almost every parent needs to be a first responder,” Harry said. “And even the best first responders in the world wouldn’t be able to tell the signs of possible suicide. Like, that is the terrifying piece of this.”

If you need emotional support or are in crisis, call the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988."

After chatting with parents Donna and Chris Dawley, whose teenage son sadly died by suicide, Jane 73, focused the attention on former Suits actress Meghan who was subjected to the harmful effects of social media and previously dealt with suicidal thoughts while pregnant with her son Archie - a topic she spoke about with Oprah Winfrey back in 2021.

And her touching display of affection didn't go unnoticed, with Jane noting: ""You had an experience that connects you to these families – and I see you touch your husband's hand in just the way I knew that you would be looking after each other - but the connection that you have with people is they know you had suffered, too, personally.""

In response, mother-of-two Mehgan said: ""I understand why you are, though – I wasn't expecting it, but I understand why you are, because there is a through-line, I think.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who stepped down as senior working royals in 2020, launched their new initiative following the success of a two-year pilot program run by The Archewell Foundation.

The Parents' Network is now available for the first time for parents to join in the US, UK and Canada.

Its key aim is to provide crucial support to parents whose children have suffered from the harmful effects of social media, from facing near-fatal harm, managing ongoing mental health difficulties, or experiencing the tragic loss of a child.

James Holt, Executive Director of The Archewell Foundation, said: ""Over the past two years, alongside our co-founders Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, our team has engaged deeply with parents and young people about the repercussions of social media on their mental, physical, and emotional well-being.

""It became strikingly clear that there is a critical need for connection and community among those who understand the pain, fear, and isolation caused by social media’s impact on children. We believe in the transformative power of community, and that is why we have created this network—to connect those who face these challenges and offer mutual support.""

During the chat—and in a preview clip that was released ahead of the special—Meghan opened up about online bullying (particularly, how she plans to protect her young children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, from the masses of harmful content freely available online).

For some context, Meghan and Harry's Archewell Foundation offers a support network for families and parents dealing with grief, as well as for children who are struggling with mental health conditions due to harmful internet exposure.

The Duchess told Pauley the following during the convo: “Our kids are young—they're three and five. They're amazing. But all you want to do as parents is protect them.”



“So as we can see what's happening in the online space, we know that there's a lot of work to be done there, and we're just happy to be able to be a part of change for good,” she added.

In light of this, it has just been announced that the couple will undertake a four-day visit to Colombia later this summer ahead of the first World Ministerial Conference on the Elimination of Violence Against Children.

Francia Márquez, Colombia's vice president said this in a statement: “The conference will present a global framework for creating safer physical and virtual spaces, addressing issues such as cyberbullying, online exploitation and the impact of these threats on mental health. It will offer practical solutions and commitments for countries around the world.”

She added that during the Duke and Duchess' visit, the couple, alongside the Archewell Foundation, will take part in a “number of activities related to this important topic.”

A royal commentator has said he's 'struggling' with 'awful abuse' from Princes Harry and Meghan Markle's fans.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who have launched Parents' Network to address the dangers of online harm, have seemingly failed to teach the same lesson to their fans who allegedly targeted a journalist with their comments.

Cameron Walker, GB News royal correspondent, has said he is ""struggling"" with some of the ""awful abuse"" that he receives from royal fans.



""I am struggling with a little bit is the amount of abuse that comes from Harry and Meghan supporters online. I mean, just tweeting about the royal couple's new initiative this morning, I got a lot of hate from Prince and Princess of Wales fans.

""So I think there are two cult groups that are either very pro-Harry and Meghan or very pro-William and Catherine.""

The commentator went on: ""And they're pitted against each other online all the time, hurling awful abuse against both Meghan. And it's very bizarre, isn't it?""

It emerges after Harry and Meghan's latest interview, in which the Sussexes tried to school social media users while explaining how online abuse can affect people's wellbeing and mantle health."

Most families think the unthinkable is just that—unthinkable. But the charter members of The Parents' Network have learned how, with the blink of an eye, this can change. Two of those parents are the Dawleys, a couple who lost 17-year old son, C.J., from suicide after what they believe was depression fueled by social media use, ""We had no idea what happened to our son,"" Mrs. Dawley told CBS News Sunday Morning.

Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle have launched an initiative aimed at tackling child safety online, called The Parents' Network.

As part of the campaign, a group of parents have come together, to help offer a 'safe and supportive community [which] is available to all parents and caregivers navigating the complex digital world'.

This group includes those who 'have first-hand knowledge of the pain and destruction caused by social media use'.

A description of the network on the Sussexes' Archewell Foundation website says: 'Each of us have been through something no parent should ever have to experience, and our mission is to prevent anyone else from suffering the way we have.

'For anyone who has a child affected by social media harms, we are here to support you. Our safe and supportive community is available to all parents and caregivers navigating the complex digital world.'

Harry and Meghan were shown embracing parents from The Parents' Network as they met in person for its launch

The campaign, which carries the slogan #NoChildLostToSocialMedia, includes a video which has been posted on the Foundation's website and features parents who have lost their children to suicide because of online harm among others whose children have been badly harmed.

As well as those who have lost children, The Parents' Network aims to support those whose children are struggling with 'present-day issues of cyberbullying, depression and anxiety, sexual exploitation, eating disorders, and a range of other traumas related to social media use'.

According to the network: 'Some are seeking ways to channel pain into purpose. Some are simply trying to survive – while ensuring our kids do the same.

'All of us are seeking safe, supportive environments where we can talk openly about experiences often kept under lock and key, and forge meaningful relationships with others who understand.'

In addition, a list of three guides has been posted on the site, each tackling a social media platform, including Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok.

The guides are described by the site as being 'repurposed in partnership with The Social Media Victims Law Center'.

Compiled using information from the Center's online social media guides, they include information about what each platform is used for, and how caregivers can 'improve their child’s safety' while they are using them.

Alongside the campaign launch, the couple gave their first formal broadcast interview together in three years today, appearing on American broadcaster CBS News' Sunday Morning programme.

During the sit down with anchor Jane Pauley, the couple said they want to 'be a part of change for good' when it comes to the 'online space'.

'Our kids are young - they're three and five,' said Meghan, who wore a £12,800 Cartier necklace and £1485 Ralph Lauren coords for the appearance.

'They're amazing. But all you want to do as parents is protect them. And so, as we can see what's happening in the online space, we know that there's a lot of work to be done there, and we're just happy to be able to be a part of change for good.'

Harry added: 'At this point, we've got to the stage where almost every parent needs to be a first responder.

'And even the best first responders in the world wouldn't be able to tell the signs of possible suicide. Like, that is the terrifying piece of this.'

Meghan, who turns 43 today, also discussed having suicidal thoughts. The Duchess first said she had experienced suicidal thoughts during her time as working royal while the couple were being interviewed by Oprah Winfrey three years ago.

During the interview released today, she said she hopes her candour will help others and will encourage people to check in on their friends.

'There is a through line, when you've been through any level of pain or trauma,' Meghan said.

'Part of your healing journey, certainly part of mine is to be open about it.

'I haven't really scraped the surface on my experience. I would never want someone else to feel that way. I would never want someone else to be making these plan. I would never want someone else not to be believed.'

She added: 'So if me voicing what I have overcome, will save someone, or encourage someone in their life to really genuinely check in on them, not assume the appearance is good, not assume everything is okay, then I'll take that.'

The Duchess of Sussex told Oprah in 2021 she 'couldn't be left alone' and told her husband she 'didn't want to be alive anymore' before claiming the Buckingham Palace HR department ignored her plea for help because she wasn't a 'paid employee'.

Describing how she considered ending her life believing it 'was better for everyone', Meghan said: 'I knew that if I didn't say it, that I would do it. I just didn't want to be alive anymore. And that was a very clear and real and frightening constant thought. I remember how he just cradled me. I said that I needed to go somewhere to get help. I said that 'I've never felt this way before, and I need to go somewhere'. And I was told that I couldn't, that it wouldn't be good for the institution'.

She said that after confiding in her husband, she was forced to go to the Royal Albert Hall for a charity event in January 2019, claiming photos from that night 'haunt me'.

She told Oprah she later reached out to one of the best friends of Diana, Princess of Wales, because she felt unsupported by the palace.

She said: 'When I joined that family, that was the last time I saw my passport, my driving licence, my keys - all of that gets turned over'. Meghan said Harry had 'saved my life' by agreeing to move to Los Angeles.

In the interview, Harry and Meghan also met with a group of parents who lost their children to suicide. Harry also spoke of the 'scariest thing' about social media being 'absolutely anyone' can lose a loved one.

The interview shared today by American broadcaster CBS featured a clip of Meghan hugging bereaved parents (pictured)

'We always talk about in the olden days, if kids are under your roof, you know what they are up to. At least they're safe.

'But now, they could in the next room, in a tablet or phone, going down these rabbit holes, and within 24 hours they could be taking their life'.

Responding to host Jane Pauley describing the network as a 'modest beginning', adding that 'it isn't an army of parents', Meghan said: 'You have to start somewhere. Anyone watching this or anyone able to make change needs to look through the lens of ""what if this was my son or daughter?"".

'Your son or daughter who comes home who are joyful, who I love, and one day, right under my roof, our entire lives change because of something that's completely out of my control. And if you look at is as a parent, there is no way to see it any other way than to try and find a solution'.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle launch Parents' Network to address the dangers of online.,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2485544/meghan-markle-opens-up-about-suicidal-thoughts-discusses-new-initiative-to-combat-online-harm,"In a candid interview on CBS Sunday Morning, Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, shared personal insights about her past struggles with suicidal thoughts, emphasizing her commitment to improving online safety for children.

The interview, which aired on Meghan’s 43rd birthday, featured her and Prince Harry discussing their latest project, The Parents Network, launched through their Archewell Foundation.

The Parents Network aims to support parents dealing with the effects of social media-related trauma on their children. This initiative, now available in the U.S., U.K., and Canada after a two-year pilot program, seeks to address the growing concern over online bullying and its impact on young people.

During the interview, Meghan reflected on her 2021 revelation to Oprah Winfrey about her mental health struggles, describing a period when she “just didn’t want to be alive anymore.”

She articulated the importance of being open about such experiences as part of the healing process, stating, “I really scraped the surface on my experience, but I do think that I would never want someone else to feel that way... If me voicing what I have overcome will save someone or encourage someone in their life to really, genuinely check in on them, then that’s worth it.”

Meghan and Prince Harry, who are parents to Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, also discussed their efforts to shield their children from harmful online content. Meghan expressed a strong desire to protect their young family from the negative impacts of social media, emphasizing the need for proactive measures in the digital space.

Prince Harry highlighted the challenge of recognizing signs of distress and the importance of parental vigilance, stating, “Almost every parent needs to be a first responder. Even the best first responders in the world wouldn’t be able to tell the signs of possible suicide.”

The Parents Network’s ""No Child Lost to Social Media"" campaign aligns with the Archewell Foundation’s ongoing mission to provide a supportive community for families affected by online harassment.

The initiative was a key focus of the Foundation’s first in-person event, held in New York City on World Mental Health Day in October 2023. The event aimed to address the urgency of online safety through discussions with families who have experienced loss due to social media."

Called The Parents' Network, the initiative aims to help offer a 'safe and supportive community [which] is available to all caregivers navigating the complex digital world'.

The Network already includes a group of parents. According to the Sussexes' Archewell Foundation website, this group includes those who 'have first-hand knowledge of the pain and destruction caused by social media use'.

A description of the network on the site says: 'Each of us have been through something no parent should ever have to experience, and our mission is to prevent anyone else from suffering the way we have.

'For anyone who has a child affected by social media harms, we are here to support you. Our safe and supportive community is available to all parents and caregivers navigating the complex digital world.'

Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle (pictured) have launched a new campaign called The Parents' Network

The campaign, which carries the slogan #NoChildLostToSocialMedia, includes a video which has been posted on the Foundation's website and features parents who have lost their children to suicide because of online harm.

In addition, a list of three guides has been posted on the site, each tackling a social media platform, including Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok.

The guides are described by the site as being 'repurposed in partnership with The Social Media Victims Law Center'.

Compiled using information from the Center's online social media guides, they include information about what each platform is used for, and how caregivers can 'improve their child’s safety' while they are using them.

Alongside the campaign launch, the couple gave their first formal broadcast interview together in three years today, appearing on American broadcaster CBS News' Sunday Morning programme.

During the sit down with anchor Jane Pauley, the couple said they want to 'be a part of change for good' when it comes to the 'online space'.

The interview showed the couple meeting with members of The Parents' Network in person for the launch, with future meetings set to take place online.

These are the parents who are featured in the campaign video shared today on the Archewell Foundation website. In the video, they shared they shared their heartbreaking stories of how their families were affected by social media.

Darla and Ryan

Darla and Ryan lost their firstborn Emma Claire to suicide after finding out she had been relentlessly bullied

Darla and Ryan's firstborn child Emma Claire enjoyed spending time with her show pigs. She also loved basketball, photography, cheering for Alabama football and hunting with her father at the weekends.

According to the couple, their family was close: Emma Claire was a 'happy and outgoing' girl, even on her final day, and so they were never aware of the depression and darkness she was experiencing.

One Sunday, as they were getting ready for church, Darla found Emma Claire in their barn. As told by Darla to the Archewell Foundation's website: 'I saw her legs first and knew something was wrong. I hurried over to her, but it was too late. She had taken her own life.

'I ran to Ryan. He thought he could fix it, you know. He was her dad. That's what he did. He thought he could throw her in the truck and take her to ER.

'But then reality set in. It was the worst day of our lives. We say our lives stopped that day.'

Darla and Ryan learnt that their daughter had been relentlessly bullied on Snapchat, a social media app where people can send captioned pictures to each other and messages that disappear after a certain time period.

'Even though we checked her phone regularly, the messages that were causing her so much pain weren't visible to us,' Darla said.

Darla and Ryan said they knew where Emma Claire was at all times, knew what she was watching on TV and who her friends were, but said even this 'wasn't enough'.

They hope by sharing their daughter's story, they can raise awareness, and prevent any other young people from suffering in the same way.

According to the couple: 'It's the most indescribable pain, the worst pain a human can feel, to lose a child. We wouldn't wish it on anyone.'

Erin

Erin described her daughter, Angelica (pictured), as happy, playful, carefree and curious, before social media impacted her life

Erin described her daughter Angelica as happy, playful, carefree and curious - before social media impacted her life.

Angelica got her first smartphone at the age of 12. At first, she used it to watch 'funny animal videos and message friends'. But she started to engage with darker content, which ultimately drove a wedge between mother and daughter.

She asked her mother if she could start using Snapchat, and Erin then downloaded it to check out the features on the social media app herself.

According to Erin, all she could see was 'light, entertaining videos,' along with 'funny filters' - she had no idea the app could be so dangerous.

'Angelica was being targeted with content about drugs - menus of all the pills she could get at the click of a button, sent via private messages sent by adults who did not know her,' Erin said.

By the time Angelica was in the eighth grade, her attitude, style, music taste and who she spent her time with changed drastically.

Angelica showed signs of depression and 'ran away several times'. Erin said her daughter knew how to bypass monitoring apps, and would not let her mother see her phone, and would instead show her a different phone.

When she was aged around 14 to 15, Angelica disappeared for five months. Then, Erin received a call that shook her to her very core.

A police officer phoned her and said: 'Your daughter has overdosed'.

After this, Erin stripped everything back to basics and ensured that her daughter felt listened to and 'gave her the freedom she needed without restriction' to help rebuild her family.

She wrote on the charity's website: 'I used to wake up at 2am to make sure she was still breathing and still there.'

Erin said Angelica realised the toll that social media was having on her life but even now gets shown disturbing content.

'Videos of naked men, of people shooting themselves in the head, colourful drug menus, images that invite eating disorders by promoting unhealthy body images, and even the unimaginable things like ads encouraging young teen girls to make money through surrogacy,' she said.

But Angelica does not try and hide the thing she gets shown online anymore so they can talk about it openly.

Kathleen and Jeff

Kathleen and Jeff (pictured) say their daughter, Alexis, was 'robbed of her childhood' due to social media

Kathleen and Jeff say their daughter, Alexis, was 'robbed of her childhood' due to social media.

Her first phone was a flip phone and they gave it to her so they could keep in contact - for safety reasons.

But things changed when Alexis made an Instagram account in the sixth grade without telling her parents.

She was around 11 or 12-years-old when she began interacting with the app, which is in violation of their policy.

Alexis had posts pop-up on her feed that were marked #ProAna (which denotes pro-anorexia content) but Alexis not understand what this meant.

She thought Ana was a person, and wanted to see if 'she' was okay.

After engaging with a couple of posts, Alexis was then flooded with similar content, and this affected her badly.

Her parents said: 'We started to notice that she was self-harming, running straight off to the bathroom after any meal, and she became extremely irritable.'

Kathleen and Jeff said their 'hearts broke' after they found out their daughter was struggling with an eating disorder and self-harm - harming her almost fatally in 2018.

'The algorithms are designed to keep children specifically addicted, which can often lead them to dark and harmful places. This is a systemic issue that needs addressing,' they said.

Now, Alexis has graduated university with her bachelor's degree and works as an emergency medical technician.

She hopes to become a special education teacher 'to use her experiences and compassion to help others'.

Joanne and Derek

Joanne and Derek (pictured) felt like they were 'in competition' with social media apps for their son's attention

Joanne and Derek gave their son Lucas a phone when he was around nine-years-old, but soon felt Lucas - who was described as a 'happy ball of energy' - slipping away from them.

They felt like they were 'in competition' with social media apps for their son's attention. But they were losing the battle.

Joanne and Derek said: 'A stupid challenge on social media had led to Lucas being attacked in the school bathrooms, and some inappropriate photos were shared on social media.'

They struggled to understand how content like that could get shared around online so easily 'without any consequences'.

Since the attack, Lucas is slowly recovering but they admitted that it had a 'massive impact' on him.

Our children are puppets in these evil games, and platforms are doing nothing to stop them,' they said.

Toney and Brandy

Toney and Brandy (pictured) who lost their daughter Englyn, want social media companies to make their platforms safer for children

Parents Toney and Brandy lost their daughter Englyn, the youngest of their eight children (five girls and three boys). According to the bereavd parents, they were 'so close' with their youngest that it isn't possible for them to 'ever get close to describing the amount of love and happiness we had'.

Describing their daughter, they said she loved fashion, and would change several times a day as she enjoyed her clothing so much. She also loved singing and dancing.

When she was around 12 or 13-years-old, she had a smartphone so she could stay connected with her parents. They knew she was using it to post fun pictures and videos, as Toney and Brandy said, they were 'really simple, fun things that any young child would do'.

However, in retrospect, they say they now realise their daughter had become addicted to social media, and while they once thought it was for staying connected and having fun, they now realise how dangerous it can be.

Speaking about Englyn's tragic death by suicide,Toney and Brandy said there were no signs. The day she died, she was laughing and dancing, behaving in her normal manner. She told her parents she loved them before going to bed.

After her death, her devastated parents found notes on Englyn's phone, describing how depressed she was. They realised how her social media feeds were 'sending her harmful content based on, what we assume to be, her searches about feeling down'.

Toney and Brandy want social media companies to make their platforms safer for children, describing their algorithms as doing harm that is 'real', and that they are 'affecting too many families'. Their engagement in The Parents' Network is to try and save others from going through the same lifelong grief as their family.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have spoken about their need keep their children Archie and Lilibet protected, stating that as a parent it is ""all you want to do.""

Harry and Meghan spoke in a new TV interview for US TV show CBS Sunday Morning.



The interview was focussed on the couple's new project, which launches next week and supports parents of children affected by online harm.

A trailer for the new interview has been released, where the couple talk about their two children Archie, five, and Lilibet, three, and their feelings as parents.

The interview will feature the couple discussing their work with parents who have lost their children to online bullying and their campaigning to address the problem.

Meghan says on the trailer: ""Our kids are young, they're three and five, they're amazing.

""But all you want to do as parents is protect them.

""And so as we can see what's happening in the online space, we know that there's a lot of work to be done there and we're just happy to be able to be a part of change for good.""

When the host then says that when children ask for help, the hope is that someone is there to help, Harry replies:

""If you know how to help... At this point we've got to the stage where almost every parent needs to be a first responder.

""Even the best first responders in the world wouldn't be able to tell the signs of possible suicide.

A spokesperson for CBS, the channel who are broadcasting the interview, confirmed: “The Duke and Duchess sat down with ‘CBS Sunday Morning’ host Jane Pauley last week for an exclusive interview to introduce a program aimed at supporting parents whose children have been impacted by online harm.

“Jane also spoke with parents participating in the pilot program who described how it has helped their healing process.”

It comes three years after the pair's bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey, which saw the couple make a series of claims about the Royal Family.

The new interview comes after the news that the The Duke and Duchess have been personally invited to spend a few days in Colombia by the country's Vice President Francia Márquez in a visit shortly before a conference on ending violence against children set to be held there – the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence Against Children.

Speaking to Jane Pauley in a segment on CBS News Sunday Morning, Meghan noted that she hadn't ""really scraped the surface"" on her personal experience, despite sharing some details of the abuse she had received in her 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle discuss their kids Archie and Lilibet in new joint interview

In the newly aired interview, Meghan was joined by her husband, Prince Harry, to promote the Parents' Network – a community largely comprised of parents who have either directly or indirectly lost a child as a result of exposure to online social media. The initiative has been launched by the couple's charitable organization, The Archewell Foundation.

In an emotional moment, Jane noted that Meghan shared a connection with the organization's parents, as a result of her own experiences with suicidal ideation. After the broadcaster explained that she was ""dancing around the topic"" to avoid making Meghan uncomfortable, the mom-of-two opened up.

""I understand why you are, though – I wasn't expecting it, but I understand why you are, because there is a through-line, I think,"" Meghan said.

""And when you've been through any level of pain or trauma, I believe part of our healing journey (certainly part of mine) is being able to be really open about it. And you know, I haven't really scraped the surface on my experience. But I do think that I would never want someone else to feel that way. And I would never want someone else to be making those sorts of plans. And I would never want someone else to not be believed.

Meghan initially spoke about her mental health during an interview with Oprah Winfrey

""So, if me voicing what I have overcome will save someone, or encourage someone in their life to really genuinely check in on them and not assume that the appearance is good, so everything's okay, then that's worth it,"" Meghan explained. ""I'll take a hit for that.""

Back in 2021, Meghan told Oprah Winfrey that she'd previously had suicidal thoughts. ""Look, I was really ashamed to say it at the time and ashamed to have to admit it to Harry, especially, because I know how much loss he has suffered, but I knew that if I didn't say it, then I would do it,"" Meghan shared with Oprah. ""I just didn't want to be alive anymore.""

Meghan explained that the relentless, negative media coverage of her meant she felt extreme distress, but she went on to confide in her husband, Harry and then reached out for help from a professional.

Harry himself has also spoken about Meghan's mental health during this time, noting that he was ""ashamed"" of the way that he responded after she confided in him just hours before visiting the Royal Albert Hall for a charity event.

While appearing on the mental health series, The Me You Can't See, which he created and produced with Oprah for Apple TV, Harry said: ""I'm somewhat ashamed of the way that I dealt with it… When my wife and I were in those chairs gripping each other's hand the moment the lights go down, Meghan starts crying, I'm feeling sorry for her but I'm also really angry with myself that we're stuck in this situation.

""I was ashamed that it got this bad. I was ashamed to go to my family because to be honest with you like a lot of other people my age could probably relate to, I know that I'm not going to get from my family what I need.""

Having worked with a trusted therapist, Meghan has continued to encourage anyone struggling with their mental health to seek outside help.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have landed in trouble as they announce their new initiative, the Parents' Network, aimed at combating harmful online content.



The Duke and Duchess of Sussex received scathing criticism for being ‘hypocrite’ as expert noted their ‘vile behaviour’ after their latest interview with CBS Sunday Morning was released.

Speaking with Sky News Australia, Gemma Tognini slammed the California-based royal couple on the issue, citing their history of posting their children's photos online without hiding their faces.

“This is the couple that pimped out their children on Instagram regularly,” she said, referring to Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.

“Their children who aren't in a position to make decisions for themselves about who gets to see them and what their digital footprint looks like,” she added.

Tognini said the Sussexes have “zero credibility in this space to talk about cyberbullying” and went on to reference Harry’s past behaviour when he shared explicit details of his former life in Spare.

“I mean, even talking about the woman who (Harry) lost his virginity to and the way he described it - this woman had been getting on with her life, and had by all reports, kept his secret for the last however many years,"" she said.

“I mean, it was just absolutely vile behaviour. They have absolutely no credibility from which to launch this conversation.”"

Speaking on CBS News Sunday Morning, the couple drew on their own experience as parents, saying all they wanted to do was ""protect"" their son Archie and daughter Lilibet.

Prince Harry added that ""one of the scariest things"" was knowing that any parent could lose a child to suicide as a result of exposure to harmful content.

The pair recently launched a new programme called The Parents Network, which aims to support parents and guardians who have been affected by the issue.

In their interview with Oprah, Prince Harry and Meghan covered issues from racism to life in the Royal Family.

This interview solely focused on their ambitions to tackle online harm.

""At least they were safe, right?"" he said.

""And now, they could be in the next door room on a tablet or on a phone, and can be going down these rabbit holes. And before you know it, within 24 hours, they could be taking their life.""

""And even the best first responders in the world wouldn't be able to tell the signs of possible suicide,"" he said.

""That is the terrifying piece of this.""

Prince Harry, whose mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, died when he was 12, has been open about the impact grief had - and continues to have - on his mental health.

In her interview with Oprah, Meghan also spoke about her battles with poor mental health.

She said there was ""a through-line"" which connected her experience to those families who had lost a child.

""When you've been through any level of pain or trauma, I believe part of our healing journey - certainly part of mine - is being able to be really open about it,"" she said.

Meghan said that she hadn't really ""scraped the surface"" on her own experience, but she never wanted anyone else to feel the way she had.

'We have to start somewhere'

The couple are expected to highlight the importance of safeguarding young people online during their official visit to Colombia later this month. The trip follows their visit to Nigeria in May.

Speaking about their new initiative, The Parents Network, Meghan said that it was important to ""start somewhere"".

She urged people watching the interview to look at it through the lens of it being their own child who was impacted.

""What if it was my daughter, what if it was my son,"" she said. ""My son or my daughter who comes home, who are joyful, who I love, and one day, right under my roof, our entire lives change because of something that was completely out of our control.

""And if you look at it through the lens as a parent, there is no way to see that any other way than to try and find a solution.""

The Sussexes moved to California in June 2020 with their son Archie. Their daughter Lilibet was born there in 2021.

The couple do not mention any other members of the Royal Family in their CBS interview.

They are not expected to visit Prince Harry's father, King Charles III, in Scotland during his summer break.

Meghan Markle has opened up about her ""pain"" and ""trauma"" in a new interview. The Duchess of Sussex sat down with her husband Prince Harry for a candid interview on CBS.

Meghan, 43, and Harry, 39, appeared on the network's Sunday Morning show to discuss their latest project, The Parents Network, which aims to support parents to have a lost a child to suicide after being victims of cyberbullying. The new project, which launched on Sunday, 4 August, also helps those who have lost children after they were sold drugs online.

Harry said: ""That's one of the scariest things that we've learned over the course of the last 15 or 17 years of social media, and more so recently, is that it could happen to anybody. We always talk about 'in the olden days' if your children were under your roof they would be safe, you knew what they were up to. But now they can be in the next room on their tablet, or phone, going down rabbit holes. And before you know it, 24 hours later, they could be taking their life.""

Meghan discussed hers and Harry's two young children, Archie, five, and Lilibet, three, and the importance of knowing ""what's happening in the online space"". She said: ""Our kids are young, they're three and five, they're amazing. But all you want to do as parents is protect them. And so as we can see what's happening in the online space, we know that there's a lot of work to be done there and we're just happy to be able to be a part of change for good.""

Elsewhere, Meghan discussed her ""healing journey"" after experiencing ""pain"". She admitted she hasn't ""scraped the surface"" of her experience yet.

She told host Jane Pauley: ""When you've been through any level of pain or trauma, I believe part of our healing journey, certainly part of mine, is being able to be really open about it. I haven't really scraped the surface of my experience, but I do think I would never want someone else to feel that way, or for someone else to make those sort plans, or for someone else to not be believed.""

The Duchess added: ""If me voicing what I have overcome will save someone or encourages someone in their life to really genuinely check in on them, and not assume if the appearance is good, then everything is okay, then that's worth it, I will take a hit for that.""

Meghan has been open about her struggles in the past, most notably in her interview with Oprah Winfrey. She admitted she struggled enormously with her mental health while living in the UK and being part of the Royal Family.

Meghan Markle made a fresh TV appearance over the weekend and Royal fans had plenty to say about it.

The Duchess of Sussex joined her husband, Prince Harry, on CBS' Sunday Morning to announce their latest initiative - The Parents Network. This project aims to address child safety online and provide support for families who have lost children to suicide due to insufficient online protection.

Meghan was the epitome of understated elegance in a neutral palette, opting for the 'Adrien' relaxed fit linen-blend shirt by Ralph Lauren (£775), teamed with the same designer's 'Evanne' linen trousers (£915), both in a soft mauve shade.

She added a touch of sparkle to her outfit with her go-to jewellery pieces, including Cartier's Juste un Clou necklace (£15,500), the brand's gold Tank Francaise watch (£28,200) and a yellow gold Love bracelet (£7,050). Her look was completed with a pair of beige strappy pointed heels.

And Royal followers were mostly smitten with Meghan's ensemble, with many commenting on her radiant makeup. One Instagram user gushed: ""Her makeup looks so good in these photos. She seems to gravitate towards these neutral colours. I actually like this colour."" Another fan concurred: ""Adore the whole outfit, super chic and polished; and the make-up is perfection.""

A third chimed in: ""She does casual looks so well. And what an unexpected colour. Looks very nice on her. Compliments softness of hair and makeup.""

A user penned: ""This is a great neutral tone on her, and she looks more tailored and put together than in some past looks. The shirt is blousy but not wrinkled, casual yet serious for the discussion at hand. A great choice! "".

Another added: ""She definitely loves her neutrals, and they look good on her. She's also loving that necklace lately. Love this ensemble, the colour looks great on her! My dream is to get a Cartier love bracelet someday! "".

A third chimed in: ""Love the colour and fit. It's also nice to see her with her hair down for a change."" A fourth exclaimed: ""That colour is amazing. BRB running to Ralph Lauren. I was never really blown away by the juste in clou and love bracelets I see on all my friends, but the necklace is on another level. Love it"".

A fifth admirer wrote: ""She looks beautiful and her hair is lovely [heart emoji] very elegant."""

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle launch Parents' Network to address the dangers of online.,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-13709369/Meghan-Duchess-Sussex-CBS-hug-jarring.html,"When the Duchess of Sussex met parents whose children had been victims of online bullying, she skipped formalities and offered them a warm hug.

Meghan Markle, 43, took to Santa Barbra with Prince Harry, 39, to support grieving parents as part of their new initiative called The Parents Network, forming a new branch of the Archewell Foundation.

In an interview for American broadcaster CBS, the royals discussed the launch with anchor Jane Pauley and hugged and spoke with parents who lost their children to suicide, which in many cases was linked to social media usage.

The CBS segment praised the Sussex's willingness to hug members of the public, with the news anchor saying at the start of the interview: 'Harry and Meghan are definitely big huggers'.

It's an act not often associated with members of the royal family, and in the Netflix docuseries Harry & Meghan, the mother-of-two previously revealed how her hugs haven't always had a positive reception.

Meghan Markle was praised on American broadcast network CBS over the weekend for being a 'big hugger' - a characteristic she has repeatedly demonstrated, including during a 2018 visit to the Hubb Community Kitchen in London (pictured)

Talking in the 2020 docuseries, the 43-year-old revealed she was 'barefoot' and wearing ripped jeans when she first met the Prince and Princess of Wales.

Meghan said she did not know the 'formality' carries on behind closed doors and that she is a 'hugger', which she did not realise was 'jarring for some Brits'.

In the explosive Netflix docuseries, the mother-of-two admitted she was 'surprised' there is a 'forward facing way of being' in private.

She said: 'Even when Will and Kate came over and I was meeting her for the first time I remember I was in ripped jeans, I was barefoot. Like I was a hugger, I have always been a hugger I didn't realise that is really jarring for a lot of Brits.'

'I started to understand that the formality on the outside carried through on the inside, that there is a forward facing way of being and then you close the door and think ""OK we can relax now"". But that formality carries over on both sides and that was surprising to me.'

Despite attracting mixed feelings from others, Meghan has continued to embrace the public on various occasions, including Invictus Games participants, with her photographed hugging swimmer Danielle Pothoof at the medals ceremony last year.

It was also a running theme during the Sussex's three-day tour of Nigeria in May, during which Meghan thanked Nigerians for welcoming her to 'my country', where she hoped she can 'do justice' to being a 'role model'.

The Duchess of Sussex, who recently discovered she is '43 per cent Nigerian', wowed crowds in May as she and Prince Harry conducted a whirlwind 'royal' tour of the African nation.

The mother-of-two did not hold back when it came to hugging members of the Nigerian public, with her photographed hugging various individuals lining the streets to meet her.

It's of little surprise then that Meghan greeted parents on the CBS segment with a warm embrace - an action that received praise news anchor Jane Pauley.

During the interview, Meghan said she has 'only scraped the surface' of discussing the suicidal thoughts she had while a working member of the royal family, three years after she told Oprah Winfrey she 'didn't want to be alive anymore' while living in the UK.

Meghan first spoke of her suicidal thoughts while being a working royal in an bombshell interview with Oprah in 2021.

She now says she hopes her candour will help others and will encourage people to check in on their friends.

'I think when you've been through any level of pain or trauma, I believe part of our healing journey, certainly part of mine, is being able to be really open about it,' the duchess said.

'And I haven't really scraped the surface on my experience but I do think that I would never want someone else to feel that way.

'And I would never want someone else to be making those sorts of plans and I would never want someone else to not be believed.

'So, if me voicing what I have overcome, will save someone or encourage someone in their life to really genuinely check in on them and not assume that the appearance is good so everything's okay, then that's worth it.

'I'll take a hit for that.'

Harry and Meghan have released a new CBS interview about cyber abuse, with the Duke saying parents have to be 'first responders'

Meghan said that 'opening up' is part of the healing process and she hopes her candour will help others

The Duchess of Sussex told Oprah in 2021 she 'couldn't be left alone' and told her husband she 'didn't want to be alive anymore' before claiming the Buckingham Palace HR department ignored her plea for help because she wasn't a 'paid employee'.

'I was really ashamed to say it at the time, and ashamed to have to admit it to Harry especially, because I know how much loss he suffered. But I knew that if I didn't say it, that I would do it … and I just didn't want to be alive anymore,'.

Describing how she considered ending her life believing it 'was better for everyone', Meghan said: 'I knew that if I didn't say it, that I would do it. I just didn't want to be alive anymore. And that was a very clear and real and frightening constant thought. I remember how he just cradled me.

'I said that I needed to go somewhere to get help. I said that 'I've never felt this way before, and I need to go somewhere'. And I was told that I couldn't, that it wouldn't be good for the institution'.

She said that after confiding in her husband, she was forced to go to the Royal Albert Hall for a charity event in January 2019, claiming photos from that night 'haunt me'.

She told Oprah she later reached out to one of the best friends of Diana, Princess of Wales, because she felt unsupported by the palace.

She said: 'When I joined that family, that was the last time I saw my passport, my driving licence, my keys - all of that gets turned over'. Meghan said Harry had 'saved my life' by agreeing to move to Los Angeles.

At the start of the CBS segment, Meghan was seen in a clip hugging bereaved parents

Meghan first spoke of her suicidal thoughts while being a working royal in an bombshell interview with Oprah in 2021

In the pre-recoreded interview, Harry and Meghan also met with a group of parents who lost their children to suicide.

Host Jane Pauley said the pair were 'no strangers' to online bullying', with footage showing the couple hugging bereaved parents with Meghan saying she is 'so happy' they came.

Harry also spoke of the 'scariest thing' about social media being 'absolutely anyone' can lose a loved one.

'We always talk about in the olden days, if kids are under your roof, you know what they are up to. At least they're safe.

'But now, they could in the next room, in a tablet or phone, going down these rabbit holes, and within 24 hours they could be taking their life'.

Meghan also discussed their own experience with their children, Archie and Lilbet. She said: 'Our kids are young, they're three and five, they're amazing, but all you want to do as parents is protect them,' the Duchess said.

'And so as we can see what's happening in the online space, we know that there's a lot of work to be done there and we're just happy to be able to be a part of change for good.'

Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle have launched an initiative aimed at tackling child safety online.

Called The Parents' Network, Harry and Meghan have joined a group of parents have come together, to help offer a 'safe and supportive community is available to all parents and caregivers navigating the complex digital world'.

This group includes those who 'have first-hand knowledge of the pain and destruction caused by social media use'.

A description of the network on the Sussexes' Archewell Foundation website says: 'Each of us have been through something no parent should ever have to experience, and our mission is to prevent anyone else from suffering the way we have.

Throughout the interview, Meghan also spoke about her 'amazing' children - Prince Archie, five, and Princess Lilibet, three

'For anyone who has a child affected by social media harms, we are here to support you. Our safe and supportive community is available to all parents and caregivers navigating the complex digital world.'

As part of the campaign, which carries the slogan #NoChildLostToSocialMedia, a video featuring parents who have lost their children to suicide because of online harm has been posted on the Foundation's website.

In addition, a list of three guides has been posted on the site, each tackling a social media platform, including Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok.

The guides are described by the site as being 'repurposed in partnership with The Social Media Victims Law Center'.

Compiled using information from the Center's online social media guides, they include information about what each platform is used for, and how caregivers can 'improve their child's safety' while they are using them.

One of the couples featured in the interview was Donna and Chris Dawley whose heir 17-year old son, C.J., died from suicide after what they believe was depression fuelled by social media use.

They told Jane they believed he had a 'demon in his bedroom'.

'We had no idea what happened to our son,' said Donna. 'You know, he had a beautiful car. He had a job he liked. He was happy kid'.

'Sisters that loved him, parents that adored him,' said Chris added.

He added that he was so addicted to his phone, he died with it still in his hand.

'He still had it in his hand, the phone; that's how addicted he was,' said Donna. 'He couldn't even kill himself without posting about it first,'.

Group facilitator Leora Wolf-Prusan said the important thing about the group is that they will talk to each other.

'We're gonna stop expecting you to be 'done' with your grief in a year,' she told Jane.

'We're gonna stop telling you that we're tired of hearing the stories of internet harm. Like, we will say your kid's name over and over again, because they existed, and they mattered. And that we know that it wasn't your fault. That's it, right? It wasn't your fault. This happened to you. And now we as a community get to create something with you.'

Taj and Selene Swanson-Jensen also joined Harry and Meghan in the interview. Their son, Tanner, died from an overdose of drugs were pushed to him online.

Also in the interview was Brandy and Toney Roberts, whose daughter, Englyn, died by suicide following online bullying.

Perla Mendoza, also spoke to Harry and Meghan. His son Eli, died when a painkiller he bought online was actually a lethal dose of fentanyl.

Members of The Parents' Network are pictured meeting in person for the launch of the new initiative

When asked by Jane why they 'do all this' Taj said: 'Simple answer: So others don't have to live what we've lived, and will continue to live.'

Perla said, 'I don't expect anything from anyone. This is just a labour of love in honour of my son and all the other children that have lost their lives to fentanyl.

'This is for the mother who cannot get out of bed, for the dad that won't leave his house. I stand here for them, too. And I hope that one day, when it's my turn to go home, I'll see my son, and he'll tell me, ""Good job, Mama.'''

Harry and Meghan have raised the issue numerous times since their move to America, and are also due to focus the spotlight on the topic during their official visit to Colombia following an invitation by vice president Francia Marquez.

The Sussexes' trip to the South American nation will be their second official tour of the year after they visited Nigeria in May, taking part in a range of activities over three days.

While details of the couple's itinerary have not been released by the Archewell Foundation, the vice president said they would 'engage in several activities' related to safeguarding young people online and in physical spaces.

When Jane, 73, said “you hope that when your children ask for help, someone is there to give it”, Harry added only “if you know to help”.

He went on: “At this point we’ve got to the stage where almost every parent needs to be a first responder.”

“And even the best first responders in the world wouldn’t be able to tell the signs of possible suicide. That is the terrifying piece of this.”

Meghan added: “You have to start somewhere. Anyone watching this or anyone able to make change needs to look through the lens of, ‘What if this was my son or daughter?’

“Your son or daughter who come home, who are joyful, who I love - and one day, right under my roof, our entire lives change because of something that’s completely out of my control.

“And if you look at it as a parent, there is no way to see it any other way than to try [to] find a solution.”"

Meghan Markle has said that she “would never want someone not to be believed” as she addressed the suicidal thoughts she experienced during her time in the royal family.

The Duchess of Sussex appeared on CBS News Sunday Morning on 4 August with her husband, Prince Harry, to talk about their new project, The Parents Network, which will support parents of children affected by online bullying.

During the interview, journalist Jane Pauley asked Meghan about her experiences of suicidal thoughts, which she first addressed publicly with Oprah Winfrey in 2021. In response, Meghan said that while she “wasn’t expecting” Pauley to bring up that topic, she still “understood why”. The Duchess added that she wants to continue speaking candidly about her mental health.

“When you’ve been through any level of pain or trauma, I believe part of our healing journey, certainly part of mine, is being able to be really open about it. And I haven’t really scraped the surface on my experience. But I do think that I would never want someone else to feel that way,” she said.

“And I would never want someone else to be making those sorts of plans. And I would never want someone else to not be believed. If me voicing what I have overcome will save someone, or encourage someone in their life to really, genuinely check in on them, and not assume that the appearance is good so everything’s okay, then that’s worth it. I’ll take a hit for that.”

During Meghan and Harry’s tell-all interview with Oprah, she tearfully addressed her mental health challenges during her time in the royal family. “I just didn’t want to be alive any more,” she said.

When asked explicitly about suicide and self harm, she responded: “That was a very clear and real and frightening constant thought. And I remember how he [Harry] just cradled me.”

She continued: “I went to the institution, and I said that I needed to go somewhere to get help. I said that I’ve never felt this way before and I need to go somewhere. And I was told that I couldn’t, that it wouldn’t be good for the institution.”

In their 2022 Netflix documentary, Harry & Meghan, the Duke of Sussex spoke openly about his wife’s mental health. Harry recalled how “devastated” he was when he learned that she was struggling with thoughts of suicide.

“I knew that she was struggling. We were both struggling, but I never thought that it would get to that stage. And the fact that it got to that stage, I felt angry and ashamed. I didn’t deal with it particularly well,” Harry said. “I dealt with it as ‘institutional Harry’ as opposed to ‘husband Harry’. And what took over my feelings was my royal role.”

open image in gallery Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, and Prince Harry appear on ‘CBS Sunday Morning’ ( CBS Sunday Morning )

The duke said his response was due to a lifetime of worrying about “what are people going to think”.

He continued: “Looking back on it now, I hate myself for it. What she needed from me was so much more than I was able to give.”

He also criticised his family’s response to Meghan’s mental health challenges, claiming that they “knew how bad it was,” and yet questioned why she couldn’t “just deal with it”.

During the couple’s appearance on CBS, they explained that they want their new project to bring awareness to the dangers of online bullying because they themselves are parents of two young children, Archie and Lilibet.

“Our kids are young; they’re three and five. They’re amazing. But all you want to do as parents is protect them,” Meghan said. “And so, as we can see what’s happening in the online space, we know that there’s a lot of work to be done there, and we’re just happy to be able to be a part of change for good.”

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle launch Parents' Network to address the dangers of online.,https://en.inform.kz/news/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-launch-the-parents-network-project-4e0ccb/,"Harry and Meghan appeared in an interview on CBS to discuss their new initiative, The Parents' Network, which aimed to support parents of children affected by online harm, Kazinform News Agency correspondent reports.

They highlighted the internet's threat to children’s mental wellbeing, with Harry emphasising the need for parents to act as first responders. Meghan expressed concerns for their children, Archie and Lilibet, stressing the importance of online safety.

Reflecting on her past mental health struggles, Meghan revealed she had previously considered taking her own life during a crisis with the Royal Family.

The Duchess of Sussex has said she's glad she spoke out about suicidal thoughts and will ""take a hit"" for it if her words help save the lives of others.

In 2021, Meghan shared her struggles with Oprah Winfrey, admitting, ""I just didn't want to be alive anymore"". She hoped her honesty would encourage others to check in on their loved ones genuinely."

The father-of-two, 39, who has son Archie, five, and three-year-old Lilibet with his wife Meghan, Duchess of Sussex – who celebrated her 43rd birthday on Sunday (04.08.24) – shared his terror over the power of the web on children while launching the Parents Network campaign, which aims to secure child safety online.

He said while opening up on CBS to anchor Jane Pauley about the initiative in a joint interview with Meghan: “We always talk about in the olden days, if kids are under your roof, you know what they are up to. At least they’re safe.

“But now, they could in the next room, in a tablet or phone, going down these rabbit holes, and within 24 hours they could be taking their life.”

Harry and Meghan’s pre-recorded interview, which was shown on Sunday, also showed footage of them meeting with a group of parents who lost their children to suicide.

Meghan also discussed their experience with their children and their desire to shield them from all harm.

She added: “Our kids are young – they’re three and five – they’re amazing, but all you want to do as parents is protect them.

“And so as we can see what’s happening in the online space, we know that there’s a lot of work to be done there and we’re just happy to be able to be a part of change for good.”

When Jane, 73, said “you hope that when your children ask for help, someone is there to give it”, Harry added only “if you know to help”.

He went on: “At this point we’ve got to the stage where almost every parent needs to be a first responder.

“And even the best first responders in the world wouldn’t be able to tell the signs of possible suicide. That is the terrifying piece of this.”

Meghan added: “You have to start somewhere. Anyone watching this or anyone able to make change needs to look through the lens of, ‘What if this was my son or daughter?’

“Your son or daughter who come home who are joyful, who I love, and one day, right under my roof, our entire lives change because of something that’s completely out of my control.

“And if you look at is as a parent, there is no way to see it any other way than to try and find a solution.”"

Speaking to GB News he said: ""I am struggling with a little bit is the amount of abuse that comes from Harry and Meghan supporters online.

""I mean, just tweeting about Harry and Meghan's new initiative this morning, I got a lot of hate from Prince and Princess of Wales fans.

""So I think there are two cult groups that are either very pro-Harry and Meghan or very pro-William and Catherine.

The Duchess of Sussex, who turns 43 today, has launched a campaign alongside her husband Prince Harry, 39, to tackle child safety online.

In an interview for American broadcaster CBS, the royals discussed the launch of the Parents Network with anchor Jane Pauley and hugged and spoke with parents who lost their children to suicide, which in many cases was linked to social media usage, with Harry and Meghan saying they want to be there so they have a place to come for help'.

Meghan first said spoke of her suicidal thoughts while being a working royal in an bombshell interview with Oprah in 2021.

She now says she hopes her candour will help others and will encourage people to check in on their friends.

Harry and Meghan have released a new CBS interview about cyber abuse, with the Duke saying parents have to be 'first responders'

Meghan said that 'opening up' is part of the healing process and she hopes her candour will help others

'I think when you've been through any level of pain or trauma, I believe part of our healing journey, certainly part of mine, is being able to be really open about it,' the duchess said while wearing £12,800 Cartier necklace and £1485 Ralph Lauren coords..

'And I haven't really scraped the surface on my experience but I do think that I would never want someone else to feel that way.

'And I would never want someone else to be making those sorts of plans and I would never want someone else to not be believed.

'So, if me voicing what I have overcome, will save someone or encourage someone in their life to really genuinely check in on them and not assume that the appearance is good so everything's okay, then that's worth it.

'I'll take a hit for that.'

The Duchess of Sussex told Oprah in 2021 she 'couldn't be left alone' and told her husband she 'didn't want to be alive anymore' before claiming the Buckingham Palace HR department ignored her plea for help because she wasn't a 'paid employee'.

'I was really ashamed to say it at the time, and ashamed to have to admit it to Harry especially, because I know how much loss he suffered. But I knew that if I didn't say it, that I would do it … and I just didn't want to be alive anymore,'.

Describing how she considered ending her life believing it 'was better for everyone', Meghan said: 'I knew that if I didn't say it, that I would do it. I just didn't want to be alive anymore. And that was a very clear and real and frightening constant thought. I remember how he just cradled me.

'I said that I needed to go somewhere to get help. I said that 'I've never felt this way before, and I need to go somewhere'. And I was told that I couldn't, that it wouldn't be good for the institution'.

The video also featured a clip of Meghan hugging bereaved parents

She said that after confiding in her husband, she was forced to go to the Royal Albert Hall for a charity event in January 2019, claiming photos from that night 'haunt me'.

She told Oprah she later reached out to one of the best friends of Diana, Princess of Wales, because she felt unsupported by the palace.

She said: 'When I joined that family, that was the last time I saw my passport, my driving licence, my keys - all of that gets turned over'. Meghan said Harry had 'saved my life' by agreeing to move to Los Angeles.

In today's pre-recoreded interview, Harry and Meghan also met with a group of parents who lost their children to suicide.

Host Jane Pauley said the pair were 'no strangers' to online bullying', with footage showing the couple hugging bereaved parents with Meghan saying she is 'so happy' they came.

Harry also spoke of the 'scariest thing' about social media being 'absolutely anyone' can lose a loved one.

'We always talk about in the olden days, if kids are under your roof, you know what they are up to. At least they're safe.

'But now, they could in the next room, in a tablet or phone, going down these rabbit holes, and within 24 hours they could be taking their life'.

'And so as we can see what's happening in the online space, we know that there's a lot of work to be done there and we're just happy to be able to be a part of change for good.'

When the broadcaster adds 'you hope that when your children ask for help, someone is there to give it' the Duke adds only 'if you know to help.'

'At this point we've got to the stage where almost every parent needs to be a first responder,' he said. 'And even the best first responders in the world wouldn't be able to tell the signs of possible suicide. That is the terrifying piece of this.'

Responding to host Jane Pauley saying it was a 'modest beginning, Meghan added: 'You have to start somewhere. Anyone watching this or anyone able to make change needs to look through the lens of 'what if this was my son or daughter?'.

'Your son or daughter who comes home who are joyful, who I love, and one day, right under my roof, our entire lives change because of something that's completely out of my control. And if you look at is as a parent, there is no way to see it any other way than to try and find a solution'.

Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle have launched an initiative aimed at tackling child safety online.

The interview comes as part of a new campaign the couple have launches with their Archwell foundation.

Called The Parents' Network, Harry and Meghan have joined a group of parents have come together, to help offer a 'safe and supportive community is available to all parents and caregivers navigating the complex digital world'.

This group includes those who 'have first-hand knowledge of the pain and destruction caused by social media use'.

A description of the network on the Sussexes' Archewell Foundation website says: 'Each of us have been through something no parent should ever have to experience, and our mission is to prevent anyone else from suffering the way we have.

Throughout the interview, Meghan also spoke about her 'amazing' children - Prince Archie, five, and Princess Lilibet, three

'For anyone who has a child affected by social media harms, we are here to support you. Our safe and supportive community is available to all parents and caregivers navigating the complex digital world.'

As part of the campaign, which carries the slogan #NoChildLostToSocialMedia, a video featuring parents who have lost their children to suicide because of online harm has been posted on the Foundation's website.

In addition, a list of three guides has been posted on the site, each tackling a social media platform, including Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok.

The guides are described by the site as being 'repurposed in partnership with The Social Media Victims Law Center'.

Compiled using information from the Center's online social media guides, they include information about what each platform is used for, and how caregivers can 'improve their child's safety' while they are using them.

One of the couples featured in the interview was Donna and Chris Dawley whose heir 17-year old son, C.J., died from suicide after what they believe was depression fuelled by social media use.

They told Jane they believed he had a 'demon in his bedroom'.

'We had no idea what happened to our son,' said Donna. 'You know, he had a beautiful car. He had a job he liked. He was happy kid'.

'Sisters that loved him, parents that adored him,' said Chris added.

He added that he was so addicted to his phone, he died with it still in his hand.

'He still had it in his hand, the phone; that's how addicted he was,' said Donna. 'He couldn't even kill himself without posting about it first,'.

Group facilitator Leora Wolf-Prusan said the important thing about the group is that they will talk to each other.

'We're gonna stop expecting you to be 'done' with your grief in a year,' she told Jane.

'We're gonna stop telling you that we're tired of hearing the stories of internet harm. Like, we will say your kid's name over and over again, because they existed, and they mattered. And that we know that it wasn't your fault. That's it, right? It wasn't your fault. This happened to you. And now we as a community get to create something with you.'

Taj and Selene Swanson-Jensen also joined Harry and Meghan in the interview.

Their son, Tanner, died from an overdose of drugs were pushed to him online.

Also in the interview was Brandy and Toney Roberts, who daughter, Englyn, died by suicide following online bullying.

Perla Mendoza, also spoke to Harry and Meghan. His son Eli, died when a painkiller he bought online was actually a lethal dose of fentanyl.

Harry and Meghan were shown embracing parents from The Parents' Network as they met in person for its launch

When asked by Jane why they 'do all this' Taj said: 'Simple answer: So others don't have to live what we've lived, and will continue to live.'

Perla said, 'I don't expect anything from anyone. This is just a labour of love in honour of my son and all the other children that have lost their lives to fentanyl. This is for the mother who cannot get out of bed, for the dad that won't leave his house. I stand here for them, too. And I hope that one day, when it's my turn to go home, I'll see my son, and he'll tell me, ""Good job, Mama.''

Harry and Meghan have raised the issue numerous times since their move to America, and are also due to focus the spotlight on the topic during their official visit to Colombia following an invitation by vice president Francia Marquez.

The Sussexes' trip to the South American nation will be their second official tour of the year after they visited Nigeria in May, taking part in a range of activities over three days.

While details of the couple's itinerary have not been released by the Archewell Foundation, the vice president said they would 'engage in several activities' related to safeguarding young people online and in physical spaces.

Meghan opted for a £12,800 Cartier necklace and £1485 Ralph Lauren coords in the interview.

She previously sported the yellow gold choker with 57 diamonds to the Invictus Games Opening Ceremony.

Adding more American brands, Meghan looked summery in matching Ralph Lauren coords.

The Duchess paired the £570 Adrien relaxed fit broadcloth shirt in mauve with the brand's £915 evanne Trouser in the same colour.

Opting for her signature natural look, Meghan wore her hair in loose waves and highlighted her beauty with a light layer of make-up.

The mother-of-two fluffed up her eyebrows with a dark pencil while adding highlighter and a creamy foundation to her skin.

A deep pink creamy lip finished off the look while black eyeliner and mascara highlighted her eyes.

The No Child Lost to Social Media campaign was set up after a two-year pilot programme with families whose children had felt the harmful effects of social media.

Prince Harry said the grief these families had suffered could happen to anyone. “We always talk about in the olden days if your kids were under your roof, you knew what they were up to. At least they were safe, right? And now, they could be in the next-door room on a tablet or on a phone and can be going down these rabbit holes.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle launch Parents' Network to address the dangers of online.,https://marketresearchtelecast.com/harry-and-meghan-launch-initiative-to-combat-online-harm-dangers/,"On a sunny day near Santa Barbara last week, a group of friends gathered to meet with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. This gathering was part of an exclusive and heart-wrenching club—comprising parents who have lost children, either directly or indirectly, due to exposure to social media.

Harry and Meghan are offering these parents a new avenue for support called The Parents’ Network. This initiative, part of their charitable Archewell Foundation, officially launches today.

Meghan Markle has personal experience with online bullying, and her husband Harry is no stranger to grief.

Pauley asked, “The central topic is the loss that these families have suffered, stories that need to be shared. Parents who haven’t suffered a loss think it couldn’t happen to them. But it could.”

“It certainly could,” Harry responded. “One of the scariest things we’ve learned over the course of the last 16, 17 years that social media’s been around is the fact that it could happen to anyone. We always talk about in the olden days if your kids were under your roof, you knew what they were up to; at least they were safe, right? Now, they could be in the next room on a tablet or a phone and can go down these rabbit holes. Within 24 hours, they might be contemplating taking their life.”

Meghan added, “Our kids are young; they’re three and five. They’re amazing. All you want to do as parents is protect them. As we see what’s happening in the online space, we know there’s a lot of work to be done, and we’re happy to be part of change for good.”

“Well, you hope that when your children ask for help, someone, you know, is there to give it,” said Pauley.

“If you know how to help, right?” Harry interjected. “We’ve got to the stage where almost every parent needs to be a first responder. And even the best first responders wouldn’t be able to tell the signs of possible suicide. That’s the terrifying piece.”

For parents like Donna and Chris Dawley, their 17-year-old son, C.J., died from suicide, which they believe was fueled by social media-induced depression.

“We had no idea what happened to our son,” Donna said. “He had a beautiful car. He had a job he liked.”

“Sisters that loved him, parents that adored him,” Chris added.

“And he was happy,” said Donna. “He was a happy kid.”

Addiction to his smartphone, a device designed to be so addictive, prevented C.J. from putting it down, not even in the minutes before he died. “He couldn’t even kill himself without posting about it first,” Donna said.

Parents often fail to recognize signs that someone is spiraling into despair. Meghan herself admitted to Oprah Winfrey in 2021, “I was really ashamed to say it at the time and ashamed to admit it to Harry, especially because I know how much loss he suffered. But I knew that if I didn’t say it, that I would do it … and I didn’t want to be alive anymore.”

Pauley approached the topic gently: “You had an experience that connects you to these families. The connection you have with people is they know you had suffered, too. Contemplating killing yourself is what suicidal ideation is. I’m dancing around this because I can see you’re uncomfortable with my even going there…”

“I understand why you are though – I wasn’t expecting it, but I understand why,” Meghan replied. “When you’ve been through any level of pain or trauma, part of our healing journey is being really open about it. I haven’t really scraped the surface of my experience, but I believe voicing what I have overcome might save someone. I’ll take a hit for that.”

This gathering was for the launch; the Parents’ Network will primarily meet online. Group facilitator Leora Wolf-Prusan pointed out that the key topic is lasting impact: “We’re going to stop expecting you to be ‘done’ with your grief in a year. We’ll say your kid’s name over and over again, ’cause they existed and they mattered. It wasn’t your fault. This happened to you. Now we, as a community, get to create something with you.”

Among the group’s charter members are Taj and Selene Swanson-Jensen, whose son Tanner died from an online drug overdose; Brandy and Toney Roberts, whose daughter Englyn committed suicide after online bullying; and Perla Mendoza, whose son Eli died from a fentanyl overdose.

Pauley asked, “Why would you do this?”

Taj replied, “Simple answer: So others don’t have to live what we’ve lived, and will continue to live.”

Perla added, “This is just a labor of love in honor of my son and all other children who lost their lives to fentanyl. This is for the mother who cannot get out of bed, for the dad that won’t leave his house. I stand here for them, too. And I hope that one day, I’ll see my son, and he’ll tell me, ‘Good job, Mama.'”

The idea is that there is comfort and power in numbers, with the goal of turning pain into purpose.

Meghan said, “You have to start somewhere. The simplest thing is to look at it through the lens of, ‘What if it was my daughter or son?’ If you look at it as a parent, there’s no way to see it other than to try to find a solution.”

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle launch Parents' Network to address the dangers of online.,https://www.celebritykind.com/celebrity-kindness/harry-meghan-launch-the-parents-network-to-support-families-whove-lost-a-child-through-social-media-use/,"Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Messenger Email

Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have launched an initiative to support families who’ve lost a child through social media use. It’s called The Parents’ Network.

Announced on Meghan’s 43rd birthday, the network gives bereaved parents a space to speak openly about their loss, and discuss ways of combatting cyberbullying, sexual exploitation, depression and more to create a better online space. It was started through the couple’s Archewell Foundation after they spent time with families impacted by online harm and subsequently helped amplify their voices at a summit on “Mental Wellness During the Digital Age” in October last year.

Speaking to CBS Sunday Morning’s Jane Pauley, Prince Harry explained that no one is immune from online bullying:

“That’s one of the scariest things that we’ve learnt over the course of the last 16,17 years that social media’s been around, and more so recently, is the fact that it could happen to absolutely anybody….We always talk about in the olden days, if your kids were under your roof, you knew what they were up to. At least they were safe, right? And now, they could be in the next-door room on a tablet or on a phone and can be going down these rabbit holes. And before you know it, within 24 hours, they could be taking their life.”

He added that the situation is so dire, “every parent needs to be a first responder” which is an unfair burden given that “even the best first responders in the world wouldn’t be able to tell the signs of possible suicide. That is the terrifying piece of this.”

During the interview, Meghan was asked about her own connection to online bullying and suicidal thoughts (which she first shared with Oprah Winfrey in 2021). She said that she hopes by speaking out she might help others:

“When you’ve been through any level of pain or trauma, I believe part of our healing journey, certainly part of mine, is being able to be really open about it. I really scraped the surface on my experience, but I do think that I would never want someone else to feel that way. And I would never want someone else to be making those sort of plans and I would never want someone else to not be believed.”

She continued, “So, if me voicing what I have overcome will save someone, or encourage someone in their life to really genuinely check in on them and not assume that the appearance is good, so everything’s okay, then that’s worth it. I’ll take a hit for that.”

The network is currently available to parents in the US, Canada and UK. For parents in other countries, the Archewell Foundation has shared a set of resources including Parent Guides to various social media sites including Snapchat and TikTok, as well as mental health support.

One TPN parent who lost her teenage son to a fentanyl overdose after he purchased it online says she hopes the network will help others: “This is just a labour of love in honour of my son and all the other children who have lost their lives to fentanyl, for the mother who cannot get out of bed, for the dad that won’t leave his house. I stand here for them too. I hope that one day when it’s my turn to go home, I will see my son and he’ll tell me ‘good job, mum.'”

On their website, the Archewell Foundation says, “As it exists currently, platforms and online spaces put our children at risk. We understand that the desire for connection is rooted in our collective humanity. That is why these platforms should be a destination where young people can communicate, thrive and learn. Instead, online spaces are designed to keep our children scrolling and waiting for the next notification, like or comment. Without safety standards in place, platforms are serving inappropriate and dangerous content, leaving the door wide open for abuse, cyberbullying and the spread of harmful material.”

Part of Harry & Meghan’s initiative is to get people talking about the issue online using the hashtag #NoChildLostToSocialMedia.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle launch Parents' Network to address the dangers of online.,https://tdpelmedia.com/meghan-markle-offers-comforting-hugs-to-grieving-parents-in-santa-barbara-while-launching-new-anti-bullying-initiative-with-prince-harry/,"When Meghan Markle met with parents whose children had been victims of online bullying, she didn’t just offer words of comfort—she embraced them with a warm hug, breaking away from the traditional royal formalities. Accompanied by Prince Harry, Meghan took to Santa Barbara to support these grieving families as part of their new initiative, The Parents Network, under the Archewell Foundation.

In a recent interview with CBS, the couple discussed the launch of this initiative with anchor Jane Pauley. The segment highlighted the Sussexes’ willingness to connect with people on a personal level, with Pauley noting, “Harry and Meghan are definitely big huggers.” This simple act of human connection is not something often associated with the royal family, making it all the more significant.

A Hugger at Heart: Meghan’s Warm Approach

Meghan, who describes herself as a “hugger,” has always preferred a more personal and informal approach, even though it sometimes clashes with royal expectations. In the 2020 Netflix docuseries Harry & Meghan, she recalled how her casual demeanor, including her penchant for hugs, was surprising to some members of the royal family. Meghan reflected on her first meeting with the Prince and Princess of Wales, where she was in ripped jeans and barefoot. She didn’t realize that her warmth might be seen as jarring by those accustomed to a more formal way of life.

Despite this, Meghan has continued to embrace her natural approach, even during public appearances like the Invictus Games, where she was photographed hugging participants. Her recent tour of Nigeria with Prince Harry also demonstrated this, as she warmly interacted with the people who came out to meet her, thanking them for their hospitality.

Tackling Online Bullying: The Launch of The Parents Network

The Parents Network is a new branch of the Archewell Foundation, aimed at supporting parents whose children have been affected by online bullying. During the CBS interview, Meghan and Harry met with parents who had lost their children to suicide, many cases linked to social media use. Meghan, who has been open about her own struggles with mental health, expressed her hope that by sharing her story, she could help others.

In the interview, Meghan reflected on her own experiences and the importance of being open about pain and trauma. She shared that she has only “scraped the surface” of discussing the suicidal thoughts she had while a working member of the royal family. By being candid about her struggles, she hopes to encourage others to check in on their loved ones and not assume that everything is okay just because it appears so on the outside.

A Personal Mission: Meghan and Harry’s Commitment to Change

The Parents Network is not just a professional project for Meghan and Harry—it’s deeply personal. The couple, who are parents to young children themselves, Archie and Lilibet, are keenly aware of the dangers that the digital world can pose. They are committed to making a change, not just for their own children, but for all families navigating the complexities of the online space.

The Archewell Foundation’s website describes The Parents Network as a safe and supportive community for parents and caregivers dealing with the impact of social media. The initiative includes resources like guides for Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok, repurposed in partnership with The Social Media Victims Law Center. These guides aim to help caregivers improve their children’s safety online.

Moving Forward: Meghan and Harry’s Global Advocacy

Meghan and Harry have consistently raised awareness about the dangers of social media since their move to the United States. Their commitment to this cause extends beyond their foundation, with plans to continue their advocacy on a global scale. They are set to visit Colombia following an invitation from Vice President Francia Marquez, where they will focus on safeguarding young people both online and in physical spaces.

The couple’s recent visit to Nigeria and their upcoming trip to Colombia highlight their ongoing dedication to this issue. Through their work, Meghan and Harry are using their platform to create positive change, offering support to those who need it most and striving to prevent future tragedies.

For those in need of support, resources like the Samaritans in the UK and the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline in the US are available to provide help. Meghan and Harry’s work with The Parents Network serves as a reminder that no one has to face these challenges alone.
