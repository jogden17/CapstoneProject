Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her.,https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-hasina-student-protest-quota-violence-fdc7f2632c3d8fcbd913e6c0a1903fd4,"DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Bangladesh’s prime minister resigned and fled the country Monday after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s departure threatens to create even more instability in the densely populated nation on India’s border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment to corruption to climate change. Amid security concerns, the main airport in Dhaka, the capital, suspended operations.

Violence just before and after her resignation left at least 41 people dead and about 200 others injured, according to media reports, which could not be independently confirmed. More than a dozen were reportedly killed when protesters set fire to a hotel owned by a leader in Hasina’s party in the southwestern town of Jashore.

The military chief, Gen. Waker-uz-Zamam said he was temporarily taking control of the country, and soldiers tried to stem the growing unrest. Mohammed Shahabuddin, the country’s figurehead president, announced late Monday after meeting with Waker-uz-Zamam and opposition politicians that Parliament would be dissolved and a national government would be formed as soon as possible, leading to fresh elections.

Speaking after the embattled leader was seen in television footage boarding a military helicopter with her sister, Waker-uz-Zaman sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored. Experts, though, warned the road ahead would be long.

Hundreds of thousands of people poured into the streets waving flags and cheering to celebrate Hasina’s resignation. But some celebrations soon turned violent, with protesters attacking symbols of her government and party, ransacking and setting fires in several buildings.

“This is not just the end of the tyrant Sheikh Hasina, with this we put an end to the mafia state that she has created,” declared Sairaj Salekin, a student protester, on the streets of Dhaka.

Protests began peacefully last month as frustrated students demanded an end to a quota system for government jobs that they said favored those with connections to the prime minister’s Awami League party. But amid a deadly crackdown, the demonstrations morphed into an unprecedented challenge to Hasina, highlighting the extent of economic distress in Bangladesh, where exports have fallen and foreign exchange reserves are running low.

Waker-uz-Zaman promised that the military would launch an investigation into a crackdown that had left nearly 300 people dead since mid-July, some of the country’s worst bloodshed since the 1971 war of independence, and which had fueled outrage against the government. Nearly 100 people, including 14 policemen, were killed Sunday, according to the country’s leading Bengali-language daily newspaper, Prothom Alo. At least 11,000 people have been arrested in recent weeks.

“Keep faith in the military. We will investigate all the killings and punish the responsible,” he said.

The military wields significant political influence in Bangladesh, which has faced more than 20 coups or coup attempts since independence in 1971. But it was not clear if Hasina’s resignation or the military chief’s calls for calm would be enough to end the turmoil.

Nahid Islam, a top student coordinator, told reporters late Monday that the movement would propose an outline for the new interim government — and they would not accept any other solution.

Throughout the day, people continued to pour into and out of Hasina’s official residence, where they set fires, carried out furniture and pulled raw fish from the refrigerators. They also massed outside the parliament building, where a banner reading “justice” was hung.

Crowds also ransacked Hasina’s family’s ancestral home-turned-museum where her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman — the country’s first president and independence leader — was assassinated. They torched major offices of the ruling party and the country’s two leading, pro-government TV stations — both of which were forced to go off air.

Elsewhere, protests were peaceful, and thousands gathered Monday evening outside the presidential palace, where the military chief, opposition politicians and the country’s figurehead president met.

Hasina, meanwhile, landed in a city in India on the border with Bangladesh, according to a military official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information to the media. It was not clear where she would go next.

The 76-year-old was elected for a fourth consecutive term in a January vote that was boycotted by her main opponents. Thousands of opposition members were jailed in the lead-up to the polls, and the U.S. and the U.K. denounced the result as not credible, though the government defended it.

Hasina had cultivated ties with powerful countries, including both India and China. But under her, relations with United States and other Western nations have come under strain, as they have expressed concerns over human rights violations and press freedoms in the predominantly Muslim nation of 170 million people.

Her political opponents have previously accused her of growing increasingly autocratic and have blamed the unrest on that authoritarian streak. In total, she served more than 20 years, longer than any other female head of government.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged a peaceful transition, according to a statement from U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq, calling for “a full, independent, impartial and transparent investigation into all acts of violence.”

U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller, speaking to reporters in Washington, welcomed the announcement that an interim government would be formed and called for “calm and restraint in the days ahead.”

Ali Riaz, an expert on Bangladeshi politics who teaches political science at Illinois State University, said the country now faces an immense political challenge, as politicians and the military will struggle to restore calm while satisfying various camps and reining in attempts to settle scores.

“So the challenges on the process going forward are daunting,” he said, adding that observers will be watching to ensure that the military’s role stays that of mediator, given the history of army takeovers.

Protests continued even after the Supreme Court last month ruled that the quota system — which set aside up to 30% of government jobs for family members of veterans who fought in Bangladesh’s war of independence against Pakistan — must be drastically cut.

The debate has highlighted the fact that there’s a lack of quality jobs for college graduates, who increasingly seek the more stable and lucrative government jobs. But there aren’t enough to go around — each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam.

The unrest has resulted in the closure of schools and universities across the country, and authorities at one point imposed a shoot-on-sight curfew. Fears also rose among Hindus that they might be targeted in the unrest since they are generally thought to be supporters of Hasina’s party.

Authorities also shut off mobile internet on Sunday, and broadband internet was cut briefly Monday but services were restored later in the day.

Hasina’s son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, told the BBC that he doubted his mother would make a political comeback, as she has in the past, saying she was “so disappointed after all her hard work.”

Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her.,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/5/world-reacts-to-bangladesh-pm-sheikh-hasinas-removal-from-power,"Reactions as Hasina is forced to resign and flee the country after weeks of deadly unrest in the country.

Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has resigned and fled the country after weeks of protests against her government in which hundreds of people were killed.

Hasina, 76, quit on Monday after last month’s student-led protests against a quota system for government jobs turned into a popular call for her sacking – the worst political crisis to hit during her 15-year rule.

As tens of thousands of people surrounded government offices and residences in the capital Dhaka, Hasina fled in an army helicopter with her sister. She has landed in New Delhi, according to Indian media reports.

In an address to the nation, Bangladesh’s army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman announced that an interim government will now run the country of 170 million people, without providing details.

Here are some global reactions to Hasina’s ouster and the unrest in the country:

Tarique Rahman, acting chairman of main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party

Rahman, who lives in exile in the United Kingdom, said on X that “Hasina’s resignation proves the power of the people.”

“Together, let’s rebuild Bangladesh into a democratic and developed nation, where the rights and freedoms of all people are protected,” he urged.

British PM’s office

In a statement, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s spokesperson said his office is concerned by the violence and the “significant loss of life, including of students, children and law enforcement officers”, saying it was “completely unacceptable”.

“The right to peaceful protest must be protected and never subject to violence and we call on the authorities to release all peaceful protesters and ensure due process is followed for those charged and prosecuted,” Starmer’s spokesperson added.

Bangladeshi diaspora in UK

In Whitechapel, a London neighbourhood home to a large Bangladeshi community, many took to the streets to celebrate.

Waving their national flag and honking car horns, they chanted: “Bangladesh! Bangladesh!”

“Bangladesh has achieved its second independence now,” said Abu Sayem, 50. “We actually got our independence first in 1971, but autocrat Sheikh Hasina was ruling the country forcibly. She has snatched away our rights. She has killed thousands of children.”

Cab driver Ishtiaque Choudhury said: “It is a relief for us and I’m happy for my nation.”

Germany

A German foreign ministry spokesperson said it is “important that Bangladesh continue on its democratic path” amid the unrest in the country.

European Union

The European Union has called for an “orderly and peaceful” transition to democratic rule in Bangladesh.

“The EU calls for calm and restraint. It is vital that an orderly and peaceful transition towards a democratically elected government is ensured, in full respect of human rights and democratic principles,” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said.

United States

The United States has commended Bangladesh’s army for its “restraint”.

A State Department spokesperson said Washington welcomed the announcement that an interim government will be formed.

The White House has also called for respecting democratic rights in Bangladesh. “We urge that the interim government formation be democratic and inclusive. We commend the Army for the restraint they have showed today,” a White House spokesperson added.

US Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer said on X that PM Hasina’s violent reaction to legitimate protests made her continued rule untenable.

“I applaud the brave protestors & demand justice for those killed. It’s critical to establish a balanced interim government that respects the rights of all & sets up democratic elections swiftly,” Schumer said.

United Nations

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged calm in Bangladesh after the resignation and departure of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, and highlighted the need for a “peaceful, orderly and democratic transition,” his spokesman said.

Guterres “stands in full solidarity with the people of Bangladesh and calls for the full respect of their human rights,” said spokesperson Farhan Haq.

“He continues to underscore the need for a full, independent, impartial and transparent investigation into all acts of violence.”

Irene Khan, the United Nations special rapporteur on freedom of expression and opinion, says the army, which has formed an interim government after Hasina fled, has a “very tough job ahead”.

“We are all hoping that the transition would be peaceful and that there will be accountability for all the human rights violations that have taken place recently, including the killing of about 300 people in the last three weeks,” Khan told Al Jazeera.

“Bangladesh has, of course, an enormous task ahead. It is not the poster child of sustainable development anymore. The previous government had driven this country into despair, and there would be a lot of hard work to do to build it up, but most of all, I think it’s extremely important that the army respect human rights.”

Amnesty International

Amnesty’s South Asia researcher Taqbir Huda has told Democracy Now that while Hasina has resigned, much of the violence “could have been avoided” if her government was more responsive to the students’ demands.

He noted that the military has taken over and cautioned: “Given Bangladesh’s history with military dictatorships … it is really important to stress that this must be a time-bound measure until … governance can be reissued.”

India

While Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has not yet commented on Hasina’s resignation, it issued a “high alert” along its 4,096km (2,545-mile) border with Bangladesh.

Modi’s government was reported to have close ties with the Hasina-led Awami League government.

Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka’s foreign minister Ali Sabry said in a statement on X: “We believe in the resilience and unity of the Bangladeshi nation and hope for a swift return to peace and stability.”

“May the people of Bangladesh find the strength to overcome these challenges and emerge even stronger,” he added.

Russia

Russia’s foreign ministry said in a statement that “Moscow … hopes for a speedy return of internal political processes to constitutional norms in a country friendly to us.”"

WASHINGTON (AP) — A judge has ruled that Google’s ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. It's a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world’s best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country’s biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. Mehta reviewed reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year’s 10-week trial. He issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.

Tropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia and the Carolinas

HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with torrential rain, high winds and flooding, contributing to at least five deaths as it turned menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard’s low-lying regions and threatened to flood some of America’s most historic Southern cities. Sarasota Police Department officials say about 500 residents were rescued from flooded homes. Record-setting rain was next expected to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Historic cities including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, are gearing up for potential high water. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 50 mph.

Ex-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped

PHOENIX (AP) — Former President Donald Trump’s campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case. The state attorney general’s office announced the agreement Monday. Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting. She pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.

Japan's share benchmark soars nearly 11% a day after massive sell-offs that shook Wall Street

NEW YORK (AP) — Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index has soared more than 10% a day after it set markets tumbling in Europe and on Wall Street, while other world markets appeared to have settled after the rollercoaster ride that started the week. The Japanese index fell back after its biggest early advance, gaining 8.7% by midmorning. On Monday, nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as world markets quaked under fears the U.S. economy is slowing too much. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed the Nikkei's 12.4% plunge, its worst since 1987.

Venezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Venezuela’s top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition’s presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab’s statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo “falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council"" and they openly incited “police and military officials to disobey the laws.”

Rally dates are set. Venues are chosen. The only thing missing for Harris' blitz is her VP choice

WASHINGTON (AP) — The dates are set. The venues are chosen. The only thing missing from this week’s campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there’s not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.

Kamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee

WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris’ coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official. That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden’s disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.

Proxy forces armed by Iran could take part in retaliation against Israel over Hamas leader's killing

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — As Iran threatens to respond to the suspected Israeli assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, the regional militias that the Islamic Republic has armed for decades could play a role in any attack. They include Lebanon's Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels of Yemen, Shiite militias in Iraq and others. Those relationships are managed by Iran’s powerful paramilitary organization, the Revolutionary Guard. Iran relies on those proxy forces as international sanctions on Tehran, including over its nuclear program, have kept it from receiving advanced weaponry. While developing its own missile program, Iran also relies on militias as an asymmetric threat to squeeze Israel and the United States.

Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India’s border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country’s military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.

PHOENIX (AP) — Former President Donald Trump’s campaign attorney Jenna Ellis, who worked closely with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case, the state attorney general’s office announced Monday.

Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people charged in the case have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges — including Giuliani, Trump presidential chief of staff Mark Meadows and 11 Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring Trump had won Arizona.

“Her insights are invaluable and will greatly aid the State in proving its case in court,” Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a statement. “As I stated when the initial charges were announced, I will not allow American democracy to be undermined — it is far too important. Today’s announcement is a win for the rule of law.”

Eleven people who had been nominated to be Arizona’s Republican electors had met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were “duly elected and qualified” electors and claimed Trump had carried the state in the 2020 election. President Joe Biden won Arizona by 10,457 votes.

A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.

Last year, Ellis was charged in Georgia after she appeared with Giuliani at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers at the Georgia Capitol during which false allegations of election fraud were made. She had pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings. The cooperation agreement signed by Ellis in the Arizona case requires her to provide truthful information to the Attorney General’s Office and testify honestly in proceedings in any state or federal court. Prosecutors can withdraw from the deal and refile charges if Ellis violates the agreement.

Prosecutors have already asked a court to dismiss the Arizona charges against Ellis. It wasn’t immediately clear if a judge had yet approved the request.

The Associated Press left messages with Ellis’ attorney, Matthew Brown, after the agreement was announced Monday. Mel McDonald, a retired lawyer and former Arizona U.S. Attorney and judge in metro Phoenix, said cooperation agreements like the one signed by Ellis are common in Arizona state courts and are typically given to insiders who can explain how a crime unfolded.

“You need someone who is part of it to fill in the blanks,” said McDonald, who isn’t involved in the Arizona case.

While not a fake elector in Arizona, prosecutors say Ellis made false claims of widespread election fraud in the state and six others, encouraged the Arizona Legislature to change the outcome of the election and encouraged then-Vice President Mike Pence to accept Arizona’s fake elector votes.

The indictment said Ellis, Giuliani and other associates were at a meeting at the Arizona Legislature on Dec. 1, 2020, with then-House Speaker Rusty Bowers and other Republicans when Giuliani and his team asked the speaker to hold a committee hearing on the election.

When Bowers asked for proof of election fraud, Giuliani said he had proof but Ellis had advised that it was left back at a hotel room, the indictment said. No proof was provided to Bowers.

Ellis also is barred from practicing law in Colorado for three years after her guilty plea in Georgia.

Prosecutors in Michigan, Nevada, Georgia and Wisconsin have also filed criminal charges related to the fake electors scheme.

Arizona authorities unveiled the felony charges in late April. Overall, charges were brought against 11 Republicans who submitted the document falsely declaring Trump had won Arizona, five lawyers connected to the former president and two former Trump aides.

Trump himself was not charged in the Arizona case but was referred to as an unindicted co-conspirator in the indictment.

Several U.S. personnel were injured in a suspected rocket attack at Al Asad air base.,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/05/politics/personnel-injured-iraq-al-asad-airbase/index.html,"CNN —

Several US personnel were injured in a suspected rocket attack Monday against US and coalition forces at Al-Asad Airbase in Iraq, a US defense official said.

“We can confirm that there was a suspected rocket attack today against US and Coalition forces at Al-Asad Airbase, Iraq,” the official said. “Initial indications are that several US personnel were injured. Base personnel are conducting a post-attack damage assessment.”

The attack comes amid extremely high tensions in the Middle East, as the US has been bracing for Iranian retaliation against Israel over the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week. Israel has not commented on the killing of Haniyeh. Hezbollah in Lebanon has also vowed retaliation on Israel after the assassination of one of its top commanders in Beirut less than a day before Haniyeh’s killing.

It also comes just days after Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered additional military assets to the region, sending a carrier strike group, a fighter squadron and additional warships to the Middle East.

While it’s unclear who carried out the rocket attack on Monday, US officials have long blamed attacks on troops in Iraq and Syria on Iran-backed militia groups.

Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said last month after a drone attack on Al-Asad that it was “most likely” carried out by Iranian-supported groups.

“We know that these are IRGC-backed militias that have launched these attacks on US forces in the past. Most likely than not, it is one of those affiliate groups,” Singh said on July 18.

Between October 17 and January 29, there were more than 150 attacks on US personnel in Iraq and Syria. Those attacks slowed after three American troops were killed in a drone attack on a small US outpost in Jordan, resulting in a significant US response that hit 85 targets at seven different locations.

“The United States does not seek conflict in the Middle East or anywhere else in the world,” Biden said at the time. “But let all those who might seek to do us harm know this: If you harm an American, we will respond.”"

The Israel-Gaza war has gone on for months, and tensions have spilled into the surrounding Middle East region.

The war: On Oct. 7, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel that included the taking of civilian hostages at a music festival. See photos and videos of how the deadly assault unfolded. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel’s creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century’s most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including President Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations’ cease-fire resolutions.

History: The roots of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and mistrust are deep and complex, predating the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948. Read more on the history of the Gaza Strip."

They have not yet said who was behind the attack.

Officials told the BBC’s partner CBS News that the Al Asad airbase in western Iraq was attacked and that they are still assessing the damage.

The attack comes as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Middle East was at a critical moment following the killings of senior leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah.

Several US personnel have been injured after a suspected rocket attack on an American military base in Iraq, US officials have said.

Security sources told CBS that two Katyusha rockets were fired at the base, and that one had fallen inside the base.

“We can confirm that there was a suspected rocket attack today against US and Coalition forces at Al Asad Airbase, Iraq,” said a Department of Defence spokesperson.

“Initial indications are that several US personnel were injured. Base personnel are conducting a post-attack damage assessment,” the spokesperson added.

It is unclear how many US personnel were injured. A senior US military official said no critical injuries, such as a loss of limbs, have been reported at this time, and no service members were killed.

President Joe Biden was briefed on the suspected attack, a White House official said.

In a statement on X, Mr Biden said he and vice-president Kamala Harris were briefed in the Situation Room on ""developments on the Middle East.""

""We received updates on threats posed by Iran and its proxies, diplomatic efforts to de-escalate regional tensions, and preparations to support Israel should it be attacked again,"" the president said.

""We also discussed the steps we are taking to defend our forces and respond to any attack against our personnel in a manner and place of our choosing.""

The attack comes after the US carried out a strike in Iraq last week that was described as an act of self-defence against militants who officials said were preparing to launch drones against US and coalition forces in the region.

Tensions have been escalating following the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran last Wednesday by a blast at his guesthouse.

Iran’s revolutionary guard (IRGC) has accused Israel of killing Haniyeh and said it was supported by the US. Israel has not commented on Haniyeh's death.

Also last week, Israel said it killed a top Hezbollah commander in an air strike on a southern suburb of Beirut, Lebanon’s capital.

Both Iran and Hezbollah have threatened to retaliate against Israel for the killings.

The Al Asad base was attacked in January this year by Iranian-backed militias, who launched ballistic missiles and rockets - most of which were intercepted, US Central Command said at the time.

A number of US personnel were assessed for traumatic brain injuries after the attack, while at least one Iraqi service member was wounded.

The airbase has been used by the US since 2004, following the invasion of Iraq, and has been visited by former US presidents George W Bush and later Donald Trump."

U.S. personnel in Iraq injured in rocket attack

Several U.S. personnel appear to have been injured in a suspected rocket attack against U.S. and Coalition forces at Al Asad Air Base in Iraq on Monday, a Pentagon spokesperson said, adding that officials at the base are conducting a post-attack damage assessment.

U.S. military officials told CBS News that there were no known fatalities, and that the service members' injuries were not reported to be critical.

It appeared that two Katyusha rockets were fired from a modified box truck toward Al Asad, the officials said.

A White House official said President Biden has been briefed on the attack.

""The briefing focused on the threats posed by Iran and its proxies to Israel and to U.S. servicemembers in the region,"" the White House said in a statement. ""The President and Vice President were briefed on the attack at Al Asad Air Base in Iraq. They discussed the steps we are taking to defend our forces and respond to any attack against our personnel in a manner and place of our choosing.""

The attack came amid mounting concerns of a larger regional war in the Middle East after last week's killings of a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon and Hamas' top political leader in Iran. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday said the region was in a ""critical moment,"" and he urged all parties in the Middle East to work to ease tensions.

Al Asad has been a target of strikes before, most notably in early 2020, when Iran launched a missile attack against the base in retaliation for the U.S. assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. More than 100 American troops were diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries in the aftermath of the Iranian missile attack.

Israel announced it killed a senior Hezbollah commander in a strike in Lebanon. Hours later, it was reported that Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh had been killed in Iran.

Though Israel’s military has not taken responsibility for Haniyeh’s death, Iranian officials blamed the country for the attack. An Israeli official told NBC News on Sunday that officials were bracing for potential retaliatory attacks from both Hamas and Iran.

State Department spokesman Matt Miller said Monday that Biden was convening his national security team to discuss ways to keep the 10-month siege of the Gaza Strip from becoming a full-blown regional conflict.

Biden posted Monday on X about what he and Vice President Kamala Harris were told in the Situation Room:

WASHINGTON – Several U.S. personnel were injured Monday in a rocket attack on a military base in Iraq, a defense official said.

“We can confirm that there was a suspected rocket attack today against U.S. and coalition forces at al Asad Air Base, Iraq,” said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity. “Initial indications are that several U.S. personnel were injured. Base personnel are conducting a post-attack damage assessment.”

Two Katyusha rockets were fired at the base in western Iraq, Reuters reported.

The latest incident comes after Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Friday ordered additional warships and a fighter squadron to the Middle East to bolster defenses in the region. The decision to move U.S. forces came ahead of an anticipated Iranian attack in response to the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week.

Israel had pledged to kill Haniyeh and other Hamas leaders over the militant group’s Oct. 7 surprise attack on southern Israel that sparked the war in Gaza. The strike came just after Haniyeh had attended the inauguration of Iran’s new president in Tehran and hours after Israel targeted a top commander for the Iran-backed Hezbollah in the Lebanese capital of Beirut.

Austin ordered the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group to replace the USS Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group, which is now deployed in the Middle East. Other assets include deploying additional land-based ballistic missile defenses and a fighter squadron to the region.

U.S. bases in the region have been prone to attacks. After the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel, Iran-linked groups launched some 175 rocket and drone strikes on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria."

A suspected rocket attack on an air base in Iraq injured several U.S. personnel on Aug. 5, U.S. officials said.

The episode at Al Asad Air Base occurred amid an uptick in strikes against U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria in recent weeks and as the U.S. is moving aircraft and ships to the region to help defend Israel against an expected Iranian attack.

Tensions in the Middle East have been running high following the July 30 killing of the political leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, believed to have been conducted by Israel. The same day, the U.S. carried out its first airstrike in months in Iraq to thwart a drone attack by an Iranian-backed militia.

The U.S. has said the two events were unrelated and it had no knowledge of the operation that killed Haniyeh. Still, U.S. officials say they have been bracing for an increase in attacks against U.S. troops—and have said they are prepared to respond with force to protect Americans.

President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were briefed on the attack on Al Asad during a meeting with their national security team, including Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III, on the Middle East that “focused on the threats posed by Iran and its proxies to Israel and to U.S. service members in the region,” the White House said.

“They discussed the steps we are taking to defend our forces and respond to any attack against our personnel in a manner and place of our choosing,” the White House added.

The U.S. says it is still assessing exactly how many American personnel were injured, what was fired at them, and what was struck.

“Base personnel are conducting a post-attack damage assessment,” a U.S. defense spokesperson told Air & Space Forces Magazine.

The Pentagon says there have been over 180 attacks by Iranian-backed militias on U.S. troops in Iraq, Jordan, and Israel since Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel in October sparked region-wide violence. Three Soldiers were killed in a January attack on Tower 22 in Jordan, which supports the Al Tanf U.S. outpost in eastern Syria.

There are an estimated 2,500 U.S. troops in Iraq and 900 in Syria supporting the fight against the Islamic State group, as well as 4,000 American service members throughout Jordan.

The U.S. launched a major retaliatory strike in early February with fighters and B-1 bombers against 85 targets in Iraq and Syria affiliated with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Iranian-aligned militias.

Two rockets were fired at Al Asad Air Base in Iraq on July 25, U.S. defense officials previously told Air & Space Forces Magazine.

The U.S. is deploying F-22 fighters and warships and may be increasing land-based air defenses as it prepares for a possible Iranian attack on Israel and potential region-wide escalation by Iran’s network for proxy groups.

Biden and Harris were briefed on “U.S. military efforts to support the defense of Israel should it be attacked again” and “continued diplomatic efforts to de-escalate regional tension and to bring the ceasefire and hostage release deal [between Hamas and [Israel] to a conclusion,” the White House said.

Iran attacked Israel on April 13 with roughly 300 missiles, rockets, and drones. Israel shot down many of the projectiles, while U.S. F-15Es and F-16s also shot down more than 80 Iranian drones and U.S. warships intercepted multiple ballistic missiles. A U.S. Patriot surface-to-air system in Erbil, Iraq, also took down a missile.

Al Asad is equipped with an advanced Patriot battery and other air defense systems but has repeatedly come under attack in strikes that injured Americans.

“Of course, we’re postured to always protect our forces in the region,” Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters on Aug. 5."

Biden, 81, said he discussed “developments in the Middle East” with his national security team, according to a post on his X account which did not acknowledge the latest attack on US troops in the region.

“We received updates on threats posed by Iran and its proxies, diplomatic efforts to de-escalate regional tensions, and preparations to support Israel should it be attacked again,” the president said.

“We also discussed the steps we are taking to defend our forces and respond to any attack against our personnel in a manner and place of our choosing,” he added.

US officials said “several” Americans were wounded in the attack against Al Asad airbase in western Iraq, Reuters reported.

“Base personnel are conducting a post-attack damage assessment,” one US official told the outlet.

At least one of the two Katyusha rockets fired at US forces fell inside the airbase, according to the report.

The attack comes as the US and Israel brace for retaliation from Iran and its proxies over the deaths of two top Hamas and Hezbollah officials last week.

Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was reportedly assassinated when a covertly placed bomb detonated inside his Tehran guesthouse, while Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr, who is believed to have ordered the rocket attack on a soccer field in the Israel-controlled Golan Heights that killed 12 children last month, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in the Lebanese capital of Beirut.

The US has denied any involvement in the deaths of the terrorist groups’ leaders. Iran has blamed Israel for the attacks and has vowed to take revenge.

It’s unclear whether Iran or one of its many proxies were behind Monday’s attack.

On Friday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered more US troops, ships, fighter jets and “land-based ballistic missile defense” systems to the Middle East to counter potential retaliatory strikes from Iran.

The “posture adjustments” were made “to improve US force protection, to increase support for the defense of Israel, and to ensure the United States is prepared to respond to various contingencies,” according to the Pentagon.

The Israel Defense Forces have been on “high alert” since last week over fears of an attack from Iran.

Last week, the US conducted its first airstrike against Iranian-backed militia groups in Iraq since February, hitting a base south of Baghdad used by Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces – killing four PMF members.

US officials described the airstrike as defensive and aimed at militants preparing to launch an attack.

The Institute for the Study of War notes that PMP – a formal Iraqi security force – has been “infiltrated” by Iran and is used to “wield significant influence in Iraq.”

Since last October, in response to US support for Israel’s war against Hamas, Iran-backed militia groups have launched more than 170 attacks on US military personnel in Iraq, Syria and Jordan, wounding dozens of US troops.

Three US soldiers were killed in one such attack on a US outpost in Jordan in January, which prompted a series of retaliatory US airstrikes."

The Israel-Gaza war has gone on for months, and tensions have spilled into the surrounding Middle East region.

The war: On Oct. 7, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel that included the taking of civilian hostages at a music festival. See photos and videos of how the deadly assault unfolded. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel’s creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

This is the latest attack against American forces in the Middle East. Iranian-backed militia groups have fired mortars and launched drones and missiles against U.S. troops in the region since Hamas’ Oct. 7 terror attack on Israel. Three Army Reserve soldiers were killed in a Jan. 28 drone attack against a U.S. base in Jordan.

July saw the most attacks against U.S. bases in the region in months. On July 30, the U.S. military launched a defense airstrike against militants who were preparing to launch a drone. It was the first U.S. airstrike in the country since February.

Tensions in the Middle East have been especially high in the past week. Israel is bracing for an attack by Iran and its proxies after the July 30 Israeli airstrike killed Fuad Shukr, a senior Hezbollah commander who “played a central role” in the Oct. 23,1983 attack on U.S. Marines in Beirut that killed 241 American troops, and the subsequent assassination of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Israeli officials have not commented publicly on Haniyeh’s death.

Several U.S. personnel were injured in a suspected rocket attack at Al Asad air base.,https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/several-us-personnel-injured-rocket-attack-iraq-base,"WASHINGTON — Several US personnel were injured in a suspected rocket attack on the al-Asad air base in western Iraq on Monday night, two US defense officials told Al-Monitor.

The incident marks the first attack confirmed by the Pentagon to have injured American troops in the region since a de facto truce set in in February between US forces and Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria.



Monday's rocket attack was not the first to target bases used by US troops in those countries since then. But it comes as the Pentagon and Israeli defense establishment, along with other military commands and armed groups in the region, are on edge over anticipated retaliation by Iran and its proxies against Israel for last week's assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.

The rocket attack is likely to complicate the Biden administration's ongoing diplomatic efforts to avert the anticipated Iranian counterattack against Israel, which could spiral into a wider regional war.

What they're saying: No group immediately claimed credit for the barrage in Iraq on Monday, and the United States has not attributed blame. But a handful of Iran-backed groups in Iraq last week suggested they could retaliate for the killing of Haniyeh and a top Hezbollah commander by a separate Israeli strike in Beirut last week.

One militia, Harikat an-Nujaba, issued a statement last week warning that Israel and the United States had ""opened the gates of hell upon themselves” due to the assassinations. The United States has denied involvement in both strikes, while Israeli leaders have neither confirmed nor denied any role in Haniyeh's assassination. US officials have said they believe Israel was behind the strike on the Hamas leader in Tehran.

The Biden administration has initiated a full-court press along with its allies to persuade Iran’s leaders not to retaliate against Israel. “The consensus position is that Iran should not take further action,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday cautioned that the world was watching the current “critical moment” in the region as Iran weighed its response.

The top diplomats from the G7 countries — which include the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom — released a statement on Monday expressing their ""deep concern at the heightened level of tension in the Middle East which threatens to ignite a broader conflict in the region.""

""We urge all involved parties once again to refrain from perpetuating the current destructive cycle of retaliatory violence, to lower tensions and engage constructively toward de-escalation,"" the statement read. ""No country or nation stands to gain from a further escalation in the Middle East.""

Yet US defense officials on Monday sought to downplay the risks of a broader outbreak of conflict across the Middle East, even as Washington has deployed more warships and advanced F-22 fighter jets to shield Israel and American troops in the region against expected attack.

“We still believe that a wider regional war is not imminent,” deputy spokesperson Sabrina Singh told a group of reporters gathered at the Pentagon on Monday morning.

Behind the scenes: US President Joe Biden spoke with Jordan’s King Abdullah on Monday in a bid to head off the expected Iranian attack, a day after Jordan’s foreign minister, Ayman al-Safadi, met with Iran’s newly elected President Masoud Pezeshkian in Tehran.

During Iran and its proxies’ previous retaliatory attack on Israel in April, the Royal Jordanian Air Force scrambled its own fighter jets to help intercept airborne drones and missiles fired over the kingdom and headed towards Israel.

The top US general overseeing troops in the Middle East, Gen. Michael “Erik” Kurilla , met with Israeli top brass in Tel Aviv on Monday to coordinate on joint defensive plans before continuing on to stops in other US-aligned countries in the region.

In a meeting with Gallant and IDF chief of staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, Kurilla discussed “expand[ing] the international coalition ” to defend Israel and American personnel in the region, Gallant’s office said.

The big picture: Washington is attempting to play to Iranian leaders' interest in eventually rebuilding ties with the West in hope of averting a major escalation toward war.



“We don’t think it’s productive or conducive to anyone’s interest, including Iran’s, to conduct further actions, be they retaliatory or not,"" Miller said during a press briefing.

The timing and nature of the attack which Iran and its proxies intended to undertake remained unclear on Monday, but the Pentagon’s deployment of highly advanced F-22 fighter aircraft and additional navy destroyers underscored Washington’s concerns about a repeat of Iran’s large-scale drone and missile barrage towards Israel in April.

Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani on Monday said that his government aimed to reinforce “stability and security in the region” by establishing “ deterrence against Israel and its adventurism.”

Kanaani further said Iran has the right to retaliate under international law for the alleged Israeli attack on Iranian soil but that Tehran does not want to see an escalation of violence in the region.

“I won't lay out what I expect Iran to do, because I don't think we want to show our hand in that way,” deputy US National Security Adviser Jon Finer said in an interview with ABC News on Sunday.

Back and forth: The Biden administration’s last-ditch attempts to avert escalation came as Israeli leaders openly suggested that their military forces were prepared to go on the offensive should they come under attack from Iran and its proxies.

“We are prepared for any scenario, both offensively and defensively,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday.

Defense Minister Yoav Gallant issued a similar warning after a meeting with Israeli Air Force commanders on Monday. “We must prepare for all possibilities — including a quick pivot to offense,” Gallant said in a statement released on social media.

Two US officials told Al-Monitor that the Pentagon has ruled out launching preemptive strikes against Iran and its proxies in defense of Israel. “We are not going to start this war,” one official said.

Yet American forces in the region will take action to defend Israel and themselves, the second official said. Last week a US military aircraft bombed a group of Kataib Hezbollah fighters who defense officials said were preparing to launch an attack drone in central Iraq, posing a threat to US-led coalition troops.

It was not immediately clear if the US military would retaliate for Monday night's rocket attack on the al-Asad Air Base in Iraq.

What’s next: US officials have been tight-lipped about which countries may contribute to a collective defense against the anticipated attack, which could come as soon as this week.

US defense chief Lloyd Austin on Friday signed off on the deployment of a second aircraft carrier to the region, the USS Abraham Lincoln, to replace another American carrier already in the Gulf of Oman. Austin also authorized an undisclosed number of F-22 Raptor fighter jets to head to the region, a US official confirmed to Al-Monitor. The deployment of F-22s was first reported by the New York Times.

“We do believe there is an off-ramp here, and it is that cease-fire deal,” Singh told reporters late last week.

Yet negotiations between Israel and Hamas over a cease-fire in Gaza in exchange for release of hostages have been put on hold in anticipation of Iranian attack, the Times of Israel reported on Monday. Al-Monitor has not independently confirmed the report.

“Nothing that’s happened over the past week has done anything to erode the fundamental agreement on the framework to this cease-fire. That stands,” State Department spokesperson Miller told journalists on Monday."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -At least five U.S. personnel were injured in an attack against a military base in Iraq on Monday, U.S. officials told Reuters, as the Middle East braced for a possible new wave of attacks by Iran and its allies following last week’s killing of senior members of militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah.

Two Katyusha rockets were fired at al Asad airbase in western Iraq, two Iraqi security sources said. One Iraqi security source said the rockets fell inside the base. It was unclear whether the attack was linked to threats by Iran to retaliate over the killings.

On Wednesday, Iran said the U.S. bears responsibility in the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran because of its support for Israel.

The U.S. officials, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said one of the wounded Americans was seriously injured. The casualty count was based on initial reports which could still change, they said.

“Base personnel are conducting a post-attack damage assessment,” one of the officials added.

Last week the U.S. carried out a strike in Iraq against individuals U.S. officials said were militants getting ready to launch drones and posed a threat to U.S. and coalition forces.

The U.S. has been watching to see if Iran would make good on its vow to respond to the killing of Haniyeh two days ago in Tehran, one in a series of killings of senior figures in the Palestinian militant group as the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza rages.

The Pentagon has said it will deploy additional fighter jets and Navy warships to the Middle East, as Washington seeks to bolster defenses following threats from Iran and its allies Hamas and Hezbollah.

A rare ally of both the U.S. and Iran, Iraq hosts 2,500 U.S. troops and has Iran-backed militias linked to its security forces. It has witnessed escalating tit-for-tat attacks since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in October.

Iraq wants troops from the U.S.-led military coalition to begin withdrawing in September and to formally end the coalition’s work by September 2025, Iraqi sources have said, with some U.S. forces likely to remain in a newly negotiated advisory capacity.

Baghdad has struggled to reign in Iran-backed armed groups that have attacked U.S. forces there and in neighboring Syria dozens of time since Oct. 7.

Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken on Sunday.

An Iraqi official said Blinken asked Sudani to help decrease regional tensions by helping to convince Iran to temper its response to an Israeli strike in Tehran that killed the leader of Hamas last week.

U.S. Army General Michael “Erik” Kurilla, head of U.S. Central Command, is currently in the Middle East. One of the U.S. officials said Kurilla was speaking with allies to ensure there was coordination in case of an Iranian attack against Israel.

The attack comes as tensions across the Middle East are spiking following the killings last week of a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon and Hamas’ top political leader in Iran, in suspected Israeli strikes. Both groups are backed by Iran.

The U.S. defense officials said troops at al-Asad air base were still assessing the injuries and damage, and it appeared that as many as seven military troops and civilians were injured. Earlier Monday, Iraqi security officials confirmed the attack, but no group has claimed responsibility.

The American officials said the U.S. looked into reports of a possible second attack at the base but determined there had not been another one.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations. The White House said the president and vice president were briefed on the attack.

In recent weeks, Iranian-backed Iraqi militias have resumed launching attacks on bases housing U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria after a lull of several months, following a strike on a base in Jordan in late January that killed three American soldiers and prompted a series of retaliatory U.S. strikes.

Officials have not released the extent or number of injuries.

President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were briefed on the attack, according to a White House readout of a meeting Monday in the Situation Room on escalating tensions in the Middle East.

""We received updates on threats posed by Iran and its proxies, diplomatic efforts to de-escalate regional tensions and preparations to support Israel should it be attacked again,"" the president wrote Monday in a post on X.

The reported attack comes as Iran vows revenge on Israel for last week's assassinations of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and Fouad Shukr, Hezbollah senior military commander and founding member of the Iran-backed group. The Israel Defense Forces has not claimed responsibility for Haniyeh's death.

""They will see the result of their mistake,"" Iranian General Hossein Salami warned after Haniyeh's death. ""They will see when, how and where they will get their response.""

Meanwhile, the U.S. Defense Department reported Monday it continues to move vessels and aircraft in the Middle East to protect American forces and increase the defense of Israel.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke Sunday with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant to show the United States' support for Israel's security and right to defend itself against Iran, Lebanese Hezbollah, Houthis and other Iranian-backed terrorist groups, according to deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh.

Several U.S. personnel were injured in a suspected rocket attack at Al Asad air base.,https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/394165,"Several US personnel were injured in a suspected rocket attack at the Ain al-Asad air base in western Iraq on Monday, Fox News reported, citing US defense officials.

A US defense official confirmed the suspected rocket attack to Fox News, after Reuters had reported that at least two Katyusha rockets were fired towards the base, which houses US-led forces.

The official said that ""several"" US personnel were injured during the incident.

""Base personnel are conducting a post-attack damage assessment,"" the official added. ""We will provide updates as more information becomes available.""

Officials have not released the exact number of injuries. A source told Reuters that the rockets fell inside the base.

Monday’s attack marks the third time in recent weeks that the base has come under attack, but the first time that any injuries have been reported.

In late July, multiple rockets were launched at Ain al-Asad airbase. No damage or casualties were reported. Two US officials said the base itself had not been struck in the attack.

The Ain al-Asad base had come under attack by two armed drones the previous week as well, but that attack was the first one against US forces in Iraq since early February, when Iranian-backed groups in Iraq announced they would stop their attacks against US troops.

That announcement came two days after a drone attack in Jordan killed three US service members and wounded dozens of others."

The official said that more updates will follow as new information becomes available.

The attack was reportedly carried out by one of Iran’s terrorist proxy groups, the same terror groups that have launched more than 200 attacks against U.S. forces in the region following Hamas’ October 7 terrorist attack on Israel.

The attack comes amid growing fears that the Israel-Hamas war will spill over into a wider conflict in the Middle East following assassinations in Beirut and Tehran last week. Israel announced it killed a senior Hezbollah commander in a strike in Lebanon. Hours later, it was reported that Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh had been killed in Iran.

Though Israel’s military has not taken responsibility for Haniyeh’s death, Iranian officials blamed the country for the attack. An Israeli official told NBC News on Sunday that officials were bracing for potential retaliatory attacks from both Hamas and Iran.

Several U.S. personnel were injured in a suspected rocket attack at Al Asad air base.,https://www.arabnews.com/node/2563296/amp,"BAGHDAD: Several US personnel were injured in an attack against a military base in Iraq on Monday, three US officials told Reuters.

The officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the suspected rocket attack took place at Al Asad air base in Iraq. They said they were citing initial information which could change.

“Rockets were launched at Ain Assad base” in Anbar province, said the military source.

While some “fell inside the base,” one rocket landed on a nearby village without causing any damage, the source added.

A commander in a pro-Iran armed group told AFP that at least “two rockets targeted” the base, without saying who had carried out the attack.

Another source in the group and a security source confirmed an attack occurred.

All sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media.

Such attacks were frequent early in the war between Israel and Hamas Palestinian militants in Gaza but since then have largely halted.

But the latest rocket fire comes as fears grow of an attack by Iran and its allies on Israel in retaliation for the killing of top Hamas and Hezbollah figures in strikes last weeks either blamed on or claimed by Israel.

The killings, with both Iran and Hezbollah vowing retaliation, are among the most serious series of tit-for-tat attacks that had already heightened fears of a regional conflagration stemming from the Gaza war.

The Iran-aligned “Axis of Resistance” against Israel, which also includes Iraqi groups and Yemen’s Houthis, have already been drawn into the nearly 10-month war.

Monday’s rocket attack also occurred after US forces carried out an air strike Tuesday night on pro-Iran Iraqi fighters who were attempting to launch drones that were deemed a threat to American and allied troops, a US official said.

The strike, which Iraqi sources said left four killed, was the first by American forces in Iraq since February.

There have been two recent attacks targeting bases hosting US and allied forces in Iraq — on July 16 and 25. The troops are part of an anti-jihadist coalition.

Prior to that, US troops in Iraq and Syria had not been targeted since April. But attacks against them were much more common in the first few months of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, when they were targeted more than 175 times.

The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a loose alliance of pro-Iran groups, claimed the majority of the attacks, saying they were in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

In January, a drone strike blamed on those groups killed three US soldiers at a base in Jordan. In retaliation, US forces launched dozens of strikes against Tehran-backed fighters in Iraq and Syria.

Since then, attacks against US troops have largely halted.

Baghdad has sought to defuse tensions, engaging in talks with Washington on the future of the US-led coalition’s mission in Iraq, with Iran-backed groups demanding a withdrawal.

The US military has around 2,500 troops in Iraq and 900 in Syria.

Several U.S. personnel were injured in a suspected rocket attack at Al Asad air base.,https://www.arabnews.com/node/2563296,"ICC prosecutor urges world to ‘stem the bleeding’ in Sudan before region spins out of control

NEW YORK CITY: Violence in Sudan has continued to escalate in the past six months, the International Criminal Court’s prosecutor said on Monday, with reports of rapes, crimes against children and persecution on a massive scale.

“Terror has become a common currency,” Karim Khan told a meeting of the UN Security Council, “and the terror is not felt by the people with guns but by people who are running, very often with nothing on their feet, hungry.”

War between rival military factions has been raging in Sudan for more than a year. Since it began in April 2023, about 19,000 people have been killed. More than 10 million are displaced within the country and more than 2 million have fled to neighboring countries as refugees, making it the largest displacement crisis in the world.

The country is on the brink of famine as a severe food crisis looms, with many families reportedly already often going days without food.

Khan said the ICC is prioritizing investigations into allegations of crimes against, and affecting, children, and gender crimes. These “profound human rights abuses, mass violations of personal dignity” continue to be fueled by the “provision of arms, financial support from various sectors, and political triangulations that lead to inaction by the international community,” he added.

His comments came during the latest semi-annual briefing to the Security Council on the court’s Darfur-related activities. Almost 20 years after the council referred the situation in Darfur to the ICC, arrest warrants issued by the court against former president Omar Al-Bashir, former ministers Ahmad Mohammed Harun and Abdel Raheem Mohammed Hussein, and the former commander-in-chief of the Justice and Equality Movement, Abdallah Banda Abakaer Nourain, remain outstanding.

Khan said that such failures to execute arrest warrants for indicted individuals have contributed to several unwelcome consequences, including “the climate of impunity and the outbreak of violence that commenced in April (2023), and that continues today, (in which) belligerents think they can get away with murder and rape; the feeling that the bandwidth of the (Security) Council, the bandwidth of states, is too limited, it’s too preoccupied with other epicenters of conflict, hot wars in other parts of the world; that we’ve lost sight of the plight of the people of Darfur, we have somehow forgotten our responsibilities under the UN Charter; (and) the feeling that Darfur or Sudan is a law-free zone in which people can act with abandon, based upon their worst proclivities, their worst base instincts, the politics of hate and power, the opportunities to profit.”

He called on council members to “back in substance” the call for justice.

In comments directed toward both of the warring factions, the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces, as well as “those who are funding them, supplying them with weapons, giving orders, gaining certain advantages,” Khan said his office is investigating and “using our resources as effectively as we can to make sure that the events since April of last year are subjected to the principle of international humanitarian law and the imperative that every human life must be seen to have equal value.”

He said that after “a great deal of difficulty,” Sudanese authorities are finally cooperating with ICC investigators who have been able to enter Port Sudan, collect evidence and engage with Gen. Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan, commander of the Sudanese Armed Forces and the country’s de facto leader.

“But one swallow does not a summer make,” Khan added as he underscored the need for “continuous, deepening cooperation with the Sudanese Armed Forces, with Gen. Al-Burhan and his government moving forward.”

He said that “one concrete way in which that commitment to accountability, and this lack of tolerance for impunity, can be evidenced is by properly enforcing court orders,” including the arrest of former minister Harun and delivering him to the court.

However, Khan said that the most recent significant efforts to engage with the leadership of the Rapid Support Forces have so far proved to be fruitless.

Meanwhile, he said, ICC investigators have visited neighboring Chad several times and collected “very valuable testimonial evidence” from displaced Sudanese citizens living there as refugees.

They have met representatives of Sudanese civil society in Chad, South Sudan, the Central African Republic and Europe, he added, “to get and preserve their accounts and their stories, to analyze it and to piece it together, to see what crimes, if any, it shows and who is responsible for the hell on earth that is being unleashed so stubbornly, so persistently against the people of Darfur.”

Khan said his office has used technological tools to gather and piece together various forms of evidence from phones, videos and audio recordings, and that this is “proving to be extremely critical to pierce the veil of impunity.”

The collective efforts by investigators, analysts, lawyers and members of civil society have resulted in significant progress being made, he added, and he expressed hope that he will soon be able to announce that arrest warrants have been requested for individuals believed to be most responsible for the crimes in the country.

Meanwhile, Khan sounded a broader alarm over what he described as “a trapezium of chaos in that part of the continent.”

He continued: “If one draws a line from the Mediterranean of Libya, down to the Red Sea of Sudan, and then draws a line to Sub-Saharan Africa, and then all the way to the Atlantic, with Boko Haram causing instability, chaos and suffering in Nigeria, and then back to Sudan, (we) see the map and the countries that risk being unsettled or destabilized by this concentration of chaos and suffering.”

He warned the members of the Security Council that in addition to the concerns about the rights of the people of Darfur, “we’re reaching a tipping point in which a Pandora’s box of ethnic, racial, religious, sectarian (and) commercial interests will be unleashed.”

He added that “they will no longer be susceptible to the political powers of the great states of the world, or even of this council. It requires some real action now to stem the bleeding … in Sudan.”"

The base, which has frequently been the target of attacks by Iran-backed Iraqi armed groups, was hit by at least two rockets that landed within its perimeter.The attack comes amid heightened tensions in the region following Israel's conflict with Hamas in the Gaza Strip and the recent killing of key leaders tied to Hamas and Hezbollah.This latest assault adds to a series of attacks on US military positions in Iraq and Syria over the past month, including a recent incident at a small US base in eastern Syria.Preliminary reports indicate that at least five individuals were wounded in the attack, including both US troops and contractors. While no group has yet claimed responsibility, the strike bears the hallmarks of previous operations by Iran-backed militias in Iraq, whose goal is to force the withdrawal of US forces from the region.The attack on Ain al-Asad Air Base occurred against a backdrop of escalating regional tensions. Last week, a Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed in Tehran, and Hezbollah leader Fouad Shukur was killed in Beirut. Israel has acknowledged responsibility for the assassination of Shukur but has remained silent on Haniyeh’s death. In response, Iran has vowed retaliation through its proxy forces, including Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen, and various militant groups in Iraq.While it remains unclear whether this latest rocket attack was part of a broader Iranian response or a continuation of ongoing militia efforts, it underscores the volatile situation in the region. The US military has been on high alert, anticipating potential reprisals similar to the April attack by Iran on Israel following the killing of senior Iranian military figures by Israeli forces.The White House confirmed that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have been briefed on the incident and are considering potential responses. A statement from the administration emphasized that any retaliatory action would be carried out ""in a manner and place of our choosing.""The attack has also highlighted ongoing negotiations between US and Iraqi officials over the future of American military presence in the country. While some factions within the Iraqi government, particularly those aligned with Iran, are pushing for a swift US withdrawal, others, including many Iraqi defense officials, favor a continued albeit reduced US involvement to maintain stability.Currently, approximately 2,500 US troops are stationed in Iraq, with an additional 900 in Syria, where the resurgence of the Islamic State group remains a concern."

Two Katyusha rockets on Monday were fired at the base in western Iraq, security sources said. One security source said the rockets fell inside the base.

Last week the US carried out a strike in Iraq against individuals U.S. officials said were militants getting ready to launch drones and posed a threat to US and coalition forces.

The US is bracing for Iran to make good on its vow to respond to the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh two days ago in Tehran - one in a series of killings of senior figures in the Palestinian militant group as the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza rages.

The Pentagon has said it will deploy additional fighter jets and Navy warships to the Middle East, as Washington seeks to bolster defenses following threats from Iran and its allies Hamas and Hezbollah.

The steps being taken include deployment of an additional fighter squadron to the Middle East, reinforcing the defensive air support capability. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin is sending the USS Abraham Lincoln Aircraft Carrier Strike Group to replace the USS Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group in the Central Command area of responsibility.

Additionally, Secretary Austin has ordered additional ballistic missile defense-capable cruisers and destroyers to the U.S. European Command and U.S. Central Command regions. The Department is also taking steps to increase our readiness to deploy additional land-based ballistic missile defense.

These actions are meant to prepare for and mitigate against the possibility of regional escalation by Iran or Iran’s partners and proxies.

According to an anonymously sourced story in Axios, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is saying that Iran and Hezbollah may attack Israel within the next 24 to 48 hours. Iran and Hezbollah have vowed to retaliate for Israel’s killing of top Hamas and Hezbollah terrorists last week.

“The sources said Blinken stressed [in a call to G-7 leaders] that the US believes Iran and Hezbollah will both retaliate,” according to Axios, which added that the U.S. “doesn’t know the exact timing of the attacks.”

The news comes the same day that reports have come in about an unknown number of U.S. personnel injured in a suspected rocket attack on Al Asad Air Base in Iraq on Monday

“Initial indications are that several U.S. personnel were injured,” a spokesperson said in a statement. “Base personnel are conducting a post-attack damage assessment. We will provide updates as more information becomes available.”

Since the horrific Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7, which resulted in the most Jewish people killed since Hitler’s Holocaust, the Secretary of Defense has reiterated that the United States will keep America’s “ironclad commitment to the defense of Israel.”

Already in the region is the USS WASP Amphibious Ready Group / Marine Expeditionary Unit (ARG/MEU) operating in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea.

Missiles hit US-led coalition base in Iraq: security sources

A commander in a pro-Iran armed group told AFP that at least two rockets targeted the base, without saying who had carried out the attack.

Another source in the group and a security source confirmed an attack occurred.

Such attacks were frequent early in the war between Israel and Hamas Palestinian in Gaza but since then have largely halted.

The latest rocket fire comes as fears grow of an attack by Iran and its allies on Israel in retaliation for the killing of top Hamas and Hezbollah figures in strikes last weeks either blamed on or claimed by Israel.

Series of attacks

The killings, with both Iran and Hezbollah vowing retaliation, are among the most serious series of tit-for-tat attacks that had already heightened fears of a regional conflagration stemming from the Gaza war.

The Iran-aligned “Axis of Resistance” against Israel, which also includes Iraqi groups and Yemen’s Houthis, have already been drawn into the nearly 10-month war.

Monday’s rocket attack occurred after US forces carried out a trike last week on combatants who were attempting to launch drones that were deemed a threat to American and allied troops, a US official said.

Iran says Revolutionary Guards attack Israel’s ‘spy HQ’ in Iraq, vow more revenge

The strike, which Iraqi sources said left four killed, was the first by American forces in Iraq since February.

There have been two recent attacks targeting bases hosting US and allied forces in Iraq – on July 16 and 25.

Prior to that, US troops in Iraq and Syria had not been targeted since April. But attacks against them were much more common in the first few months of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, when they were targeted more than 175 times.

The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a loose alliance of pro-Iran groups, claimed the majority of the attacks, saying they were in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

In January, a drone strike blamed on those groups killed three US soldiers at a base in Jordan. In retaliation, US forces launched dozens of strikes against Tehran-backed fighters in Iraq and Syria.

Since then, attacks against US troops have largely halted.

Baghdad has sought to defuse tensions, engaging in talks with Washington on the future of the US-led coalition’s mission in Iraq, with Iran-backed groups demanding a withdrawal.

The US military has around 2,500 troops in Iraq and 900 in Syria."

A pro-Iranian commander told AFP at least ""two rockets targeted"" the base which is also used to station a number of other international troops.

Several US personnel were injured in the blasts, a source told Reuters.

""Base personnel are conducting a post-attack damage assessment,"" one of the officials added.

The US Department of Defense later confirmed the attacks saying: ""There was a suspected rocket attack today against US and coalition forces' at the base.

""Initial indications are that several US personnel were injured. Base personnel are conducting a post-attack damage assessment.""

A White House spokesperson confirmed that President Joe Biden and his VP Kamala Harris were both briefed by national security advisers.

Concerns in the region are mounting following last week's killing of senior members of militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah.

It is unclear who officials believe carried out the attack, but Iranian proxies in the Middle East are known to target US controlled areas when tensions reach boiling point.

In April, another US military base in Syria was struck by rockets in a Iraqi drone strike.

Earlier this week, the US deployed a fleet of warships and fighter jets to the Middle East amid fears of an attack from Iran in response to recent Israeli blasts.

Officials in America, Israel's most powerful ally, expect a retaliatory April 13th-style attack from Iran which could hit in the next few days.

President Joe Biden reportedly held a crisis meeting with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday to discuss the Middle East melting pot.

Biden assured Netanyahu that US military deployments would be sent out to help Israel defend itself against the looming threats.

A recent spate of targeted high-profile assassinations by Israel, killing two senior Hamas leaders and a Hezbollah commander, has led to serious WW3 fears.

Israel ready to ‘cut the head off the snake’ as Iran hours away from revenge strikeIran

On April 1 Iran's Syrian embassy in the capital Damascus was destroyed in a suspected Israeli strike - killing several top brass IRGC commanders.

Iran and its proxy groups Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis have all made threats to seek revenge for the deaths of their allies and leaders in the past week.

And as boiling tensions in the region flare, Tehran’s nuclear capabilities remain a “serious” concern for the future of the Middle East.

An expert in the war-torn region told The Sun that Israel is gearing up to finally defeat arch enemy Iran - with a brutal attack possibly happening within hours.

Tel Aviv is preparing to ""cut the head off the snake"" of Tehran and its sprawling proxy network as they plan an imminent coordinated strike that could spark all-out war, she warned.

It comes as several countries including Britain and the US have told their citizens in Lebanon to leave the country immediately.

Over the weekend up to 30 Hezbollah rockets were obliterated by Israel's incredible $1billion Iron Dome air defence system.

Dramatic footage showed the one-of-a-kind air defence beast kicking into action and shooting down missiles over Galilee.

Rising tensions in the Middle East By Ellie Doughty, Foreign News Reporter TENSIONS in the Middle East have long been a fluctuating and dangerous area of global concern. Conflict between Israel and Palestine in the Gaza Strip, West Bank and on Israeli territory itself is nothing new. Iran and Israel have long been in conflict with each other too. But after a brutal terrorist attack by Hamas on Israeli soil in October last year, things entered a new phase. Israel hit back like never before, unleashing almost ten months of ground warfare and airstrikes on the decimated enclave in a bid to destroy Hamas and rescue its hostages. The Iran-backed terror group had killed some 1,200 Israeli people and kidnapped 250 more in the hideous October 7 massacre. The UN estimates that at least 39,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the fresh war there broke out. This figure includes data from the health ministry in Gaza which falls under Hamas domain and has sparked concerns from officials about accuracy. Now, after almost ten months of war in Gaza, tensions have appeared to enter an all new high after a series of deadly strikes and high-profile assassinations in late July and early August. On Saturday July 27, a rocket strike fired from southern Lebanon hit a football pitch in Golan Heights - a Druze village occupied by Israel - killing 12 young people including children. Israel and the US both said Hezbollah, the largest of Iran’s terror proxy groups, operating out of Lebanon, were responsible for the deadly strike. On Monday July 28, the IDF dropped an airstrike on an area of Beirut, Lebanon’s capital, killing Hezbollah’s most senior military commander Fuad Shukr. Less than two days later, at around 2am on Wednesday July 30, Israel killed Hamas’ top political leader Ismail Haniyeh as he slept in Iran’s capital Tehran. Israel has yet to explicitly claim responsibility for the hit, but after vowing to take out all of Hamas last year, they are widely believed to be behind it. US officials have also said they suspect Israel of being behind the assassination. On the morning of Thursday August 1 morning the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) announced that a strike on Khan Younis, southern Gaza, had killed Mohammed Deif on July 13. Dief had worked as head of Hamas' ruthless military wing, the al-Qassam brigades, since 2002. It marked another major loss for Iran’s terror proxy groups in the region. Early reports this week suggested Ismail Haniyeh was taken out in a precision strike, when a rocket was fired from a drone outside his window and detonated inside the room. Then an investigation by the New York Times suggested a bomb had been planted in his room at the military-run compound where he was staying and detonated remotely. Unnamed Iranian officials also shared the explosive theory with The Telegraph, further confusing the murky details around Haniyeh’s death. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), concluded its investigation into the humiliating security breach on Saturday August 1 and said he died after a “short-range projectile” was fired from outside the building. A statement shared on Iranian state TV said a 7kg rocket warhead was used in the attack. Iran and its proxy groups; Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen all vowed to seek revenge on Israel over the assassination of Haniyeh. Then, on the night of Saturday August 3, Hezbollah fired some 30 rockets from Lebanon towards Galilee in northern Israel. Tel Aviv’s impressive Iron Dome Defence system launched into action, destroying “most” of the missiles and no one was hurt. But the UK, US and France have all urged their citizens to evacuate from Lebanon as fears of a wider war breaking out in the region continue to spiral.

The officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, disclosed that the suspected rocket attack occurred at Al Asad airbase in Iraq. They emphasized that the information was preliminary and subject to change. ""Base personnel are conducting a post-attack damage assessment,"" one official noted.

Two Katyusha rockets were fired at the base in western Iraq, according to security sources. One source confirmed that the rockets landed inside the base. This attack follows a U.S. strike in Iraq targeting militants preparing to launch drone attacks against U.S. and coalition forces.

The U.S. is preparing for potential retaliatory actions from Iran, which has vowed to respond to the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. The Pentagon announced plans to deploy additional fighter jets and Navy warships to the Middle East as Washington aims to bolster defenses in response to threats from Iran and its allies Hamas and Hezbollah.

Nine UNRWA staff will be fired for potential role in the 7 October attacks on Israel.,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/08/1152841,"The development follows the conclusion of an investigation by the UN Office of Oversight Services (OIOS), launched earlier this year after Israel alleged that several UNRWA personnel took part in the brutal assault on its territory in which some 1,200 people were killed and another 250 were taken to Gaza as hostages.

However, OIOS was not able to independently authenticate information used by Israel to support the allegations.

Appropriate measures and terminations

OIOS is the highest investigative body in the UN system and its reports are confidential but can be made available to Member States upon request.

Investigators made findings in relation to 19 UNRWA staff alleged to have been involved in the attacks, UN Deputy Spokesperson Farhan Haq told journalists in New York.

“In one case, no evidence was obtained by OIOS to support the allegations of the staff member’s involvement, while in nine other cases, the evidence obtained by OIOS was insufficient to support the staff members’ involvement,” he said.

Regarding these10 cases, he said that appropriate measures will be taken in due course, in conformity with UNRWA Regulations and Rules.

With respect to the remaining nine cases, the evidence obtained by OIOS indicated that the UNRWA staff members may have been involved in the 7 October attacks.

UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini issued a statement acknowledging the completion of the probe. “I have decided that in the case of these remaining nine staff members, they cannot work for UNRWA. All contracts of these staff members will be terminated in the interest of the Agency,” he said. Information not authenticated

Asked about the extent of the staff members’ alleged involvement, Mr. Haq responded that he did not have specific information about the specific allegations.

He said the OIOS investigation involved visits to Israel for discussions with officials and to see and review information held by authorities there.

The investigators also travelled to Amman, Jordan, to obtain and review relevant information held by UNRWA, including on its staff and operations.

They also reviewed information and communications technology data, such as email records and information on agency vehicles, in addition to information from various other sources, including that released to the media and other public sources, and communications with several Member States.

“However, one thing I'd like to point out is that since information used by Israeli officials to support the allegations have remained in Israeli custody, OIOS was not able to independently authenticate most of the information provided to it,” he noted.

Parallel probe

The accusations surfaced in January when Israel informed UNRWA of the alleged involvement of 12 staff members in the attacks. UNRWA immediately identified and terminated 10, while two were confirmed dead.

The UN later received information from Israel about seven more cases – five in March and two in April.

Following the initial allegations, UN Secretary-General António Guterres immediately ordered OIOS to investigate.

He also appointed an independent review panel to conduct a separate assessment into UNRWA to determine whether the agency was doing everything it could to ensure neutrality and to respond to allegations of serious breaches when they arise.

The panel – headed by former French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna - published its report in April.

Speaking at the time, she said “the set of rules and the mechanisms and procedures in place [at UNRWA] are the most elaborate within the UN system, precisely because it is such a difficult issue to work in such a complex and sensitive environment.”

Mr. Lazzarini said that UNRWA has started implementing the panel’s recommendations and is fully committed to them.

“Finally, I reiterate UNRWA’s condemnation of the 7 October attack in the strongest possible terms. I call – once again – for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages and their safe return to their families,” he said.

UN chief’s opinions

Mr. Haq was asked about the Secretary-General’s views regarding the OIOS findings.

The UN chief “believes that it is important that we go through this very carefully, given the fact that any involvement in these attacks would constitute a major betrayal of trust,” he said.

“Obviously, there were actions that were taken for the benefit of the agency that were very swift and very decisive in terms of dealing with the individuals who had been named at first, and now it's good to have all of the information available,” he added.

Referring to the Gaza war, Mr. Haq also underlined the importance of remembering that a “huge number” of UNRWA staff have been taking enormous risks for months, keeping hundreds of thousands of people alive, whether in shelters or by providing food and services.

“And we want to make sure that the reputation of our UNRWA staff, our dedicated staff, including about 200 people who have lost their lives since 7 October, is fully recognized and that UNRWA gets the support that it needs,” he said."
Nine UNRWA staff will be fired for potential role in the 7 October attacks on Israel.,https://apnews.com/article/un-unrwa-staffers-fired-oct-7-cc33d0ab25dc4bacc0af1db10705e0d6,"JERUSALEM (AP) — The United Nations said Monday it has fired additional staff members from its agency for Palestinian refugees after an internal investigation found they may have been involved in the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack against Israel.

The U.N. secretary-general’s office announced the move in a brief statement to journalists. Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson for the secretary-general, did not elaborate on the UNRWA staffers’ likely role in the attack or on the evidence that prompted its decision.

UNRWA previously fired 12 staffers and put seven staffers on administrative leave without pay over the claims. The group of nine staffers the U.N. announced it had fired Monday includes some from each group, said Juliette Touma, communications director for UNRWA.

The U.N. did not clarify how many have now been fired from the agency in total.

The U.N.’s internal watchdog has been investigating the agency since Israel in January accused 12 UNRWA staffers of being involved in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, in which militants killed 1,200 people and abducted some 250 others.

Israel’s allegations initially led top donor countries to suspend their funding for UNRWA. That caused a cash crunch of about $450 million dollars. Since then, all donor countries except for the US have decided to resume funding.

Oren Marmorstein, the spokesperson for Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, wrote on X following the announcement of the firings that Israel was again calling for donor countries to suspend funding “as the funds may go to terrorist elements.”

“UNRWA is part of the problem and not part of the solution, and anyone who seeks the best interests of Israel, the Gaza Strip and the region should act to replace UNWRA’s activities with other agencies,” he wrote.

The U.N. watchdog charged with investigating UNRWA, called the Office of Internal Oversight Services, said it drew on evidence provided by Israel in discussions with Israeli authorities. It said it could not independently corroborate that evidence since it did not have direct access to it. The investigators also reviewed internal UNRWA information, including staff records, email and other communications data.

It said it found sufficient evidence pointing to nine employees’ potential involvement in the Oct. 7 attack.

An Israeli official with knowledge of the discussions, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the media, said that Israeli authorities spent hours on each accused UNRWA staffer when briefing U.N. investigators on their findings.

“I have decided that in the case of these remaining nine staff members, they cannot work for UNRWA,” the agency’s head Philippe Lazzarini said in a statement.

“The agency’s priority is to continue lifesaving and critical services for Palestine refugees in Gaza and across the region, especially in the face of the ongoing war, the instability and risk of regional escalation,” said Lazzarini, who also said he condemned the Oct. 7 attack.

In nine other cases, the evidence was insufficient, and in one other case there was no evidence pointing to involvement.

UNRWA has been the main agency distributing aid to Palestinians in Gaza during the 10-month old war there, which Gaza Health officials say has killed over 39,600 people and unleashed a mass humanitarian catastrophe.

Israel has escalated calls for the agency’s shutdown since the war began. It has long accused UNRWA of collaborating with Hamas and turning a blind eye to the militant group’s activities. Throughout the war, it has released images of tunnels built next to UNRWA facilities and charged that many more UNRWA staffers than those who have been fired are members of militant groups.

During the war, far-right protesters demonstrating against the agency have set portions of the its facility in Jerusalem ablaze.

UNRWA denies collaborating with Hamas. The agency says that more than 200 UNRWA staffers have been killed, and 190 of the agency’s installations have been damaged during the war — including U.N.-run schools that have been turned into shelters for displaced Palestinians.

Nine UNRWA staff will be fired for potential role in the 7 October attacks on Israel.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/08/05/unrwa-october-7-israel-hamas-gaza/,"The United Nations has officially closed its internal investigation of Israeli allegations that staff members of UNRWA, the main U.N. relief agency in Gaza, participated in the Oct. 7 Hamas invasion of southern Israel after determining that nine of 19 accused “may have been involved” in the attack. The nine have been fired, according to U.N. statements.

Investigators determined there was “insufficient” evidence to support Israel’s charges against another nine of the accused, and “no evidence” against one, a spokesman for Secretary General António Guterres said Monday.

The Israeli allegations, initially made in January, led more than a dozen countries to suspend support donations to UNRWA. All except the United States, which in the past has supplied at least a third of all UNRWA funding, have since resumed their support. After the Biden administration paused U.S. funding, Congress voted to eliminate all donations to the agency until at least March 2025.

The report by the U.N. Office of Internal Oversight Services remains confidential, although member states can ask to see it. Asked Monday about the U.N. statements on its conclusions, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said he would have no comment until the administration has a “chance to review” the document.

Israel has long accused UNRWA, and the United Nations in general, of being biased. Since the October attack, which sparked the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, senior Israeli officials have used numbers ranging from dozens to thousands in charging that UNRWA is an instrument of Hamas.

For its part, UNRWA has charged that Israel has long sought to eliminate the agency, whose official mission is to care for Palestinian “refugees.” Israel claims that Palestinians forced to leave their homes at the creation of the Israeli state in 1948 and in subsequent territorial wars — totaling, with their descendants, almost 6 million — should not be classified as refugees.

In addition to Gaza, UNRWA also provides education, health care and humanitarian aid to Palestinians in the West Bank, East Jerusalem, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan. Of its 30,000 employees, 13,000 work in Gaza. More than 200 have been killed in ongoing Israeli attacks, according to the United Nations.

“The U.N. is incapable of running a state-like enterprise in Gaza without being infiltrated by terrorist organizations,” the Israeli government said in a statement last week. “UNRWA in Gaza can and should be replaced, without hampering the humanitarian assistance … Donor countries that continue to fund UNRWA are indirectly funding Hamas.”

Amid an escalating humanitarian crisis in Gaza, UNRWA and other international aid agencies have accused Israel of blocking assistance to more than 2 million Gazans, most of whom have relocated numerous times inside the enclave to try to avoid Israeli fighting. Israel has countered by calling UNRWA “incompetent” and accusing Hamas of looting aid convoys. The United States, along with the aid agencies, have rejected those charges and called on Israel to allow more assistance to enter Gaza.

The OIOS report appeared to have added fuel to the long-standing war of both actions and words between Israel and the United Nations. In a statement Monday, Israel’s ambassador, Gilad Erdan, called the investigation “a disgrace.” According to Israeli media, he said the document “ignored the thousands of agency employees involved in Hamas terrorism.”

Calling for UNRWA to be shut down, Erdan said that Israel “gave the U.N. the precise details on over 100 UNRWA employees who are members of Hamas.”

In his own statement on the report, UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini said that only 19 cases were ever brought to U.N. attention by Israel. He has previously charged Israel with an “insidious” campaign to destroy UNWRA and has repeatedly said that Israel refused to supply evidence of its charges.

The OIOS investigation, Lazzarini said, found that “in one case, no evidence was obtained by OIOS to support the allegations of the staff member’s involvement. That staff member has rejoined the Agency.

“In nine other cases, the evidence obtained by OIOS was insufficient to support the staff members’ involvement and the OIOS investigation of them is now closed.”

“For the remaining nine cases, the evidence — if authenticated and corroborated — could indicate that the UNRWA staff members may have been involved in the attacks of 7 October. I have decided in the case of the remaining nine staff members, they cannot work for UNRWA. All contracts of these staff members will be terminated in the interest of the Agency.”

In a briefing at the United Nations, Guterres spokesman Farhan Haq said that as part of its investigation, OIOS investigators held discussions with Israeli officials, examined UNRWA documents and records, reviewed technical information, communications data and public sources.

“However,” Haq said, “one thing I’d like to point out is that since information used by Israeli officials to support the allegations have remained in Israeli custody, OIOS was not able to independently authenticate most of the information provided to it.”

Asked about the U.N. public wording that the nine “may have been involved” in the Hamas attack, Haq indicated that his hands were tied in offering more information because of the confidential nature of the finding. “That is my words as summarizing the investigation’s words. But it is the words I’ve been given to tell you which have been very precisely written for me.”"
Nine UNRWA staff will be fired for potential role in the 7 October attacks on Israel.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/world/middleeast/unrwa-oct-7-attack.html,"U.N. investigators cleared 10 employees of a Palestinian refugee agency in Gaza accused of taking part in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, but nine others were fired because of possible involvement, the United Nations said.

The investigators found evidence that the employees “may have been involved” in the attack, which set off the war in the Gaza Strip, the U.N. said. It said they had been fired “in the interests of the agency.”

The investigation’s conclusion appeared to bring to a close, for now at least, a controversy that began after Israel leveled the alarming accusations in January against the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA. The allegations led dozens of donor nations to suspend hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for the agency, threatening to hobble its aid operations in Gaza.

With 13,000 staff members in the embattled territory, UNRWA has been key to efforts to provide shelter, food and other basic services to Gazans during nine months of war that has displaced most of the territory’s 2.2 million people. Tens of thousands have been killed, according to Gaza’s health authorities."

An Israeli intelligence document shared in January with CBS News and a number of other Western news outlets detailed the allegations against a dozen U.N. employees. The document claimed seven staff members stormed into Israeli territory during the Oct. 7 attack, with two staffers allegedly participating in kidnappings.

The U.N.'s internal watchdog has been investigating the agency since Israel in January accused 12 UNRWA staffers of being involved in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel in which militants killed 1,200 people and abducted some 250 others.

Israel's allegations initially led top donor countries, including the U.S., to suspend their funding for UNRWA, the main agency providing aid to Palestinians in Gaza amid the 10-month old war there. The U.S., the largest funder of the agency, said in January that it would temporarily pause funding while the allegations against staffers were reviewed. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller at the time said the U.S. was ""extremely troubled"" by the reports, while Secretary of State Antony Blinken told U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres that ""there must be complete accountability for anyone who participated in the heinous attacks.""

The pause in funding caused a cash crunch of about $450 million dollars. Since then, all donor countries except for the U.S. have decided to resume funding.

About 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages in the unprecedented assault last autumn. Since the attack, the Israeli military operation in Gaza has killed more than 38,400 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

He said the UN had completed an investigation following allegations by Israel that UNRWA staff were involved.

All nine would have their employment terminated, said UN deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq.

Nine staff members at the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, may have been involved in the 7 October Hamas-led attack on Israel, the United Nations says.

Why are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza?

Mr Haq did not specify what the men's precise involvement may have been.

""For us, any participation in the attacks is a tremendous betrayal of the sort of work that we are supposed to be doing on behalf of the Palestinian people,"" he said.

An Israeli Defense Forces spokeperson said the report showed UNRWA had hit a ""new low"".

The UN investigated 19 members of UNRWA staff in all, after Israel alleged that 12 took part in the attack.

Israel later claimed that more than 450 UNRWA staff were members of terrorist groups, but a UN review published in April found Israel had not provided evidence for its claims.

Aside from the nine employees who the UN said may have had links to the 7 October attack, its report found no evidence of involvement in one case, and insufficient evidence in the case of nine others.

UNRWA, which employs 13,000 people in Gaza, said in March that some of its employees reported being pressured by Israeli authorities into making false statements while in detention.

Most countries withdrew funding for the UN agency because of the Israeli allegations.

In July, the UK joined other countries that had resumed funding since then, leaving the US, UNRWA's single biggest donor, as the only country not to have restarted donations.

UNRWA has provided aid for Palestinian refugees since 1949."

The UN secretary-general's office announced the move in a brief statement to journalists.

Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson for the secretary-general, did not elaborate on the UNRWA staffers' likely role in the attack or on the evidence that prompted its decision.

The nine fired included some staffers who previously had been fired over the claims, Haq said, but he did not clarify how many.

The agency previously fired seven employees over the allegations.

The UN's internal watchdog has been investigating the agency since Israel in January accused 12 UNRWA staffers of being involved in the October 7 attack on Israel, in which militants killed 1200 people and abducted some 250 others.

Israel's allegations initially led top donor countries to suspend their funding for UNRWA.

Since then, all donor countries except for the US have decided to resume funding.

The UN watchdog charged with investigating UNRWA, called the Office of Internal Oversight Services, said it drew on evidence provided by Israel in discussions with Israeli authorities.

It said it could not independently corroborate that evidence since it did not have direct access to it.

The investigators also reviewed internal UNRWA information, including staff records, email and other communications data.

It said it found sufficient evidence pointing to nine employees' potential involvement in the October 7 attack.

""I have decided that in the case of these remaining nine staff members, they cannot work for UNRWA,"" the agency's head Philippe Lazzarini said in a statement.

""The agency's priority is to continue lifesaving and critical services for Palestine refugees in Gaza and across the region, especially in the face of the ongoing war, the instability and risk of regional escalation,"" said Lazzarini, who also said he condemned the October 7 attack.

In nine other cases, the evidence was insufficient, and in one other case there was no evidence pointing to involvement.

UNRWA has been the main agency distributing aid to Palestinians in Gaza during the 10-month old war there, which Gaza Health officials say has killed over 39,600 people and unleashed a mass humanitarian catastrophe.

Israel has long accused UNRWA of collaborating with Hamas and turning a blind eye to the militant group's activities. Throughout the war, it has released images of tunnels built next to UNRWA facilities.

During the war, the feud has escalated, with far-right protests setting portions of the agency's facility in Jerusalem ablaze and calling for the agency's shutdown.

UNRWA denies collaborating with Hamas.

The agency says that more than 200 UNRWA staffers have been killed, and 190 of the agency's installations have been damaged during the war — including UN-run schools that have been turned into shelters for displaced Palestinians."

Nine staff members of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) may have been involved in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks on Israel, and they will be fired, the UN said on Monday.

The UN secretary general's office announced the move in a brief statement to journalists. It did not elaborate on the UNRWA staffers' likely role in the attack.

""For nine people, the evidence was sufficient to conclude that they may have been involved in the seventh of October attacks,"" said Farhan Haq, the deputy spokesperson for the UN secretary general.

He was referring to findings of the UN's Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS), which he said had completed its investigation into the alleged involvement of 19 UNRWA staff members in the attacks.

The OIOS said it drew on evidence provided by Israel in discussions with Israeli authorities. It said it could not independently corroborate that evidence since it did not have direct access to it.

UNRWA previously fired 12 staffers and put seven on administrative leave without pay over the claims. The group of nine staffers the UN announced it had fired Monday includes some from each group, said Juliette Touma, communications director for UNRWA. The UN did not clarify how many have now been fired from the agency in total.

The UN's internal watchdog has been investigating the agency since Israel in January accused 12 UNRWA staffers of being involved in the Oct. 7 attacks, in which Palestinian militants killed 1,200 people and took some 250 others into Hamas-controlled Gaza, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's subsequent siege on Gaza has killed more than 39,500 people, according to the enclave's Health Ministry.

Israel stepped up its accusations in March, saying more than 450 UNRWA staff were military operatives in Gaza terrorist groups. UNRWA employs 32,000 people across its area of operations, 13,000 of them in Gaza.

UNRWA said in March that some employees released into Gaza from Israeli detention reported having been pressured by Israeli authorities into falsely stating that the agency has Hamas links and that staff took part in the Oct. 7 attacks.

Israel's allegations initially led top donor countries to suspend their funding for UNRWA, the main agency providing aid to Palestinians in Gaza amid the 10-month-old war there. That caused a cash crunch of about $450 million US. Since then, all donor countries except the United States have decided to resume funding."
Nine UNRWA staff will be fired for potential role in the 7 October attacks on Israel.,https://dailycaller.com/2024/08/05/un-agency-staffers-likely-participated-oct7-terrorist-attacks-against-israel/,"Nine United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) employees were “likely” involved in the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks in Israel, a United Nations spokesperson confirmed to a reporter during a press conference on Monday.

The UN Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) investigated 19 UNRWA staffers for potential involvement in the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks against Israel and found that nine may have participated, UN deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq said at the press conference. The UN did not provide details on what actions the employees may have carried out, but noted that they would be fired from their roles.

“For nine people, the evidence was sufficient to conclude that they may have been involved in the seventh of October attacks,” Haq said. (RELATED: Judge Rejects Biden Admin’s Effort To Dismiss Case Alleging It Funded Palestinian Terrorists)

Multiple reporters in the room pressed Haq over what he meant by “may,” with one asking if he could “say that these nine people likely or highly likely were part of the attacks.” Haq responded that was “a good way of describing it.”

OIOS’ investigation followed accusations from Israel that 12 UNRWA staff members participated in Hamas’ attacks, according to Reuters. Some of the evidence reviewed by OIOS is in Israeli custody and could not be independently verified by the UN, but the organization had “sufficient information” to make its decision, Haq said.

The UN did not conduct live interviews of the accused staffers, but in some cases, did receive video testimonies, Haq said.

The final report on UNRWA staff involvement in the Oct. 7 attacks will remain confidential for legal reasons, Haq said.

Israel’s more recent allegations stretch far beyond what the UN investigated, with the state saying in March that over 450 UNRWA staff were affiliated with terrorist groups in Gaza, Reuters reported. UNRWA has 32,000 total employees, 13,000 of whom are stationed in Gaza.

"Iran has decided to attack Israel, Foreign Minister Katz says.",https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-813400,"Iran has decided to attack Israel, Foreign Minister Israel Katz said Monday amid an intense diplomatic push to avoid any further military action that could spark a direct war between the Islamic Republic and the Jewish state.

Iran’s message was delivered to Israel by Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó, who called Katz to explain that he had received this information from acting Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri.

“Iran has informed us that it intends to attack Israel,” Katz said.

“The world should exact a price from Iran for any aggressive action it carries out,” he added.

In a conversation Bagheri held with his Bahraini counterpart, Abdullatif bin Rashid Alzayani, he spoke about his country’s determination to respond to the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week.

Israel has not claimed responsibility for the attack, but it is widely presumed to have carried it out.

“Silence toward the expanding evil acts of the Zionist regime will be detrimental to the regional stability,” Bagheri wrote on X, formerly Twitter, adding that “indifference to its recent moves is tantamount to giving the regime an incentive.”

The United States said it believed an Iranian attack could come within the next 48 hours. There is a fear that Iran could coordinate its attack with its proxy groups, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, and others in Syria and Iraq.

Israel has claimed responsibility for the attack last week that killed Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut.

Biden set to meet with national security team

US President Joe Biden was expected to meet Monday afternoon with his national security team to discuss the situation. US CENTCOM Commander Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla visited Israel on Monday and met with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi.

Gallant said the visit was “a direct translation of US support for Israel into action. The relationship between Israel and the United States is unshakable. We discussed the coordination of defense activities and ways to expand the international coalition facing aggressive actions by Iran and its proxies.”

In April, the United States, Israel, Jordan, the United Kingdom, and France defended Israel from a direct Iranian attack. Saudi Arabia lent tacit support to the coalition.

It is presumed that the US is attempting to coalesce the same five militaries even as it is scrambling to thwart an attack or at the very least limit its scope.

Saudi Arabia has said it would not allow Iranian missiles or drones to move through its airspace, according to media reports.

Jordan has said it wants its airspace to remain neutral, according to media reports. Biden and King Abdullah spoke Monday about regional tensions.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday spoke to Qatari Prime Minister Al Thani and Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty about the regional tensions. This followed conversations with his counterparts in the G7 countries and with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia’ Al Sudani on Sunday.

“The secretary has delivered a consistent message in all of these engagements,” US State Department Matthew Miller told reporters in Washington on Monday. “We are at a critical moment for the region. It is important that all parties take steps over the coming days to refrain from escalation and calm tensions.

“Escalation is in no one’s interest. It’s not in the interest of any one country. It’s not in the interest of the region, and it’s certainly not in the interest of the millions of civilians who just want to live their lives free from violence and conflict,” Miller said.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Monday said Tehran was determined to expand relations with its “strategic partner Russia,” Iranian state media reported.

Sergei Shoigu, the secretary of Russia’s Security Council, is visiting Iran and met with Pezeshkian and senior Iranian security officials as the Islamic Republic weighs its response to Haniyeh’s assassination.

“Russia is among the countries that have stood by the Iranian nation during difficult times,” Pezeshkian told Shoigu, Iranian state media reported.

Pezeshkian said shared positions between Iran and Russia “in promoting a multipolar world will certainly lead to greater global security and peace.”

Russia has condemned the killing of Haniyeh and has called on all parties to refrain from steps that could tip the Middle East into a wider regional war.

Pezeshkian said Israel’s “criminal actions” in Gaza and the assassination of Haniyeh “are clear examples of the violation of all international laws and regulations.”

Shoigu was Russia’s defense minister before being moved to the Security Council in May. He also met with R.-Adm. Ali Akbar Ahmadian, a senior Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commander who serves as secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, Russia’s Zvezda television reported.

Although Russian President Vladimir Putin has yet to comment in public on the recent escalation of tensions in the Middle East, senior Russian officials have said those behind the killing of Haniyeh were seeking to scuttle any hope of peace in the Middle East and to draw the United States into military action.

Russia has cultivated closer ties with Iran since the start of its war with Ukraine and has said it is preparing to sign a wide-ranging cooperation agreement with the Islamic state.

Iran has provided Russia with a large number of powerful surface-to-surface ballistic missiles, Reuters reported in February.

Regarding Shoigu’s talks in Tehran, Miller said the US had no expectations that Russia would play a productive role in easing Middle East tensions.

Iran communicated to Israel that it plans on attacking after almost a week of vowing to retaliate against Israel for the assassination of Hamas terror leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, according to a Monday note given to Israeli Foreign Minister Yisrael Katz.

Though the decision is not a surprise, it comes amid a strong international push to lower tensions and avoid an all-out war with Israel, Iran and the latter’s terrorist proxy groups, including Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and others. Iran stated earlier Monday that it plans on “punishing” Israel but does not want a full-scale war to develop. Earlier reports indicated that Iran would choose Tisha B’av to attack.

The Iranian message was delivered to Katz by Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó, who said that he had received notice from acting Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri, Reuters reported.

“Iran has informed us that it intends to attack Israel,” Katz said. “The world should exact a price from Iran for any aggressive action it carries out,” he added.

The U.S., which has exerted efforts to deescalate the situation, said that an Iranian attack could occur within 48 hours.

The United States said it believed an Iranian attack could come within the next 48 hours. President Joe Biden is expected to meet Monday with national security advisors, and U.S. CENTCOM Commander Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla met with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi earlier Monday.

Jordan and Saudi Arabia reportedly told Iran that it should not cross into their airspaces if they attack Israel; in April, Jordan, along with the U.S and European allies, held off a barrage of missiles and drones that Iran had sent to Israel. Such an alliance is likely to reform should Iran follow through with its plans.

The Jerusalem Post reports that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke to Qatari Prime Minister Al Thani and Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty on Monday regarding the volatile situation. He held similar conversation with the G7 countries and Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia’ Al Sudani the day before.

“The secretary has delivered a consistent message in all of these engagements,” U.S. State Department Matthew Miller told reporters in Washington on Monday. “We are at a critical moment for the region. It is important that all parties take steps over the coming days to refrain from escalation and calm tensions.

“Escalation is in no one’s interest. It’s not in the interest of any one country. It’s not in the interest of the region, and it’s certainly not in the interest of the millions of civilians who just want to live their lives free from violence and conflict,” Miller said.

Going beyond the Middle East, Iran hinted out to potential Russian support of the Islamic country. Newly inaugurated Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said he would expand its relationship with Iran’s “strategic partner Russia,” according to Iranian state media, as Sergei Shoigu, secretary of Russia’s Security Council, is visiting Iran.

“Russia is among the countries that have stood by the Iranian nation during difficult times,” Pezeshkian told Shoigu, according to Iranian state media. Iran, for its part, has supplied Russia with munitions during the latter’s invasion of Ukraine."

During the meeting, Biden, 81, and Vice President Kamala Harris were informed that the timing of an expected attack on Israel by Iran and Hezbollah remains unclear, as is what the strike could look like, US officials told Axios.

The guidance provided to Biden and Harris, 59, is seemingly at odds with what Secretary of State Antony Blinken told his counterparts from the G7 countries on Sunday, when he reportedly warned foreign ministers that Iran and Hezbollah could launch an attack on the Jewish State within 48 hours.

US intelligence now suggests that strikes from Hezbollah, Iran and its proxy groups could come in two different waves, according to the outlet.

Biden and Harris were reportedly told in the Situation Room that it remains unknown which group will strike first and how significant that attack could be.

A US official described Iran and Hezbollah’s plans for retaliation against Israel as a “work in progress,” according to Axios, but the Pentagon expects attacks against US troops in the MIddle East by Iran-backed groups to ramp up in the coming days.

Biden had talked by phone earlier in the day with Jordan’s King Abdullah about the dire situation.

At least two rockets were later fired at the Ain al-Asad base in western Iraq, where US troops are stationed, sources told Reuters.

“Several’’ Americans were injured in the attack, the outlet said.

“The President and Vice President were briefed on the attack at Al Asad Air Base in Iraq,’’ the White House said in a statement after the administration’s huddle.

“They discussed the steps we are taking to defend our forces and respond to any attack against our personnel in a manner and place of our choosing.

“They were updated on U.S. military efforts to support the defense of Israel should it be attacked again.

They were also briefed on continued diplomatic efforts to de-escalate regional tension and to bring the ceasefire and hostage release deal to a conclusion,’’ the statement said.

The moves came as Israel’s foreign minister, Israel Katz, said he was informed that Iran has decided it will definitely attack the Jewish state.

Katz said he received the message from Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó, who told him he was informed of the impending assault by acting Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri, the Jerusalem Post reported.

“Iran has informed us that it intends to attack Israel,” Katz sai

Iran says it needs to avenge the Israeli assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the top political chief and negotiator for Iranian ally and Palestinian terror group Hamas, on its own soil, Tehran, last week.

Israel also is facing an expected attack from Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon in retribution for the killing of one of their commanders, Fuad Shukr, in Lebanon around the same time."

On Sunday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned his G7 counterparts that that an attack by Iran and Hezbollah against Israel could start as early as Monday, Axios reported. Times of Israel reported that PM Benjamin Netanyahu-led government could sanction a preemptive strike on Iran.

Lebanese group Hezbollah said it launched a drone attack early Monday on northern Israel that the Israeli military said wounded two Israeli troops. The violence came amid fears of an all-out regional war following the killings last week of a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon and Hamas’ top political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.

"Iran has decided to attack Israel, Foreign Minister Katz says.",https://ca.news.yahoo.com/israel-rages-ireland-spain-norway-105938803.html,"Ireland, Spain, and Norway on Wednesday said they will officially recognize a Palestinian state in a historic move that was met with a predictably furious response by Israel as it faces mounting international condemnation over its war with Hamas in Gaza.

Although the majority of countries in the world already recognize a sovereign state of Palestine, most in Western Europe, along with the U.S., do not. The news of the latest additions—whose formal recognition will begin Tuesday—was welcomed by Palestinian officials as a highly symbolic victory for their people and derided by the government of Israel, which wasted no time in excoriating the decision.

Benjamin Netanyahu Denies Starving Gazans Amid Near-Famine Conditions

Writing on X before Spain announced its decision to join Norway and Ireland, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said he had ordered the “immediate recall” of his country’s ambassadors to Oslo and Dublin.

“Today’s decision sends a message to the Palestinians and the world: Terrorism pays,” Katz wrote. “After the Hamas terror organization carried out the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, after committing heinous sexual crimes witnessed by the world, these countries chose to reward Hamas and Iran by recognizing a Palestinian state.”

He also slammed the “distorted step” as an injustice to the victims of Hamas’ Oct. 7 terror attacks—which sparked the current war in Gaza—and said it would act as “a blow to efforts to return the 128 hostages.” Katz also claimed the decision represents a “boost to Hamas and Iran’s jihadists, which undermines the chance for peace and questions Israel’s right to self-defense.”

“Israel will not remain silent—there will be further severe consequences,” Katz wrote. “If Spain follows through on its intention to recognize a Palestinian state, a similar step will be taken against it.” He added that Israel would not be deterred by the “Irish-Norwegian folly.”

Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre announced his government’s decision by arguing that a “lasting solution to the conflict in the Middle East is only achieved through a two-state solution.” “There can be no two-state solution without a Palestinian state. In other words, a Palestinian state is a prerequisite for achieving peace in the Middle East,” he said.

Gahr Støre also said he would “take note” of Israel’s decision to recall its ambassador. “This is a government with which we have many disagreements,” he said, according to the Associated Press. “What we agree on is to condemn Hamas’s cruel attack on Oct. 7.”

Simon Harris, the Irish Taoiseach—a head of government position equivalent to that of a prime minister—said Ireland was similarly recognizing Palestine “as a nation among nations” to “keep the hope of that two-state solution alive.” He also said Ireland was “honored” to make the recognition at the same time as Spain and Norway, remaining hopeful that “others will do the same in the next wave.”

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, meanwhile, insisted that the recognition “is not against Israel” or the Jewish people, nor is it “in favor of Hamas,” but rather it is in favor of “peace and coexistence,” he said, the BBC reports. He added that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is “still playing deaf ears” and “still bombing hospitals and schools and punishing women and children with hunger and cold.”

Netanyahu has yet to personally respond to the development. Earlier this week, the prosecutor for the International Criminal Court requested an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and his defense minister over alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity relating to the war in Gaza. Netanyahu slammed the “outrageous” move, accusing the ICC prosecutor of making “blood libels” and “callously pouring gasoline on the fires of antisemitism that are raging across the world.”

He has long opposed the establishment of a Palestinian state, hailing an overwhelming Knesset vote in February rejecting any “unilateral” recognition of such a state as a clear statement that Israel “will not reward terrorism by unilateral recognition in response to the October 7 massacre, nor will we accept imposed solutions” amid rising international clamor for new talks on Palestinian statehood. Netanyahu said the formation of Palestinian state “would not only fail to bring peace but would endanger the state of Israel.”

Mahmoud Abbas, the president of Palestinian Authority, welcomed the decisions of Ireland, Spain, and Norway. In a statement reported by the Wafa news agency, Abbas called on other countries yet to recognize the state of Palestine to “acknowledge the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and restore confidence in a global system based on rules and equal rights for all the peoples of the earth.”

Lebanon grapples with fear and tough choices as regional war looms.,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/5/lebanese-grapple-with-fear-rage-and-tough-choices-as-regional-war-looms,"As the spectre of a major war looms over Lebanon, civilians are bracing for the worst-case scenario.

Beirut, Lebanon – On July 27, Loubna El-Amine was waiting to board a connecting flight from Romania to Lebanon’s capital Beirut, having travelled from her family’s home in the United Kingdom.

As boarding started, El-Amine received news that a projectile had killed 12 Druze children and young people in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Israel blamed the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, which denied responsibility for the incident.

Fearing how Israel would respond, El-Amine, a Lebanese-American, discussed with her husband whether to board with their three children or not.

Moments later, they got on the plane.

Shortly after they arrived in Beirut, Israel assassinated one of Hezbollah’s top commanders, Fuad Shukr, by launching a rocket into a residential building in Dahiyeh, a district in southern Beirut. They then killed Hamas’s political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Iran’s capital Tehran during the inauguration of President Masoud Pezeshkian.

Both assassinations have pushed the region to the brink of an all-out war. Iran and Hezbollah have both vowed to retaliate against Israel, likely via a coordinated attack alongside other Iranian-allied armed groups in the region, analysts have previously told Al Jazeera.

The shadow of a major war has compelled El-Amine and her husband to cut their trip short and book a flight to Turkey for August 10, while some commercial flights are still available.

“Even if there doesn’t end up being direct danger, we had to think if we really wanted to put our children through this level of stress,” El-Amine, 40, told Al Jazeera from a cafe in Hamra, a bustling district in Beirut.

Fear and rage

El-Amine is one of millions of Lebanese civilians wrestling with life-and-death decisions as they wait anxiously to see if a major conflict with Israel will devour their tiny country, which has under six million people and lies to Israel’s north.

Many are trying to live day-to-day despite the growing fear that a broader conflict is imminent, while also holding faint hope that regional tensions won’t boil over.

“The tensions feel different this time [since the Israeli assassination],” El-Amine said, in resignation. “But a part of me hopes that maybe there will be a ceasefire tomorrow, somehow.”

Since October 8, Hezbollah has engaged Israel in a low-level conflict in a stated attempt to “reduce pressure” on Hamas in Gaza, where Israel has killed about 40,000 people and displaced nearly the entire 2.3 million population.

Israel’s war on Gaza began after a Hamas-led attack on Israeli military outposts and communities on October 7, in which 1,139 people were killed and 250 were taken captive.

Hezbollah has repeatedly promised to stop attacking Israel if a ceasefire is secured in Gaza, but despite negotiations ongoing for months, no deal has been agreed.

In Lebanon, the blame for that is largely placed on Israel, with the perception that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government does not actually want an agreement, and wants to continue the war in Gaza, and expand it to the wider region.

In light of that, many Lebanese civilians see continued Western support for Israel as a moral failure and cannot bring themselves to escape to Europe or North America.

“I do not want to go and pay taxes to these murderers,” said Majd Akaar, a software engineer working from a cafe in Hamra. “It would also feel very wrong on a fundamental level to leave right now, as if I’m abandoning Lebanon and my people.”

Akaar acknowledged that he has some trepidation about what could befall Lebanon in a regional war. He described a recent traumatising call with a friend in south Lebanon, which has suffered the brunt of Israel’s attacks since October.

They were on a video call when his friend showed him an ordnance that fell near his home and then suddenly exploded.

“I remember just hearing her screaming. I panicked until she called me back 10 minutes later,” recalled Akaar, 36.

Resignation

In a small bedding and furniture store on the corner of Hamra Street, Sirine Sinou said that her family can’t possibly leave Lebanon or else they will lose their business.

She added that her husband and two children are not taking major precautions – such as buying food or house supplies in bulk – in case a larger war breaks out.

“We did that during the coronavirus [COVID-19 pandemic] and then we ended up throwing out so much stuff,” she told Al Jazeera. “Whatever is written [our fate], is going to happen.”

In the event that Israel begins bombing neighbourhoods and civilian structures in Beirut – a strategy Israel calls the “Dahiya doctrine” in reference to the Dahiyeh/Dahiya neighbourhood, and which it used in the 2006 war against Hezbollah – then Sinou and her family may head to their small ancestral village in north Lebanon, which is far from the capital.

Assad Georges, 21, is another who says he is staying put in his hometown of Zahle – which is about 55 kilometres (34 miles) from Beirut – if a major conflict erupts.

On Monday afternoon, he spoke to Al Jazeera while waiting with his girlfriend to have lunch with his parents in Hamra. They held hands as Georges spoke about the terrifying sounds of war that he frequently hears in his town.

“There is nothing too serious happening in Zahle now, but we do often hear bombs and sonic booms hitting towns to the west of us,” he told Al Jazeera.

Minutes before his parents walked into the restaurant, Georges said that civilians have been on edge for months due to the cycle of tensions mounting and then simmering down.

However, he does believe that a wider conflict now looms over Lebanon.

“With the US and UK sending warships [to the coast of Israel], it feels like they are preparing for something to happen,” he said, clasping his girlfriend’s hand.

“Now that Israel is almost finished in Gaza, I think their next plan is to try and get rid of Hezbollah.”"
Lebanon grapples with fear and tough choices as regional war looms.,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/5/israel-returns-decomposed-bodies-of-89-palestinians-to-gaza,"Government Media Office in Gaza says Israel has ‘stolen’ 2,000 bodies since October 7 and sent some of them in ‘an inhumane manner’.

Israel has returned the bodies of nearly 90 Palestinians killed in its military offensive in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian Ministry of Health has said.

Yamen Abu Suleiman, the director of the Palestinian Civil Emergency Service in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, said on Monday that it was unclear whether the bodies had been dug up from cemeteries by the army during the ground offensive, or whether they were “detainees who had been tortured and killed”.

“The occupation provided us with no information about the names, or ages, or anything. This is a war crime, a crime against humanity,” Abu Suleiman said.

He said the bodies would be examined in an attempt to determine the causes of death and to identify them, before being buried in a mass grave at a cemetery near Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis.

Gaza’s Government Media Office said Israel had sent 89 bodies as “bones and decomposed bodies in an inhumane manner”.

It said Israeli forces had “stolen” 2,000 bodies since October 7 from dozens of cemeteries, which they bulldozed during their ongoing military offensive.

The office added that Israeli forces also previously dug up graves in Khan Younis, Jabalia and the Tuffah neighbourhood in Gaza City, and transferred the bodies to “unknown places”, an action amounting to a war crime and a crime against humanity.

It said Israeli forces continue to hold dozens of bodies.

Hamas said in a statement the bodies were handed over in “a state of complete decomposition, without any ability to determine their identities”.

“It highlights the sadism of the [Israeli] occupation and the level of crime committed by the Nazi occupation army, which is unprecedented in human history,” it said.

There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the return of the bodies. In the past, Israel has said it returned bodies after checks that they were not Israeli hostages who had been held by Hamas since the October 7 attack on Israel.

No ceasefire deal

In Jerusalem, the Israeli Hostages and Missing Families Forum asked why Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would allow the handover of Palestinian bodies without a ceasefire deal with Hamas.

“Why are bodies being returned outside the framework of a comprehensive deal? Such an agreement could bring back living hostages for rehabilitation and the deceased for proper burial,” the group said in a statement.

Rocketing regional tensions are increasing the desperation of families and friends of the remaining 111 captives, including 39 known to be dead, taken during the October 7 attack.

Critics say Netanyahu, who is facing a corruption trial, prefers to prolong the conflict rather than agree a deal that could upset his hardline coalition partners and tip him out of office."

UK prime minister talks of a ‘standing army’ of police to deal with riots.,https://apnews.com/article/britain-riots-asylum-seekers-violence-a391b4513c41fe4de3806b28ee0c1740,"LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Monday that a “standing army” of specialist police would be set up to deal with rioting and that the justice system would be ramped up to handle hundreds of arrests after violent disorder rocked cities across the nation over the past week.

Starmer convened an urgent meeting after lawlessness he blamed on “far-right thuggery” that was driven in part by misinformation on social media that whipped up anger over a stabbing rampage at a dance class that killed three girls and wounded 10 people. False rumors spread online that the suspect was a Muslim asylum-seeker led to attacks on immigrants and mosques.

“Whatever the apparent motivation, this is not protest. It is pure violence and we will not tolerate attacks on mosques or our Muslim communities,” Starmer said. “The full force of the law will be visited on all those who are identified as having taken part in these activities.”

On Sunday, angry mobs attacked two hotels used to house asylum seekers, breaking windows and lighting fires before police dispersed the crowds and residents were evacuated. Dozens of police officers have been hospitalized for injuries in the past six days after being struck with bricks, bottles and large wooden posts.

More than 375 people have been arrested in the mayhem so far and more are expected, the National Police Chiefs’ Council said.

Many made court appearances Monday and found themselves facing at least several weeks behind bars awaiting their next court hearing.

AP AUDIO: UK prime minister talks of ‘standing army’ of police to deal with rioting across Britain AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports on new British government measures aimed at dealing with the violent unrest.

Deputy District Judge Liam McStay in Belfast Magistrates’ Court refused bail for two men who had participated in a march that trashed businesses and set a supermarket on fire in the capital of Northern Ireland. He said he couldn’t allow that to be repeated and “visited on other people.”

“The events at the weekend were absolutely disgraceful: a concerted and deliberate attempt to undermine public order and to then domineer the community and there were racist elements to it,” McStay said. “The message has to be if you allow yourself to become involved in these matters for whatever reason, then you will face the consequences.”

Starmer’s plan to beef up the criminal justice system and deliver quick justice faces significant challenges as courts are already backed up and prisons are so overcrowded that plans were already in the works to release inmates early, said Cassia Rowland, a senior researcher at the Institute for Government think tank.

“That’s not a problem you can fix overnight and it’s going to be difficult, I think, for the system to cope with the influx of demand that we’re likely to see as a result of this disorder,” Rowland said.

Starmer has dismissed calls to reconvene Parliament to deal with the crisis or send in the army. His office said police can handle the disorder.

In the meeting with ministers and top law enforcement officials, Starmer said social media companies have not done enough to prevent the spread of misinformation that has fueled far-right violence and vowed that anyone who stokes the disorder — online or on the streets — could face prison, a spokesperson said. Some of that false and misleading information has come from foreign states.

“The disinformation that we’ve seen online attracts amplification from known bot activity, which, as I say, can be linked to state-backed activity,” a Starmer spokesperson said in a read-out of the meeting.

Starmer’s office condemned Elon Musk, owner of the social media platform X, for responding to a post of footage of the violence by saying: “civil war is inevitable.”

“There’s no justification for comments like that,” the spokesperson said. “We’re talking about a minority of thugs who don’t speak for Britain.”

Near Rotheram, in Northern England, where a violent mob on Sunday stormed a Holiday Inn Express where migrants were housed, throwing chairs at police and setting a fire, a crowd of volunteers showed up Monday to help clean up the mess.

Police guarded the building as glass from broken windows was swept up. A wooden fence behind the building had been destroyed by men who tore off planks of wood and hurled them at police.

“I’m horrified. I’m appalled by the violence that we saw yesterday,” Oliver Coppard, the mayor of South Yorkshire, said. “We saw a violent far-right mob come down to attack 240 of the most vulnerable people in our society and try and burn them in the hotel in which they were living. That is not OK and there is no excuse for it.”

In Southport, where rioting first broke out July 30 — the day after the horrific stabbing there — police said only one child remained in the hospital. The seven other children and two adults who were seriously injured had been discharged.

A vigil was held Monday to remember the three girls killed at the Taylor Swift-themed dance class: Bebe King, 6, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9.

Hundreds of parents and children gathered around bouquets of flowers and stuffed animals outside The Atkinson arts center in memory of the girls. As a piano played, children blew iridescent bubbles that hung and swirled in the air before they were gone."

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer says a “standing army” of specialist police would be set up as he promises “swift criminal sanctions” to check violent riots that have broken out in the country over the past week.

Starmer convened an emergency meeting on Monday with ministers and police chiefs, including Scotland Yard boss Mark Rowley, to discuss how to quell the violence that first broke out in Southport in northwest England on Tuesday.

He blamed the lawlessness on far-right activists and misinformation on social media that has whipped up anger over a stabbing attack at a dance class last week that killed three girls.

False rumours spread online that the suspect was a Muslim and an asylum-seeker, leading to attacks on immigrants and Muslims.

Police said the 17-year-old suspect was born in the United Kingdom and they are not treating the stabbings as a terrorist incident.

Starmer said a “standing army” of specially trained police officers was ready to be deployed to support local forces where any further riots break out.

“Whatever the apparent motivation, this is not protest. It is pure violence, and we will not tolerate attacks on mosques or our Muslim communities,” Starmer said.

“The full force of the law will be visited on all those who are identified as having taken part in these activities.”

On Sunday, angry mobs attacked two hotels used to house asylum seekers, breaking windows and lighting fires before police dispersed the crowds and residents were evacuated.

Dozens of police officers have been hospitalised for injuries in the past six days after being struck with bricks, bottles and large wooden posts.

Oliver Coppard, the mayor of South Yorkshire, where one of the hotels was attacked, attributed the violence to “far-right thugs”.

“As Keir said, as every decent person has said, I think these are far-right thugs who attacked some of the most vulnerable people in our communities, and there is absolutely no excuse,” Coppard told the BBC.

“There can never be any excuse for trying to burn to death 200 of the most vulnerable people in our community.”

A Starmer spokesperson said no requests have been made to call in the army.

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper promised a reckoning to those involved, saying the government would back punishments ranging from jail sentences to travel bans. Police have arrested about 420 people.

The Home Office, which is responsible for law and order, has offered mosques greater protection under a new “rapid response process” designed to quickly tackle the threat of further attacks on places of worship.

Starmer’s spokesperson said after Monday’s meeting that social media companies have not done enough to prevent the spread of misinformation that has fuelled far-right violence and promised that anyone who stokes the disorder – online or on the streets – could face prison.

UK prime minister made the announcement on Monday after he convened officials for an urgent meeting aimed at tackling growing far-right violence enshrouding the nation.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday a “standing army” comprising specialist police would be set up to deal with far-right rioting currently gripping the country.

There would also be a ""ramp up"" of the justice system to name the approximate 400 individuals arrested during violent clashes that have rocked the nation of the past week, he said outside 10 Downing Street.

Starmer described the actions of those demonstrating as ""pure violence"" and ""not protest"". ""We will not tolerate attacks on mosques or our Muslim community,"" he added.

Starmer convened an urgent meeting dubbed ""Cobra"" with cabinet ministers and intelligence officials after lawlessness, which he blamed on far-right activists and misinformation on social media.

It was whipped up anger over a stabbing rampage at a dance class that left three girls dead and many more wounded. False rumours spread online that the suspect was an asylum-seeker, which led to attacks on immigrants and Muslims.

""The full force of the law will be visited on all those who are identified as having taken part in these activities,"" Starmer said.

On Sunday, angry mobs attacked two hotels used to house asylum seekers, breaking windows and lighting fires before police dispersed the crowds and residents were evacuated.

Dozens of police officers have been hospitalised for injuries in the past six days after being struck with bricks, bottles and large wooden posts.

“As Keir said, as every decent person has said, I think these are far-right thugs who attacked some of the most vulnerable people in our communities and there is absolutely no excuse,” Coppard told the BBC.

Thank you for following our live updates on the violent disorder which has flared up across parts of the UK since the mass stabbing in Southport just over a week ago.

Monday saw unrest in Plymouth, Birmingham and Belfast, while police chiefs announced that the overall number of arrests made in the UK over the past week had reached nearly 400.

The Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, announced a ""standing army"" of specialist police officers was ready to tackle the disorder.

In Southport itself, crowds gathered at a vigil in remembrance of the three little girls killed in the attack on a holiday club. A cousin of Leanne Lucas, the yoga teacher critically injured in the attack, told the BBC he thought the protests and riots were ""disgusting"" and should stop.

We will be back shortly to bring you the latest developments in this story."

Over the weekend, several police officers were injured and scores of people were arrested as mobs throwing bricks and flares clashed with officers, burnt and looted shops, and smashed the windows of cars and homes.

The prime minister met ministers and police chiefs, including Scotland Yard boss Mark Rowley, to discuss how to quell the violence that first broke out in Southport, northwest England on Tuesday.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Monday vowed “swift criminal sanctions” following an emergency meeting on the far-right riots that broke out across England last week over the murders of three children.

He also said a “standing army” of specially trained police officers was ready to be deployed to support local forces if any further riots break out.

“My focus is on making sure that we stop this disorder,” he added.

Clashes erupted in Southport a day after three young girls were killed and five more children critically injured during a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class.

False rumours initially spread on social media saying the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker, but police said the suspect was a 17-year-old born in Wales, with UK media reporting he has Rwandan parents.

However, that has not stopped mosques from being targeted.

Police have since arrested hundreds of people in towns and cities nationwide, with anti-immigration demonstrators and rioters facing off against police and counterprotesters, including groups of Muslims.

Starmer on Sunday warned rioters they would “regret” taking part in England’s worst disorder in 13 years, while his interior minister Yvette Cooper told the BBC on Monday that “there will be a reckoning”.

Cooper also said social media put a “rocket booster” under the violence, and Starmer stressed that “criminal law applies online as well as offline”.

Police have blamed the violence on people associated with the English Defence League, an anti-Islam organisation founded 15 years ago whose supporters have been linked to football hooliganism.

Some of the worst scenes on Sunday broke out in Rotherham, northern England, where masked rioters smashed several windows at a hotel that has been used to house asylum seekers.

At least 12 officers were injured, including one who was knocked unconscious, as they battled around 500 protesters with “far-right and anti-immigration views”, South Yorkshire Police’s Lindsey Butterfield said on Monday.

There were also large scuffles in Bolton, northwest England, and Middlesbrough, northeast England, where mobs smashed windows of houses and cars, leading to 43 arrests.

Protesters seized a media camera and broke it. The journalists were not injured.

Late on Sunday, Staffordshire police said another hotel known to have sheltered asylum seekers was targeted near Birmingham.

The violence is a major challenge for Starmer, elected only a month ago after leading Labour to a landslide win over the Conservatives.

MPs from all sides have urged Starmer to recall parliament from its summer holiday, including Conservative former interior minister Priti Patel, Labour MPs Diane Abbott and Dawn Butler, and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage.

Police have said more than 150 people were arrested over the weekend.

Rioters threw bricks, bottles and flares at police – injuring several officers – and looted and burnt shops, while demonstrators shouted anti-Islamic slurs as they clashed with counterprotesters.

The violence is the worst England has seen since 2011, when widespread rioting followed the police killing of a mixed-race man in north London.

Police have blamed online disinformation, amplified by high-profile figures for driving the violence.

Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, known by the pseudonym Tommy Robinson and previously the leader of the defunct anti-Islam English Defence League, has been blamed by media for spreading misinformation to his 875,000 followers on X.

“They are lying to you all,” Yaxley-Lennon said. “Attempting to turn the nation against me. I need you, you are my voice.”

Elon Musk , the owner of X , formerly Twitter, also weighed in. Responding to a post on X that blamed mass migration and open borders for the disorder in Britain , he wrote: “Civil war is inevitable.”

Starmer’s spokesman said there was “no justification” for Musk’s comment.

Authorities have said the initial violence was partly caused by the false rumours about suspect Axel Rudakubana , who is accused of killing a six, seven, and nine-year-old, and injuring another 10 people.

Agitators have targeted at least two mosques, with the government now offering new emergency security to Islamic places of worship.

The rallies have been advertised on far-right social media channels under the banner “Enough is enough”.

Participants have waved English and British flags while chanting slogans such as “Stop the boats” – a reference to irregular migrants crossing the Channel to Britain from France.

Anti-fascist demonstrators have meanwhile held counter-rallies in many cities.

At last month’s election, the Reform UK party led by Brexit cheerleader Farage captured 14 per cent of the vote – one of the largest vote shares for a hard-right British party.

UK prime minister talks of a ‘standing army’ of police to deal with riots.,https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2024/08/05/wfmq-a05.html,"Following six days of riots throughout Britain led by fascists, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer held an emergency COBRA meeting on Monday, a month to the day since his Labour Party took office on July 5.

Named “COBRA” after the Cabinet Office Briefing Room A in Downing Street, the committee gathers in times of national crisis. The meeting was attended by Starmer, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, other ministers, Attorney General Lord Richard Hermer, police leaders and representatives from the National Crime Agency and prison service.

With a Union Jack behind him, Starmer announced a new “standing army of specialist officers” to quell the riots. Members of Parliament have called for a recall of parliament, and the use of the Army to deal with the rioters, which Starmer has so far opposed.

The “standing police army” is the creation of a national police force. It follows Starmer’s statement on August 1 after meeting with police leaders that he would “establish a national capability, across police forces, to tackle violent disorder”.

Starmer’s promises make clear that the new force will be used not just against the far-right but all opposition to the government.

The fascists seized on the stabbing murder of three children on July 29 in Southport, England, to launch a riot falsely blaming a Muslim for the deaths. Attacks on immigrants and asylum seekers—and anyone not white—in many towns and cities have become ever more violent.

Starmer said, “We will have a standing army of specialist public duty officers so that we will have enough officers to deal with this where we need them,” adding, “we will ramp up criminal justice. There have already been hundreds of arrests, some have appeared in court this morning.”

Speaking to Sky News, Home Secretary Cooper said, “We’ve made sure there are additional prosecutors in place, that there are prisons, that prison places are ready, and also that the courts stand ready as well.”

The reality is that to date far-right thugs have mostly been treated with kid gloves, as they rampage through cities, attack mosques, loot stores and carry out arson. It is purely down to chance and the brave response of local communities that no-one has yet died in the pogrom-type attacks.

After five days of riots, just 273 rioters had been arrested by Sunday. Another 147 were arrested on Sunday, taking the total by Monday morning to 420. This is despite the police having massive powers at their disposal—across numerous acts of parliaments—to disperse protests, make arrests and even make arrests before disturbances take place.

On Sunday, the fascists targeted two hotels—in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, and Tamworth, Staffordshire—containing asylum seekers, attacks that were planned days in advance.

In Rotherham the Times reported that “men clad in balaclavas pushed through the shattered glass window of the dining room at the Holiday Inn Express… and marauded through the corridors where 130 terrified migrants live.”

Once inside the fascists began attacking asylum seekers, with one explaining, “They came into this floor [first] and hit me until the police drove them away down the corridor.”

Before the fascists arrived, a group of around 100 mobilised to protect the hotel, with only a small number of police present. Speaking to Sky News, Nick Aldworth, the Director of Counter Terrorism and Risk at the Carlisle Support Services’ firm, revealed, “I have an intelligence document dated two days ago that highlighted an extreme right-wing protest at this location [Holiday Inn, Rotherham] at 12pm today.

“With two days’ preparation time, I wouldn’t expect protesters to be able to get to the venue like this. I would suggest there’s been a really serious failure by the planners and senior leadership team in South Yorkshire Police.”

South Yorkshire Police (SYP) are no strangers to mass mobilisations when it suits theirs, and the governments’ purposes in taking on the working class. SYP mobilised—along with 18 other police forces—6,000 officers to violently attack and mass arrest picketing miners at the Orgreave coking works during the 1984-85 miners’ strike.

In pledging a crackdown on the far-right thugs, the Starmer government has unleashed a torrent of hypocrisy, claiming that the riots have as good as fallen from the sky. The fact is that the fascists are operating in a political environment polluted by the anti-immigrant sentiment spewed out by the main parties of the ruling class, Labour and Conservative, for years, echoed by a foul xenophobic right-wing media.

The demand of the fascists that asylum seekers must be driven out of hotels is a call stretching back years, after first being made by the fascist groups and by Nigel Farage, now the leader of the Reform UK party.

In 2020, Farage, then leader of the Brexit Party, fronted a series of YouTube videos on opposing “illegal” immigration under the title, “Nigel Farage investigates.” In one, Farage went to the Rivenhall hotel in the Essex constituency of Whitham, used to accommodate asylum seekers and refugees.

Shortly after members of the fascist Britain First entered hotels in London, Essex, Birmingham and Warrington in which asylum seekers were being housed, and harassed them. Similar provocations were organised by another fascist outfit, For Britain.

Ever since Farage emerged as a leader of his UK Independence Party in 1993, his role has been to shift government policy sharply to the right. Everything Farage demands today becomes the policy of the main parties soon after.

Labour pledged during the general election campaign to “clear the asylum backlog” and “secure the borders”, announcing as soon as they came to office that they were planning to end the temporary accommodation of asylum seekers in hotels.

Then Shadow Home Secretary Cooper made an inflammatory X posting on June 13, declaring that 8,000 asylum seekers were unaccounted for in Conservative government figures: “How can they just lose 8,000 people? Who they are paying for. In Home Office asylum hotels. Labour will clear the backlog, end asylum hotels & fix the Tories chaos.”

On July 2, two days before the general election, Cooper visited Tamworth at the invitation of prospective Labour MP Sarah Edwards. In a Facebook posting Edwards said, “Labour will restore community policing, control our borders, and close the asylum hotel.”

This was the very hotel attacked by the fascists just over one month later. Cooper said in a video with Edwards that Labour would be “fixing the chaos in the asylum system, ending asylum hotels” and “actually get some grip again”.

On July 30, as the fascist riots began in Southport, Edwards made a speech in parliament declaring, “In Tamworth the Holiday Inn has been used for asylum purposes for years and the simple reality is that residents want their hotel back.”

Local Rotherham Labour MP John Healey—now the defence secretary—wrote to then immigration minister Robert Jenrick last October, stating that the Holiday Inn, attacked in Rotherham on Sunday, should not be used as an “asylum hotel”.

Responding to the spread of the riots on Sunday, Farage said, “In the short term, we will quell the riots, but deeper longer-term problems remain.” He demanded an “honest debate” as “The majority of our population can see the fracturing of our communities as a result of mass, uncontrolled immigration, whether legal or illegal.”

The Sun newspaper, which endorsed Labour in the election, echoed Farage, editorialising Monday that while the courts had to “throw the book” at “far-right thugs” (whose propaganda it has spewed out for years) the government had to deal with “the twin problems of violent crime and illegal migration.” It added, “Punishment, too, should be meted out to the hard-Left and Islamists also seeking to drive a wedge in our communities.”

The editorial can be read as the Labour government’s playbook in the coming weeks."
UK prime minister talks of a ‘standing army’ of police to deal with riots.,https://www.cbc.ca/news/britain-standing-army-police-riot-1.7285610,"A ""standing army"" of specialist police will be set up to deal with rioting and the justice system will be ramped up to handle hundreds of arrests after violent disorder rocked cities across the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Monday.

Starmer convened an urgent meeting after lawlessness blamed on far-right activists and misinformation on social media whipped up anger over a stabbing rampage at a dance class last month that left three girls dead and many more wounded.

""Whatever the apparent motivation, this is not protest. It is pure violence and we will not tolerate attacks on mosques or our Muslim communities,"" Starmer said. ""The full force of the law will be visited on all those who are identified as having taken part in these activities.""

False rumors spread online that the suspect was a Muslim and an asylum seeker, which led to the attacks on immigrants and Muslims. Police have said the suspect was born in Britain and are not treating it as a terrorist incident. A 17-year-old boy was charged and named in a U.K. court last Thursday, partly to counter misinformation about his identity that has been blamed for triggering the riots.

WATCH | Violent anti-immigration protests in U.K. partly fuelled by misinformation Violent anti-immigration protests in U.K. partly fuelled by misinformation Duration 2:04 Violent far-right anti-immigration protests spread across the U.K over the weekend, fuelled in part by online misinformation about the suspect in a deadly stabbing attack at a children's dance party.

On Sunday, angry mobs attacked two hotels used to house asylum seekers, breaking windows and lighting fires before police dispersed the crowds and residents were evacuated. Dozens of police officers have been hospitalized for injuries in the past six days after being struck with bricks, bottles and large wooden posts.

Oliver Coppard, the mayor of South Yorkshire, where one of the hotels was attacked, attributed the violence to ""far-right thugs.""

""As Keir said, as every decent person has said, I think these are far-right thugs who attacked some of the most vulnerable people in our communities and there is absolutely no excuse,"" Coppard told the BBC. ""There can never be any excuse for trying to burn to death 200 of the most vulnerable people in our community.""

Starmer's spokesperson said after the meeting that social media companies have not done enough to prevent the spread of misinformation that has fuelled far-right violence. They vowed that anyone who stokes the disorder — online or on the streets — could face prison.

The National Police Chiefs' Council said 147 people had been arrested since Saturday evening and more would follow in the coming days.

Some of that false and misleading information has come from foreign states, according to the spokesperson.

""The disinformation that we've seen online attracts amplification from known bot activity, which, as I say, can be linked to state-backed activity,"" the spokesperson said in a read-out of the meeting.

A spokesperson for Starmer said no requests have been made to call in the army.

The Home Office, which is responsible for law and order, has offered mosques greater protection under a new ""rapid response process"" designed to quickly tackle the threat of further attacks on places of worship."

Children could face life-changing consequences for rioting, director of public prosecutions warns

20:49 , Alexander Butler

Stephen Parkinson, the Director of Public Prosecutions, warned children who get involved in disorder could face life-long consequences.

“One of the most striking features of the current outbreak of disorder is that many young people are involved. Children as young as 11. This is deeply disturbing,” he said.

“They may face life-long consequences: conviction, and a permanent record of their involvement on the Police National Database. This can limit their employment options in the future and ability to travel to certain countries.

“For adults, these offences can attract lengthy sentences of imprisonment, beyond the two-year maximum detention available for young offenders.

“Sentencing is a matter for the judiciary, but from the evidence that I have seen, sentencing guidelines suggest that immediate imprisonment will be appropriate for the type of violent disorder that has been witnessed.

“If this seems harsh, the reality, from reports I have received from prosecutors, is that there has been a terrible impact on communities: people barricaded in properties, businesses destroyed and police officers facing violence while trying to keep people safe.”

List of immigration officers shared

20:44 , Alexander Butler

Concern for the safety of lawyers has been voiced after a list of solicitors’ firms and advice agencies were shared as targets for gatherings in the coming days.

A message believed to have been widely shared on chat groups lists addresses for immigration law specialists and advice organisations across England, and invites people to “mask up” if they go.

Tell Mama, a group monitoring Islamophobia in the UK, said it had alerted police and counter-terrorism to the “far-right threats”.

Law Society of England and Wales president Nick Emmerson condemned the violence which has already taken place, and said they have “serious concerns about the safety and wellbeing of our members” after the list was shared giving “targets for further protest and violence this week”.

He described such gatherings as a “direct assault on our legal profession” and therefore a “direct assault on our democratic values”.

Anyone who posted on social media assisting or encouraging the disorder on Britain’s streets in recent days could be prosecuted over the violence, even if they were were not at the scene, a legal expert has warned.

Mark Jones, partner at law firm Payne Hicks Beach, said individuals “do not need to be present when the crime itself is carried out, yet can be as guilty as the person who commits the crime itself”.

The warning comes as Sir Keir Starmer said anyone whipping up violence online will face “the full force of the law”.

Sir Mark Rowley apologises for grabbing reporter’s microphone

Met police commissioner Sir Mark Rowley has apologised for grabbing a reporter’s microphone and knocking it to the floor.

Sir Mark bizarrely grabbed a journalist’s microphone cover as he was asked about the UK police’s response to ongoing mob violence across the country.

Footage from Sky News captured Sir Mark leaving the cabinet office in Westminster on Monday after attending a Cobra meeting with the prime minister.

He said: “There’s been a story running all day about my exit from the meeting. This is a distraction from the critical events we are dealing with.

“In an effort to move a microphone out of my path I’m sorry that I knocked it to the floor. That was never my intention. We remain focused on the critical and urgent matters at hand.”

“If you were in Stoke-on-Trent or Tamworth this weekend, tell us what you know. Do you have any footage of people in the area or information that can identify them?

“I’d like to assure local communities in Staffordshire that our efforts to find those involved are substantial. Our inquiries are progressing and we’re ready to deploy proactively to keep our communities safe.”

Australia’s government advised its citizens to “exercise a high degree of caution”, adding: “Avoid areas where protests are occurring due to the potential for disruption and violence.”

Nigeria’s ministry of foreign affairs warned nationals that the violence had “assumed dangerous proportions” and there was “an increased risk of violence and disorder occasioned by the recent riots in the UK”.

Malaysia’s High Commission said: “Malaysians residing in or travelling to the United Kingdom are urged to stay away from protest areas, remain vigilant and follow the latest updates and guidance provided by local authorities.”

The Indonesian embassy in London meanwhile advised its citizens in the UK to avoid large crowds and increase their vigilance.

When far-right rioters started throwing bottles at police officers guarding an asylum seeker hotel, local resident Becky Brunt decided it was time for her family to flee the area.

She had been watching the chaos unfold streets away from her estate on a TikTok live stream and as the crowds grew around their home she decided it would be safer to stay with her mother-in-law in Sheffield.

The family returned when the violence had died down at around midnight on Sunday night. And the next morning they spoke to The Independent from outside the hotel where they were clearing up after the devastation.

Police will become ‘fatigued’

17:18 , Alexander Butler

Police officers will have their rest days cancelled as they face violence some have never seen before amid the riots - and they will become “fatigued” at some point, the Police Federation has said.

Broken bones and concussion are among the injuries police officers have suffered over six days of disorder which has seen hundreds of arrests in the wake of a knife attack in Southport last week which left three girls dead, the federation said.

It is not yet known how many police officers have been injured during the disorder.

Tiffany Lynch, acting national chairwoman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, told Times Radio: “What we’re actually seeing and our officers out there that are working incredibly hard for extended periods of duty, is unprecedented, and the violence that they’re actually facing, some have never faced before in their careers.

“We know of recorded injuries where we’ve had broken bones, concussion and such like, but we’re also seeing that these officers are working extended long hours and with the level of violence that they’re facing, they will be becoming fatigued at some point.”

Officers being ‘run ragged’ with rest days and leave cancelled

17:06 , Athena Stavrou

The Independent’s Crime Correspondent Amy-Clare Martin reports:

Brian Booth, deputy national chair of the Police Federation, told The Independent that front line officers are “absolutely being run ragged” doing 18 hour shifts as they face their sixth day of far-right unrest.

Officer morale was low before the rallies, he said, adding: “On top of this now some are not able to take annual leave with their families and having rest days cancelled to work long hours in very dangerous conditions.

“They will step up to the plate and do their duties without fear or favour to the best of their abilities but there has to be some recognition of that down the line.”

While forces are “well resourced” to cope with any further clashes, he said the long-term impact will be officers taken away from community policing as they dedicate thousands of hours to gathering evidence to secure convictions against rioters.

“All these offences of arson, assault and GBH, they will need to be investigated and evidence gathered and put before the courts and that takes officers time,” he added.

“I think we are in a really good position to deal with the here and now, the downside of this is the future months and months compiling evidence.”

The motion also “rejects all forms of Islamophobia, xenophobia and racism; endorses the work of voluntary sector organisations combatting racism and supporting those impacted by it; recognises the work of the Police Service of Northern Ireland and other public sector bodies protecting our communities during the recent unrest; calls on the First Minister and deputy First Minister to finalise the draft Refugee Integration Strategy and associated Thematic Delivery Plan and present it to the Executive; and further calls on the First Minister and deputy First Minister to bring forward the renewed Race Relations Order, and set-out the process of replacing the Racial Equality Strategy 2015-2025 by the end of 2024”.

Nursing union condemns far-right race riots

16:47 , Athena Stavrou

Responding to what she called the “far-right race riots in recent days”, Royal College of Nursing general secretary and chief executive Professor Nicola Ranger said: “Migrant nursing staff are precious members of our communities, hardwired into the very DNA of our health and care services – we ask Government to ensure that anybody targeting them pays a very heavy price.

“Whether in their first months working here, or after decades working in our health system, our international colleagues are welcome, valued and owed a debt of gratitude.

“These scenes around the country are nothing short of despicable racism – they have no place in our society and we join fully in the condemnation of them. As an anti-racist organisation, the RCN will take a lead part in tackling this hatred wherever it rears its head.

“Employers have a duty of care to keep their staff safe at work. That includes those working in hospitals, but also those delivering care alone in community settings. Health leaders need to act urgently to reassure staff, review risk assessments and implement any measures necessary to keep workers safe.

“Nursing staff of every nationality and ethnic heritage are holding the health service together, dealing with the fallout of these racist attacks. They are a credit to our profession and a powerful reminder of the strength we find in diversity and unity.”

“The people involved in this criminality do not represent the views of our communities and it has been heartening to see people coming together to support each other and their local forces.

“This is a challenging time for forces and I want to extend my thanks to the officers and staff who have carried out their roles with dignity, bravery and professionalism in the face of sustained violence and assaults.

“There have been a number of officers injured, some have been hospitalised after putting themselves in harm’s way to protect others, and I wish them a full recovery.

“Officers do not go to work to be assaulted or attacked and it is completely unacceptable.”

378 arrested so far with more expected to come

16:32 , Athena Stavrou

Police have made 378 arrests so far since disorder broke out last week and the total is expected to rise each day, the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) said as it promised a “united and robust policing response”.

NPCC chairman Gavin Stephens said: “Every community across the country will have been affected in some way by the violent disorder we have seen in this past week.

“I want to reassure the public that a united and robust policing response is in place across the country and we are doing all we can to tackle this disorder and keep you safe.

“All forces have been requested not only to increase the number of specialist resources in their local area, but to contribute to regional reserves, coordinated nationally.

“So far 378 arrests have been made and we expect that total to rise each day as forces continue to identify those involved and continue to apprehend those responsible. Work is going on around the clock to do this and those involved will be brought to justice.

“We have been clear that this is not protest activity or people exercising their democratic right. It is unnecessary violence and we’ve seen important community hubs like a Citizen’s Advice Bureau and a library completely destroyed.”

16:16 , Athena Stavrou

Sir Keir Starmer has ordered a new “standing army” of specialist police officers to be set up to bring an end to the far-right riots which have broken out across the UK in the last week.

The prime minister made the move after chairing an emergency COBR(Cabinet Office Briefing Room) committee this morning with the deputy prime minister Angela Rayner, home secretary Yvette Cooper and senior police officers including Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Mark Rowley.

Ms Cooper pledged that the far right thugs face “a reckoning” with over 400 people arrested after far-right violence swept across the country over the weekend.

‘Goodwill’ of lawyers working extra hours ‘fast running out'

16:04 , Athena Stavrou

The necessary support must be put in place to enable the courts to deal with those charged following the violent disorder, said the Law Society president, as he described how the “goodwill” of solicitors being called on to work extra hours is “fast running out”.

Nick Emmerson, Law Society of England and Wales president, said: “It is paramount that justice is done for all those who have been involved in, or are victims of, the riots.

“We commend the UK government for its swift response and want to see that the necessary support and resources are provided for both prosecution and defence lawyers, courts staff and judiciary in dealing with this emergency.

“The criminal justice system has suffered significant neglect over the last decade and has less resilience and flexibility with severe backlogs in the Magistrates and Crown Courts.

“The criminal defence profession is also depleted and over-worked and the goodwill of the solicitors who are being called on to work additional antisocial hours is fast running out.”

Volunteers gather to paint over racist graffiti on Tamworth hotel

15:55 , Athena Stavrou

Around 20 volunteers including local councillors helped council staff and contractors to paint over racist graffiti and clear up debris, including broken glass, bricks and paving slabs which had been used as missiles during the attack on Tamworth’s Holiday Inn Express.

Among those who made their way to the hotel to help out was councillor Margaret Clarke, who said those responsible for the damage had exhibited “stone age thinking”.

The 80-year-old, a member of Tamworth Soroptimists: “I have lived in Tamworth for over 50 years and the first thing you do when there’s trouble is you help – that’s the way I look at things.

“Debasing our town is not something that we allow – it’s not Tamworth. Most of them (the rioters) were not Tamworthians and we don’t want our people to be harassed like that again.”

Her colleague Pat Pallett, 77, said of the amount of local people taking part in the clean-up: “That is Tamworth for you. We band together when there’s any trouble. It’s a lovely town to live in and we don’t want this happening again, ever.”

A Green MP has labelled violent disorder “fascist violence fuelled by racism and Islamophobia”.

Brighton Pavilion MP Sian Berry said in a statement: “What we are witnessing on our streets is fascist violence fuelled by racism and Islamophobia. Only by naming it and understanding clearly what it is can we work to defeat it.”

She added: “It is also important to ask what the police and security services have been doing to monitor the far right over the past decade. We have to question if a focus on monitoring Muslim citizens and climate protesters has allowed the far more sinister menace of fascism to foment.

“We need to bring those responsible for instigating the violence to justice, but this won’t be enough to defeat an ideology which uses organised political violence to undermine our society, divide communities and compromise the state and its institutions, including the judiciary and the police.

“The engine that drives fascism is racism, so ministers need to speak up now with one voice to celebrate and defend our Muslim citizens and their place in our diverse society. The Government also needs urgently to create real new investment in supporting community cohesion.”

‘Serious concerns' about safety of solicitors as far-right share list of targets

15:40 , Athena Stavrou

The Law Society of England and Wales said it has “serious concerns” about the safety of its members after names and addresses of solicitors’ firms and advice agencies were shared in a list of locations to be targeted by demonstrators.

The organisation’s president, Nick Emmerson, said: “We deplore the violent scenes and rioting that we have witnessed across the past week.

“We have serious concerns about the safety and wellbeing of our members following names and addresses of a number of solicitors’ firms and advice agencies being shared on a list of targets for further protest and violence this week.

“I have written to the Prime Minister, Lord Chancellor and Home Secretary today asking that the threats against the legal profession are treated with the utmost seriousness.

“A direct assault on our legal profession is a direct assault on our democratic values and we are supporting our members who are being targeted.”

People arrested in connection to the violent far-right riots across the country have begun to appear in court.

The prime minister has vowed that people who took part in the “unforgivable” riots will face swift and harsh judgements as the courts prepare to sit for longer hours.

Amongst those appearing in court today were brothers Adam, 28, and Ellis Wharton, 22, who both pleaded guilty to burgling the Spellow Hub community centre in Liverpool.

Joshua Sanderson-Kirk, prosecuting, said Adam was seen outside the Spellow Library on County Road on Sunday, wearing a balaclava and “sweating profusely”.

Australia has become the third country to issue a warning to citizens travelling to the UK following days of violent riots.

It advised travellers to “Avoid areas where protests are occurring due to the potential for disruption and violence” as it urged people to “monitor the media for information and updates”.

It comes after Malaysia alerted citizens living or visiting the UK to “stay away” from protest areas and “remain vigilant”.

The Nigerian Interior Ministry also issued a warning this morning, citing an “increased risk of violence and disorder occasioned by the recent riots in the UK”.

Police patrols are being stepped up in Teesside over the coming days amid fears the area could be hit with more violent disorder.

In a statement, Cleveland Police said: “There will be an increased police presence across our towns and communities in the coming days, providing reassurance to residents and speaking to members of the public about their concerns.

“We are aware of information currently in circulation on social media and other platforms about further activity in the area and we’re monitoring the situation closely.

“Cleveland Police’s focus remains firmly on protecting people, protecting communities, and taking robust action against those who are intent on causing violence and fear across Teesside.”

Merseyside leaders committed to ‘peace and safety'

15:16 , Athena Stavrou

Political leaders from across Merseyside have said they are committed to restoring “peace and safety” in communities.

In a statement, the leader of Sefton Council Councillor Marion Atkinson, Liverpool City Region Metro Mayor, Steve Rotheram and council leaders of Liverpool, St Helens, Knowsley, Wirral and Halton said: “We are profoundly appalled and deeply saddened by the recent acts of serious violence and chaos that have marred our beloved region.

“These actions are not expressions of protest, but deliberate attempts to spread fear and misery within the communities we serve – places where our residents live, work, and learn.

“As political leaders, we want to assure each and every one of you that such behaviour will not be tolerated. We are committed to restoring peace and safety in our communities.

“Our heartfelt thanks go out to our council staff, police officers, firefighters, NHS staff, community volunteers, faith sectors, and business leaders. Many of you reside in our region, standing by our side as neighbours, and have safeguarded us through these deeply troubling times. Your dedication and hard work have not gone unnoticed.

“Lastly, we want to express our deepest gratitude to our residents who have displayed compassion, courage, and steadfast resilience.

“Please know that we stand with you, and we are here for you, now and always.”

Tamworth MP condemns torching of asylum hotel

15:07 , Athena Stavrou

The Labour MP for Tamworth, Sarah Edwards, said in a statement issued on her social media accounts that the attack on the town’s Holiday Inn Express had put lives at risk.

Urging local people to help police identify those responsible, Ms Edwards said: “It is not protest. It’s not legitimate. It is crime and violent disorder. An assault on the rule of law.

“It was distressing to see petrol bombs and fireworks being thrown towards police and emergency workers and it was horrifying to see such violence towards the most vulnerable in our society.”

Saying such behaviour would not be tolerated, she added: “Those who are intent on stoking disorder and division are not welcome and do not speak for Britain or for Tamworth.

“It is fortunate that no one inside the hotel was injured, but rest assured those involved in the violence will face the full force of the justice system.”

Racist thugs targeted the hotel housing refugees as they clashed with police and set it alight on Sunday night.

Ms Edwards told the Commons days ago that the people of Tamworth “want their hotel back” as she called for the government to “end the use of the Holiday Inn for asylum purposes”.

Asylum charity forced to close HQ after far-right threats

15:04 , Athena Stavrou

A charity that helps refugees has been forced to close its headquarters in Liverpool after receiving threats of far-right violence.

The Asylum Link charity, which has helped many vulnerable people who have escaped war and persecution, said they would be closing the building until further notice.

“We are aware of the threats of far-right violence made towards our centre this week,” it wrote on social media. “For this reason we have decided to temporarily close the building and switch to remote working until further notice.

“We will ensure that we can continue to offer support, advice, food and essential resources to those of our clients that need and we hope to re-open the building as soon as it is safe to do so.”

Speaking on the riots seen over the weekend, it said: “The senseless destruction seen over the weekend is exactly that: senseless. Here at Asylum Link, we see every day the incredible contributions made by people seeking sanctuary in the UK.

“We see and know them as people, friends, fathers, mothers, sons and daughters; people that make huge efforts to help others and volunteer in our local community; people with enthusiasm to learn, connect and share.

“Lots of local people see that too, and we’re delighted here at Asylum Link to have such a strong connection with the city we operate in. We’ve been really touched by all the messages of support over the last 24 hours. Together, we will get through this difficult time and we will continue our vital work. In the meantime, take care of each other and your neighbours. Thanks so much everyone”

A rumoured far-right gathering planned in Huddersfield this afternoon has failed to materialise.

Several businesses closed their doors today out of fear that scenes of violence might materialise and police vans were seen by the train station.

However, the gathering does not appear to have taken place.

Amnesty says government must address ‘root cause of racism that plagues our society’

14:31 , Athena Stavrou

In response to recent racist attacks and other violent disorder across the UK, Sacha Deshmukh, Amnesty International UK’s Chief Executive, said: “The widespread violence and hate crimes we’ve witnessed over the last few days are utterly unacceptable.

“It’s disgusting to see hotels housing people seeking sanctuary set on fire, mosques and businesses attacked, and people targeted because of the colour of their skin, their faith or their country of origin.

“The racist violence we are now seeing on our streets has been preceded by an intense period of scapegoating refugees and migrants by politicians and others – in dangerous rhetoric and policy. I hope those who spread that rhetoric look on the consequences of their words and learn.

“Events of the last few days have been reported as ‘anti-immigration protests’ or ‘pro-British demonstrations’ and they should not be labelled as such. What we are seeing are clearly violent racist attacks targeting specific communities.”

It added: “Above all, the Government must address the root causes of racism, Islamophobia and xenophobia that plagues our society – and this includes actively calling out and addressing the dangerous rhetoric of politicians and commentators on social media and elsewhere.”

Asylum seekers ‘glad to be alive’ after Rotherham hotel attack

23:20 , Alexander Butler

Asylum seekers who were inside a Rotherham hotel when it was attacked by far-right rioters are frightened but glad to be alive, an activist who attempted to guard the entrance said.

Phil Turner, from Stand up to Racism Rotherham, helped organise a counter-demonstration of around 150 people at the Holiday Inn Express on Sunday in support of the refugees who were trapped inside.

The violence in the South Yorkshire town took place amid widespread rioting across the UK in recent days, in the wake of last week’s stabbings in Southport.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Monday said that a ""standing army"" of specialist police would be set up to deal with rioting and that the justice system would be ramped up to deal with hundreds of arrests after violent disorder rocked cities across the nation over the past week.

""Whatever the apparent motivation, this is not protest, it is pure violence and we will not tolerate attacks on mosques or our Muslim communities,"" Starmer said on Monday. ""The full force of law will be visited on all those who are identified as having taken part.""

Riots and protests involving hundreds of people have created chaos in towns and cities across the country.

RIOTS ERUPT IN UK AFTER STABBING SPREE FALSELY BLAMED ON ASYLUM SEEKER

Dozens of police officers have been hospitalized for injuries in the past six days after being struck with bricks, bottles, chairs and large wooden posts.

On Sunday, angry mobs attacked two hotels used to house asylum seekers, breaking windows and lighting fires before police dispersed the crowds and residents were evacuated.

Starmer blamed the violence on misinformation spread on social media that sparked outrage over a stabbing that left three young girls dead and others wounded at a Taylor Swift-themed dance event in the town of Southport.

The false social media posts claimed that the suspected attacker was a radical Islamist who had recently arrived in Britain, Reuters reported. Police, however, identified the attacker as 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana, who was born in Wales to Rwandan parents, and said authorities are not treating the incident as terror-related.

Suspects under 18 are typically not named in the U.K., but the judge in the case ordered the suspect to be identified to stop the spread of misinformation. The teen has been charged with three counts of murder and 10 counts of attempted murder .

A spokesperson for Starmer said on Monday that social media companies have not done enough to prevent the spread of misinformation, and that some of that false and misleading information has come from foreign states.

Sir Keir Starmer has ordered a new “standing army” of specialist police officers to be set up to bring an end to the far-right riots which have broken out across the UK in the last week.

The prime minister made the move after chairing an emergency Cobra committee meeting this morning with the deputy prime minister Angela Rayner, home secretary Yvette Cooper, senior officials and leading police officers including Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Mark Rowley.

It came as reports suggest that far-right groups intend to target 30 immigration and law centres on Thursday after sharing addresses on the messaging platform Telegram.

Ms Cooper pledged that the far-right thugs face “a reckoning”, with nearly 400 people arrested after far-right violence swept across the country over the weekend.

The meeting took place as the first cases of alleged rioters were heard in emergency sessions of courts, with the accused as young as 14 and one sobbing as he faced justice.

The mobile force of police officers is a rare use of special emergency powers since they were first used 40 years ago, with the controversial squads drafted under the Ridley Plan to tackle the miners’ strike in 1984 and 1985.

Over the weekend Sir Keir signalled that he had lost patience with “the far-right thugs” who caused civil unrest around the country in towns and cities such as Southport, Liverpool, Hull, London, Rotherham and Tamworth.

And the unrest continued on Monday evening with demonstrations in Plymouth and Birmingham seeing outbreaks of violence.

Six people were arrested in Plymouth after a police van was damaged and several officers received minor injuries. Pictures and footage from the scene showed fireworks and stones being thrown.

But he is continuing to resist recalling parliament even though the Stormont Assembly in Northern Ireland is being recalled to discuss the riots which took place in Belfast.

The violence across the UK broke out after misinformation on social media about the alleged attacker in the murder of three young girls at a Taylor Swift dance club in Southport. Far-right activists descended on the seaside resort and set fire to a police car while besieging a mosque.

Since then attacks have spread around the country and included violent attacks on hotels holding asylum seekers in Rotherham and Tamworth on Sunday.

The new mobile police force will provide extra specialist support in tackling civil unrest for the 24 police forces around the country, several of which have been unable to cope with the scale of the riots.

Announcing his new initiative this morning, the prime minister said: “There are a number of actions that came out of the [Cobra] meeting.

“The first is we will have a standing army of specialist public duty officers so that we will have enough officers to deal with this where we need them.

“The second is we will ramp up criminal justice. There have already been hundreds of arrests, some have appeared in court this morning.

“I have asked for early consideration of the earliest naming and identification of those involved in the process who will feel the full force of the law.”

Already the government had agreed to release £29m funding for extra protection of mosques over the weekend with gangs targeting the Muslim community.

Among those in court today was a 14-year-old boy who aimed fireworks at police and the public.

The teenage rioter, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty to violent disorder at Liverpool Magistrates’ Court as cases were fast-tracked.

A string of judges hearing the first cases linked to the unrest have condemned the violence seen in riots which broke out in the wake of last week’s knife attack in Southport.

Prosecutor Joshua Sanderson-Kirk said the teenager was among eight to 12 young people seen setting off fireworks towards the public and a police carrier in Clayton Square, Liverpool, at around 10.30pm on Saturday.

He said: “They exploded underneath the police carrier.”

The court heard the boy said “I’m sorry, I wasn’t firing them at you, though”, when he was arrested by police after they gave chase. He had five fireworks and a lighter in his possession.

Iqbal Singh Kang, defending, said the teenager had been in the city centre to catch a bus home, adding: “Without thinking things through, he became involved in something much more serious.”

The boy was released on bail ahead of his sentencing on 27 August.

Rioter Derek Drummond, 58, of Pool Street, Southport, admitted punching a police officer who was trying to protect his colleagues as they put on riot gear.

PC Thomas Ball was deployed to the mosque on St Luke's Road, Southport, where the riots first erupted last Tuesday where a group of around 300 people arrived shouting “this is our f****** country” and “scumbag b*****ds”.

Liverpool Magistrates’ Court heard officers had to withdraw for fear of being overwhelmed, but PC Ball stood to protect colleagues as they put on protective equipment when Drummond became violent, shouting “s***houses” and punching him in the face.

Drummond was remanded in custody and will be sentenced for violent disorder and assault by beating of an emergency worker on 29 August.

At the same court, Adam Wharton, 28, of Selwyn Street, Liverpool, also indicated a guilty plea to burglary with intent to steal after he was seen wearing a balaclava and “sweating profusely” outside Spellow Library in Liverpool on Sunday, which had been torched and looted the night before.

He was also remanded in custody to be sentenced on 29 August.

Another court heard how a rioter in Sunderland was wearing a balaclava but was identified by his distinctive sleeve of tattoos.

Josh Kellett, 29, of Southcroft, Washington, admitted violent disorder at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court after he was filmed throwing a stone towards police during clashes on Friday.

Kellett was remanded in custody until his sentencing at crown court on 2 September after a district judge said his case was “too serious for this court”.

One alleged rioter sobbed in the dock as he denied affray at Sheffield Magistrates’ Court.

Curtis Coulson, 30, wiped away tears as he appeared accused of swinging a stick at a woman outside Sheffield City Hall on Sunday.

The Cobra meeting was told there have been hundreds of arrests and people are already being charged. Police will continue to provide updates on specifics in relation to progress on arrests and charging.

Tweeting after the Cobra meeting, Ms Cooper promised: “There will be a reckoning for criminals and thugs who took part in violence on streets, burning buildings, attacks on mosques, looting shops and the whipping up of racist violence online.”

Chief Constable Gavin Stephens, chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, said: “So far 378 arrests have been made and we expect that total to rise each day as forces continue to identify those involved and continue to apprehend those responsible. Work is going on around the clock to do this and those involved will be brought to justice.”

Brian Booth, deputy national chair of the Police Federation, told The Independent that frontline officers are “absolutely being run ragged” doing 18-hour shifts as they face their sixth day of far-right unrest.

Officer morale was low before the rallies, he said, adding: “On top of this now some are not able to take annual leave with their families and having rest days cancelled to work long hours in very dangerous conditions.

“They will step up to the plate and do their duties without fear or favour to the best of their abilities but there has to be some recognition of that down the line.”"
UK prime minister talks of a ‘standing army’ of police to deal with riots.,https://news.sky.com/story/what-is-sir-keir-starmers-standing-army-and-will-it-work-13191485,"Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer today announced a new ""standing army"" of specialist police officers to get a grip on the ongoing violence.

This is nothing to do with the actual army - which ministers have insisted is not required, because there are enough police to tackle the outbreaks.

Forces sending public order officers to other areas to cope with big events already happens regularly and is called ""mutual aid.""

UK riots latest: Countries issue 'travel alerts' and safety warnings to citizens over disorder

Overseen by the National Police Chiefs Council, in the past few months various police forces have sent specialist officers to London to police pro-Palestine protests following the 7 October terrorist attacks.

These arrangements are also used to police big sporting competitions and national events such as the Queen's funeral.

A senior Downing Street official said this ""standing army"" would be an enhanced version of mutual aid ""so there are officers forward deployed to hot spots quicker"".

There are many thousands of public order officers, and police forces sound confident about their office numbers - although they will inevitably be diverted from other duties.

It's not a new idea, but the prime minister insisted: ""We will have the officers we need, where we need them.""

The next challenge will be bringing anyone arrested to justice, with the backlog of outstanding cases in the Crown courts and the Magistrates courts at a record high, according to figures released in June, and nowhere near pre-pandemic levels.

The sector blames a decline in criminal lawyers, court staff and the dilapidated state of many courts - all of which are long-term challenges.

Courts have not been asked to sit round the clock, as they did in response to the London riots in 2021. The chair of the Criminal Bar Association, Tana Adkin KC, has said they wouldn't be able to, as the system is already ""working at maximum capacity"".

However, the prime minister insisted these cases would be dealt with ""swiftly"", with early naming and shaming of offenders at their first hearings.

Some of those involved pleaded guilty this morning and will be sentenced in September. This is quick, as many victims of crime are left waiting months or years for their cases to be heard.

Prisons are also nearly full, with hundreds of offenders being let out early to free up space. The prime minister said this situation was being closely monitored and those responsible for the violence would be punished.

The final part of the response is insisting that those committing crimes online, inciting violence, would also feel ""the full force of the law"".

Why are riots happening in UK?

Asylum seekers 'slept in woods' as hotel targeted

The science and technology secretary Peter Kyle said in a statement that as well as individuals being pursued, ""social media has provided a platform for this hate"" - strongly suggesting he will be asking the social media companies to go further in curbing the content they promote.

However when X proprietor Elon Musk is tweeting about ""civil war"" it looks tricky to see how they proceed. The prime minister's spokesman also suggested hostile states may play a role.

Questions about whether the far-right activist Tommy Robinson - accused of stoking the riots while on holiday and claiming they are the result of ""legitimate concerns"" - should continue to post on these platforms, where he has some 800,000 followers, are continuing.

Mosques have already been offered funding for additional security from the home secretary, as Muslim communities have been targeted by violence.

UK prime minister talks of a ‘standing army’ of police to deal with riots.,https://www.wral.com/story/uk-police-warn-far-right-fueled-street-violence-affects-resources-needed-to-investigate-other-crimes/21559338/,"LONDON (AP) — U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer strongly condemned an attack Sunday on a hotel housing asylum seekers that saw at least 10 police officers injured, one seriously, describing it as “far-right thuggery.""

In a statement from 10 Downing Street on Sunday afternoon, the prime minister vowed that the authorities will “do whatever it takes to bring these thugs to justice"" and that justice will be swift.

Starmer's statement came as more violence broke out across the country in the wake of a stabbing rampage at a dance class that left three girls dead and many more wounded.

“I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves,"" he said. ""This is not a protest, it is organized, violent thuggery and it has no place on our streets or online.”

Starmer was speaking after another day of far-right violence, which was particularly acute in the north of England town of Rotherham where police struggled to hold back hundreds of rioters who sought to break into a Holiday Inn Express hotel being used as accommodation for asylum-seekers.

Before bringing the riot under some sort of control, police officers with shields had faced a barrage of missiles, including bits of wood, chairs and fire extinguishers. A large bin close to a window of the hotel was also set alight but the small fire was extinguished.

South Yorkshire Police, which is responsible for Rotherham, said at least 10 officers have been injured, including one who was left unconscious.

“The behaviour we witnessed has been nothing short of disgusting. While it was a smaller number of those in attendance who chose to commit violence and destruction, those who simply stood on and watched remain absolutely complicit in this,"" said Assistant Chief Constable Lindsey Butterfield. ""We have officers working hard, reviewing the considerable online imagery and footage of those involved, and they should expect us to be at their doors very soon.”

Far-right agitators have sought to take advantage of last week's stabbing attack by tapping into concerns about the scale of immigration in the U.K., in particular the tens of thousands of migrants arriving in small boats from France across the English Channel.

Tensions were also running high Sunday in the northeastern town of Middlesbrough, where some protesters broke free of a police guard. One group walked through a residential area smashing the windows of houses and cars. When asked by a resident why they were breaking windows, one man replied, “Because we’re English."" Hundreds of others squared up to police with shields at the town's cenotaph, throwing bricks, cans and pots at officers.

Starmer said anyone targeting people for the color of their skin or their faith is far-right.

“People in this country have a right to be safe, and yet we’ve seen Muslim communities targeted, attacks on mosques, other minority communities singled out, Nazi salutes in the street, attacks on the police, wanton violence alongside racist rhetoric, so no, I won’t shy away from calling it what it is: far-right thuggery,” he said.

The violence over the past days, which has seen a library torched, mosques attacked and flares thrown at a statue of wartime leader Winston Churchill, began after false rumors spread online that the suspect in the dance class stabbing attack was an asylum-seeker, fueling anger among far-right supporters.

Suspects under 18 are usually not named in the U.K., but the judge in the case ordered Axel Rudakubana, born in Wales to Rwandan parents, to be identified, in part to stop the spread of misinformation. Rudakubana has been charged with three counts of murder, and 10 counts of attempted murder.

Hundreds of people have been arrested in connection with the disorder and many more are likely as police scour CCTV, social media and body-worn camera footage. However, police have also warned that with widespread security measures in place, with thousands of officers deployed, other crimes may not be investigated fully.

With so many arrests, the courts will face a challenge in processing all the charges at a time when the criminal justice system is overstretched, following years of austerity and the COVID pandemic. In May, the National Audit Office warned that the courts faced a backlog of more than 60,000 cases, while the government said last month that thousands of inmates would have to be released early to ease prison overcrowding.

Stephen Parkinson, director of public prosecutions for England and Wales, said extra lawyers have been deployed over the weekend and will work “around the clock” over coming days to ensure justice is served. He said he has directed prosecutors to make immediate charging decisions where key evidence is in place.

“I am determined that we will act swiftly and robustly, giving the courts maximum ability to pass sentences that reflect what has occurred,"" he said.

Many of the demonstrations over the past week were organized online by far-right groups, who mobilize support with phrases like “enough is enough,” “save our kids” and “stop the boats.”

Rallying cries have come from a diffuse group of social media accounts, but a key player in amplifying them is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, a longtime far-right agitator who uses the name Tommy Robinson. He led the English Defense League, which Merseyside Police has linked to the violent protest in Southport on Tuesday, near the scene of the stabbing attack.

Yaxley-Lennon, 41, was banned from Twitter in 2018 but allowed back after it was bought by Elon Musk and rebranded as X. He has more than 800,000 followers. He currently faces an arrest warrant after leaving the U.K. last week before a scheduled hearing in contempt-of-court proceedings against him.

Nigel Farage, who was elected to parliament in July for the first time as leader of Reform U.K., has also been blamed by many for encouraging — indirectly — the anti-immigration sentiment. He has sought to link many of the problems the country faces, such as in health and housing, on the big annual increases in the country's population.

As well as calling out what he's described as ""far right thuggery"", the prime minister has used his statements on the riots to send solidarity to Muslim communities that have been targeted.

Mosques have been offered greater protection by the Home Office, which has been welcomed by faith leaders.

But Labour MP Afzal Khan wants his party to go further, writing to the PM demanding the government provide a definition of Islamophobia to combat the ""racism and vitriol"" of the past week.

He wants Sir Keir Starmer's government to adopt a definition put forward following an inquiry in 2017.

It reads: ""Islamophobia is rooted in racism and is a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness.""

Mr Khan, who also wants the PM to meet Muslim community leaders, said such racism had become ""mainstream"" since 2010.

The Manchester Rusholme MP wrote in a letter to Sir Keir: ""It is imperative that this Labour government, in stark contrast to the previous Conservative governments, will not ignore Islamophobia when it occurs.""



The previous Tory administration reclined to adopt the proposed definition because it said the wording could harm freedom of speech.

Rishi Sunak, the then prime minister, would often instead refer to an ""anti-Muslim hatred""."

Australia has told its citizens to “exercise a high degree of caution”, while Nigeria informed nationals that the unrest had “assumed dangerous proportions”.

Sir Keir Starmer responded to criticism of his handling of the disorder by announcing a “standing army” of specialist public duty police officers, warning people involved in the riots that they would be named, shamed and jailed.

Downing Street insisted there were enough free prison cells to “lock up anyone involved” in the violence.

The Prime Minister has faced calls from Nigel Farage, among others, to recall Parliament to discuss the response to the disorder, but said there was currently no need to do so and also appeared to rule out asking the Army for assistance.

Fireworks were let off and a police van was damaged as far-right and anti-racist demonstrators clashed in Plymouth amid a wave of mob violence sweeping the UK.

The protesters clashed as campaign group Stand Up To Racism and a “stop the boats” rally met at Guildhall Square in Plymouth this evening.

Devon and Cornwall Police also said violence had been carried out against its officers and a riot van had been damaged during the confrontation.

In Birmingham, balaclava-clad rioters waving Palestinian flags were seen smashing a car as rumours of a far-right rally in the city circulated online.

It comes as almost 400 people have been arrested over the mob violence spreading across the UK, with the prime minister setting up a “standing army” of specialist police officers to deal with further attacks.

Sir Keir Starmer has held an emergency Cobra meeting after far-right mobs carried out racist attacks and set fire to hotels housing asylum seekers in Rotherham and Tamworth.

UK prime minister talks of a ‘standing army’ of police to deal with riots.,https://www.sinardaily.my/article/220195/focus/world/uk-pm-promises-quotstanding-armyquot-of-officers-to-tackle-riots,"LONDON, UK - United Kingdom (UK) Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday that a ""standing army"" of specialist police officers would be established to deal with riots that have rocked the country following deadly stabbings in Southport, northwest England.

Starmer made the announcement after an emergency meeting with ministers and top law enforcement officials after far-right protesters violently clashed with police officers and counter-protesters in many cities and towns of the country in the past week.

In the past week, far-right protesters were seen throwing projectiles, attacking officers, looting stores and storming hotels housing asylum seekers in major cities like London, Manchester, Liverpool, Bristol, Leeds, Nottingham and Sunderland, as well as in towns like Middlesbrough, Bolton and Rotherham.

Police have arrested 378 people since the start of the disorder, UK's National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said on Monday.

NPCC Chair Gavin Stephens said he expects the number to rise each day as police forces continue to identify those involved and continue to apprehend those responsible.

""Violent disorder is a serious offence which often comes with a lengthy jail term,"" said Stephens.

Following the emergency meeting, Starmer said the government will ""ramp up criminal justice"" to ensure that ""sanctions are swift."" - XINHHUA"

4h ago 18.29 EDT A summary of today's developments Police have made 378 arrests so far since disorder broke out last week and the total is expected to rise each day, the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) said.

Keir Starmer said a “standing army” of specialist police officers would be set up to deal with rioting and unrest. The PM said: “We will have a standing army of specialist public duty officers so that we will have enough officers to deal with this where we need them,” the prime minister said, adding that “we will ramp up criminal justice. There have already been hundreds of arrests, some have appeared in court this morning.”

Judges condemned the recent violent scenes as the latest wave of suspects arrested after protests and riots across the country appeared in court. Several suspects have faced charges in court on Monday, after a sixth day of disorder which broke out in the wake of a knife attack in Southport last week which left three girls dead. One judge described scenes of violence in Belfast as “absolutely disgraceful” as he refused bail to two men accused of taking part in disorder which followed an anti-immigration protest in the city on Saturday. In another court, a boy aged 14 admitted violent disorder after he was seen by police officers to be among a group of young people setting fireworks off in the direction of members of the public and a police carrier. Deputy district judge Liam McStay told Belfast magistrates court: “The events at the weekend were absolutely disgraceful: a concerted and deliberate attempt to undermine public order and to then domineer the community and there were racist elements to it.”

Superintendent Russ Dawe, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said “several” officers have been injured following disorder in Plymouth city centre. Some 150 officers were deployed to de-escalate the situation. Six people were arrested. A police van was also damaged.

A spokesman for Merseyside Police said one child remained in hospital a week on from the Southport attack and all other patients had been discharged. Three girls, Elsie Dot Stancombe, Alice Dasilva Aguiar and Bebe King died, after the attack last Monday at a dance class. Eight other children and two adults were also injured.

Ministers are preparing an additional 500 prison places to cope with an influx of people expected to be held on remand over the next month, the Ministry of Justice said.

Downing Street criticised comments by Elon Musk who posted on X that “civil war is inevitable” under a video of violent riots in Liverpool. Keir Starmer’s spokesperson said the violence came from a small minority of people who “do not speak for Britain” and said the prime minister did not share the sentiments of the billionaire, who has previously been criticised for allowing far-right figures back on to his social media platform.

6h ago 16.06 EDT Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions, warned children who get involved in disorder could face life-long consequences. “One of the most striking features of the current outbreak of disorder is that many young people are involved. Children as young as 11. This is deeply disturbing,” he said. “They may face life-long consequences: conviction, and a permanent record of their involvement on the Police National Database. This can limit their employment options in the future and ability to travel to certain countries. “For adults, these offences can attract lengthy sentences of imprisonment, beyond the two-year maximum detention available for young offenders. “Sentencing is a matter for the judiciary, but from the evidence that I have seen, sentencing guidelines suggest that immediate imprisonment will be appropriate for the type of violent disorder that has been witnessed. “If this seems harsh, the reality, from reports I have received from prosecutors, is that there has been a terrible impact on communities: people barricaded in properties, businesses destroyed and police officers facing violence while trying to keep people safe.” Share"

By StephenRigley

An “army” of riot police officers is being mobilised to deal with further violent protests, Sir Keir Starmer said on Monday.

Listen to this article Loading audio...

After a meeting of Whitehall’s COBRA emergency committee, the Prime Minister said: “We will have a standing army of specialist officers, public duty officers, so we will have enough officers to deal with this where we need them.”

Sir Keir also stressed that the criminal justice system was being “ramped up” to deal with the people involved in the violence.

He has triggered a special judicial system so courts can sit for 24 hours to deal with the thugs who rampaged through towns and cities in Britain.

It comes despite comments on Monday evening from West Midlands Police Chief Constable, Craig Guildford, deterring counter-protestors from far-Right protests as numbers could see police resources stretched to their absolute limit.

Starmer says 'standing army' of police will be set up to deal with riots

The PM's announcement came after ministers held a Cobra meeting on Monday to discuss the government’s response to the riots which have swept through Britain's towns and cities.

Speaking after the meeting, the Prime Minister said: ""There are a number of actions that came out of the meeting.

""The first is we will have a Standing Army of specialist public duty officers so that we will have enough officers to deal with this where we need them.

""The second is we will ramp up criminal justice. There have already been hundreds of arrests, some have appeared in court this morning.

""I have asked for early consideration of the earliest naming and identification of those involved in the process who will feel the full force of the law.""

Starmer also stressed the criminal law applies to social media users as well as those involved in riots across the country.

Downing Street also confirmed there are enough free prison cells to ensure every last rioter is slammed in jail.

So far more than 420 people have been arrested since the riots erupted last week, with unrest witnessed in Middlesbrough and Bolton.

Hotels housing asylum seekers were attacked in Rotherham and Tamworth while violent rioters also destroyed a children's library in Liverpool and a Citizens Advice centre in Sunderland.

It comes as Chief Constable Craig Guildford of West Midlands Police today flagged that counter protests to far-Right activists could see police resources stretched to their absolute limit.

""Over the weekend, following the disorder seen across the country, it has been a busy weekend for the force where we have been undertaking business as usual in addition to supporting other forces as part of national contingency plans,"" he said.

""This is very much a tried and tested operation and our officers helped colleagues in Nottingham, Liverpool, Rotherham and Tamworth. Thankfully there have been no injuries to our officers reported. This morning we have also sent some resources to Tamworth.

Thanking the local mosque leadership ""for their support"" throughout the riots, Mr Guildford noted that ""at this time, I observe that counter protests, while fully understandable, could serve to unduly stretch national resources.

""As your Chief Constable I underline this message as I know the gold commander is focusing her resourcing plan upon those who criminally seek to undermine the communities of the West Midlands."""

The prime minister met with ministers and police chiefs, including Scotland Yard boss Mark Rowley, to discuss how to quell the violence that first broke out in Southport, northwest England, on Tuesday.

Starmer said that a ""standing army"" of specialist police would be set up to deal with rioting and that the justice system would be ramped up to deal with hundreds of arrests after violent disorder rocked cities across the nation over the past week.

""Whatever the apparent motivation, this is not a protest. It is pure violence, and we will not tolerate attacks on mosques or our Muslim communities,"" Starmer said.

""The full force of the law will be visited on all those who are identified as having taken part in these activities,"" the prime minister added.

Notably, hundreds of arrests have been made as police officers in riot gear responded to violent scenes in Rotherham, Middlesbrough, Bolton, and other parts of the UK on Sunday, after days of some of the worst rioting seen on the streets of the country in the wake of the fatal stabbings of three schoolgirls in Southport, north-west England.

Police have blamed the violence on people associated with the English Defence League, an anti-Islam organisation founded 15 years ago whose supporters have been linked to football hooliganism.

Hotels housing asylum seekers and mosques have been among the targets of the anti-immigrant mobs after initial false claims spread online regarding the stabbing suspect being an immigrant who arrived in the country illegally."

As he exited the Cabinet Office, the visibly angry Scotland Yard chief was filmed being asked by a Sky News journalist: 'Are we going to end two-tier policing sir?'

In the astonishing footage, Sir Mark was shown taking part of the microphone before throwing it to the floor as he headed towards a waiting car.

The bizarre incident came amid intense pressure on police chiefs to get a grip on the violent disorder causing chaos on UK streets, in the wake of last week's Southport stabbing attack.

Scotland Yard later defended Sir Mark for being 'in a hurry' to return to his office 'to take action on the agreed next steps' after an emergency Cobra meeting with top ministers.

Sir Keir Starmer is scrambling to put a lid on tensions and end the rioting in the first big test of his premiership since entering Downing Street a month ago.

After chairing the Cobra meeting this morning, the Prime Minister pledged a 'standing army' of specialist police officers to tackle what he has condemned as 'far-right thuggery'.

He and other senior ministers met with police chiefs and prison bosses in response to the continuing violence being waged by far-right thugs.

They updated on efforts to deploy officers to trouble hotspots, boost court capacity and tackle online criminality and misinformation as social media is used to whip up rioters.

Police have made 378 arrests so far since disorder broke out last week, the National Police Chiefs' Council said as it promised a 'united and robust policing response'.

'Two-tier policing' is a phrase used to described an impression that some protests and demonstrations are dealt with more harshly than others.

Reform UK leader Nigel Farage earlier claimed the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 had left feelings of 'two-tier policing', although his remarks were dismissed by Tory former home secretary Dame Priti Patel.

A narrative of 'politicised' or 'two-tier policing' has also been pushed by far-right figures, including England Defence League founder Tommy Robinson.

The PM's official spokesman said Sir Keir 'wouldn't recognise that characterisation of policing'.

'The job of the police is to keep everyone safe, to tackle violence and disorder no matter the origination,' the spokesman added.

'There is no justification at all for the scenes we have seen. There is no justification for any sorts of criminal activity.

'The police will always will always carry out their job without fear or favour.'

Speaking after this morning's Cobra meeting, the PM revealed a 'standing army' of specialist police officers would be set up to deal with unrest.

'There are a number of actions that came out of the meeting,' he said.

'The first is we will have a standing army of specialist public duty officers so that we will have enough officers to deal with this where we need them.

'The second is we will ramp up criminal justice. There have already been hundreds of arrests, some have appeared in court this morning.

'I have asked for early consideration of the earliest naming and identification of those involved in the process who will feel the full force of the law.

'Thirdly, I have been absolutely clear that the criminal law applies online as well as offline. I am assured that that is the approach that is being taken.

'Whatever the apparent motivation, this is not protest, it is pure violence and we will not tolerate attacks on mosques or our Muslim communities.

'So the full force of the law will be visited on all those who are identified as having taken part in these activities.'

The PM insisted the Government will 'make this work' when asked if there was enough room in prisons to deal with rioters.

He told broadcasters: 'On the question of prisons, firstly we are monitoring it on a daily basis.

'I am appalled that we have been put in this position by the previous government, that it is even a discussion, that it is even a question that you have to ask me.

'But we will make this work and ensure that we have got the places that are needed to bring the perpetrators swiftly to justice.'

Sir Keir denied that 'two-tier policing' was being carried out in the UK, saying: 'There is no two-tier policing.

'There is policing without fear or favour – exactly as it should be, exactly what I would expect and require. So that is a non-issue.'

In response to the incident involving Sir Mark and the Sky News reporter, a Met Police spokesperson said: 'The Commissioner had a positive and constructive meeting with the PM and partners across Government and policing.

'He was in a hurry to return to New Scotland Yard to take action on the agreed next steps.'

During the Cobra meeting, the PM 'paid tribute to the hard work of police officers over the past week and sent best wishes to those who have been injured protecting our streets', Downing Street said.

The talks were attended by Sir Keir, Deputy PM Angela Rayner, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood, Technology Secretary Peter Kyle, Attorney General Richard Hermer, and Darren Jones, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury.

They met with senior police and prison service leaders, bosses from the National Crime Agency (NCA), and other top officials.

The PM's official spokesman told reporters: 'There have been hundreds of arrests and people are already being charged, and police will continue to update on the specifics in relation to progress or arrests and charging.

'The police are continuing to deploy additional resource around the country at strategic locations where necessary.

'The police, Home Office, DSIT (Department for Science, Innovation and Technology) and NCA are working to tackle criminality online, to ensure people are prosecuted for online criminal activity. And they are working to tackle misinformation and bot activity.'

Downing Street warned that anyone whipping up violence online could face prison.

'I should be very clear that anyone who stokes this violence, whether on the internet or in person, can be prosecuted and face prison,' Sir Keir's official spokesman said.

Hundreds of far-right thugs have been arrested during six days of escalating disorder, which have seen attacks on police and buildings set alight.

Sir Keir vowed rioters would 'regret' engaging in 'far-right thuggery' and promised those involved in unrest would 'face the full force of the law' as he addressed the nation on Sunday.

Tory leadership contender James Cleverly, the shadow former secretary, has criticised the Labour Government's 'slow' response to the crisis.

Riots have broken out across the country fuelled by misinformation on social media since three little girls were stabbed to death at a Taylor Swift themed dance class in Southport on Monday.

Hundreds of police officers have been injured in clashes with thugs, as far-right activists led the way in attacking police officers, mosques and hotels thought to house asylum seekers this week.

Islamophobic chants were heard and in some areas of the country rioters were filmed stopping cars and interrogating drivers about whether they were 'white and English'.

Speaking ahead of the Cobra meeting, the Home Secretary said the Government is not recalling Parliament 'right now'.

'That's not what we're doing right now. What we're doing right now is keeping in close contact with MPs,' Ms Cooper said.

Communities are now coming together to begin the massive clean-up operation in towns including Rotherham, Middlesbrough and Tamworth.

Adam Wharton indicated a guilty plea and will be sentenced on August 29. Ellis Wharton was also charged with assault on an emergency worker. Sunderland Josh Kellett, 29, of Southcroft, Washington, admitted violent disorder at South Tyneside Magistrates Court on Monday.

A large crowd gathered outside a mosque in Middlesbrough on Sunday night and others have also been targeted.

On Saturday night Spellow Lane Library in Liverpool was torched while in Sunderland local travel agents Hays Travel, known for its commitment to raising money for charity, had its storefront smashed.

In Rotherham, anti-immigration rioters smashed the windows of the Holiday Inn Express before starting fires in an apparent attempt to set the building alight while dozens of people were inside it.

At least 10 officers were injured there, including one who was knocked unconscious, South Yorkshire Police confirmed later, saying one person had already been arrested and others involved should 'expect us to be at their doors very soon'.

Masked men hurled lengths of wood, chairs and bottles, and sprayed fire extinguishers at officers outside after some 700 people gathered.

Islamophobic and racist chants were heard at multiple riots across the country, with images appearing to show some members of the mobs performing Nazi salutes.

A similar incident played out at a Holiday Inn hotel in Tamworth into Sunday evening, where reports suggested asylum seekers were also being housed.

People threw projectiles, smashed windows, started fires and targeted officers, Staffordshire Police said.

A group of rioters in Middlesbrough smashed the windows of houses and cars and threw objects at officers on Sunday afternoon, with one seen shouting a racial slur and another telling police: 'It's our f****** country.'

Video footage showed groups of youths and young men running from house to house and smashing windows and cars parked outside, throwing bricks, traffic cones and other objects.

Youths also appeared to loot a branch of Iceland, with one teenager running out triumphantly while holding a bottle of Friji.

And footage from a local park appeared to show a group of white men and boys with faces covered surrounding and attacking a group, with violence erupting before they fled the scene.

Nearby, a Muslim leader at a mosque told community members who had turned out to protect their place of worship to 'show the world what Muslims are really like'.

Addressing far-right violence in the town, he said: 'They are doing all the wrong things. We don't want to be part of it.'

Other local Muslims were seen carrying tea and coffee to police officers on the front line of the town amid fierce violence from the far-right.

There were 43 arrests, and significant damage was caused to the Crown Court and the University, Cleveland Police said.

Greater Manchester Police issued a Section 60AA order amid disturbances in Bolton, requiring people to 'remove face coverings used to disguise or conceal their appearance'.

And in Weymouth, police said three people were arrested and dispersal orders put in place for several teenagers.

A 42-year-old man from Yeovil was arrested on suspicion of a public order offence, a 62-year-old man from Yeovil was arrested for being drunk and disorderly and a 27-year-old man from Weymouth was arrested for assault.

Assistant Chief Constable Mark Callaghan said two officers were injured - one when a bottle his them in the face and a second who was punched in the head.

He said: 'There were rumours circulating that asylum seekers currently housed on the Bibby Stockholm would be moved to Portland, Weymouth or the wider Dorset Council area but the Home Office have confirmed this is not the case.

'In addition, there are no asylum seekers housed in hotels in the Weymouth area.'

The widespread unrest poses the biggest challenge yet to Sir Keir's premiership, with MPs including Ian Byrne and Dame Priti Patel saying Parliament should be recalled as it was in 2011 so the Commons could debate the riots.

The race riots have spread from Southport to cities including London, Leeds, Rotherham, Manchester, Blackbool, Belfast and Aldershot.

It comes after Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said there would be a 'reckoning' following unrest across England, as she pledged that anyone involved in the riots will 'pay the price'.

She told Sky News: 'It's a total disgrace and there has to be a reckoning. Those individuals who are involved in the disorder need to know that they will pay a price.'

'I've made clear to the police they have my full support in going after the full range of offenders, from those who turned up at the last minute and joined in the looting, to some of the most serious offenders who were pursuing really dangerous arson, really dangerous damage and criminal violence, because we simply cannot stand for this.

'So we should be clear, there will be people who were thinking they were going on their summer holidays this week, and instead they will face a knock on the door from the police.

'They will face arrest and... a police cell, while they wait for trial in order to make sure that they do pay the price for what they have done,' she added.

Ms Cooper claimed that social media has put 'rocket boosters' under far-right organisations.

But she said the courts are on 'stand-by' to ensure 'swift justice': 'We have made sure that the courts are on stand-by. We've made sure that there are additional prosecutors in place this weekend, and hundreds of arrests have already taken place. So we do expect swift justice to take place.'

Residents saw their car windows smashed and businesses suffered attacks including arson

Asked if the Army would be called upon, Ms Cooper said: 'So, the police have the expertise and also the powers in terms of dealing with public order and crime, because this is crime.

'There are also significant additional numbers of public order-trained police, who were not deployed this weekend, so there are considerable additional policing resources that forces can call upon.'

Pressed on whether the Government will take action against Tommy Robinson, who has been accused of stoking tensions from afar, Ms Cooper said: 'If it's a crime offline, it's a crime online.'

'You can't just have the the armchair thuggery or the people being able to incite and organise violence and also not face consequences for this,' she added.

Shadow Secretary James Cleverly said: 'The things that we have seen are completely unjustified. These are the actions of people who are clearly responding to disinformation online but are obviously motivated by racism.

'We've seen people with Swastika tattoos and making the Nazi salute... attacking people who have no link at all to the terrible incidents that we saw in Southport last week and it is absolutely right that the government is taking firm action.

'When you've people giving Nazi salutes with Swastika tattoos that is clearly far-right extremism.

'It's clearly these attacks on mosques on hotels these are clearly driven by racism and should be unequivocally condemned.'

But he also criticised Starmer's new government for not reacting quickly enough: 'They could and should have been quicker, it's worrying that it's only today that cobra is meeting.

'We want to support the government taking firm action against this violence but they have to move much more quickly and they have to be more agile, more decisive. Had I still be Home Secretary I would have called a Cobra much earlier than this.'

He continued: 'I'm really uncomfortable with the idea that somehow this violence reflects a wider national move. This is a group of extreme people.

'People committing arson, attacking mosques, targeting asylum hotels, they are not reflective of the country. This is a generous and open hearted country. The people in this country are not represented by the thugs that are attacking people, committing arson and targeting places of worship.'

The former first minister of Scotland Humza Yousaf said the army should be called in to stop 'thugs' causing disorder on the streets.

Ministers have so far insisted police have the resources required to respond and have rejected calls to bring in the army.

Sir Keir said he wanted those who 'feel targeted because of the colour of their skin' to know 'this violent mob do not represent our country'.

In his message to rioters, the Prime Minister said: 'I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves.'

Dame Sara Khan, who was Rishi Sunak's independent adviser for social cohesion and resilience until May, blamed the Conservative government for leaving the country open to far-right violence.

'The writing was clearly on the wall for some time,' she told the Guardian.

Writing in The Times, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said 'there will be reckoning' for people who took part in the unrest and those who 'whipped them up on social media and in online chat forums'.

'Whatever they and some of their political supporters may tell us, these are not patriots standing up for their communities,' she said.

'They are thugs, criminals and extremists who betray the values our country is built on.'

She said those responsible would be 'paying the price for years to come'.

Ms Cooper slammed actions taken by rioters this week after more than 420 people were arrested, as she warned 'many more will follow' as authorities scour CCTV footage to identify all those involved.

Clashes, sparked by the murder of three little girls in Southport last Monday, deteriorated further yesterday when a second migrant hotel was set ablaze in Tamworth, while hundreds cheered and clinked beers outside.

In Middlesbrough far-right yobs were filmed stopping traffic to interrogate the passengers to check they were 'white and English'.

Keir Starmer also waded in to warn far-Right rioters 'you'll regret taking part' as he tried to stamp his authority over the first major test of his Premiership.

He blasted 'far-Right thuggery', for which he promised swift justice as he is expected to call a COBRA meeting today.

Meanwhile, the Tories were forced to reprimanded Shadow Wales Secretary Lord Davies of Gower after The Mail on Sunday columnist Dan Hodges said there was 'no political justification' for the riots and Lord Davies retorted: 'Labour blocked the Rwanda Bill 130+ times, of course it's politically justified!'

This came after Tommy Robinson posted a video of a confrontation in Stoke and falsely claimed two 'protesters' had been stabbed 'by Muslims'. The post was viewed two million times on X.

Two hours later, Staffordshire Police confirmed the information was false. Those injured were hit by something thrown by their own side.

Actor Laurence Fox has also shared a string of false claims. On Friday night, he posted a list of dozens of acts of violence he alleged had been committed by immigrants under the caption: 'Anyone else had enough?'

Among them was the claim that a 'woman [was] beaten to death by two Somalis while walking her dog' – understood to have been a reference to last month's murder of Anita Rose, 57, in Brantham, Suffolk.

Three people have been arrested in connection with the murder, but Suffolk Police last night confirmed Fox's tweet was not correct.

Hundreds of people gathered as a group of masked thugs threw a burning bush inside the side entrance of the Hotel Inn Express, Leisure Island, in Tamworth yesterday evening.

'Get out England' was graffitied on the side of the building, as police worked to extinguish the fire inside the hotel's stairwell.

Some people could be heard chanting 'England, England, England,' while others threw objects at police and set off flares and fireworks. One man could be seen running towards police with what appeared to be a large speaker.

Officers clad in riot gear were seen standing in a line guarding the entrance to the hotel. One police officer has suffered a suspected broken arm.

Police have said the violent disorder has been 'successfully dispersed' as they appeal to anyone with information to help identify those responsible.

Starmer blasted 'far-Right thuggery', for which he promised swift justice amid another day of violent scenes nationwide.

He is today expected to hold an emergency COBRA Cabinet meeting, attended by police chiefs, in a bid to ensure the crisis does not spiral further out of control.

He also opened the door yesterday to tougher sentences to act as a 'deterrent', saying he will do 'whatever it takes' to crack down on the violence. He said the sentences would mirror action taken to deal with thuggery during the 2011 riots, when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.

An asylum seeker who was staying at the Holiday Inn in Tamworth when it was set alight, told the Times of his terror as he was beaten up by the mob when they broke in.

'They came onto this floor and hit me until the police drove them down the corridor.'

While another 55-year-old Palestinian said his window was pelted with rocks thrown at his window.

'I was taking some tea when they ran down shouting f***, f***, f***. A shirtless man was shouting and making so much noise. They broke the windows. There were eight on my floor.'

While John Woodcock, a former Labour MP, called for MI6, MI5 and GCHQ to be given additional powers that would allow them to ask social media firms to take down accounts that try to 'fan the flames of British extreme actors'.

Malaysia has become the first country to warn its citizens about the dangers of visiting Britain at the moment.

The statement released by Malaysia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: 'Malaysians residing in or travelling to the United Kingdom are urged to stay away from protest areas, remain vigilant and follow the latest updates and guidance provided by local authorities.'

More than 300 started marching through Middlesbrough after gathering at the city's Cenotaph.

The thugs chanted 'We want our country back' as they made their way through the city centre, before at least two people were taken away in handcuffs.

Police have said that there was a 'staggering' surge of violence which led to 35 people being arrested in Middlesbrough on Sunday.

Rioters smashed the windows of houses and cars and hurled objects at officers, with one seen shouting a racial slur and another telling police: 'It's our f****** country.'

There was significant damage to the crown court, the university and a number of properties in the Parliament Road area.

Cleveland Police said it has now arrested 55 people because of the violence that has swept across Teesside as 20 suspects were also arrested after rioting in Hartlepool on Wednesday.

Assistant Chief Constable David Felton said: 'The level of violence we have seen today is staggering.

'We know the shocking scenes across Middlesbrough today will have caused alarm amongst communities.

'I want to reassure the people of Teesside that we will continue to identify those involved in these acts of violence and arrest them and put them before the courts.'

At one point police used dogs to keep the group back and stop them breaking through and running ahead of the officers patrolling the march. Several pieces of slate were also thrown, along with vapes and full plastic bottles.

Some people kicked bollards into the road so that police vehicles driving ahead of the group could not get through, and one man sat on the bonnet of a police car to stop it moving.

In Bolton, Greater Manchester, violent clashes between rioters and police broke out, with footage showing the activists pushing against officers who had formed a human barricade.

There was also an counter protest in Bolton, where it was reported that large groups of Asian men could be heard shouting 'Allahu Akbar' as they clashed with the far-right.

Last night experts condemned the 'dangerous' behaviour and also called for stricter action against those spreading misinformation.

Festus Akinbusoye, a former police and crime commissioner, said: 'Of course there are discussions to be had about the level of immigration, the type of immigration and issues like integration.

'But misinformation and xenophobic narratives are wrong, irresponsible and dangerous. These actions are having real world consequences and the people spreading dangerous lies need to be brought to book.'

Mr Akinbusoye, who was Britain's first black PCC, added: 'Our entire criminal justice system is going to have to be revisited in terms of how the authorities are going to be able to legitimately counter and pre-empt these narratives.

'I understand that police forces need to be careful about what they put into the public domain but they need to... publish safe information whenever possible.'

Tory leadership hopeful Mel Stride said the scrapping of pilots of rapid-response police units, introduced by the Tories last March, may make it harder to tackle the current disorder.

It comes after an angry far-right mob stormed into a hotel in Rotherham yesterday, hurling chairs and spraying fire extinguishers at riot police, while setting bins, a generator and furniture alight.

Around 700 violent thugs clad in balaclavas and draped in St George's flags clashed with officers trying to protect the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham, South Yorkshire since around 2pm this afternoon.

At least 10 officers have been injured in the chaos outside the hotel on the northern outskirts of the post-industrial town. One was left unconscious following a head injury, another suffered a suspected fractured elbow and other suspected broken bones.

It marks yet another day of violent riots of Britain's streets, with crowds in Middlesbrough setting fire to a car and pushing burning wheelie bins at police, while thugs in Rotherham smash windows and doors as riot police use shields to push them back.

South Yorkshire Police said one person has been arrested on suspicion of public order offences.

Similar scenes could be seen in Weymouth, as around 400 protesters from opposing sides gathered on the seafront to chant at each other. One side could be heard chanting 'Nazis go home', while the other shouted 'Tommy Robinson'."
UK prime minister talks of a ‘standing army’ of police to deal with riots.,https://www.rte.ie/news/uk/2024/0805/1463489-uk-demonstrator-riots/,"A ""standing army"" of specialist police officers is being assembled to crack down on rioting, the British Prime Minister said as he called for perpetrators to be named and shamed.

Keir Starmer vowed to ""ramp up criminal justice"" after an emergency Cobra meeting was called in the wake of a sixth day of disorder which saw rioters storm hotels housing asylum seekers.

It comes as rival protest groups clashed in Plymouth this evening.

Devon and Cornwall Police said 150 officers were deployed in Plymouth city centre and ""work is ongoing to de-escalate the situation"" after officers were injured during clashes.

In a post on social media, the force said: ""Violence will not be tolerated, hate will not be tolerated.

So far, 344 people have been arrested since the violence broke out on Tuesday.

Several suspects faced charges in court on Monday, as ministers and police chiefs descended on Westminster for the meeting setting out the response for the coming days in a bid to clamp down on further unrest.

Calls for the army to be brought in have so far been dismissed, with the Government insisting the police already have the resources needed to respond.

Speaking after the meeting and listing the action due to be taken, the Prime Minister said: ""The first is we will have a standing army of specialist public duty officers so that we will have enough officers to deal with this where we need them.

""The second is we will ramp up criminal justice. There have already been hundreds of arrests, some have appeared in court this morning.

""I have asked for early consideration of the earliest naming and identification of those involved in the process who will feel the full force of the law.""

It comes as Sir Keir addressed the nation on Sunday amid the biggest challenge to his premiership so far, telling perpetrators they would ""regret"" engaging in ""far-right thuggery"" and promising those involved in unrest that they would ""face the full force of the law"".

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the courts are on ""standby"" to ensure ""swift justice"". Although several cases were already in motion, questions were being raised about how quickly this would happen in reality as it emerged some suspects will not face court for weeks.

Staffordshire Police said two people charged over disorder in Stoke-on-Trent on Saturday were not due in court for more than a fortnight and others accused of being involved in unrest in Bristol are not due to face court until September, Avon and Somerset Police said.

Elsewhere, defendants were being brought before magistrates in Belfast, Sheffield, Liverpool and South Tyneside in the latest wave of court appearances.

Judges condemned the ""disgraceful"" and ""large-scale mob violence"" while some courts heard how defendants took advantage of the disorder to commit crime.

A woman admitted pushing over a large bin towards police in Sunderland, after getting involved when the pub where she had been drinking closed, and a man said he stole vapes from a shop that had been damaged during the violent scenes in the town after ""socialising with friends"".

A 30-year-old man accused of swinging a stick at a woman during disorder outside Sheffield City Hall sobbed in the dock as he denied the charges against him.

The unrest has prompted some MPs to demand Parliament is recalled so the problems can be debated in the Commons, as it was during the 2011 riots.

The Board of Deputies of British Jews called for a ""national conversation"" on promoting respect for the country and each other, as it condemned the ""lawlessness and thuggery"".

Former home secretary Priti Patel said she would not feel safe in some of the areas where violence unfolded and that the racism on display was no different from that of the 1970s and 1980s.

The UK Home Office brought in urgent measures on Sunday to make sure mosques were offered extra protection so any threats of more attacks on places of worship could be responded to quickly.

A mosque in Middlesbrough was the latest of several to be targeted.

People threw projectiles, smashed windows and targeted officers, Staffordshire Police said

Organisation Tell Mama, which monitors anti-Muslim attacks, said it had called the police after it ""identified more far-right threats on Telegram that seek to target immigration solicitors and refugee services"" in more than 30 locations across the country on Wednesday.

Priti Patel, the Conservative MP for Essex constituency Witham, also rejected claims there was ""two-tier policing"" in Britain, where right-wing protests are dealt with more harshly than left-wing ones, something the Prime Minister also denied as he insisted policing was ""without fear or favour"".

The most senior police officer in the country, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Mark Rowley, appeared to grab a reporter's microphone and throw it on the ground when he was asked about two-tier policing as he left the Cobra meeting. Asked about the incident, the force said he was ""in a hurry"".

A police car is set on fire as activists hold an 'Enough is Enough' protest in Sunderland

Among the latest scenes of widespread and continued disorder, which broke out in the wake of a knife attack last week which left three girls dead, anti-immigration rioters smashed the windows of the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham at the weekend before starting fires.

Masked men hurled lengths of wood, chairs and bottles with some spraying fire extinguishers at police officers amid the 700-strong crowd.

At least 10 officers were injured, with one knocked unconscious, South Yorkshire Police said. One arrest had already been made and others involved should ""expect us to be at their doors very soon"", the force said.

Violence broke out in several parts of England and Northern Ireland following the killing of three young girls in Southport last week

On Sunday evening, a similar incident played out at a Holiday Inn hotel in Tamworth, Staffordshire, where reports suggested asylum seekers were also being housed, in a scene which saw fires, smashed windows and missiles being thrown at officers, Staffordshire Police said.

Earlier in the afternoon, a group of rioters in Middlesbrough smashed the windows of houses and cars and threw objects at officers.

There were 43 arrests, with crown court and university buildings sustaining significant damage, Cleveland Police said.

Greater Manchester Police used powers amid disturbances in Bolton to order people to ""remove face coverings used to disguise or conceal their appearance""."
UK prime minister talks of a ‘standing army’ of police to deal with riots.,https://news.sky.com/story/keir-starmer-riots-parliament-conservative-leadership-latest-live-12593360,"Labour MP demands government give official Islamophobia definition

As well as calling out what he's described as ""far right thuggery"", the prime minister has used his statements on the riots to send solidarity to Muslim communities that have been targeted.

Mosques have been offered greater protection by the Home Office, which has been welcomed by faith leaders.

But Labour MP Afzal Khan wants his party to go further, writing to the PM demanding the government provide a definition of Islamophobia to combat the ""racism and vitriol"" of the past week.

He wants Sir Keir Starmer's government to adopt a definition put forward following an inquiry in 2017.

It reads: ""Islamophobia is rooted in racism and is a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness.""



Watch anti-racist activists chase rioters from mosque:

Tories accused of 'ignoring' Islamophobia

Mr Khan, who also wants the PM to meet Muslim community leaders, said such racism had become ""mainstream"" since 2010.

The Manchester Rusholme MP wrote in a letter to Sir Keir: ""It is imperative that this Labour government, in stark contrast to the previous Conservative governments, will not ignore Islamophobia when it occurs.""



The previous Tory administration reclined to adopt the proposed definition because it said the wording could harm freedom of speech.

Rishi Sunak, the then prime minister, would often instead refer to an ""anti-Muslim hatred""."
"Evan Gershkovich, freed Americans now face IRS fines, fees for their services.",https://www.poynter.org/commentary/2024/russias-false-charges-for-evan-gershkovich-provoked-a-loud-response-from-the-wall-street-journal/,"After 17 months in a Russian prison, Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich was freed last week in a prisoner swap between the United States and Russia.

During the time Gershkovich was imprisoned — on trumped-up charges of espionage — the Journal relentlessly pursued the story and advocated for the journalist’s release.

Last October, Journal editor-in-chief Emma Tucker announced assistant editor Paul Beckett would step away from his regular gig to focus on getting Gershkovich freed.

Appearing on CBS News’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday, Beckett said, “Very very early on, someone in the government to whom I’ll always be grateful to for this advice said there’s a time to be loud and there’s a time to be quiet, and now is the time to be loud. And so we stayed loud until we knew the time to be quiet. And that time to be quiet was Wednesday and Thursday of this week.”

Correspondent Ed O’Keefe asked whether Beckett was ever concerned “that by being so public, it potentially put him at greater risk or that it put other colleagues either at the Journal or at other publications at greater risk?”

“The Russians didn’t give us much of a choice,” Beckett said, “because they came out and said he is a spy. Total nonsense.”

Meanwhile, for The Washington Post, opinion writer Jason Rezaian shared some hard-earned advice for Gershkovich and the others freed in the prisoner swap — businessman and former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan, journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, and Vladimir Kara-Murza, a British-Russian dissident and Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist. Rezaian was imprisoned by Iran for nearly a year and a half and was freed in 2016.

“After the euphoria wears off, though, a new set of challenges will inevitably emerge. Having been cut off from society for months or years, the returning hostages will face difficulty returning to ordinary life,” Rezaian wrote.

He wrote that he found the IRS had charged him thousands of dollars for not filing taxes on time — fees that compounded. His wife’s immigration papers had expired. Bills that were set to autopay had been declined and his credit rating was shattered.

“I was sleeping less than three hours a night, repeatedly waking from nightmares that I was back in prison,” he wrote. “During the day, I was distracted and having trouble concentrating. So I neglected to sit down and address the problem.”

Rezaian urged the House of Representatives to approve a bill — the Stop Tax Penalties on American Hostages Act, which passed through the Senate in May — to help others like Gershkovich.

“As a free society, we owe the victims of this abuse more than our support and empathy,” he wrote. “Considerable resources were expended in the effort to negotiate their release. It is important now to invest more to return them to normal life.”

In an interview after a win at the Olympics, basketball star Brittney Griner, who was also imprisoned by Russia in 2022, said she was “head over heels” that the Americans had been freed.

“Great day. It’s a great day. It’s a great day,” she said. “… Any day that Americans come home, that’s a win. That’s a win.”

Finally, The New York Times’ Emmett Lindner interviewed Anton Troianovski, the Moscow bureau chief for The New York Times, who, Lindner writes, “has been following the story from both a professional and a personal perspective: He met Mr. Gershkovich in Russia in 2018, and the two bonded over their shared journalistic mission.”

Troianovski wrote a piece on Thursday that reconstructed how the deal between the U.S. and Russia happened and what it means for future international agreements. Lindner spoke to him about that story and his friendship with Gershkovich.

And now for more media news, tidbits and interesting links

What’s the latest with the debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump? It’s getting hard to follow. On Friday, Trump pulled out of an ABC News debate set for Sept. 10 that was supposed to be between him and former President Joe Biden. Instead, he said he would appear on Fox News on Sept. 4 and invited Harris to debate him. Harris said she’d see Trump at the event “he already agreed to.” Trump responded, “I’ll see her on September 4th or, I won’t see her at all.” Trump said that if she does not sign on for the proposed Fox News debate — which would include a full audience, unlike the ABC News debate he pulled out of — it would turn into a town hall. It’s unclear if the ABC News debate would become a Harris town hall now that Trump is not part of it. It seems increasingly possible that Harris and Trump will never meet before Election Day.

Still, on Sunday NewsNation shot its shot and joined a growing list of news organizations that have pitched debates to the candidates.

Fascinating stuff from Thomas Bach, the president of the International Olympic Committee: “We are on track for more than half the world’s population to follow the Olympic Games Paris 2024.”

In a headline in the print sports section on Friday, The Boston Globe misidentified Algerian boxer Imane Khelif as transgender. (As our colleagues at PolitiFact noted, Khelif is not transgender; she was born female, has lived her life female and competes female.) In an editor’s note, the Globe wrote: “We recognize the magnitude of this mistake and have corrected it in the epaper, the electronic version of the printed Globe. This editing lapse is regrettable and unacceptable and we apologize to Khelif, to Associated Press writer Greg Beacham, and to you, our readers.”

The New York Times’ Emmett Lindner writes, “Ina Jaffe, Dogged and Award-Winning NPR Reporter, Dies at 75.” Jaffe was an NPR correspondent for nearly 40 years, was the first editor of “Weekend Edition Saturday” and contributed to “All Things Considered.” She was known for her coverage of aging in America. Jaffe’s husband told the Times that she had been living with metastatic breast cancer for several years. Jaffe wrote about her diagnosis in 2021.

NPR’s Scott Simon has more in “Remembering our colleague and friend, Ina Jaffe.” Simon writes, “Jaffe was the first editor of Weekend Edition. In many ways this program grew out of our Chicago Bureau, and the style of reporting we tried to practice there. ‘Make ‘em laugh, make ‘em cry, make ‘em come back for more,’ Jaffe used to tell us. I hope you hear that in this show to this day.”

Notable line in this New York Times story about China skirting U.S. bans on exports of artificial intelligence chips: “But given the vast profits at stake, businesses around the world have found ways to skirt the restrictions, according to interviews with more than 85 current and former U.S. officials, executives and industry analysts, as well as reviews of corporate records and visits to companies in Beijing, Kunshan and Shenzhen.” That’s a lot of interviews. That’s quality journalism.

We keep repeating the word “unprecedented” when discussing this political news cycle. But there is precedent for much of it, just not in contemporary history. And then there’s this: “Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Admits He Left a Dead Bear in Central Park.” The New York Times’ Emma G. Fitzsimmons writes that Kennedy “confessed on Sunday that he had left a dead bear cub in Central Park in Manhattan in 2014 because he thought it would be ‘amusing.’” Uhh … pretty sure this one is actually unprecedented.

Venezuela’s top prosecutor announces a criminal probe of opposition leaders.,https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-election-armed-forces-maduro-gonzalez-763defac84e8234ff36e0dc6182efdf7,"CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Venezuela’s top prosecutor on Monday announced a criminal investigation against the opposition’s presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators.

Attorney General Tarek William Saab’s statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election.

Saab, in a written announcement posted on the social media site X, said the duo “falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council, the only body qualified to do so” and they openly incited “police and military officials to disobey the laws.”

Gonzalez’s and Machado’s written appeal shows the alleged commission of various crimes including usurpation of functions, dissemination of false information to cause fear and conspiracy, Saab said.

The armed forces are traditionally the arbiter of political disputes in Venezuela. But they’ve shown no signs of ditching Maduro even in the face of credible evidence presented by the opposition that it trounced the self-proclaimed socialist at the polls by a more than 2-to-1 margin.

González and Machado called on rank and file members of the security forces to rethink their loyalty to Maduro.

“We appeal to the conscience of the military and police to put themselves on the side of the people and their families,” the two wrote in a long message.

“We won this election without any doubt. It was an electoral avalanche,” the two continued. “Now it’s up to all of us to respect the voice of the people.”

Authorities have declared Maduro the victor in last Sunday’s election but have yet to produce voting tallies to prove he won. The opposition claims to have collected records from more than 80% of the 30,000 polling booths nationwide showing it won.

Maduro announced Saturday that the government has arrested 2,000 opponents and at a rally in Caracas he pledged to detain more people and send them to prison. The post-electoral uprising has also claimed at least 11 lives, according to Foro Penal, a Caracas-based human rights group.

The Venezuela-based human rights organization Provea, in a report issued Monday analyzing the post-election climate, concluded that the government’s response in silencing people’s discontent has been “through the disproportionate use of force” that has resulted in the deaths of protesters and “the open coordinated action between security forces and groups of armed civilians in favor of Nicolás Maduro to calm the protests” which has led to an increase in arbitrary arrests.

The organization reported that based on figures announced by the Attorney General’s Office last week, the number of arrests against real or perceived government opponents is equivalent to about 42% “of the total number of arbitrary arrests recorded by Provea between April and August 2017, the most important cycle of protests in the country since 1989.”

González and Machado in their missive called on Venezuelans with family members serving in the security forces to urge their loved ones not to attack protesters and not obey illegal orders. It said it would offer “guarantees” to soldiers who follow the constitution even while promising there would be no impunity for those behind abuses and following illegal orders.

Both González, a former diplomat, and Machado — who was barred by the government from running — have gone into hiding, saying they fear they will be arrested or killed. Maduro and his cadres have threatened to lock them both up.

As Venezuelans fight Maduro on the streets, pressure is also building internationally for the Venezuelan government to publish the full breakdown of the electoral results.

But so far, Maduro has instead asked the country’s supreme court — which like all institutions in Venezuela is packed with loyalists — to review any claims of irregularities.

“Respect for popular sovereignty is what moves us to defend the transparency of the (election) results,” Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said Monday in a press conference alongside fellow leftist President Gabriel Boric of Chile.

Boric, who cast doubt on Maduro’s victory claim in an unexpectedly strong statement within hours of Venezuela’s July 28 election, told reporters that he and Lula discussed the situation in Venezuela on Monday, without elaborating. The leaders did not take questions and their carefully worded statements signaled how leftist leaders in the region are gingerly trying to show respect for Venezuela’s sovereignty while voicing doubts about the official results.

A few of Maduro’s staunch allies — including Russia, China and Cuba — have applauded his victory. On Monday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian held a telephone call with Maduro and reiterated his congratulations and “condemned any foreign interference in Venezuela’s internal affairs,” Pezeshkian’s office said.

Tensions in the Middle East have soared following the assassinations last week of a senior Hezbollah commander in Beirut and Hamas’s top political leader in Tehran. Iran and its allies have blamed Israel for the attacks and threatened retaliation.

Mr Netanyahu said Israel was ready for any scenario as its allies attempt to contain the conflict. Jordan’s foreign minister was making a rare trip to Iran as part of diplomatic efforts while the Pentagon has moved significant assets to the region.

“We are doing everything possible to make sure that this situation does not boil over,” White House deputy national security adviser Jon Finer told ABC on Sunday."

The airstrikes come as violence flared again in the Israeli-occupied territory with tensions high over the war in Gaza and a potential regional escalation.

Ceasefire discussions on Gaza continued, with an Israel delegation led by the Mossad chief briefly visiting Cairo, an Egyptian official said.

The US has urged Israel to seize the chance for a ceasefire after the shock killing of Hamas’ political leader in Iran, which Tehran blames on Israel.

That killing and Israel’s assassination of a Hezbollah commander in Lebanon have the region holding its breath for retaliation against Israel on either front, or both, after Iran and its proxies vowed to act.

Hamas said its command had begun discussions on choosing a new leader.

In the northern West Bank, the Israeli army said its forces first struck a vehicle in a rural area outside the city of Tulkarem early on Saturday, killing the five occupants.

The army said they were on their way to carry out an attack. Hamas identified all five as militants with the group, including a local commander.

According to an Associated Press journalist and witnesses, the blast took place along a road connecting the Palestinian villages of Zeita and Qaffin.

“We came to the site and found a young man martyred here on the street and half of his face was missing,” said Taiser Abdullah, a Zeita resident.

The official Palestinian news agency Wafa said four bodies were “burned and charred beyond recognition”.

Later on Saturday, Israel’s military said it killed four other Palestinian militants in the Tulkarem area shortly after they opened fire on Israeli troops.

No further information was immediately available.

Over 590 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank since the Israel-Hamas war began in Gaza in October, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.

Most have been killed during Israeli raids and violent protests. Tulkarem is regularly raided by Israeli forces, and Palestinian militant groups, including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, are active there.

A strike in central Gaza early on Sunday hit a tent area in the courtyard of Al Aqsa Martyrs hospital, killing four people, including a woman, and injuring others, health officials said.

An Associated Press journalist filmed men rushing to the scene to help the injured and retrieve bodies while trying to extinguish the fire.

Concerns about a full-fledged regional war are high after the assassinations of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran early on Wednesday and top Hezbollah commander Fouad Shukur in Beirut the evening before.

Iran and its proxies, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, vowed to retaliate against Israel, which said it killed Mr Shukur but has not confirmed or denied its role in Mr Haniyeh’s death.

Iran’s Revolutionary Guard said a short-range projectile was behind the killing and accused the United States of supporting the attack."

The Pentagon said on Friday the U.S. military will move a fighter jet squadron to the Middle East and maintain an aircraft carrier in the region. The U.S. Embassy in Lebanon encouraged citizens who wish to leave to ""book any ticket available,"" noting that several airlines have suspended or canceled flights. The British government called on its citizens in Lebanon to “leave now.” Jordan did the same.

President Joe Biden on August 1 said he had urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to seize the chance for a cease-fire with Hamas, adding that Haniyeh’s killing had “not helped” efforts to negotiate an end to the war. Mr. Netanyahu has vowed to destroy Hamas' military and governing capabilities.

“On August 3 midday, an Israeli delegation led by Mossad chief David Barnea arrived in Cairo,” an Egyptian official said. “The delegation, which also included Ronan Bar, chief of Israel’s internal security agency Shin Bet, was to meet with Abbas Kamel, head of Egypt’s General Intelligence Service, for talks on the Philadelphi corridor along the border with Egypt and the Rafah crossing point,” the official said.

“The delegation left Cairo hours later and there was nothing new,” said the Egyptian official, who has direct knowledge of the Gaza cease-fire negotiations and spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorised to brief reporters.

There was no immediate comment from Israeli officials. Mr. Netanyahu's office on August 2 said he ordered the negotiation delegation to leave for Cairo on Saturday or Sunday.

Egypt's Foreign Minister had calls with counterparts in Iran and Lebanon about the “dangerous” escalation in the region.

As protesters in various countries marked 300 days of the war in Gaza and expressed support for Palestinians, the death toll inside the territory is nearing 40,000. At least 39,550 have been killed in the nearly 10 months since Hamas’ brutal October 7 attack on Israel. That's according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count. Israel has accused Hamas of embedding in the civilian population and putting it at risk.

In the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood in Gaza City on Saturday, witnesses told the AP an Israeli strike targeting a school killed an unspecified number of people. Israel's military said it struck a Hamas command centre.

Most of Gaza's population of about 2.3 million is displaced, many people multiple times, as Israel's military returns to areas where it says Hamas militants have regrouped. Health services and sanitation have largely collapsed across the territory as hunger grows.

Families of hostages taken on October 7 and others again held protests on Saturday night in Israel seeking a deal to end the war. “Most of the military targets were achieved, there is no reason to continue this war,” said one protester Naama Weinberg."
Ukraine’s Zelenskyy displays newly arrived F-16 fighter jets.,https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-f16-zelenskyy-3cd2cd27af1a135bb8179fe6776446f6,"SOMEWHERE IN UKRAINE (AP) — Ukraine’s newly arrived F-16 fighter jets were put on display Sunday by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who said the planes will boost the country’s war effort against Russia.

“These jets are in our sky and today you see them,” said Zelenskyy, standing in front of two of the fighter jets as two others flew overhead in close formation. “It’s good that they are here and that we can put them to use.”

Ukraine is also trying to get neighboring countries to help defend it against Russian missiles, Zelenskyy said.

“This decision is probably a difficult one for our partners, as they are always afraid of unnecessary escalation,” said Ukraine’s president. “We will work on this ... I think we have a good option of a NATO-Ukraine council ... so that NATO countries could talk to Ukraine about the possibility of a small coalition of neighboring countries that would shoot down enemy missiles.”

Two F-16 jets, sporting Ukraine’s trident insignia on their tails and draped in camouflage netting, were a dramatic background for Zelenskyy’s address to Air Forces Day, an event held under tight security at an undisclosed location to protect the fighter jets from Russian attacks.

“Since the beginning of this war, we have been talking with our partners about the need to protect our Ukrainian skies from Russian missiles and Russian aircraft,” Zelenskyy said. “Now we have a new reality in our skies. The F-16s are in Ukraine. We made it happen. I am proud of our guys who are mastering these aircraft and have already started using them for our country. ... Our combat aviation will bring us closer to victory.”

Ukraine may keep some of the F-16 fighter jets at foreign bases to protect them from Russian strikes, according to a senior Ukrainian military official. Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that Moscow could consider launching strikes at facilities in NATO countries if they host the warplanes used in Ukraine.

The American-made F-16 is an iconic fighter jet that’s been the front-line combat plane of choice for the NATO alliance and numerous air forces around the world for 50 years.

Although new to Ukraine, the F-16s are actually older jets that have been donated by Western allies of Ukraine. Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway have committed to providing Ukraine with more than 60 of them over coming months in what could be a slow trickle of deliveries. Zelenskyy did not say how many F-16s have arrived in Ukraine or which countries they came from.

United States President Joe Biden gave the go-ahead in August 2023 for used F-16s to be deployed to Ukraine, though the U.S. won’t be providing any of its own planes.

The F-16s will boost Ukraine’s military strength, especially by upgrading its air defenses. But analysts say they won’t turn the tide of the war on their own.

Russia is making small but steady battlefield gains in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region and its steady forward movement is adding up as Ukraine gradually yields ground.

Ukraine destroyed a Russian Su-34 fighter-bomber aircraft and an ammunition depot at an airfield some 165 miles from the frontline of the war, Kyiv’s military intelligence unit has claimed.

The attack on the Morozovsk airfield in Russia’s Rostov region on Saturday is also likely to have damaged two other Su-34 warplanes, Ukraine’s military said, citing satellite imagery.

It came as Volodymyr Zelensky unveiled the first Western-supplied F-16 warplanes to arrive in Ukraine, and asked for Nato allies to help protect them.

“These jets are in our sky and today you see them,” the Ukrainian president said from an undisclosed airbase, standing in front of two of the jets as others flew overhead.

Mr Putin has warned that Moscow could consider launching strikes at facilities in Nato countries if they host the warplanes used in Ukraine.

The arrival of the planes will bolster Ukrainian morale on the frontline, battered by incessant Russian strikes. Ukrainian commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said the arrival of the F-16s “means that more occupiers will be neutralised.”"

“These jets are in our sky and today you see them,” said Zelenskyy, standing in front of two of the fighter jets as two others flew overhead in close formation. “It’s good that they are here and that we can put them to use.”

Ukraine is also trying to get neighbouring countries to help defend it against Russian missiles, Zelenskyy said.

“This decision is probably a difficult one for our partners, as they are always afraid of unnecessary escalation,” said Ukraine's president. “We will work on this.""

""I think we have a good option of a NATO-Ukraine council ... so that NATO countries could talk to Ukraine about the possibility of a small coalition of neighbouring countries that would shoot down enemy missiles.”

The F-16 jets sported Ukraine’s trident insignia on their tails and were draped in camouflage netting, providing a background for Zelenskyy’s address on Armed Forces Day.

“Since the beginning of this war, we have been talking with our partners about the need to protect our Ukrainian skies from Russian missiles and Russian aircraft,” Zelenskyy said. “Now we have a new reality in our skies. The F-16s are in Ukraine. We made it happen"".

Ukraine may keep some of the F-16 fighter jets at foreign bases to protect them from Russian strikes, according to a senior Ukrainian military official.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has reacted by saying that Moscow would consider launching strikes on facilities in NATO countries if they hosted Ukraine's warplanes.

Although new to Ukraine, the F-16s are older jets that have been donated by Western allies of Ukraine.

Belgium, Denmark and Norway have committed to giving Ukraine over 60 jets in the upcoming months. Zelenskyy did not say how many F-16s have arrived in Ukraine or which countries they came from.

Last August, US President Joe Biden said that used F-16s could be deployed to Ukraine, although Washington wouldn't provide any of its own planes.

Analysts say that the F-16s will boost Ukraine's military strength, but they will likely not be enough to turn the tide of the war as Russia continues to make small but steady gains on the battlefield."

The American-made F-16 is an iconic fighter jet that has been the front-line combat plane of choice for the NATO alliance and numerous air forces around the world for 50 years.

The fighter jets are equipped with a 20mm cannon and can carry bombs, rockets, and missiles.

Zelenskyy admits Ukraine does not have enough pilots trained to use the F-16s or enough of the jets themselves: ""The positive thing is that we are expecting additional F-16s... many guys are now training,"" he said.

F-16s are operated by several countries, including Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Denmark - some of whom have pledged their aircraft to Ukraine.

Russia has been targeting bases that may house them and vowed to shoot them down.

How many jets does Ukraine have? As the first F-16 fighter jets arrive from neighbours

The first F-16 fighter jets have arrived in Ukraine to boost the country’s battle against Vladimir Putin’s invasion.

Lithuania’s foreign minister and the US confirmed the planes had been delivered to the Kyiv government after the “robust package” to help was unveiled at the recent Nato summit in Washington.

The first six F-16s to be supplied to Ukraine were reported to have come from the Netherlands.

Ukrainian pilots have trained in Britain and other countries on how to fly modern aircraft.

F-16s, built by American aerospace manufacturer Lockheed Martin, have been on Ukraine’s wish list for a long time because of their destructive power and global availability.

The fighter jet is equipped with a 20mm cannon and can carry bombs, rockets and missiles.

F-16s in Ukraine. Another impossible thing turned out to be totally possible. — Gabrielius Landsbergis🇱🇹 (@GLandsbergis) July 31, 2024

“F-16s in Ukraine. Another impossible thing turned out to be totally possible,” tweeted Lithuanian foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis.

A US official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the delivery had been completed.

Ukraine’s Air Force did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Kremlin said on Thursday that Russian forces were prepared to shoot down Ukraine's first batch of F-16 jets and the weapons will not be a ""panacea"" for Kyiv's army.

Denmark has committed to donate 19 jets in total, while the Netherlands has promised to deliver 24 aircraft.

No date for the others has yet been made public.

Britain’s prime minister Sir Keir Starmer also gave his backing to the country in recent weeks, giving the go-ahead for British missiles to be used in strikes against targets inside Russia.

The use of Storm Shadow missiles, which has been welcomed by Ukraine, represents a shift in policy from the stance taken by the former Conservative government.

John Healey, the new defence secretary for the UK, said he would not go into specifics about how operations would work but told Sky News that Britain ""will do all we can to help Ukraine in their fight to repel Putin's invasion"".

Here is a look at how many jets Ukraine has pledged and what we know about the state of the armament flow to help it combat Russian forces.

How many jets does Ukraine have?

According to Forbes, Ukrainians had around 105 MiG-29s, Su-24s and Su-25s before the Russians attacked – and, a year later, still have around 105 of these types.

It is estimated Ukraine still has up to 50 Su-27s. Forbes claims these might be Ukraine’s most useful jets as they are fast, manoeuvrable, and flexible.

How many jets are being sent now?

Poland had promised Ukraine four MiG-29 fighter jets, which had been inherited from the former German Democratic Republic. It issued an update on May 17 that it has delivered almost all its jets to Ukraine.

Even before Russia invaded Ukraine, Poland was one of the loudest opponents of the Russian leadership in Europe.

The German government approved Poland’s request in mid-April last year.

Defence minister Boris Pistorius, said: “I welcome the fact that we, in the federal government, have reached this decision together.”

Denmark has committed to donate 19 jets in total, while the Netherlands has promised to deliver 24 aircraft.

Both countries have been driving forces behind an international coalition to supply Ukraine with F-16s. Norway has also said that it would donate six F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine.

Who else is arming Ukraine?

By a wide margin, the US provides the most military aid, followed by the UK and the EU.

On January 23 last year, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky declared that his country's forces urgently required western battle tanks to protect its borders and drive Russian troops out of occupied territory.

The same month, the US, the UK and Germany said they were sending tanks, and Germany allowed other Western countries to send German-made tanks from their fleets.

The US is sending 31 Abrams tanks, the UK is sending 14, Germany is sending 14 and the US is sending 14 Challenger 2 tanks. It is not clear if all of these have reached the battlefield.

Many European nations use the Leopard 2, which is said to be more fuel-efficient and easier to maintain than the majority of Western tanks.

Six Leopard 2 tanks were sent out to Ukraine by Spain on April 21.

Now they are receiving more support from the UK in the form of the missiles agreement, with a more “robust package” set to be unveiled over the coming week."

Ukraine destroyed a Russian Su-34 fighter-bomber aircraft and an ammunition depot at an airfield some 165 miles from the frontline of the war, Kyiv’s military intelligence unit has claimed.

The attack on the Morozovsk airfield in Russia’s Rostov region on Saturday is also likely to have damaged two other Su-34 warplanes, Ukraine’s military said, citing satellite imagery.

It came as Volodymyr Zelensky unveiled the first Western-supplied F-16 warplanes to arrive in Ukraine, and asked for Nato allies to help protect them.

“These jets are in our sky and today you see them,” the Ukrainian president said from an undisclosed airbase, standing in front of two of the jets as others flew overhead.

Mr Putin has warned that Moscow could consider launching strikes at facilities in Nato countries if they host the warplanes used in Ukraine.

The arrival of the planes will bolster Ukrainian morale on the frontline, battered by incessant Russian strikes. Ukrainian commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said the arrival of the F-16s “means that more occupiers will be neutralised.”"

WASHINGTON (AP) — Several U.S. personnel were injured in a suspected rocket attack at a military base in Iraq, U.S. defense officials said Monday, in what has been a recent uptick in strikes on American forces by Iranian-backed militias.

The attack comes as tensions across the Middle East are spiking following the killings last week of a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon and Hamas’ top political leader in Iran, in suspected Israeli strikes. Both groups are backed by Iran.

The U.S. defense officials said troops at al-Asad air base were still assessing the injuries and damage, and it appeared that as many as seven military troops and civilians were injured. Earlier Monday, Iraqi security officials confirmed the attack, but no group has claimed responsibility.

The American officials said the U.S. looked into reports of a possible second attack at the base but determined there had not been another one.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations. The White House said the president and vice president were briefed on the attack.

In recent weeks, Iranian-backed Iraqi militias have resumed launching attacks on bases housing U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria after a lull of several months, following a strike on a base in Jordan in late January that killed three American soldiers and prompted a series of retaliatory U.S. strikes.

Between October and January, an umbrella group calling itself the Islamic Resistance in Iraq had regularly claimed attacks that it said were in retaliation for Washington’s support of Israel in its war against Hamas in Gaza and were aimed at pushing U.S. troops out of the region.

Ukraine’s Zelenskyy displays newly arrived F-16 fighter jets.,https://www.latestly.com/agency-news/world-news-ukraines-zelenskyy-displays-newly-arrived-f-16-fighter-jets-to-combat-russia-in-the-air-6163409.html,"Somewhere in Ukraine, August 4: Ukraine's newly arrived F-16 fighter jets were put on display Sunday by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who said the planes will boost the country's war effort against Russia. “These jets are in our sky and today you see them,” said Zelenskyy, standing in front of two of the fighter jets as two others flew overhead in close formation. “It's good that they are here and that we can put them to use.”

Ukraine is also trying to get neighbouring countries to help defend it against Russian missiles, Zelenskyy said. “This decision is probably a difficult one for our partners, as they are always afraid of unnecessary escalation,” said Ukraine's president. “We will work on this ... I think we have a good option of a NATO-Ukraine council ... so that NATO countries could talk to Ukraine about the possibility of a small coalition of neighboring countries that would shoot down enemy missiles.” Indian Man Dies in Russia-Ukraine War: Haryana’s Ravi Moun Dead After Being Sent by Russian Army To Fight Against Ukrainians Forces.

Two F-16 jets, sporting Ukraine's trident insignia on their tails and draped in camouflage netting, were a dramatic background for Zelenskyy's address to Armed Forces Day, an event held under tight security at an undisclosed location to protect the fighter jets from Russian attacks. “Since the beginning of this war, we have been talking with our partners about the need to protect our Ukrainian skies from Russian missiles and Russian aircraft,” Zelenskyy said. “Now we have a new reality in our skies. The F-16s are in Ukraine. We made it happen. I am proud of our guys who are mastering these aircraft and have already started using them for our country. ... Our combat aviation will bring us closer to victory.”

Ukraine may keep some of the F-16 fighter jets at foreign bases to protect them from Russian strikes, according to a senior Ukrainian military official. Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that Moscow could consider launching strikes at facilities in NATO countries if they host the warplanes used in Ukraine. The American-made F-16 is an iconic fighter jet that's been the front-line combat plane of choice for the NATO alliance and numerous air forces around the world for 50 years.

Although new to Ukraine, the F-16s are actually older jets that have been donated by Western allies of Ukraine. Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway have committed to providing Ukraine with more than 60 of them over coming months in what could be a slow trickle of deliveries. Zelenskyy did not say how many F-16s have arrived in Ukraine or which countries they came from. United States President Joe Biden gave the go-ahead in August 2023 for used F-16s to be deployed to Ukraine, though the US won't be providing any of its own planes.

U.S. troops withdraw from strategic West African base as militant threat grows.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/08/05/niger-agadez-sahel-military-bases/,"AGADEZ, Niger — The last U.S. troops flew out of their sprawling base in Niger’s northern desert on Monday, marking a closing chapter in the American military relationship with this West African country and a substantial strategic setback for Washington. The withdrawal of the U.S. forces, which had numbered 1,100 in Niger at their peak, follows more than a decade of investment in Niger — and months of fruitless efforts to put the country back on a democratic path after its military seized power in a coup a year ago.

The U.S. military presence here has been a linchpin of American efforts to address rising Islamist militancy in this part of Africa. The pullout comes at a moment when extremist violence in West Africa is reaching record highs and Russia’s influence in the region is growing.

“The security of the region is a grave concern,” Air Force Major Gen. Kenneth Ekman, who is leading the U.S. drawdown from Niger, said in an interview. “The threat has become worse — it has spread and become more acute. … And from a U.S. perspective, our access has been reduced even though our objectives have not changed.”

At a ceremony Monday in an airport hangar marking the withdrawal from the Agadez base, Nigerien and American officials read a joint statement, in French and English, and signed documents making the turnover of the base official.

Already shipped away were the drones used by U.S. Special Forces to gather intelligence about the increasingly powerful al-Qaeda and Islamic State affiliates operating in the Sahel region, which runs the breadth of Africa below the Sahara Desert, U.S. officials said. The 18 generators that powered the facility were evacuated on C-17 cargo planes, and other sensitive equipment and material have also been removed from the base, which was completed in 2019 and cost more than $100 million to build.

Remaining on the nine-square-mile base are the kitchen, gym and sleeping quarters. U.S. military officers spent Sunday finishing the final tasks, including putting keys in all the door locks and lining up dozens of vehicles with keys in their ignitions, Ekman said. Niger’s plans for the base remain uncertain, as do U.S. plans for how to replace it.

“This is not about Niger alone,” said Ibrahim Yahaya Ibrahim, deputy director of the International Crisis Group’s Sahel project. “When Niger’s coup happened, it symbolized the fall of the last democratic darling of the West. Now, the withdrawal undermines U.S. strategy not only for Niger but for the Sahel and the entire region.”

Seen from the air, the cluster of white buildings that make up Air Base 201 emerges from the brown sand just outside Agadez, a small city on the southern edge of the Sahara Desert. The base took on increasing importance for the U.S. counterterrorism strategy, which began in the early 2000s under President George W. Bush and ramped up further about a decade ago, after extremists and separatists took over much of neighboring Mali.

That base “gave us a window into everything that was going on in the region,” said Cameron Hudson, a senior associate at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Now literally and figuratively, what we are doing is that we are moving to the margins.”

After the coup in Niger, U.S. officials pressed the military junta to begin restoring democracy and warned that American assistance hung in the balance. In a late-night news conference in March, the spokesman for Niger’s military government, the National Council for Safeguarding the Homeland, declared that the presence of American troops was “illegal.” The next month, Niger welcomed Russian military instructors to the same airfield in the capital where American troops were at the time based.

In an interview in May, Nigerien Prime Minister Ali Mahaman Lamine Zeine blamed the breakdown on the United States, accusing American officials, in part, of failing to justify the U.S. troop presence and essentially giving the Nigerien government an ultimatum.

U.S. officials said that the government was presented with “a choice, not an ultimatum, about whether they wished to continue their partnership with us.”

A rising militant insurgency

As relations with Niger deteriorated, U.S. defense officials have turned to nations in coastal West Africa, promising to bulk up security ties with other countries they fear are at risk, including Ivory Coast, Benin and Ghana. There are now small U.S. military teams in several coastal countries in West Africa.

Al-Qaeda-affiliated Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) and the Islamic State-Sahel Province have in recent years made Niger and its neighbors a global hot spot. Following a series of coups in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, extremist violence has largely escalated.

Last year, about 11,600 fatalities were linked to Islamist extremists, more than a threefold increase since 2020, according to the Washington-based Africa Center for Strategic Studies. In Niger, the Africa Center projects 1,230 deaths related to Islamist violence this year, more than double the total in 2020.

Héni Nsaibia, a senior researcher with Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED), described the situation as “rapidly deteriorating,” with JNIM and IS-Sahel gaining support because of the harsh response by militaries in the region.

Neither group currently appears to pose a “direct threat” to the United States because of their capacity and local focus within Africa, said Andrew Lebovich, a research fellow with the Clingendael Institute. But should local government succumb, it could destabilize the entire region.

Ekman said the U.S. government faces a growing challenge monitoring extremist activities because Mali, Burkina Faso and now Niger have expelled most Western forces, including the French military, as well as U.N. personnel.

“We don’t know what we don’t know,” he said. “We want indications and warnings, and we are losing them over time.”

Leaving the door open

Ekman said he had been surprised by how many U.S. personnel raised their hands to help close down the Agadez base, committed to winding down the mission successfully. They have spent the last weeks training Nigerien military how to run the base, including the water treatment and wastewater facilities. Some facilities will be left with air conditioners and spot generators.

U.S. officials said the goal was to leave the bases in Agadez and Niamey, the capital, in good condition in hopes of preserving relations with Niger and leaving open the possibility of restoring cooperation. The U.S. officials said that contrasted with the approach by the French military, which took or destroyed everything when Niger asked it to leave last year. French officials did not respond to requests for comment.

In Niamey, Russian military personnel who arrived in April are occupying the same airfield that the United States, France and other Western allies built. Nigerien officials have said that the Russians are providing equipment, including an air defense system, and instructors for training.

In Agadez, where protests mushroomed over the past few months calling on the Americans to leave, there were mixed feelings about their departure.

Aboubacar Alio, a 43-year-old taxi driver, said he supported the military government for having “liberated our country from foreign dominance.” He had watched American drones leaving the base and wondered what purpose they served, if not to stop the growing number of attacks.

Issoufou Mohamed, a 31-year-old who worked as a trash collector at the American base, making about $630 a month, said he knew Niger’s military cooperation with the French would end after the coup but “never imagined that it would be the same thing with the American army.”

Most of the U.S. service members who had been deployed in Niger have been sent back to their home bases around the world, Ekman said, but small Special Forces teams are being dispatched to other countries in coastal West Africa.

The U.S. military is committed to the region, Ekman said, “and is not retrenching — but will be listening carefully to what kind of partnerships West African nations want to have with the U.S. military.”

The threat is already being felt in the coastal West African countries, said Daniel Eizenga, a research fellow focused on the Sahel at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies.

He said that over the past two years, violence within coastal countries and just over their borders has increased by 250 percent. Among coastal countries, Benin and Togo have experienced the most attacks."
U.S. troops withdraw from strategic West African base as militant threat grows.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/08/05/niger-agadez-us-military-timeline/,"The U.S. military on Monday withdrew from its base near Agadez, Niger, marking the end of a security relationship with this West African nation that has lasted more than two decades. At its peak, the mission included 1,100 service members split mostly between bases in Niamey, the capital, and outside Agadez. The withdrawal follows months of fruitless negotiations with Niger’s military government, which seized power in a coup a year ago. It marks a strategic defeat for the United States at a moment when the Islamist extremist threat in the region is growing and Russia’s influence is rising.

Here are some of the key moments in the U.S. involvement in the region:

2002

In the wake of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the Bush administration launched its “war on terror,” trying to stop terrorism at its roots. The Pan Sahel Initiative, launched in 2002, included training and equipping forces in Niger, Mali, Chad and Mauritania. The focus in the Sahel region, which stretches across the continent below the Sahara desert, was more related to what the United States identified as potential drivers of extremism — including poor governance, vast spaces and poverty — than existing threats. At the time, tourism was a substantive driver of the region’s economy, with visitors flocking to Timbuktu in Mali and passing through Agadez in Niger on their way to tours of the Sahara.

2011

The United States was part of the NATO-led offensive that killed Libyan dictator Moammar Gaddafi, ultimately contributing to the collapse of the Libyan state and a flood of arms into the region. Experts say the chaos in the wake of Gaddafi’s death helped lay the groundwork for an uprising by Tuareg nationalists, whose rebellions Gaddafi had in the past helped mediate.

2012

Mali, which for the previous two decades had been a model of democracy in the region and a top recipient of Western support, collapsed. Soldiers seized power in a coup in the capital, and Tuareg separatists and a variety of Islamist extremists, including groups linked to al-Qaeda, took control of vast swaths of the country’s north. The seizure of numerous cities — including historic Timbuktu — by militants who enforced an extreme version of Islamic law prompted an international outcry and intervention by the French military.

2013

Then-President Barack Obama sent a letter to Congress announcing that the Pentagon would deploy 40 troops to Niger, bringing the total number of American military personnel in Niger to about 100. Defense officials said the troops were deployed to open a drone base in Niamey that would focus on intelligence gathering, including to help the French forces operating in Mali, where it had decided not to deploy American soldiers.

2017

Four U.S. Special Forces troops, along with five Nigerien soldiers, were killed in an ambush by militants associated with an Islamic State affiliate. The ambush, which became known by the name of the village where it happened — Tongo Tongo — prompted inquiries by Congress and the Defense Department, and it triggered a backlash in Washington, where many lawmakers said they did not have a clear sense of the size or scope of the mission in Niger. It also sparked a political controversy, when the widow of one of the soldiers killed said then-President Donald Trump appeared to forget her husband’s name and said that the soldier knew “what he was signing up for.”

Directives for U.S. troops changed after Tongo Tongo, Alan Van Saun, a company commander in a Special Forces battalion from summer 2017 to February 2018, previously told The Washington Post. U.S. soldiers had been patrolling with Nigerien soldiers on “kill and capture” missions, providing intelligence about armed groups as well as medical and logistical support to Nigerien troops. After the ambush, he said, they were largely constrained to providing support from the bases.

2019

The nine-square-mile Air Base 201, which cost more than $100 million to build, opened just outside Agadez, a city on the southern edge of the Sahara known as a hub for migration. U.S. officials said the base became vital for understanding the movements of extremists in North and Western Africa. Gen. Michael E. Langley, who heads U.S. military operations in Africa, warned in a previous interview that losing the base would be “impactful” for counterterrorism operations. “If we can’t see, we can’t sense,” he said.

In Niger, the military was combating militants associated with Boko Haram and its offshoots around Lake Chad, and Jama’a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM) and Islamic State-Sahel in the region bordering Mali and Burkina Faso.

July 2023

Nigerien military officers seized power in a coup d’état, ousting the democratically elected president, Mohamed Bazoum. Within weeks, they asked the 1,500 or so French troops that had been stationed in the country to leave. The United States paused security assistance, as required by U.S. law after a coup, and officials began negotiating to get Niger back on a democratic path.

March 2024

In a late-night news conference, a spokesman for Niger’s government — the National Council for Safeguarding the Homeland — declared the American military presence “illegal.” Nigerien officials said that followed a meeting in which they said a top U.S. official was “condescending” and tried to dictate which countries Niger could partner with. The United States has disputed that characterization and said Niger was offered “a choice, not an ultimatum.”

Far fewer protesters were seen compared to earlier demonstrations that drew thousands, mostly young people. Hundreds showed up in the economic hub of Lagos and a few northern states.

At least 13 people have been reported dead in the protests which began on Thursday against the West African nation’s worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation and against the corruption and alleged bad governance that have stifled its development.

Nigerian security forces have been accused of using excessive force in the protests.

On Monday, President Bola Tinubu met with security chiefs in the capital, Abuja. A curfew was declared in northern Kaduna state — the sixth state to take such a measure since the protests began — after reports of looting.

The cost-of-living crisis is fueled by surging inflation, at a 28-year high, and government economic policies that have pushed the local currency to record lows against the dollar.

Tinubu on Sunday said his government was committed to addressing citizens’ concerns. But he provided no plan, according to the Lagos-based SBM Intelligence research firm.

A few protesters were seen waving Russian flags over the weekend and again on Monday in northern Nigeria, whose population is among the worst affected. The Russian embassy in Nigeria denied any responsibility, saying in a statement that the flags are personal choices of the protesters and “do not reflect any official position or policy of the Russian Government.”

The Russian flags being waved constitute treason and would be treated as such, Nigeria’s military chief Christopher Musa said after meeting with Tinubu.

Pro-Russian sentiments have been growing in parts of West Africa, where Moscow is increasingly welcomed by militaries that have staged coups and severed ties with the West. One is in Nigeria’s northern neighbor, Niger, where French and American troops have been asked to leave and Russia has been chosen as a new security partner.

On Sunday, Tinubu warned protesters not to let “the enemies of democracy use you to promote an unconstitutional agenda” in Nigeria, which currently holds the rotational chairmanship position of West Africa’s regional bloc.

Nigeria’s secret service said it had apprehended some tailors in northern Kano state it said were responsible for making Russian flags being distributed in the area. It said an investigation was ongoing.

U.S. troops withdraw from strategic West African base as militant threat grows.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/08/04/israeli-raids-west-bank-cities-help-fuel-militant-violence/,"Sorry, a summary is not available for this article at this time. Please try again later.

In the city of Jenin, the impact of the raids — and their role in fueling Palestinian militancy — is especially stark.

JENIN, West Bank — Israeli raids targeting Palestinian militants in the West Bank are taking an enormous toll on daily life in the territory, leaving hundreds dead and neighborhoods destroyed, tactics residents and local fighters say are feeding resentment and causing more unrest. Since the Oct. 7 attacks, Israeli forces have killed 554 Palestinians in the West Bank, according to the United Nations, whose tally does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but is higher than any annual total since the United Nations began counting in 2005. Thousands more have been arrested or wounded, in sweeping operations backed by drones, warplanes and helicopter gunships.

Israel, which occupies the West Bank, says the firepower is necessary to prevent attacks on Israeli citizens. “In order to thwart terror activity in the region, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] deploys all the capabilities at its disposal,” including airstrikes, the army spokesperson’s unit said.

But the forays into Palestinian cities and refugee camps have done little to subdue the militants. Instead, the violence is helping grow their ranks, furnishing new recruits angered by the conflict and driving rival groups together to plan joint attacks.

In the northern West Bank city of Jenin, a longtime hub for Palestinian factions and a central focus of Israel’s recent operations, the impact of the raids, and their role in fueling militancy, is especially stark. Here, in the rubble-strewn alleys of the Jenin refugee camp, residents say they have been hardened by the incursions and have watched for months as local youth increasingly take up arms.

“They are destroying all the infrastructure, the electricity, the shops,” Ashraf Jaradat, 42, said just hours after Israeli forces withdrew following a raid on July 5. An airstrike targeting five militants that day shattered Jaradat’s windows and cracked the water tank on his roof. “We get sick and tired of this,” he said. “The children are traumatized.”

The IDF spokesperson’s unit, in response to a list of questions about the West Bank raids, said its counterterrorism operations “are carried out on the basis of concrete intelligence information” and in specific areas “where either terror activity or the preparation of such activity is taking place in a way that risks the lives of our forces or Israeli citizens.”

But some of the operations have lasted days, knocking out power and water and confining residents to their homes as battles rage outside. Nearly every house here is pockmarked by bullets and the streets torn up by Israeli bulldozers searching for explosives. A new crop of Palestinian fighters, organizing loosely under an umbrella group, the Jenin Battalion, now patrols entrances to the camp.

The battalion, which was founded three years ago during another bout of violence, is led by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a hard-line faction opposed to Israel. But it also includes fighters from other armed groups and cooperates regularly with Hamas, making it “the cornerstone” of the armed struggle in the West Bank, said 22-year-old Samer Abu Murad, one of the battalion’s more prominent fighters.

After the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in Tehran on Wednesday, the battalion marched in the streets of Jenin that night, congratulating Hamas’s armed wing on the “martyrdom of the great leader … Ismail Haniyeh.”

“We say to the enemy that we in the Jenin Battalion will continue on the same path of the martyrs,” one commander said, according to a video of the demonstration.

The group has already “lost a lot of members” since October, Abu Murad said, estimating that between 70 and 80 operatives have been killed by Israeli forces. “But at the same time, the more we lose, the more it reinforces our determination,” he said, claiming the battalion has since recruited double the number of fighters lost.

During the raid in Jenin on July 5, Israeli forces killed six militants, including three from the battalion, and shot dead a civilian bystander, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Another militant injured in an airstrike died two days later. Also among the casualties were two Hamas operatives, brothers Hareth Hashash, 19, and Hamam Hashash, 23.

Hamam Hashash was one of two militants responsible for a roadside bomb attack that killed an Israeli sniper team commander in June, according to an IDF statement and a video released by Hamas. The other suspect, 22-year-old Nidal al-Amer, fought for Palestinian Islamic Jihad before Israeli forces assassinated him in Jenin on July 3.

The joint attack on the convoy, which also injured 16 soldiers, was an example of how armed groups are cooperating and adapting in the West Bank, Abu Murad said. Fighters are operating in smaller, more nimble cells, improving their tracking, observation and bombmaking techniques, he said. They are also thriving in close-quarter gunfights, and slinging tarps across the camp’s narrow alleys to shield themselves from drones.

The military “operates within a complicated security reality” in the West Bank, the IDF spokesperson’s unit said, adding that security forces have “increased the number of operating checkpoints and monitoring efforts.”

Outside the blackened ruins of their family home, on a hill looking over the city, 28-year-old Nusayba Hashash said she hadn’t known her two brothers were involved with Hamas. Hamam worked as a courier, delivering food on his motorbike. But they were among Jenin’s “shadow soldiers,” Abu Murad said. “They fight … and the day after, they go to work normally and nobody knows what they do.”

While the militants are still relatively undisciplined, their growing capabilities, including the use of roadside bombs, have “prompted top [IDF] commanders to rethink the methods of operation in the refugee camps,” Israel’s largest daily newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, reported on July 2.

“The IDF is seeing a very fast learning curve among the Palestinians,” Israeli journalist and security analyst, Amir Bar Shalom, wrote for the Times of Israel last month. The militants are burying explosive devices deeper in the roads to evade Israel’s backhoes and bulldozers, he said, causing the army to consider reinforcing its vehicles and to work on strengthening intelligence gathering in areas where the bombs are made.

For years, Palestinian militants laid low in the West Bank, battered by Israel’s crushing response to the second intifada, a mass uprising that began in 2000 and included suicide bombings and other violent attacks in Israeli cities. Military operations were more limited in scope, even as Israel gobbled up more territory by expanding Jewish settlements across the West Bank.

It wasn’t until 2021, as tensions rose in East Jerusalem over the eviction of some Palestinian families, that the dynamic began to shift. Over the next two years, violence spiked, the military cracked down, and the number of active armed groups in the West Bank soared.

The Israelis “were very heavy-handed going in and that’s where the protective instinct started,” Tahani Mustafa, senior Palestine analyst at the International Crisis Group, said of how the Jenin Battalion and other cells were established.

In 2022, the IDF launched Operation Break the Wave, carrying out more than 2,000 raids in just six months, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, a nonprofit research group that collects and maps political violence.

By October 2023, ahead of the Hamas attacks, “there really wasn’t much left” of the battalion in Jenin, Mustafa said. “But as soon as there’s an immediate catalyst, these groups will re-form.”

“That’s something the Israelis willfully refuse to really learn,” she said. “That this isn’t something you can clamp down on with coercion.”

In Jenin, a city of roughly 68,000 people, the raids have failed to turn residents against the militants, pushing them instead to come together to support the battalion. Some women feed and hide the fighters. One man in Jenin, who identified himself only as Osama because of security reasons, said he runs a Telegram channel to alert residents to approaching military vehicles.

“There is no safe place in the camp,” Mujahed Abadi, 24, said from his hospital bed last month, two weeks after Israeli forces shot him during a raid in Jenin. The IDF had tied an injured Abadi, a vegetable seller with no ties to the militants, to the hood of a military jeep in searing hot weather, causing him to sustain severe burns in addition to the gunshot wounds to his arm and leg.

“The anger now is inside me,” Abadi said. “I believe the resistance is right in defending the camp.”

The military said in a statement that Abadi’s treatment “does not align with IDF values.” But, Mustafa said, “these raids are having a counterproductive effect,” elevating militant groups “that started out more like community defense mechanisms.”

When asked whether the IDF had degraded the militants’ capabilities, the spokesperson’s unit responded by saying the military had “eliminated hundreds of terrorists” in the West Bank over the past nine months. More than 1,800 “operatives” affiliated with Hamas were also apprehended, the IDF said.

But even as fighters are arrested or killed, the violence in Jenin has drawn a steady stream of recruits from surrounding villages. One of the militants who died in the July 5 raid — 30-year-old Yaseen al-Areedi — was a Hamas commander from Jalqamus, a village roughly 12 miles southeast of Jenin. His father, a soft-spoken cucumber and tomato farmer, said that his son had been hiding in the Jenin refugee camp for nearly a year.

Areedi “wanted the same as anyone — to live simply,” his elder brother Samer, 46, said at a memorial in the village. But he “saw the damage, the killing” and decided to take up arms.

For Amer, one of the alleged perpetrators of the roadside bomb attack, the fight “was in his blood,” his aunt, 50-year-old Dalal al-Amer, said.

Amer’s father, Ziad, who helped lead the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade during the second intifada, was killed during a 2002 battle in Jenin when his son was just an infant.

“We were telling him: ‘You have a history of fighters in the family — your uncles, your father. You have the opportunity’” to live a normal life, said Dalal. “It was useless.”

Amer was buried in Jenin, in a parking lot residents converted to a cemetery last year after the old one ran out space. Dalal’s 16-year-old son — Amer’s cousin — served as a pallbearer. Before, he was “a little boy,” scared of the violence around him, she said. But after that day, “he defeated the fear inside him. I saw it in his eyes.”"
U.S. troops withdraw from strategic West African base as militant threat grows.,https://njtoday.news/2024/08/05/niger-evicted-american-forces-from-key-african-base/,"America First isolationists are threatening the global leadership once embraced by the United States but retreating Republicans are leaving military troops exposed to growing danger.

Niger has evicted U.S. counterterrorism troops and aerial drones from the west African country, driving a nail in the coffin of the faltering American strategy to defeat a violent Islamist insurgency overrunning the continent.

The decision to expel American forces will likely force the U.S. to pivot from trying to defeat al Qaeda and Islamic State where they are strongest to a new strategy aimed at keeping militants from infiltrating neighboring countries along the West African coast.

Niger ordered the U.S. to withdraw its troops and drone forces from the country in May after a military junta overthrew the West African nation’s democratically elected government last year.

The decision to expel American forces will represented Nigerien officials were not interested in preserving a relationship with what had been Washington’s chief security partner in a region beset by violence from groups linked to the Islamic State and al-Qaeda.

The United States military intervention in Niger was a deployment of special operations forces and unmanned aerial vehicles in support of the local government and French military in counter-terrorism operations against militant groups in the greater West Africa region as part of Operation Juniper Shield.

The military operation conducted by the United States and partner nations in the Saharan and Sahel regions of Africa, consisted of counterterrorism efforts, policing of arms, and counteracting drug traffickers across central Africa as part of the ridiculously named Global War on Terrorism.

Niger is a landlocked country in West Africa bordered by Libya to the northeast, Chad to the east, Nigeria to the south, Benin and Burkina Faso to the southwest, Mali to the west, and Algeria to the northwest.

Once colonized by France, since obtaining independence in 1960, Niger has experienced five coups d’état and four periods of military rule.

According to the UN’s Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) report of 2023, Niger is one of the poorest countries in the world.

The country’s 26 million people — among the world’s youngest and poorest — have struggled since the junta severed ties with key international partners, who have imposed sanctions, suspended security arrangements and cut off development funding close to half of Niger’s budget.

The last French military aircraft and troops departed Niger by December 22, 2023, a deadline set by the junta which severed ties with Paris after the July 25, 2023 coup, ending years of on-the-ground military support.

Countries in West and Central Africa have suffered eight coups since 2020.

In August 2020, a group of Mali’s colonels led a coup against President Ibrahim Boubacar Kaita. In 2021, the military led a second coup against the interim president Colonel Bah Ndaw. Guinea experienced a coup in 2021, Burkina Faso in 2022, and most recently,

Niger met the same fate when General Abdourahmane Tchiani seized power in July. Outside of West Africa, Chad and Sudan also experienced military coups in 2021.

Africa will represent 26% of the world’s population by 2050 and 38% by 2100.

America’s Africa Command see growing danger posed by rising unrest on the continent as the demands of an exploding population are not adequately met by their governments.

There are currently conflicts in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Libya, Mali, Somalia, and Sudan along with acute challenges such as the evacuation of US troops from Niger following a coup whose leaders aligned with Russia.

The degree to which China exceeds American economic engagement in Africa complicates the military’s engagement.

The US military maintaining a rotational presence in Africa is seen as necessary to monitor violent extremist organizations that could pose a security threat to Americans.

Informed sources say that the geopolitical competition requires greater support for partners on the continent with their economic and military capacity-building efforts but the meek approach advocated by America First isolationists is threatening the global leadership once embraced by the United States.

U.S. troops withdraw from strategic West African base as militant threat grows.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/08/05/ukraine-mali-wagner-mercenaries-russia/,"KYIV — Mali has announced that it has cut diplomatic ties with Ukraine, accusing Kyiv of involvement in attacks on Malian soldiers in the West African country in late July. The Ukrainian government said no evidence was provided to support the allegation. But the announcement came late Sunday after Andriy Yusov, spokesman for Ukraine’s military intelligence agency, the GUR, commented on fierce battles in northern Mali between Tuareg rebels and Malian and Russian paramilitary troops on Ukrainian government-backed TV.

Yusov said in a broadcast last week that “the fact that the rebels received the necessary information — and not only information — which allowed them to conduct a successful operation against Russian war criminals, the whole world has already seen this.”

“We will certainly not discuss the details at this time; let’s say, there will be a continuation,” he added.

Dozens of Malian and Russian fighters from the Wagner Group may have been killed in the attacks, the Associated Press reported, citing an analyst who specializes in the region, although the exact death toll was not immediately clear. Wagner-linked Telegram channels reported that the group had sustained losses in northern Mali.

Mali described Yusov’s comments as evidence of “Ukraine’s involvement in a cowardly, traitorous and barbaric attack by armed terrorist groups,” resulting in the deaths of Malian soldiers, and said that it now considers supporting Ukraine to be akin to supporting international terrorism.

Mali’s angry response comes as Kyiv tries to court countries from the global south to assist in the battle against Russia’s invasion, especially as Ukraine pushes for an international peace process to end the war and reclaim its territory now controlled by Russia.

Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry decried Mali’s decision to cut ties, calling it “shortsighted and hasty,” and said it “resolutely rejects” Mali’s accusations that it is supporting international terrorism.

Mali “decided to sever diplomatic relations with Ukraine without conducting a thorough study of the facts and circumstances of the incident in the north of Mali, and without providing any evidence of Ukraine’s involvement in the said event,” the ministry said in a statement Monday. The GUR reposted the statement.

In Mali, military leaders who seized power in a coup in 2020 have rejected help from traditional sources, asking the French military to leave and shuttering the U.N. mission. Mali’s leaders have instead turned toward Russia, announcing that Russian trainers were coming to the country in 2021. Mali’s government has always said that it has a “state to state” relationship with Russia, but it is widely known that the mercenary group Wagner has been fighting alongside Malian troops.

In its three-page communiqué, Mali’s government claimed that Yurii Pyvovarov, the Ukrainian ambassador to Senegal and several other West African countries, had “openly and unequivocally attached the support of his country to international terrorism, especially in Mali.”

Mali is now calling for the statements of Yusov and Pyvovarov to be referred to legal authorities, claiming they “constitute acts of terrorism and apology of terrorism.” It is also requesting that measures be taken by other African nations to ensure stability in Mali, “especially in regards to Ukrainian embassies located in the subregion with terrorists disguised as diplomats.”

The Malian government also called for a formal alert to be issued to regional and international authorities of countries that support Ukraine to “indicate that this country openly and publicly presents its support for terrorism.”

Ukraine said Mali has ignored that military groups under Kremlin control, including Wagner, “use terrorist methods and are directly involved in numerous war crimes, killings of civilians and cruel treatment of prisoners of war both in Ukraine and in African countries.”

The Wagner Group, previously led by Russian mercenary commander Yevgeniy Prigozhin, a onetime ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has provided fighters to war zones from Libya and West Africa to Ukraine and beyond. In eastern Ukraine, Wagner fighters deployed to battle Ukrainian forces and eventually succeeded in seizing the city of Bakhmut last year.

Shortly after, Prigozhin launched a march on Moscow — an attempted insurrection that posed one of the most serious threats to Putin’s power. Prigozhin eventually called off the march when he was offered a safe passage out of the country to Belarus. He was then killed in a plane crash in Russia two months later.

Russian soldiers and paramilitary fighters are present in several countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including the Central African Republic, Burkina Faso and Niger, as well as Mali.

Human rights groups have accused both the Malian government and Wagner of involvement in war crimes against civilians in the country.

Wassim Nasr, a Sahel specialist and senior research fellow at the Soufan Center, said that he does not believe Ukrainian forces were directly involved in the attacks in late July or provided the intelligence that led to them, but he said they have provided support to the rebels including some financial aid.

Tuareg rebels reached out to Ukraine for help in late 2023 and early 2024, Nasr said, and a small number of rebels received training in Ukraine, along with training on how to use miniature drones, which are used prolifically on both sides of the front line in Ukraine.

The Malian army and Wagner forces were moving in a convoy toward the Algerian border when they were stopped by rebels on July 25, Nasr said, and eventually retreated back toward the town of Kidal.

They were traveling through a valley when rebels and fighters with Jama’a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM), which is an al-Qaeda affiliate, simultaneously began firing at them, said Nasr, who is in touch with both JNIM and rebel fighters.

JNIM has claimed that 50 fighters were killed and the rebels have claimed that 84 were killed. The relationship between JNIM and the rebel group has evolved over time, with the two sometimes fighting and other times forming alliances.

Both JNIM and Islamic State-Sahel Province have increasingly targeted Wagner in their propaganda in recent years, using the mercenary group’s atrocities as a tool to boost their own popularity. In a rare video appearance late last year, JNIM leader Iyad ag Ghali accused Russian mercenaries of “violence and cruelty” and positioned JNIM as a defender of civilians.

“We have seen JNIM pivot from demonizing the French to demonizing Wagner,” said Daniel Eizenga, a research fellow focused on the Sahel at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies in Washington. “And the tactics that Wagner uses are so brutal, and so often target civilian populations, that it makes JNIM’s pivot credible.”

J. Peter Pham, a former U.S. special envoy for the Sahel region, said that the severity of the attack in Mali showed that “Russia is in no position to replace the departing Western partners.”

Pham predicted that the security situation will continue to deteriorate in the Sahel, which stretches across the continent south of the Sahara desert, noting that Niger was one country with a “more effective counterterrorism effort before the coup because of the support of the U.S. and its allies.”

On Monday, the United States withdrew from its base in northern Niger after being evicted by the Nigerien junta, marking the end of Washington’s strongest military relationship in the region."

The decision— which Islamabad insists was unilateral and violated United Nations resolutions — has tested the already strained ties between the two countries.

Protesters in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-held Kashmir which is split between Pakistan and India and claimed by both in its entirety, burned an effigy of the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Indian national flags, vowing to fight New Delhi’s decree until its dissolution.

Another protest of about 200 people was led by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar in the capital.

Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif addressed lawmakers in Muzaffarabad, via a video feed, saying he hoped Kashmiri people would soon get the right to self-determination to decide their future and expressed his optimism that “that day will soon come.”.

Earlier, in a statement, he called to resolve the tense territorial dispute over Kashmir through the diplomatic channels of the U.N., saying Pakistan will continue to “extend its strong moral, political and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people.”

In 2019, India’s Hindu nationalist-led government revoked the special status of Muslim-majority Kashmir after cutting off communications and deploying thousands of troops in the restive Himalayan region amid uproar from Pakistani lawmakers.

In December, India’s top court upheld the decision by Modi’s government.

The future of Muslim-majority Kashmir was left unresolved at the end of British colonial rule in 1947 when the Indian subcontinent was divided into predominantly Hindu India and mainly Muslim Pakistan. Pakistan has long pushed for the right to self-determination under a U.N. resolution passed in 1948, which called for a referendum on whether Kashmiris wanted to merge with Pakistan or India."
U.S. troops withdraw from strategic West African base as militant threat grows.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/08/05/cambodia-china-vietnam-canal-environment-mekong/c6744df2-52f0-11ef-9a60-5b6e8b4da7c0_story.html,"PREK TAKEO, Cambodia — Cambodia broke ground Monday on a controversial, China-funded canal to link the capital Phnom Penh to the sea, despite environmental concerns and the risk of straining ties with neighboring Vietnam. The $1.7 billion, 180-kilometer (111 miles) Funan Techo canal is planned to connect the country’s capital with Kep province on Cambodia’s south coast, giving it access to the Gulf of Thailand. Cambodia hopes the 100-meter (328 feet)-wide, 5.4-meter (17.7 feet)-deep canal will lower the cost of shipping goods to the country’s sole deep-sea port, Sihanoukville, and reduce reliance on Vietnamese ports.

The project highlights the outsized role that China plays in Cambodian politics and economy. Meanwhile, concerns remain about the potential environmental impacts of the canal, especially on the flow of the Mekong River, which feeds millions of people across six countries through its fish and the agriculture that it sustains.

The project has Vietnam worried, both about the effect on its Mekong Delta rice-growing and about Cambodia moving out of its orbit, said Nguyen Khac Giang, an analyst at Singapore’s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.

“There is a concern that most of the Cambodian exports might be diverted from the current route, crossing the Vietnamese border to Vietnamese ports and moving away from that to Cambodian ports,” he said.

But Hanoi has expressed its concerns quietly, if at all, Giang said. Given the “complex historical legacy” between Cambodia and Vietnam — despite strong bilateral ties, the two nations have a contentious relationship — Vietnam is reticent to openly criticize Cambodia lest it be seen as impinging on its neighbor’s sovereignty, he said.

Analysts say that the infrastructure project is in part an effort by Cambodia’s ruling elite to invigorate support for Hun Manet, who last year took over the wheel of government from his father, Hun Sen, who led Cambodia for 38 years.

The government declared Monday — also Hun Sen’s birthday — a holiday so Cambodians could participate in the “celebration in a joyful, crowded and proud manner.” Thousands of people wearing t-shirts with photographs of the father and son began gathering at the canal site, that was covered in Cambodian flags. Billboards promoting the economic benefits of the canal dominated the countryside.

The canal will promote “national prestige, the territorial integrity and the development of Cambodia,” Manet said, adding that the country had built bigger and more expensive infrastructure projects before. But this “historic” canal was different and had nationwide support, he said.

“We will build this canal, no matter the cost,” he said.

He emphasized that while the canal would be jointly built by Chinese and Cambodian companies, the latter would have a 51% majority share and thus maintain control. Deputy Prime Minister Sun Chanthol confirmed that the Chinese state-owned construction giant China Road and Bridge Corporation had landed the contract to build the canal.

The U.S.-based nonprofit Stimson Center has warned that the canal would cause “significant transboundary impacts to water availability and agricultural production in Vietnam’s Mekong Delta.” The region is where 90% of rice exported from Vietnam is grown.

The Cambodian government has dismissed these concerns.

Earlier in April, Vietnam had asked Cambodia to share information about the canal. “We have asked Cambodia to collaborate closely with Vietnam and the Mekong River Commission in sharing information and assessing the project’s impacts on water resources and ecosystem in the Mekong Delta region.”

Cambodia is a key Chinese diplomatic partner, helping dampen criticism of Beijing within the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, several of whose members, including Vietnam, are engaged in territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea.

China’s outsized presence can be seen in the numerous Chinese-funded projects, hotels and casinos dotting the Cambodian landscape. China’s state banks have financed airports, roads and other infrastructure built with Chinese loans. Nearly 40% of Cambodia’s over $11 billion in foreign debt is owed to China."
U.S. troops withdraw from strategic West African base as militant threat grows.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/08/04/israel-gaza-strikes-holon-stabbing-war/,"TEL AVIV — Dozens of Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes in Gaza and two people were killed in a stabbing attack by a Palestinian in a Tel Aviv suburb, according to Gazan and Israeli authorities Sunday, in a region on edge over fears of a wider war. Mahmoud Bassal, a spokesman for Gaza’s Civil Defense, said at least 30 people were killed and 16 were missing after afternoon strikes on the Hassan Salama and Nasser schools in Gaza City, where thousands of displaced people were sheltering.

The Israel Defense Forces said the strikes targeted Hamas militants who were using the schools as “command and control centers.”

“Numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise munitions, surveillance, and additional intelligence,” the IDF said. On Telegram, Hamas accused Israel of “violating all international laws and norms.”

Gaza City resident Osama Labad, 35, was near Hassan Salama when he heard explosions and rushed to the scene. He described finding the building on fire and bodies in the courtyard, including children.

“I saw a mother trying to identify her daughter, who was completely cut up, and trying to wake her up and provide her with first aid,” he said.

An earlier Israeli strike hit a camp for displaced people in Deir al-Balah, around al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza, leaving four people dead and 15 others injured, according to Khalil Daqran, a spokesman for al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital.

In a statement, the IDF said it “struck an operative that conducted terrorist activities,” adding that “secondary explosions were identified” during the strike, “indicating the presence of weaponry in the area.”

In Israel, two people were killed in a stabbing attack in Holon, a southern suburb of Tel Aviv, on Sunday, medical authorities and police said. Two others were injured in the attack, according to Israel’s national emergency service, Magen David Adom. Israeli police said they shot and killed the attacker at the scene, describing him as a Palestinian man who lived in the West Bank.

Among the victims was Rina Danib, 66, who was on a morning run with her husband, authorities said. Her husband Shimon, 69, was badly wounded.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the “murderous terrorist attack” and expressed condolences to the victims’ families in a statement Sunday.

The attacks came amid soaring tensions between Israel and Iran — and its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon — following the killing of Hamas’s top political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran and the killing of a Hezbollah senior commander, Fuad Shukr, in an Israeli airstrike near Beirut last week. Hezbollah and Iran blamed Haniyeh’s death on Israel and have threatened to retaliate; Israeli officials have declined to comment on the incident.

Israel and Hezbollah exchanged fire overnight, with the IDF reporting that “approximately 30 projectiles” were fired from Lebanon toward Israeli territory. The IDF said that most were intercepted by air defense systems and that there were no injuries, though it said one projectile landed in Beit Hillel, in northern Israel, and others landed in “open areas.”

Israel’s air force “struck the Hezbollah launcher from which the projectiles were launched,” the IDF said, and other sites in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah confirmed in a statement that it launched dozens of rockets toward Beit Hillel.

The IDF also reported about five launches from southern Gaza and said air raid sirens sounded around Lachish, Ashdod and Gan Yavne, in central Israel. The IDF said one of the projectiles fell near the Hof Ashkelon Regional Council in Nitzanim, but there were no injuries reported. The launches from Gaza were unusual, reaching as far as the coastal city of Ashdod, less than an hour’s drive from Tel Aviv.

Netanyahu, meanwhile, was planning to hold a security meeting Sunday night to discuss preparations for an Iranian or Hezbollah attack.

“Our readiness in terms of defense is high,” Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Sunday during a visit with Israeli soldiers. “If they dare to attack us, they will pay a heavy price.”

Foreign governments repeated warnings to their citizens to get out of Lebanon. The U.K. Foreign Office said its citizens “should leave now.” Australian, Canadian and French officials issued similar advisories.

White House deputy national security adviser Jonathan Finer said in a Sunday interview with CBS News that the United States is “preparing for whatever may come” in Lebanon and that it encourages any Americans who wish to leave the country do so “while commercial options are available.”

“We’ve been quite clear that we’ll work with our ally Israel to defend itself against any threats that it faces, and we are in a moment that appears to be of heightened threat,” Finer said.

Israelis in Holon expressed fear following Sunday’s stabbings. Two passersby told The Washington Post they didn’t leave their home to go to work.

Israel’s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, visited the site of the attack and urged local residents to carry guns with them at all times. “Our war is not only against Iran, but also here in the streets,” he said in a post on X."
Abbas accuses Israel of killing Haniyeh in order to expand the Gaza conflict.,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/02/world/israel-hamas-iran-hezbollah-gaza,"A new report from the European Union’s representative in the West Bank and Gaza on Friday found a sharp rise last year in Israeli settlement and construction in the West Bank, even as Israel was waging a devastating war against Hamas in Gaza.

The findings provided further evidence that the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and its far-right ministers have stepped up efforts to expand Jewish settlements in territories widely considered to be illegally occupied by Israel under international law.

The pro-settler policies of the government have come under fire from several countries and international organizations, including the Group of 7, since the conflict in Gaza started. The European Union and United States have in recent months sanctioned settlers, groups and other entities that they say are inciting violence against Palestinians, blocking access to land or otherwise violating human rights.

Last month, the International Court of Justice, the United Nation’s highest court, issued an advisory opinion that concluded Israel was illegally occupying the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and through its settlement and construction was conducting a “de facto” annexation.

The new report found that plans and approvals by the Israeli government to construct new housing units in the West Bank saw a particularly sharp yearly increase, rising to nearly 12,350 units in 2023 from 4,400 units in 2022.

“For the West Bank, it was the highest number advanced since the signing of the Oslo Accords,” it stated, referring to a 1993 declaration of principles for reaching a peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians, which ultimately fell apart.

The advancements in 2023 represent a 180 percent increase over a period of five years, according to the report.

While the extent of Israeli advancement in East Jerusalem was less dramatic than in the West Bank last year, Jewish expansion there was particularly problematic geographically, the report said.

“From the perspective of safeguarding a two-state solution where Jerusalem could serve as a capital of both states, the Israeli settlement developments on the southern periphery of Jerusalem is severing the chances for contiguity between East Jerusalem and the West Bank,” the report said.

The European Union’s report noted that for the first time in more than 20 years, construction began on a new Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem in 2023. A second new settlement in the area was fully approved late last year, and plans were also advanced for construction in Palestinian neighborhoods there, “which has been known to cause friction,” the report said.

Mr. Netanyahu — and some of his far-right ministers, who are settlers themselves — have been vocal about their expansionist aims. In a speech to the U.S. Congress last month, Mr. Netanyahu referred to Jerusalem as “our eternal capital never to be divided again.”

Palestinians have long argued that the settlements are a creeping annexation, carving out territory that should become a Palestinian state into an unworkable patchwork while steadily pushing Arabs out of their homes and farms.

The United Nations in 1947 approved a partition creating a Jewish state and a Palestinian one that would include the West Bank; it put Jerusalem under international control. But after the first Arab-Israeli war, Jordan took control of the West Bank and Jerusalem became divided between Israel and Jordan.

In a 1967 war, Israel annexed East Jerusalem and occupied the West Bank, which it says is disputed territory whose fate should be determined in negotiations. Soon after, it began to permit settlements there. Under Israeli law, legal settlements must be built on land held by the state, must have government building permits and must be established by a government resolution.

Under the Oslo accords, signed by Israel and the Palestinians in the 1990s, both sides agreed that the status of Israeli settlements would be resolved by negotiation, a prospect that grows dimmer with each new outpost, settlement and housing unit.

“The E.U. has repeatedly called on Israel not to proceed with plans under its settlement policy and to halt all settlement activities,” the report said. “It remains the E.U.’s firm position that settlements are illegal under international law” and undermine “the prospects of a viable two state solution.”"
Mali severs diplomatic relations with Ukraine for providing intelligence to rebels for the Wagner ambush.,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/04/africa/mali-ukraine-wagner-intelligence-intl-latam/index.html,"CNN —

Mali has severed diplomatic ties with Ukraine after the country supplied intelligence to Malian rebels involved in an ambush against Wagner Group forces in July.

“The transitional government of the Republic of Mali condemns the hostility of the authorities of Ukraine who do not observe that Mali has always called for a peaceful settlement of the crisis between the Russian Federation and Ukraine,” government spokesman Colonel Abdoulaye Maiga said in a televised statement on Sunday.

Andriy Yusov, a representative of Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU), previously said Kyiv had provided the militants with intelligence for the attack, saying on Ukrainian television in late July that “the rebels received necessary information, which enabled a successful military operation against Russian war criminals.”

The attack was claimed by a Tuareg rebels group along with the al Qaeda affiliate in the Sahel, JNIM (Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin). Known for ad hoc cooperation, they appear to have collaborated to trap the Russian convoy.

After the attack, JNIM claimed that a “complex ambush” had wiped out the convoy, killing 50 Russians and several Malian soldiers, and published videos showing several vehicles ablaze as well as dozens of bodies in the area. A Tuareg militant group spokesman said some Malian troops and Russian fighters had also been captured during the battle.

According to some unofficial Russian Telegram channels, as many as 80 Russians were killed. That would make it by far the worst loss for Russian paramilitaries in several years of operating in Africa, as the Kremlin has sought to use proxy forces to challenge Western influence across the Sahel and central Africa and prop up unstable regimes.

Mali severs diplomatic relations with Ukraine for providing intelligence to rebels for the Wagner ambush.,https://uatv.ua/en/due-to-losses-the-occupiers-in-a-number-of-areas-cannot-even-complete-tactical-level-tasks-details-from-an-analyst/,"The transitional government of Mali has decided to sever diplomatic relations with Ukraine, accusing the country’s military intelligence of involvement in the downing of Russian Wagner mercenaries. Ukraine responded that it first wanted to see evidence of its involvement.

CNN reports this with reference to a televised address by Malian government spokesman Colonel Abdoulaye Maiga, as well as the official website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine.

“Mali has severed diplomatic relations with Ukraine after Kyiv provided Malian rebels with intelligence used to ambush members of the Wagner group in July,” the article says.

It is noted that the decision to sever diplomatic relations takes effect immediately. “The transitional government of the Republic of Mali condemns the hostility of the Ukrainian authorities, which does not take into account the fact that Mali has always called for a peaceful resolution of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine,” Maiga said.

CNN recalls that a representative of the Defence Ministry’s Main Intelligence Directorate, Andrey Yusov, had previously confirmed that the Malian rebels had been provided with “the necessary information that allowed for a successful military operation against Russian war criminals”.

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said that Mali’s decision was “short-sighted and hasty”.

“Ukraine unconditionally adheres to international law, the inviolability of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other countries and strongly rejects the accusations of the Transitional Government of Mali of allegedly ‘supporting international terrorism by Ukraine’,” the diplomatic ministry said in an official statement.

“It is regrettable that the Transitional Government of the Republic of Mali has decided to sever diplomatic relations with Ukraine without conducting a thorough study of the facts and circumstances of the incident in northern Mali, as well as without providing any evidence of Ukraine’s involvement in the event… Ukraine reserves the right to take all necessary political and diplomatic measures in response to the unfriendly actions of the Transitional Government of the Republic of Mali,” the Foreign Ministry added.

The ministry also reminded the Malian authorities that “Kremlin-controlled military structures, including Wagner, use terrorist methods and are directly involved in numerous war crimes, killings of civilians and ill-treatment of prisoners of war both in Ukraine and in Africa”.

As you know, a coalition of anti-government groups in northern Mali killed 84 mercenaries from the Russian PMC Wagner and 47 Malian soldiers during three days of fierce fighting in late July. This is the largest loss of the Wagner PMC in all the years of its presence in Africa.

Mali severs diplomatic relations with Ukraine for providing intelligence to rebels for the Wagner ambush.,https://businessday.ng/africa/article/mali-sever-diplomatic-ties-with-ukraine-over-wagner-ambush-betrayal/?amp,"Mali has severed diplomatic ties with Ukraine after a suggestive statement by a top Kyiv official stating their role in the national deadly conflict that led to the death of many Malian soldiers and Wagner mercenaries.

At least 84 mercenaries and 47 Malian soldiers were killed by The northern Tuareg rebels and fighters linked to Al-qaeda in July north of the West African country, in what appeared to be Wagner’s heaviest defeat since it stepped into the conflict two years ago.

On July 29, Andriy Yusov, the spokesperson for Ukraine’s military intelligence agency (GUR), told the public broadcaster Suspilne that the Malian rebels had received “all the information they needed, which allowed them to carry out their operation against the Russian war criminals”.

Mali said it had learned “with deep shock” of the remarks and that Yusov had “admitted Ukraine’s involvement in a cowardly, treacherous and barbaric attack by armed terrorist groups that resulted in the death of members of the Malian Defence and Security Forces”.

It said it would break off relations “with immediate effect”, a statement from government spokesman Colonel Abdoulaye Maiga said.

Mali also cited comments by Ukraine’s Ambassador to Senegal Yurii Pyvovarov, who was summoned by Senegal on Saturday over a video published on Facebook in which Pyvovarov provided “unequivocal and unqualified support for the terrorist attack” in Mali, Al-Jazeera reported.

Ukraine’s actions violated Malian sovereignty and constituted unacceptable foreign interference and support for international terrorism, according to Maiga.

Reports say the Malian and Russian forcers were ambushed by Tuareg rebels and fighters from al-Qaeda affiliate Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin while waiting for reinforcements, after retreating from Tinzaouaten.

Neither Mali’s military nor Wagner – which has since morphed into a group called the Africa Corps – have given exact figures, but the estimated death toll for Wagner fighters ranges from 20 to 80.

The Russian mercenary outfit’s losses are thought to be the heaviest it has suffered in Mali since it began helping the military government fight the insurgents two years ago.

Wagner has acknowledged that one of its commanders was killed and a Russian helicopter was downed in “fierce fighting”, saying they had been attacked by around 1,000 fighters.

More than a decade ago, Mali’s central government lost control of much of the north following a Tuareg rebellion, which was sparked by a demand for a separate state.

The country’s security was then further complicated by the involvement of Islamist militants in the conflict.

When seizing power in coups in 2020 and 2021, the military cited the government’s inability to tackle this unrest.

Mali has announced the severance of diplomatic relations with Ukraine following accusations that Ukraine provided intelligence to Malian rebels involved in an ambush against Wagner Group forces in July. The transitional government of Mali expressed strong condemnation towards Ukraine for allegedly supporting the rebels, stating that Mali has always advocated for a peaceful resolution to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

Andriy Yusov, a representative of Ukraine's Security Service (SBU), reportedly disclosed that Kyiv had supplied the militants with crucial information for the attack. The assault, claimed by a Tuareg rebels group in collaboration with the al Qaeda affiliate JNIM, resulted in significant casualties, including the reported deaths of 50 Russians and several Malian soldiers."

In a televised statement on Sunday, Mali’s government spokesperson Colonel Abdoulaye Maiga condemned Ukraine’s actions, emphasizing Mali’s stance for a peaceful resolution between Russia and Ukraine. Maiga criticized Ukraine for its perceived hostility, asserting that Mali has consistently advocated for dialogue over conflict.

Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) had previously confirmed that Kyiv provided intelligence to the rebels, facilitating their attack. Andriy Yusov of the SBU stated in late July that the intelligence allowed the militants to conduct a successful operation against Russian forces, which Ukraine described as “war criminals.”

The attack was reportedly carried out by Tuareg rebels in conjunction with the al-Qaeda affiliate JNIM (Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin). The group claimed responsibility for what they termed a “complex ambush” that resulted in significant casualties, including 50 Russian fighters and several Malian soldiers. Videos released by JNIM showed burning vehicles and numerous bodies at the site. Some sources reported that up to 80 Russians might have been killed, marking one of the heaviest losses for Russian paramilitaries in Africa.

This incident underscores the volatile situation in the Sahel region, where Russia’s Wagner Group has been actively involved in supporting local regimes and countering Western influence."

NEW YORK CITY: Violence in Sudan has continued to escalate in the past six months, the International Criminal Court’s prosecutor said on Monday, with reports of rapes, crimes against children and persecution on a massive scale.

“Terror has become a common currency,” Karim Khan told a meeting of the UN Security Council, “and the terror is not felt by the people with guns but by people who are running, very often with nothing on their feet, hungry.”

War between rival military factions has been raging in Sudan for more than a year. Since it began in April 2023, about 19,000 people have been killed. More than 10 million are displaced within the country and more than 2 million have fled to neighboring countries as refugees, making it the largest displacement crisis in the world.

The country is on the brink of famine as a severe food crisis looms, with many families reportedly already often going days without food.

Khan said the ICC is prioritizing investigations into allegations of crimes against, and affecting, children, and gender crimes. These “profound human rights abuses, mass violations of personal dignity” continue to be fueled by the “provision of arms, financial support from various sectors, and political triangulations that lead to inaction by the international community,” he added.

His comments came during the latest semi-annual briefing to the Security Council on the court’s Darfur-related activities. Almost 20 years after the council referred the situation in Darfur to the ICC, arrest warrants issued by the court against former president Omar Al-Bashir, former ministers Ahmad Mohammed Harun and Abdel Raheem Mohammed Hussein, and the former commander-in-chief of the Justice and Equality Movement, Abdallah Banda Abakaer Nourain, remain outstanding.

Khan said that such failures to execute arrest warrants for indicted individuals have contributed to several unwelcome consequences, including “the climate of impunity and the outbreak of violence that commenced in April (2023), and that continues today, (in which) belligerents think they can get away with murder and rape; the feeling that the bandwidth of the (Security) Council, the bandwidth of states, is too limited, it’s too preoccupied with other epicenters of conflict, hot wars in other parts of the world; that we’ve lost sight of the plight of the people of Darfur, we have somehow forgotten our responsibilities under the UN Charter; (and) the feeling that Darfur or Sudan is a law-free zone in which people can act with abandon, based upon their worst proclivities, their worst base instincts, the politics of hate and power, the opportunities to profit.”

He called on council members to “back in substance” the call for justice.

In comments directed toward both of the warring factions, the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces, as well as “those who are funding them, supplying them with weapons, giving orders, gaining certain advantages,” Khan said his office is investigating and “using our resources as effectively as we can to make sure that the events since April of last year are subjected to the principle of international humanitarian law and the imperative that every human life must be seen to have equal value.”

He said that after “a great deal of difficulty,” Sudanese authorities are finally cooperating with ICC investigators who have been able to enter Port Sudan, collect evidence and engage with Gen. Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan, commander of the Sudanese Armed Forces and the country’s de facto leader.

“But one swallow does not a summer make,” Khan added as he underscored the need for “continuous, deepening cooperation with the Sudanese Armed Forces, with Gen. Al-Burhan and his government moving forward.”

He said that “one concrete way in which that commitment to accountability, and this lack of tolerance for impunity, can be evidenced is by properly enforcing court orders,” including the arrest of former minister Harun and delivering him to the court.

However, Khan said that the most recent significant efforts to engage with the leadership of the Rapid Support Forces have so far proved to be fruitless.

Meanwhile, he said, ICC investigators have visited neighboring Chad several times and collected “very valuable testimonial evidence” from displaced Sudanese citizens living there as refugees.

They have met representatives of Sudanese civil society in Chad, South Sudan, the Central African Republic and Europe, he added, “to get and preserve their accounts and their stories, to analyze it and to piece it together, to see what crimes, if any, it shows and who is responsible for the hell on earth that is being unleashed so stubbornly, so persistently against the people of Darfur.”

Khan said his office has used technological tools to gather and piece together various forms of evidence from phones, videos and audio recordings, and that this is “proving to be extremely critical to pierce the veil of impunity.”

The collective efforts by investigators, analysts, lawyers and members of civil society have resulted in significant progress being made, he added, and he expressed hope that he will soon be able to announce that arrest warrants have been requested for individuals believed to be most responsible for the crimes in the country.

Meanwhile, Khan sounded a broader alarm over what he described as “a trapezium of chaos in that part of the continent.”

He continued: “If one draws a line from the Mediterranean of Libya, down to the Red Sea of Sudan, and then draws a line to Sub-Saharan Africa, and then all the way to the Atlantic, with Boko Haram causing instability, chaos and suffering in Nigeria, and then back to Sudan, (we) see the map and the countries that risk being unsettled or destabilized by this concentration of chaos and suffering.”

He warned the members of the Security Council that in addition to the concerns about the rights of the people of Darfur, “we’re reaching a tipping point in which a Pandora’s box of ethnic, racial, religious, sectarian (and) commercial interests will be unleashed.”

He added that “they will no longer be susceptible to the political powers of the great states of the world, or even of this council. It requires some real action now to stem the bleeding … in Sudan.”"

People bury the bodies of unidentified Palestinians at a mass grave after the bodies were handed over by Israel, in Khan Younis

People bury the bodies of unidentified Palestinians at a mass grave after the bodies were handed over by Israel, in Khan Younis

By Hatem Khaled

GAZA (Reuters) -In war-ravaged Gaza, even the dead cannot rest.

Residents of the southern city of Khan Younis said Israeli soldiers have dug up graves on several occasions at the Bani Suhaila cemetery in the Palestinian enclave.

Bilal Al-Qahwaji buried several members of his family, including two brothers, there in November after they were killed in an Israeli air strike. He can no longer find their bodies.

""They (Israeli forces) dug it up once again – a first, second and third time,"" he said.

“There are no corpses. My martyrs are all in this area and I didn't find them,” Qahwaji added, referring to his dead relatives.

The Israeli military said in a statement that it should be clear that it ""in no way targets cemeteries as such, and has no policy of harming or desecrating cemeteries"".

""During a war in which Hamas purposely embeds itself deeply within the civilian population, including within and adjacent to civilian sites like cemeteries, physical damage to such sites might occur,"" it added.

Israel's military has previously said it dug in Bani Suhaila to find and destroy a tunnel it says the Islamist group Hamas built to house a military command centre, a use it argued deprived the site of international legal protection.

The International Criminal Court's founding Rome Statute defines the desecration of dead bodies as a war crime.

Israeli air strikes have made major cemeteries in Gaza dangerous to reach, so mourning families are burying their dead in informal graveyards dug in empty lots amid an intensifying siege.

Israel has killed over 39,000 people in Gaza and reduced much of the small enclave to rubble since Hamas attacked the country on Oct. 7, according to local health authorities.

Many Palestinians have fled up and down Gaza seeking a safe place to shelter. Ten months into the conflict, the cemetery in Khan Younis has suffered damage several times in Israeli air strikes and during ground operations there, residents say.

With hospital morgues also filled with the bodies constantly arriving from bomb sites, families must find other places to bury their dead.

Israel launched its war in Gaza after militants from the Hamas Islamist group that ran the enclave burst across the border fence killing 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

""All this destruction, every day we are out on the streets. Shame on you, our children have been martyred,"" said Ahlam Farhan, a Gaza resident whose son was killed in the war.

""The dead were not spared from the Jews (Israelis). Where should we go? Tell us.""

The destruction of grave sites comes as Palestinians face shortages of food, fuel, water, medicine and functioning hospitals. Mediators from Qatar, the U.S. and Egypt have failed to secure a ceasefire, so the death toll is expected to keep rising.

Qahwaji said the United Nations and other international organizations should help return the bodies of those who were buried in the cemetery.

But for now, Palestinians have to deal with the ruins and remains on their own, as members of the Khan Younis Civil Defence zip body bags on the ground and carry them onto trucks.

“This is a war crime in itself, to dig up graves that are more than 50 years old,” said Yamen Abu Suleiman, its director.

On May 20, the International Criminal Court prosecutor's office requested arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his defence chief Yoav Gallant, and for three Hamas leaders for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza war.

As the living grapple with a humanitarian crisis and air strikes, some Palestinians ask why the dead were disturbed.

“Were they taking revenge on the dead in their graves, by digging them up and taking them out into the open?” Abu Suleiman asked.

The Palestinian ministry of health reported that Israel returned the bodies of over 80 Palestinians who were killed during its military offensive in the Gaza Strip. On the same day, Israeli airstrikes claimed the lives of at least 18 more people.



According to Yamen Abu Suleiman, the director of the Palestinian Civil Emergency Service in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, it was uncertain whether the bodies had been exhumed from cemeteries by the army during the ground offensive or if they were ""detainees who had been tortured and killed.""



""The occupation provided us with no information about the names, or ages, or anything. This is a war crime, a crime against humanity,"" Abu Suleiman said.

The bodies will undergo screening and examination to determine the causes of death and to identify them. Following this process, they will be laid to rest in a mass grave at a cemetery near Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis.



Abu Suleiman further stated that the 84 bodies were delivered in more than 15 bags, with each bag containing several bodies.



The Israeli military did not immediately provide a comment on the return of the bodies. Previously, Israel has stated that it returned bodies after verifying that they were not Israeli hostages who had been held by Hamas since the attack on Israel on October 7.

""There is no doubt that the purpose of Mr. Haniyeh's assassination is to prolong the war and expand its scope,"" RIA cited Abbas as saying.

""It will have a negative impact on the ongoing negotiations to end the aggression and withdraw Israeli troops from Gaza.""

Haniyeh was assassinated in the Iranian capital Tehran last week, an attack that drew threats of revenge on Israel and fuelled concern that the conflict in Gaza was turning into a wider Middle East war.

""We consider this a cowardly act and a dangerous development in Israeli politics,"" Abbas said in remarks published in Russian by the RIA agency.

""The Israeli occupation authorities are required to abandon their ambitions and stop their aggressive actions against our people and our cause, to comply with international law and implement the Arab Peace Initiative, as well as an immediate and lasting ceasefire and withdrawal from the Gaza Strip."""

The smell of death is everywhere in war-ravaged Gaza, but people often have little time, or place that is not in ruins, to mourn (Eyad BABA)

Once a day, Umm Omar picks up the phone and calls her late husband, humouring their four-year-old daughter who does not understand yet her father was killed early in the Gaza war.

Little Ella ""wants us to call him, to tell him about her day"", said Umm Omar, who has fled with her three children to Al-Mawasi, a coastal area teeming with mostly displaced Palestinians in the southern Gaza Strip.

A steadily climbing death toll, reported by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, nears 40,000 people killed in Gaza since war between Israel and Palestinian militants broke out on October 7.

It was triggered by Hamas's attack on southern Israel that day which resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.

Umm Omar told AFP she did not understand ""how the months have gone by"" since her husband, Ibrahim al-Shanbari, was killed in an Israeli strike on northern Gaza.

When he died, Umm Omar said she lost everything ""in a fraction of a second"", but there was little time to bury him properly, grieve or process the loss of the ""kind"" man that he was.

There was no funeral procession or ""any of the usual mourning (rituals) because it's wartime"", Umm Omar added.

""It was very difficult to say goodbye... because the martyrs were buried very quickly,"" she said, with fighting raging across the besieged territory.

To help Ella, ""I ended up pretending"" her father was still alive, said Umm Omar.

Still, according to her, others had it worse, ""those who have lost an entire family, those who have not been able to say goodbye, or those who find their children in pieces"".

With more than 1.5 percent of Gaza's 2.4 million people killed during the war, many inhabitants of the besieged coastal territory have lost loved ones.

The smell of death is everywhere, but under constant bombardment, shelling and battles, Gazans often have little time -- or place that is not in ruins -- to process their grief.

- 'Death has replaced life' -

Some bled to death before reaching hospitals, many of which had gone out of service due to the fighting or facing severe shortages amid an Israeli siege imposed early on in the war.

Other victims were crushed under their toppled homes, their bodies eventually retrieved from the rubble of bombed-out neighbourhoods. Some are still missing, feared buried under the ruins.

To Mustafa al-Khatib, 56, who has lost several relatives, ""death has replaced life.""

The incessant violence has rendered many cemeteries inaccessible, often forcing Gazans to dig makeshift graves with whatever tools they can find, Khatib told AFP.

And ""there are no stones or cement to make a concrete covering for the grave either"", he said.

The hasty interment of Khatib's uncle in a hospital yard has left him with a ""heavy heart"", he said.

His sister was laid to rest at a long abandoned cemetery, which Khatib said was later bombed.

In central Gaza's Al-Maghazi refugee camp, a woman placed her hand on the ground outside a school used a displacement shelter: this is where she said her daughter was buried after dying in her arms, fatally wounded in a blast.

With nearly all Gazans displaced at least once by the war, and often far from home, they have resorted to burying loved ones on any available patch of land, in the street, or sometimes on football fields.

Many do not know when they may be able to return to their burial spots or even find them again.

- Longing for a final embrace -

In the nearly 10 months since the war began, AFP correspondents have witnessed mass burials and bodies put in the ground in blood-stained blankets.

Some were wrapped in plastic sheets, marked with a number rather than a name, either because the bodies were unrecognisable or because no relatives had come to claim them.

Across the ravaged territory, which had already suffered for years under a crippling Israeli-led blockade and past cycles of violence, hasty burials are now conducted daily in the midst of fighting, evacuation orders and hazardous journeys to find food, water and medical care.

Khatib said he had ""grown accustomed"" to the often chaotic and fleeting farewells before friends and family return to their daily task of survival.

Some never had the chance to say goodbye.

Gazans interviewed by AFP have struggled or were outright unable to express their grief and loss. Many said they await their own death to rejoin their loved ones.

For more than six months, Ali Khalil has known that his 32-year-old son Mohammed was killed in the bombing of his home in the Al-Shati refugee camp, on the outskirts of Gaza City.

But he was far, having fled for safety with his grandchildren to the coastal territory's south, when he heard the news.

""What hurts me the most is not having been able to bury my son, not having hugged him and not having said goodbye to him,"" said the grieving 54-year-old man.

""I wonder if his body remained intact or if it was in pieces. I have no idea.""

"Israel returns bodies of over 80 Palestinians to Gaza, keeps up military pressure.",https://www.arabnews.com/node/2563341,"Four killed after Storm Debby hits Florida coast

MIAMI: At least four people were killed as Tropical Storm Debby drenched Florida on Monday, threatening southeastern US states with heavy rainfall and catastrophic flooding.

A 13-year-old boy died when a tree was blown onto a mobile home in Levy County, the sheriff’s office there said, after Debby made landfall on Florida’s Gulf Coast earlier Monday as a Category One hurricane.

Authorities said a truck driver was killed after his 18-wheeler plunged into a canal in Hillsborough County, while a 38-year-old woman and 12-year-old boy died in a car crash in Dixie County.

The storm is expected to move into Georgia overnight, before moving offshore and approaching the South Carolina coast on Thursday, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC).

“This is a level four out of four risk for excessive rainfall,” Michael Brennan, director of the NHC, told reporters.

“This is going to result in a prolonged extreme rainfall event with potential for catastrophic flooding across coastal portions of Georgia, South Carolina, even extending up into North Carolina,” he added.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said that some 250,000 residents in his state were without power.

“Please, be very cautious when you’re going out,” he said, adding that Debby’s winds had not been as damaging as previous hurricanes that have hit Florida.

President Joe Biden on Sunday approved an emergency declaration for Florida, allowing federal aid to be expedited.

DeSantis has activated the state’s National Guard, with more than 3,000 service members mobilized to help with storm response.

By late afternoon, the NHC said the storm was registering maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph) as it swept over Florida.

Storm surge warnings — signalling a life-threatening inundation from rising water — are in effect in parts of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.

Debby was expected to bring “potentially historic rainfall” of up to 30 inches as it moved north, the NHC said.

But it said Debby was weakening after making landfall earlier with sustained speeds of 80 mph (130 kph) as a Category One hurricane — the lowest on a scale of five.

Mandatory evacuations were ordered for part of Citrus County, Florida, with eight other counties under voluntary evacuation orders, local media reported.

Police in the city of Sarasota said that some 500 residents were evacuated from their flooded homes.

The governors of Georgia and South Carolina have declared a state of emergency ahead of the storm’s arrival.

Meanwhile, the US Border Patrol announced that Debby had washed up 25 packages of cocaine to the coast of the Florida Keys, where they were seized.

The intended shipment had a street value of more than $1 million, acting chief patrol Agent Samuel Briggs II said on X.

In July, at least 18 people were killed when the powerful Hurricane Beryl tore through the Caribbean before hitting the southern US states of Texas and Louisiana.

Scientists say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of storms such as Beryl because there is more energy in a warmer ocean for them to feed on."
"Israel returns bodies of over 80 Palestinians to Gaza, keeps up military pressure.",https://uk.news.yahoo.com/israeli-rights-group-says-palestinian-195451978.html,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel has conducted a systematic policy of prisoner abuse and torture since the start of the war in Gaza, subjecting Palestinian detainees to acts ranging from arbitrary violence to sexual abuse, a report from Israeli rights group B'Tselem said on Monday.

The group said the report was based on interviews with 55 Palestinians from Gaza, the West Bank and Israel, who were detained in Israeli prisons since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel that set off the war, most of them without being tried.

""The testimonies clearly indicate a systematic, institutional policy focused on the continual abuse and torture of all Palestinian prisoners held by Israel,"" the report said.

The report was issued days after the Israeli military detained nine soldiers accused of severe abuse of a prisoner in a military facility in the Negev desert. According to Israeli press reports, the soldiers are accused of sexually abusing a member of an elite Hamas unit.

A spokesperson for the Israel Prison Service said that all prisoners were treated according to the law and all basic rights were fully applied by professionally trained guards.

""We are not aware of the claims you described and as far as we know, no such events have occurred under IPS responsibility,"" the spokesperson said, adding that detainees had the right to file complaints that would be fully examined and investigated.

B'Tselem detailed allegations that Palestinian prisoners were subjected to arbitrary beatings, degrading and humiliating treatment and sleep deprivation, as well as ""the repeated use of sexual violence, in varying degrees of severity"".

""The overall picture indicates abuse and torture carried out under orders, in utter defiance of Israel's obligations both under domestic law and international law,"" the report said.

Allegations of prisoner abuse have surfaced repeatedly during the war in Gaza, adding to mounting international pressure on Israel over its conduct of the 10 month-old war.

The report from B'Tselem, a group that documents human rights violations by Israel in the occupied West Bank and other areas, said the treatment accorded to prisoners was a deliberate policy implemented under the direction of the hardline National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir.

The prison service spokesperson said that since the Oct. 7 attack, Ben-Gvir had ordered that prison conditions be made more strict to reverse an improvement in conditions allowed previously.

Qadura Fares, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization's Commission for Prisoners and Ex-Detainees Affairs, reiterated a call for an international commission of inquiry into the treatment of prisoners to hold Israel accountable.

""We have documentation of the crimes committed by Israel against Palestinian detainees in its prisons and we have horrific testimonies of what detainees are subjected to, whether related to torture, rape and other crimes,"" he said.

They have met representatives of Sudanese civil society in Chad, South Sudan, the Central African Republic and Europe, he added, “to get and preserve their accounts and their stories, to analyze it and to piece it together, to see what crimes, if any, it shows and who is responsible for the hell on earth that is being unleashed so stubbornly, so persistently against the people of Darfur.”

Khan said his office has used technological tools to gather and piece together various forms of evidence from phones, videos and audio recordings, and that this is “proving to be extremely critical to pierce the veil of impunity.”

The collective efforts by investigators, analysts, lawyers and members of civil society have resulted in significant progress being made, he added, and he expressed hope that he will soon be able to announce that arrest warrants have been requested for individuals believed to be most responsible for the crimes in the country.

Meanwhile, Khan sounded a broader alarm over what he described as “a trapezium of chaos in that part of the continent.”

He continued: “If one draws a line from the Mediterranean of Libya, down to the Red Sea of Sudan, and then draws a line to Sub-Saharan Africa, and then all the way to the Atlantic, with Boko Haram causing instability, chaos and suffering in Nigeria, and then back to Sudan, (we) see the map and the countries that risk being unsettled or destabilized by this concentration of chaos and suffering.”

He warned the members of the Security Council that in addition to the concerns about the rights of the people of Darfur, “we’re reaching a tipping point in which a Pandora’s box of ethnic, racial, religious, sectarian (and) commercial interests will be unleashed.”

He added that “they will no longer be susceptible to the political powers of the great states of the world, or even of this council. It requires some real action now to stem the bleeding … in Sudan.”"

JERUSALEM: Diplomatic pressure mounted Monday to avert an escalation between Iran and Israel following high-profile killings that have sent regional tensions soaring.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said late Sunday that his country was “determined to stand against” Iran and its allied armed groups “on all fronts.”

As its war against Iran-backed Hamas in Gaza nears the 11th month, Israel has been bracing for retaliation from the Tehran-aligned “Axis of Resistance” for the killing of two senior figures.

Palestinian armed group Hamas’s political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Tehran on Wednesday in an attack blamed on Israel, which has not directly commented on it.

The killing came hours after an Israeli strike on Beirut killed the military chief of Lebanon’s Hezbollah movement, Fuad Shuk.

Tehran said on Monday that “no one has the right to doubt Iran’s legal right to punish the Zionist regime” for Haniyeh’s killing.

United States President Joe Biden, whose country has sent extra warships and fighter jets to the region in support of Israel, held crisis talks on Monday with his national security team.

The head of the US military command covering the Middle East, General Michael Kurilla, arrived in Israel and met Israel’s military chief Lt. General Herzi Halevi for a security assessment, an Israeli military statement said.

Iraqi sources said a base hosting US troops in Iraq came under rocket fire on Monday, after an American strike on July 30 killed four pro-Iran Iraqi fighters.

“Rockets were launched at Ain Assad base” in Anbar province, said a military source, while a commander in a pro-Iran armed group told AFP that at least “two rockets targeted” the base, without saying who had carried out the attack.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday urged all sides in the Middle East to avoid “escalation,” his spokesman said.

US news site Axios earlier reported that Blinken told his counterparts from the G7 nations that any attack by Iran and Hezbollah could happen as early as Monday.

A European diplomat in Tel Aviv said “a coordinated response” from Iran and its proxies was expected but de-escalation efforts persisted.

“We’re telling them they have to stop playing with fire, because the risk of flare-ups is higher than at any time since October 7,” he said, declining to be named as he was not authorized to speak on the issue.

The Jeddah-based Organization of Islamic Cooperation is to meet on Wednesday at the request of “Palestine and Iran,” to discuss developments in the region, an OIC official said.

Israeli government spokesman David Mencer said his country is “preparing for any scenario both offensively and defensively.”

In the northern port city of Haifa, shop owner Yehuda Levi, 45, told AFP that Israelis are used to conflict, but facing a multi-pronged attack “is a little tricky.”

“It’s difficult, but we believe we’re a strong country. We’re going to win this war.”

Turkiye on Monday joined multiple nations calling on their citizens to leave Lebanon, where Hezbollah is based.

Numerous airlines have suspended flights to the country or limited them to daylight hours.

Germany’s Lufthansa, which has already suspended flights to the region including Tel Aviv, said its planes would avoid Iraqi and Iranian airspace until at least Wednesday.

Royal Jordanian Airlines said it would be operating three flights this week to transport nationals out of Beirut.

The United Nations’ rights chief Volker Turk called on “all parties, along with those states with influence, to act urgently to de-escalate what has become a very precarious situation.”

Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani and his Iraqi counterpart Fuad Hussein in a joint statement Monday “agreed to make every effort to avoid a regional escalation.” Italy currently holds the rotating presidency of the G7 group of countries.

French President Emmanuel Macron also appealed for “restraint” in the Middle East, during conversations with the leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

The Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, triggered by the Palestinian group’s October 7 attack on Israel, has already drawn in Iran-backed militants in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen.

The Hamas attack resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.

Militants also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.

In Tel Aviv on Monday thousands of Israelis gathered to mark the fifth birthday of child hostage Ariel Bibas, and to call for the liberation of him and his family.

Netanyahu repeatedly promises to bring the hostages home but is facing a growing chorus of skeptics who worry he’s not interested in a ceasefire and hostage-release deal with Hamas, which US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators have for months been trying to reach.

“The hostages have no time and it seems like some people in Israel, including the prime minister, are taking their time,” said Gil Dickman, whose cousin Carmel Gat is among the captives.

Israel’s retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,623 people, according to the Hamas-run territory’s health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.

As the region braced for further escalation, Hezbollah and Israel kept up their near-daily exchanges of fire.

The Lebanese health ministry said three people were killed Monday in Israeli strikes on the country’s south. Israel’s military said it had struck militants operating a drone in the Mais Al-Jabal area.

Hezbollah later said two fighters had been killed, one from Mais Al-Jabal.

Tehran has said it expects Hezbollah to hit deeper inside Israel and no longer be confined to military targets.

Far from the Lebanese border, the Israeli military said around 15 rockets had crossed from the southern Gaza Strip into Israel on Monday, with medics reporting one injury.

"Israel returns bodies of over 80 Palestinians to Gaza, keeps up military pressure.",https://www.straitstimes.com/world/middle-east/frustration-with-netanyahu-mounts-as-gaza-talks-falter,"JERUSALEM - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing mounting frustration within Israel and abroad over his handling of faltering talks aimed at securing a Gaza hostage release and ceasefire deal, according to three Israeli officials.

Divisions between Mr Netanyahu and the defence establishment over the deal have also surfaced in public remarks and behind closed doors, in angry exchanges leaked on Aug 3 to the Israeli press.

Over the previous four weeks, three Israeli officials, one in the negotiating team and two with close knowledge of the talks, have voiced concern that politics was undermining the chances of a deal.

“The feeling is that the prime minister is avoiding making a decision about the deal and is not pushing for it full force,” one of the officials told Reuters on Aug 4.

Some of Mr Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners have threatened government stability should the war end before Hamas is defeated.

Mr Netanyahu has repeatedly said the release of the remaining 115 hostages held in Gaza since the Hamas-led Oct 7 assault on Israel that triggered the war was a top priority.

The Oct 7 attackers killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 captive, according to Israeli tallies. Gaza’s health authorities say more than 39,000 Palestinians have since been killed in fighting in the densely populated coastal enclave.

Tensions laid bare

Tensions between Mr Netanyahu – who insists he is safeguarding Israel’s security – and some in his negotiating team, were laid bare in his public remarks on Aug 4.

“I am prepared to go very far to release all of our hostages, while maintaining the security of Israel,” Mr Netanyahu said in televised remarks at his cabinet meeting.

“Our commitment stands in complete contrast to the leaks and mendacious briefings on the issue of our hostages.”

Efforts by the United States, Egypt and Qatar to secure a deal between Israel and Hamas had gained momentum over July but have since ground to a near halt after new terms were introduced to an agreed framework presented by Washington in May.

The framework involves three phases, with the first seeing a six-week ceasefire and the release of women, the elderly and wounded hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.

But sources have told Reuters a new Israeli condition that displaced Palestinians should be screened as they return to the enclave’s north when the ceasefire begins was among the sticking points.

The killing on July 31 of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran has further complicated matters, though the militant group has not shut the door entirely on negotiators.

“We will continue to apply military pressure on Hamas and its senior figures, until the return of all of our hostages and achieving all of the war goals,” Mr Netanyahu said.

“Anyone who wants the release of our hostages must pressure Hamas, not the government of Israel.”

Mr Netanyahu’s remarks came in response to a flurry of reports over the weekend.

One, by N12 News, quoted US President Joe Biden telling Mr Netanyahu in an Aug 1 phone call to “stop bullshitting me” about advancing the talks.

Mr Netanyahu’s office said he does not comment on his conversations with the US president. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the remarks, which were also reported by Haaretz newspaper, citing a senior Biden administration official.

“The people who are leaking these things out of meetings want to pressure the prime minister to make a bad deal. But what these leaks are doing is encouraging Hamas to add more and more demands,” a fourth Israeli official told Reuters on Aug 5."

Tensions have soared following nearly 10 months of war in Gaza and the killing last week of a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon and Hamas’ top political leader in Iran. Iran and its allies have blamed Israel and threatened retaliation. Hamas says it has begun discussions on choosing a new leader.

Netanyahu said Israel was ready for any scenario. Jordan’s foreign minister was making a rare trip to Iran as part of diplomatic efforts — “We want the escalation to end,” Ayman Safadi said — while the Pentagon has moved significant assets to the region.

“We are doing everything possible to make sure that this situation does not boil over,” White House deputy national security adviser Jon Finer told ABC.

In Israel, some prepared bomb shelters and recalled Iran’s unprecedented direct military assault in April following a suspected Israeli strike that killed two Iranian generals. Israel said almost all the drones and ballistic and cruise missiles were intercepted.

A stabbing attack on Sunday near Tel Aviv killed a woman in her 70s and an 80-year-old man, according to Israel’s Magen David Adom rescue service, and two others were wounded. The police said the attack was carried out by a Palestinian militant, who was “neutralized.”

Inside Gaza, the Health Ministry said at least 25 people were killed and 19 others injured when Israel struck two schools in Gaza City. AP video showed at least one child among the dead. Israel’s military, which regularly accuses Palestinian militants of sheltering in civilian areas, said it hit Hamas command centers.

“As you can see, there is no equipment to recover the injured. Rescuers are digging with their hands,” said one man, Yusuf Al-Mashharawi.

Earlier, Israeli strikes killed at least 18 people. One hit a tent camp for thousands of displaced Palestinians in the courtyard of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, killing four people, including one woman, the Health Ministry said. The Israeli military said it targeted a Palestinian militant in the strike, which it said caused secondary explosions, “indicating the presence of weaponry in the area.”

The hospital in Deir Al-Balah is the main medical facility operating in central Gaza as many others in the territory no longer function. A separate strike on a home near Deir Al-Balah killed a girl and her parents, according to the hospital.

Another strike flattened a house in northern Gaza, killing at least eight, including three children, their parents and their grandmother, according to the Health Ministry. Another three people were killed in a strike on a vehicle in Gaza City, according to Civil Defense first responders.

Palestinian militants in Gaza fired at least five projectiles at Israeli communities near the border without causing casualties or damage, the military said. The military later told people in some parts of the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis to evacuate.

The Health Ministry also said an Israeli strike on Saturday at a school-turned-shelter in Gaza City killed at least 16 people. Israel’s military said it struck a Hamas command center.

The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack into Israel that killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took around 250 people hostage.

Israel’s massive offensive in response has killed at least 39,580 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Heavy airstrikes and ground operations have caused widespread destruction and displaced the vast majority of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, often multiple times.

The militant group Hezbollah and Israel have continued to trade fire along the Lebanon border since the war began, with the severity growing in recent months. The Lebanese state-run National News Agency said an Israeli strike targeted a house in Beit Lef, and the Lebanese Health Ministry said two people were critically wounded.

Hezbollah says it’s aimed at relieving pressure on fellow Iran-backed ally Hamas. A growing number of countries, including the US, are encouraging citizens to leave Lebanon after last week’s killing of a senior commander.

"Israel returns bodies of over 80 Palestinians to Gaza, keeps up military pressure.",https://aljazirahnews.com/first-vessel-hit-by-yemens-houthis-in-two-weeks-arrives-yin-djibouti-manager-says/,"Container vessel that was hit by the Houthis off Yemen on Saturday in the first such attack in two weeks, has arrived safely in Djibouti and the strike caused no injuries or water ingress, its Greek manager said on Monday.

Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthis said on Sunday that they targeted the Liberia-flagged MV Groton in the Gulf of Aden with ballistic missiles, claiming their first attack on shipping lanes since Israel carried out a retaliatory airstrike in Hodeidah port on July 20.

The MV Groton was hit by a missile 60 nautical miles off the coast of Yemen, while en route from Dubai to Jeddah, Conbulk Shipmanagement Corporation said in a statement. After the strike, it was diverted to Djibouti where it arrived on Sunday, the company said.

“No injuries nor pollution have been reported and there is no water ingress caused by the hit,” the company said, adding that the safety of the crew was a top priority.

“Full evaluation of the damage will be made … followed by the necessary repairs.”

Following the strike, fire broke out in the cargo holds that were hit and in containers on the main deck, the company said. The blaze was extinguished by the crew.

The attack is the first since an apparent lull following Israel’s attack on Hodeidah, which occurred a day after a drone launched by the Iranian-backed group hit Israeli economic hub Tel Aviv.

The Houthis have launched attacks on international shipping near Yemen since last November in solidarity with Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas.

The French government has barred them from the event.

In an unprecedented move, French authorities are using the so-called anti-terror laws to keep hundreds of individuals deemed potential security risks far from France’s largest-ever event.

Many affected individuals are minorities from former French colonies, facing restrictions such as being confined to their neighborhoods and required to report daily to the police.

Lawyers are alarmed by what one describes as “a terribly dangerous tool” in the fight against terrorism.

Among those restricted are a man who had mental health issues in the past but is now receiving treatment, an apprentice bank worker and business student who believes he’s targeted due to his Muslim background and his father’s Moroccan heritage, and a halal food delivery driver who risks losing his job due to the restrictions, their lawyers say.

French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin says the restrictions aim to prevent “very dangerous” individuals from attacking the Games.

He has applied them to more than 500 people this year as part of France’s security preparations for the Games and the Olympic torch relay that preceded the July 26 opening ceremony.

Those affected include Amine, the bank apprentice now forbidden from leaving his suburb south of Paris except to report daily at 6:30 p.m. to a local police station.

The 21-year-old, born in France, has no criminal record and has not been charged with any crime, he and his lawyer said.

Amine believes French intelligence services have mistaken him for someone else who posted disturbing visuals on a video-sharing app.

The Associated Press (AP) is not identifying Amine by his full name due to his fear of potential repercussions from employers and schools.

“I am not dangerous for France. I am not a terrorist. I am just a student working to finance his studies,” Amine said in an interview at his studio apartment, which is filled with books and family photos.

Police visited twice in the last four months.

They first broke down a neighbor’s door, seemingly by mistake, and then seized Amine’s phone and computer, making it harder for him to study.

The second visit, a month before the Games, was to notify him of his movement restrictions.

“If my name were Brian, if I were blonde and blue-eyed, the situation would be different. But I am a North African Muslim, and I’ve been targeted in France,” he said.

Fearing terror attacks, French authorities have significantly ramped up security for the Games, deploying up to 45,000 police officers, soldiers armed with assault rifles, and intelligence services to identify and neutralize potential threats.

Interior Ministry notes seen by the AP indicate security services have thwarted several alleged terror plots ahead of the Games, with Olympic football matches and France’s Jewish community among suspected targets.

The ministry also notes that the Israel-Hamas conflict has heightened the terror risk in France, which has the largest Muslim and Jewish communities in Europe.

The preventive anti-terror effort includes the broad use of police powers to restrict the movements of people deemed potential threats.

These measures can only be challenged in court after they are applied, a process some affected individuals are now pursuing, with some success.

The powers were part of reinforced anti-terror legislation passed in 2017 when France was still reeling from attacks by al-Qaida and Daesh in 2015.

The attacks killed 147 people, including in Paris neighborhoods now bustling with Olympic visitors and near the Olympic stadium, which will host track and field and rugby sevens.

The anti-terror law allows the French interior minister to restrict an individual’s movements if there are “serious reasons” to believe they pose a grave security threat and have terror ties or sympathies.

The power being used to restrict people from the Olympics, known as “individual measures of administrative control and surveillance” (MICAS), allows the interior minister to enforce these restrictions without prior judicial approval.

Darmanin told reporters last week that “just under 200” of the more than 500 MICAS cases ordered this year remain in force during the Games.

These restrictions have been applied to individuals with “possible” extremist links who have served jail time, as well as others who weren’t sentenced but “represent a danger,” he said.

“We have evidence or very important suspicions that they are radicalized and could prepare an attack,” Darmanin said.

Paris Chief of Police Laurent Nunez described the widespread use of these restrictions as “extremely positive.”

“We must use the full range of legal and administrative tools at our disposal, which is what the interior minister asked for,” he said last week as he toured venues for Olympic table tennis, weightlifting, handball and volleyball.

“He asked us to tighten the net as we approached the Olympic Games, and that is what we did,” Nunez said.

The AP spoke to six lawyers representing about 20 people with restricted movements. Some understand the need for security measures during the Olympics, while others argue the powers are being applied too broadly.

The use of restrictions for the Olympics appears unprecedented in scope.

While over 500 people had their movements curtailed this year, and Darmanin says fewer than 200 remain restricted during the Games, this compares with 205 people subjected to MICAS restrictions in the first 26 months of the 2017 law’s implementation, according to a French Senate report from 2020.

“It’s directly connected to the Olympic Games,” said Paris attorney Margot Pugliese. She described the powers as “a horror” and “a total failure of the rule of law” because they can only be contested in court after application.

“It is a terribly dangerous tool whenever there is a repressive government,” Pugliese said.

Lawyers say some clients have no prior convictions and only tenuous links to suspected extremism. Of the lawyers interviewed by the AP, about half of their clients have immigrant backgrounds, mostly with family roots in North Africa.

Darmanin says minorities are not being singled out, and that people suspected of left- or right-wing extremism are under surveillance as well.

“What would the French people say, what would the world say, if people we suspect might carry out attacks, who are radicalized, are left free and then commit attacks?” he asked.

Paris attorney Antoine Ory has represented three people subject to MICAS restrictions ahead of the Olympics – two with no criminal records. One was born in Madagascar, and the other two are French-Algerian and French-Moroccan dual nationals.

One man, who completed a five-year sentence for terror-related offenses in 2021, including periods of semi-liberty and electronic monitoring, is now banned from leaving his northeastern suburb of Paris.

Ory claims that police intelligence used to justify restrictions for his two other clients was flimsy. He alleges that intelligence services targeted people based on outdated information, labeling them as threats just before the Games.

“It’s extremely abusive,” he said. “Two weeks before the Games, they come along and say, ‘You’re dangerous.'”

A week before the Olympic opening ceremony, Ory successfully overturned the MICAS order for his Madagascar-born client. A court southeast of Paris ruled that the Interior Ministry failed to prove the man was a terror risk and ordered the state to pay him 1,500 euros ($1,600).

A police intelligence note – seen by the AP – requesting movement restrictions and daily police check-ins for Amine from July 1 to the Sept. 8 closing of the Paralympics cited “the particularly serious threat he represents to public security and order, his adherence to radical Islam, and the specific context of the terrorist threat in the framework of the organization of the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games.”

The note referenced a TikTok video Amine posted on Oct. 10 of himself in front of the Eiffel Tower, lit in Israeli colors following the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel by Hamas.

Wearing a Deportivo Palestino shirt and a motorcycle helmet, Amine posted photos of himself making some gestures at the monument.

In hindsight, “it wasn’t the best idea I’ve ever had,” he acknowledged.

Amine said he was frustrated with the French authorities’ ban on pro-Palestinian protests. “It seemed like a lack of impartiality to me,” he said.

He also posted an image of himself pointing at his shirt badge and the Star of David illuminating the tower.

The intelligence services’ MICAS request described the raised finger as a sign of allegiance to Allah.

Amine says he was mimicking football players who raise fingers in celebration. “But when it’s them, it’s not a problem,” he said.

The police note also linked Amine to an account on the video-sharing app Rave, claiming the user posted decapitation images and “worrying comments” expressing a desire to join a terror group.

The note alleged that Amine “does not hide his anti-Zionist and homophobic positions.”

Amine told the AP that the Rave account isn’t his and that he reported identity theft to the police in May.

“I am not at all anti-Zionist, homophobic, or anything like that. All those ideas are alien to me,” Amine said.

The MICAS order – seen by the AP – that bars Amine from leaving his Paris suburb except for his daily police check-in warns that he risks three years in prison and a fine of 45,000 euros ($48,600) if he violates the restrictions or fails to check-in.

Stuck at home or nearby, Amine says each day feels the same. He can only watch the Paris Olympics on TV.

Despite the Olympic opening ceremony celebrating France’s freedoms, Amine feels that the promises of “liberte, egalite, fraternite” do not apply to him.

“I have neither liberty nor fraternity toward me,” he said."
