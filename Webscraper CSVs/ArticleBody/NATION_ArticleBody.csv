"Jenna Ellis, former Trump lawyer, will cooperate in Arizona election fraud case.",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/us/jenna-ellis-trump-arizona-election-fraud.html,"Jenna Ellis, a lawyer who played a major role in the efforts to keep Donald J. Trump in power after his 2020 election loss, reached a cooperation agreement on Monday as part of a deal with prosecutors leading an election interference case in Arizona.

She is the first of the 18 defendants in the case to reach such an agreement. Ms. Ellis already pleaded guilty to a felony last year in a similar case in Georgia. In Arizona, nine felony charges against her were dropped in exchange for her cooperation and an agreement to testify truthfully.

“This agreement represents a significant step forward in our case,” Kris Mayes, the Arizona attorney general, said in a statement. Referring to Ms. Ellis, she added: “Her insights are invaluable and will greatly aid the state in proving its case in court. As I stated when the initial charges were announced, I will not allow American democracy to be undermined — it is far too important.”

Ms. Ellis’s lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Democratic prosecutors in five states have brought criminal charges against Trump allies related to efforts to overturn the 2020 results, with the cases in Georgia and Arizona being the most expansive. Ms. Mayes brought charges in April, and a trial is not expected until next year at the earliest. In June, the Arizona defendants filed an initial challenge, seizing on a new state law aimed at curbing litigation and prosecutions involving political figures."
"Jenna Ellis, former Trump lawyer, will cooperate in Arizona election fraud case.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/05/jenna-ellis-arizona/,"PHOENIX — Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes (D) reached a cooperation agreement Monday with Jenna Ellis, who was a legal adviser to Donald Trump’s 2020 campaign and was one of 18 defendants indicted in April on felony charges related to alleged efforts to try to subvert President Biden’s victory in the state four years ago, according to prosecutors.

The attorney general has agreed to drop nine felony charges against Ellis in exchange for her full cooperation with the investigation into the GOP plan to try to deliver Arizona’s 11 electoral votes to Trump instead of the rightful winner, Biden.

The deal allows Ellis to avoid potential jail time in exchange for providing prosecutors with evidence that could implicate other defendants. She could provide information about former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani’s knowledge and participation in the elector strategy. According to the agreement, Ellis has also agreed to “completely and truthfully” testify in any future trials. She will also provide documents and any other material tied to the elector strategy that could help state prosecutors secure verdicts favorable to them in the high-profile case.

“This agreement represents a significant step forward in our case,” Mayes said in a statement. “I am grateful to Ms. Ellis for her cooperation with our investigation and prosecution. Her insights are invaluable and will greatly aid the State in proving its case in court.”

An attorney for Ellis did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Arizona was one of seven states won by Biden where Republican electors gathered on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign certificates purporting to affirm Trump as the actual winner of each of the states. Trump supporters were preparing to cite the paperwork signed by the GOP electors as a way to challenge Biden’s win when Congress convened on Jan. 6, 2021, according to prosecutors.

Authorities in several of those states, including Arizona, have pursued criminal charges against the electors. All of the defendants in the Arizona case pleaded not guilty, including the 11 Republicans who allegedly falsely purported Trump won the state, Giuliani and Boris Epshteyn, a key adviser to Trump’s 2020 and 2024 presidential campaigns. They are each charged with nine felony counts, including conspiracy, forgery and fraudulent schemes and artifices.

The Arizona case was the second round of charges for Ellis and several others in the case, who were also indicted alongside Trump in Georgia last year. Ellis pleaded guilty in October to illegally conspiring to overturn Trump’s 2020 election loss in Georgia and has been cooperating with prosecutors.

In Arizona, Ellis sat down with prosecutors on June 17 for a proffer session, according to the agreement — an interview in which a prosecutor and a defense lawyer meet with a person to decide whether they have valuable information to offer an investigation, the kind that could lead to a plea deal. Such meetings are often called “queen for a day” sessions because the person being questioned will not have their answers used against them, unless they lie.

In the critical time frame after Trump’s loss, Ellis was in touch with figures central to the elector strategy outside of Arizona and within, according to the April indictment and other publicly released records.

Ellis joined Giuliani, then a personal attorney to Trump, in presenting baseless claims of widespread malfeasance in states Trump lost. She accompanied Giuliani to Phoenix for a meeting, where unfounded claims of election fraud were circulated as Trump dialed in to speak to the crowd. Ellis was also by Giuliani’s side during a meeting with then-Arizona House Speaker Russell “Rusty” Bowers (R), who testified before the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack that Giuliani repeatedly sought to persuade him to help overturn Trump’s 10,457-vote defeat in the state.

“We’ve got lots of theories, we just don’t have the evidence,” Bowers recalled Giuliani telling him and others present."

Ellis signed the cooperation agreement Monday morning, according to the announcement, which said prosecutors are dropping the charges against her.

“This agreement represents a significant step forward in our case,” Mayes, a Democrat, said in a statement. “I am grateful to Ms. Ellis for her cooperation with our investigation and prosecution.

Ellis pleaded guilty last year in the Georgia election interference case in which Trump was also charged. She was Trump’s senior legal adviser from early 2019 until shortly after he left office in January 2021 and was part of the legal team that advised him as he sought to overturn the 2020 presidential election results.

Ellis and the rest of the Trump allies charged this year had pleaded not guilty after Mayes unveiled an indictment related to their involvement in a plan to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the state.

Ellis' cooperation agreement notes that she spoke with prosecutors on June 17. The day before, lead prosecutor Nicholas Klingerman told the media assembled outside a Phoenix courthouse that plea deals might be coming.

""I think, in any other, like any other case, that we’ll make plea offers,"" Klingerman said, adding that ""I have discussed the possibility"" of a plea offer with at least one of the defendants.

A month after the 2020 election, 11 Trump supporters convened at the Arizona GOP’s headquarters in Phoenix to sign a certificate claiming to be Arizona’s 11 electors to the Electoral College, though Joe Biden won the state by 10,457 votes and state officials certified his electors. The state Republican Party documented the signing of the certificate in a social media post and sent it to Congress and the National Archives.

Those accused of being “fake electors” and the others alleged to have been accomplices are charged with fraud, forgery, and conspiracy.

Speaking to Brahm Resnik of NBC affiliate KPNX of Phoenix on Friday, Mayes expressed optimism in her office’s ongoing prosecution of the “fake electors.”

“We’re making progress in the case, and we feel good about the case,” she said."

Former Trump lawyer and conservative media figure Jenna Ellis signed the agreement Monday morning.

""The State has agreed to drop the charges against Ms. Ellis in exchange for her cooperation with the prosecution,"" read a portion of a statement. ""Ms. Ellis had previously been charged with nine felonies including fraud, forgery and conspiracy.""

Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people charged in the case have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges - including Giuliani, Trump presidential chief of staff Mark Meadows and 11 Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring Trump had won Arizona.

""Her insights are invaluable and will greatly aid the State in proving its case in court,"" Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a statement. ""As I stated when the initial charges were announced, I will not allow American democracy to be undermined - it is far too important. Today's announcement is a win for the rule of law.""

The AG's Office notes the cases against the other 17 defendants remain ongoing.

""She’s got a lot of information,"" Mayes said. ""This is important information, and she has agreed to testify fully for us in our case.""

Prosecutors say Ellis was at the right hand of former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, helping spread false claims of election fraud in Arizona and six other states.

Last year, standing teary-eyed before the judge, she pleaded guilty in Georgia and said she looks back on that time with deep remorse.

Ellis' attorney said in a statement, ""We are grateful the Arizona Attorney General's Office completely dismissed the indictment against Jenna Ellis as she was not involved in the so-called 'fake elector' scheme. Jenna was originally told she was not a target and her cooperation is her continued willingness to tell the truth.""

In 2023, Ellis was charged in Georgia after she appeared with Giuliani at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers at the Georgia Capitol, during which false allegations of election fraud were made. She had pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings. After her guilty plea in Georgia, Ellis was barred from practicing law in Colorado for three years.

While not a fake elector in Arizona, prosecutors say Ellis made false claims of widespread election fraud in the state and six others, encouraged the Arizona Legislature to change the outcome of the election and encouraged then-Vice President Mike Pence to accept Arizona's fake elector votes.

The indictment said Ellis, Giuliani and other associates were at a meeting at the Arizona Legislature on Dec. 1, 2020, with then-House Speaker Rusty Bowers and other Republicans when Giuliani and his team asked the speaker to hold a committee hearing on the election.

When Bowers asked for proof of election fraud, Giuliani said he had proof, but Ellis had advised that it was left back at a hotel room, the indictment said. No proof was provided to Bowers.

Aug. 5 (UPI) -- Donald Trump's former campaign lawyer Jenna Ellis has reached a deal with prosecutors in Arizona's 2020 election subversion case to testify against other defendants in exchange for her charges being dropped. The Arizona attorney general's office announced Monday that it was dropping nine felony charges against Ellis in exchange for her cooperation. Advertisement

""I am grateful to Ms. Ellis for her cooperation with our investigation and prosecution,"" Mayes said. ""Her insights are invaluable and will greatly aid the state in proving its case in court.""

Ellis was originally charged and pleaded not guilty to nine felony counts in Maricopa County that included fraud, forgery and conspiracy in Arizona's so-called fake electors case to overturn the 2020 election results.

According to a copy of her cooperation deal, released by officials in Arizona, Ellis has agreed to provide information to law enforcement and testify ""completely and truthfully at any time and any place"" while vowing not to ""protect any person or entity"" through false information or omissions. The agreement also shows Ellis sat for a recorded proffer session in June with the attorney general's office.

Ellis was one of eighteen people indicted by Mayes' office over alleged efforts to overturn the presidential election results in Arizona. Ellis was accused of pressuring Arizona state lawmakers to overturn the results in favor of Trump, and urging former Vice President Mike Pence to accept fake electors instead of the actual elector votes cast for President Joe Biden.

Former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows were also indicted, while Trump was not charged in the case.

This is the second time Ellis has agreed to cooperate. She pleaded guilty in Georgia's election case and was sentenced to five years probation and $5,000 in restitution.

Former Trump campaign attorney Jenna Ellis has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in Arizona in their criminal cases against so-called fake electors and others who tried to reverse the 2020 election loss of former President Donald Trump, state Attorney General Kris Mayes said Monday.

Prosecutors are dropping the nine felony counts that Ellis had faced — including fraud, forgery and conspiracy — in exchange for her cooperation against the remaining 17 defendants in the case.

""This agreement represents a significant step forward in our case,"" Mayes said in a statement. ""I am grateful to Ms. Ellis for her cooperation with our investigation and prosecution.""

""Her insights are invaluable and will greatly aid the State in proving its case in court,"" the attorney general said. ""As I stated when the initial charges were announced, I will not allow American democracy to be undermined — it is far too important. Today's announcement is a win for the rule of law.""

The remaining defendants in the case include disgraced lawyer Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who worked closely with Ellis after the 2020 election in the doomed, botched effort to undo Trump's loss to President Joe Biden.

Also charged are former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, lawyers John Eastman, Boris Epshteyn and Christina Bobb, and Mike Roman, who had led Election Day operations for the Trump campaign in 2020.

The remaining defendants are the 11 Trump supporters accused of being fake electors: Kelli Ward, Tyler Bowyer, Nancy Cottle, Jacob Hoffman, Anthony Kern, James Lamon, Robert Montgomery, Samuel Moorhead, Lorraine Pellegrino, Gregory Safsten, and Michael Ward.

The Arizona indictment alleges that Ellis and other Trump allies were part of a scheme in which these 11 defendants claimed to be electors from Arizona to the 2020 Electoral College and cast their ballots for Trump, despite Biden having won the state's popular vote.

Ellis posted a statement on social media platform X from her lawyers, Matt Brown and Matt Melito, after her cooperation became public.

""We are grateful the Arizona Attorney General's Office completely dismissed the indictment against Jenna Ellis as she was not involved in the so-called 'fake elector' scheme,"" the statement said. ""Jenna was originally told she was not a target and her cooperation is her continued willingness to tell the truth.""

As part of the agreement, Ellis must testify ""completely and truthfully"" whenever requested by the Attorney General's Office and be available for interviews by attorneys and law enforcement.

Ellis in October 2023 pleaded guilty to a separate criminal charge in the Georgia election interference case, which charges Trump and more than a dozen of his allies with crimes related to trying to overturn his loss to Biden in that state.

A Georgia appeals court in June put the case against Trump and eight of his co-defendants on hold while it considers Trump's bid to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from overseeing his prosecution.

After Ellis pleaded guilty in Georgia, officials in Colorado banned Ellis from practicing law in the state for three years. Giuliani in July was disbarred in New York, and his license remains under review in Washington, D.C., as a result of the false claims of widespread ballot fraud that he made with Ellis after the 2020 election."

Former Donald Trump 2020 campaign lawyer Jenna Ellis has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in the Arizona election subversion case, the state’s attorney general announced Monday, and charges against her will be dropped.

Ellis is expected to cooperate with prosecutors and testify against other defendants in the criminal case as part of her deal. She was originally charged with multiple felony counts in Arizona related to her alleged role in the effort to put forward fake slates of electors as part of a broader conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election results on Trump’s behalf.

Last year, Ellis pleaded guilty in the Georgia election case and was sentenced to five years of probation and $5,000 in restitution. Ellis was charged alongside several Trump allies, including his former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Rudy Giuliani in both Arizona and Georgia. Meadows and Giuliani have pleaded not guilty in both cases.

“If I knew then what I know now, I would have declined to represent Donald Trump in these post-election challenges. I look back on this experience with deep remorse,” Ellis said in a statement after her guilty plea in Georgia.

The charges in Arizona focus on Trump’s close allies who prosecutors say conspired to overturn the election results and 11 fake Republican electors who acted as pro-Trump electors despite his loss in the state.

Prosecutors alleged that Ellis worked closely with other defendants to spread false claims about widespread voter fraud in Arizona and six other states.

She also encouraged the Arizona state legislature to overturn the election results and tried to convince then-Vice President Mike Pence to accept the false elector certificates on January 6, 2021, the charging document says.

Trump was not charged in the Arizona case but was named as “Unindicted Coconspirator 1” in the original indictment. Trump was charged in the election conspiracy case in Georgia and pleaded not guilty."

Prosecutors have already asked a court to dismiss the Arizona charges against Ellis. It wasn’t immediately clear if a judge had yet approved the request.

The Associated Press left messages with Ellis’ attorney, Matthew Brown, after the agreement was announced Monday.

While not a fake elector in Arizona, prosecutors say Ellis made false claims of widespread election fraud in the state and six others, encouraged the Arizona Legislature to change the outcome of the election and encouraged then-Vice President Mike Pence to accept Arizona’s fake elector votes.

When Bowers asked for proof of election fraud, Giuliani said he had proof but Ellis had advised that it was left back at a hotel room, the indictment said. No proof was provided to Bowers.

Ellis also is barred from practicing law in Colorado for three years after her guilty plea in Georgia.

Prosecutors in Michigan, Nevada, Georgia and Wisconsin have also filed criminal charges related to the fake electors scheme.

Arizona authorities unveiled the felony charges in late April. Overall, charges were brought against 11 Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring Trump had won Arizona, five lawyers connected to the former president and two former Trump aides. President Joe Biden won Arizona by 10,457 votes.

Trump himself was not charged in the Arizona case but was referred to as an unindicted co-conspirator in the indictment.

The 11 people who claimed to be Arizona’s Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were “duly elected and qualified” electors and asserting that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.

The individuals charged in the case had all previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges.

Mayes noted that the case against the other 17 defendants remains ongoing.

Prosecutors alleged that Ellis, while not one of the fake electors herself, did peddle claims of widespread election fraud in the state, encouraged the state legislature to overturn the election result and urged former Vice President Mike Pence to participate in the fake electors plot.

Last year, Ellis was charged in the Georgia 2020 election case and reached a deal with prosecutors allowing her to plead guilty to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings in exchange for her cooperation.

Ellis’ deal with Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis recommended a sentence of five years of probation, $5,000 in restitution, and 100 hours of community service in exchange for having no contact with the media or co-defendants (which includes Trump) and cooperating and testifying at other trials in the sprawling racketeering and influence case."

PHOENIX — Donald Trump lawyer Jenna Ellis will cooperate in Arizona's ""fake electors"" investigation, Attorney General Kris Mayes announced Monday.

Ellis has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for all nine felony charges being dropped, Mayes said in a news release. Ellis struck a plea deal last year in a similar Georgia case.

On last weekend's ""Sunday Square Off,"" Mayes had revealed that one of the 18 defendants in the case was going to flip, and that the announcement was planned for this week.

She also stuck to a previous forecast that the first trial in the case would come next year.

Ellis, a former Trump legal adviser, allegedly worked with Rudy Giuliani on a pressure campaign to reverse Arizona's 2020 presidential election results.

In the Georgia case, Ellis agreed to plead guilty last year in exchange for a sentence of five years probation.

Ellis told the Fulton County, Ga., court that she had ""failed to do my due diligence"" in other states.

“If I knew then what I know now, I would have declined to represent Donald Trump in these post-election challenges,"" Ellis told the court. ""I look back on this full experience with deep remorse.”

Arizona is one of five battleground states where criminal charges have been filed in similar fake elector schemes after the 2020 presidential election.

The Arizona indictments handed up in May, allege the state's 11 Republican electors and seven Trump allies engaged in an illegal scheme to falsely put forward the electors as duly chosen by Arizona voters.

The goal was to block Congress' certification of Democrat Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential election.

The 17 remaining defendants - including former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani; former Trump Chief of Staff Mark Meadows; and former Arizona Republican Party chair Kelli Ward - have entered not-guilty pleas.

Each defendant was charged with the same nine felony counts of fraud, forgery and conspiracy.

At least three defendants have filed motions to dismiss the charges.

Two of the defendants - state Sens. Anthony Kern and Jake Hoffman - were on the July 31 Arizona primary ballot.

Kern finished fifth in the six-candidate Republican primary in the West Valley's Eighth Congressional District.

Hoffman was unopposed in his state Senate primary for a safe Republican seat in the East Valley."

Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, announced the deal on Monday, sharing a legal agreement that shows Ellis agreed to sit for interviews and turn over documents related to the scheme. The agreement also calls on Ellis to “testify completely and truthfully at any time and any place requested by the Arizona attorney general’s office”.

In exchange, Ellis will avoid potential jail time for her role in the scheme.

“This agreement represents a significant step forward in our case,” Mayes said in a statement. “I am grateful to Ms Ellis for her cooperation with our investigation and prosecution. Her insights are invaluable and will greatly aid the state in proving its case in court.”

In Arizona, 18 people were charged – the 11 people who falsely attested that Trump had won the state’s electors, and seven others from Trump’s circle who helped coordinate the scheme.

Ellis previously pleaded guilty in Georgia to one count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings in that state’s election subversion case. Her plea deal in Georgia resulted in five years’ probation, a fine and community service in exchange for cooperating with prosecutors. Her plea came quickly after two others pleaded guilty in the case, and she subsequently had her law license suspended.

Documents filed in the Arizona case cite the Georgia plea agreement, saying that it was “in the interest of justice” for the judge to accept the Arizona deal because it comes from “the same conspiracy charged in this case”.

Ellis, and the others indicted in the Arizona case, faced nine felony charges related to fraud, forgery and conspiracy. All pleaded not guilty.

Arizona prosecutors will drop nine felony charges against Donald Trump’s former attorney Jenna Ellis in exchange for her cooperation in a sweeping election interference case.

Ellis, who reached a plea deal with prosecutors in Georgia in a similar case last year, was also among 18 defendants in an investigation into a Republican-backed plan to subvert Joe Biden’s 2020 victory in Arizona and deliver the state’s 11 electoral college votes to Trump instead.

“This agreement represents a significant step forward in our case,” Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a statement on Monday.

“I am grateful to Ms Ellis for her cooperation with our investigation and prosecution. Her insights are invaluable and will greatly aid the State in proving its case in court,” Mayes added. “As I stated when the initial charges were announced, I will not allow American democracy to be undermined — it is far too important. Today’s announcement is a win for the rule of law.”

Ellis has also agreed to “completely and truthfully” testify in any future trials, according to the agreement.

That testimony could be crucial in the case against Trump’s former personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, who prosecutors have linked to several critical moments surrounding a spurious effort to overturn the state’s election results as part of a nationwide campaign to reverse Trump’s loss in swing states that Biden won.

Jenna Ellis, who reached a plea deal with prosecutors in Georgia, agreed to cooperate in a similar election interference case in Georgia on August 5 ( AP )

According to prosecutors, Ellis joined Giuliani in Phoenix for a post-election meeting to share false claims about voter fraud, as Trump himself dialed in to speak.

Ellis also joined Giuliani for a meeting with then-Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers, who would go on to testify to the House select committee investigating events surrounding January 6. In that testimony, Bowers claimed that Giuliani had pushed him to overturn Trump’s 10,457-vote defeat in the state.

Defendants in the Arizona case include former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, a former state GOP chair, two sitting state lawmakers, and a former US Senate candidate.

They have all pleaded not guilty.

Arizona is among four states where prosecutors have filed criminal charges against so-called fake electors and others who used false claims about voter fraud to promote an effort to throw out results.

In June, a judge in Nevada dismissed the state’s case against six fake electors on procedural grounds, marking the first time that a case related to Trump’s attempts to reject election results had been dismissed.

Similar cases are underway in Michigan and Wisconsin, while another case in Georgia is hung up on appeals to determine whether the chief prosecutor — Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis — should be disqualified."

Seventeen other people charged in the case have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges — including Giuliani, Trump presidential chief of staff Mark Meadows and 11 Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring Trump had won Arizona.

“Her insights are invaluable and will greatly aid the State in proving its case in court,” Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a statement. “As I stated when the initial charges were announced, I will not allow American democracy to be undermined — it is far too important. Today’s announcement is a win for the rule of law.”

Eleven people who had been nominated to be Arizona’s Republican electors had met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were “duly elected and qualified” electors and claimed Trump had carried the state in the 2020 election. President Joe Biden won Arizona by 10,457 votes.

A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.

Last year, Ellis was charged in Georgia after she appeared with Giuliani at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers at the Georgia Capitol during which false allegations of election fraud were made. She had pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings. The cooperation agreement signed by Ellis in the Arizona case requires her to provide truthful information to the Attorney General’s Office and testify honestly in proceedings in any state or federal court. Prosecutors can withdraw from the deal and refile charges if Ellis violates the agreement.

Prosecutors have already asked a court to dismiss the Arizona charges against Ellis. It wasn’t immediately clear if a judge had yet approved the request.

The Associated Press left messages with Ellis’ attorney, Matthew Brown, after the agreement was announced Monday. Mel McDonald, a retired lawyer and former Arizona U.S. Attorney and judge in metro Phoenix, said cooperation agreements like the one signed by Ellis are common in Arizona state courts and are typically given to insiders who can explain how a crime unfolded.

“You need someone who is part of it to fill in the blanks,” said McDonald, who isn’t involved in the Arizona case.

While not a fake elector in Arizona, prosecutors say Ellis made false claims of widespread election fraud in the state and six others, encouraged the Arizona Legislature to change the outcome of the election and encouraged then-Vice President Mike Pence to accept Arizona’s fake elector votes.

The indictment said Ellis, Giuliani and other associates were at a meeting at the Arizona Legislature on Dec. 1, 2020, with then-House Speaker Rusty Bowers and other Republicans when Giuliani and his team asked the speaker to hold a committee hearing on the election.

When Bowers asked for proof of election fraud, Giuliani said he had proof but Ellis had advised that it was left back at a hotel room, the indictment said. No proof was provided to Bowers.

Ellis also is barred from practicing law in Colorado for three years after her guilty plea in Georgia.

Prosecutors in Michigan, Nevada, Georgia and Wisconsin have also filed criminal charges related to the fake electors scheme.

Arizona authorities unveiled the felony charges in late April. Overall, charges were brought against 11 Republicans who submitted the document falsely declaring Trump had won Arizona, five lawyers connected to the former president and two former Trump aides.

Trump himself was not charged in the Arizona case but was referred to as an unindicted co-conspirator in the indictment.

"Jenna Ellis, former Trump lawyer, will cooperate in Arizona election fraud case.",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/state/3111473/jenna-ellis-agrees-cooperate-arizona-elector-case/,"Former Trump lawyer Jenna Ellis has agreed to cooperate with authorities to avoid prison time by providing evidence in Arizona’s “fake electors” case surrounding the 2020 election.

Ellis provided legal counsel to former President Donald Trump 2020 campaign. The lawyer was one of 18 defendants indicted earlier this year for disputing the results of the 2020 election in Arizona. Trump was not among those charged.

Democratic state Attorney General Kris Mayes announced Monday that Ellis agreed to cooperate with the investigation into the electors case. The case surrounds Republicans who have been accused of unlawfully attempting to deliver the state’s 11 electoral votes to Trump after the battleground race was called for President Joe Biden.

Arizona’s 2020 race between Trump and Biden was one of the closest in the country. Many major networks, including NBC, held off on calling the state for Biden until nine days after Election Day, with final tallies showing Trump lost by under 11,000 votes.

Trump disputed the election results, telling supporters the following January, “In the state of Arizona, over 36,000 ballots were illegally cast by non-citizens. Two thousand ballots were returned with no address.”

No evidence has been found to back up his claims.

In December 2020, 11 Republicans concerned with alleged voter fraud gathered in Arizona’s capitol and signed a document claiming Trump had won the state. They said they were “duly elected and qualified” electors and sent the document to Congress.

Ellis was not one of the electors but was later indicted on charges of aiding their efforts to overturn the Arizona presidential election. The lawyer worked closely with Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s former personal attorney, who was also indicted in the Arizona election case, to make the case that the GOP leader had legally won the battleground state.

Prosecutors are dropping nine charges against her, Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a statement, in a case where 18 Republicans have been charged in a scheme to try snatch away the state's 11 electoral votes and award them to Donald Trump in the 2020 election.

Ellis was a prominent Trump campaign attorney, and famously accompanied former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani as he made claims of election fraud in a series of states Trump was contesting.

Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case, the state AG's office announced Monday.

She has agreed to testify 'completely and truthfully' and will provide documents and evidence as needed.

Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people charged in the case have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges - including Giuliani, Trump presidential chief of staff Mark Meadows and 11 Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring Trump had won Arizona.

Former Trump campaign attorney Jenna Ellis has reached a cooperation agreement with Arizona prosecutors. Last year she pleaded guilty to charges in Georgia, where former President Donald Trump and alleged coconspirators are charged

The cooperation deal allows her to avoid jail time. She pleaded guilty in the Georgia election interference case which also involved an alleged scheme involving 'fake' electors. Joe Biden carried both states.

'Her insights are invaluable and will greatly aid the State in proving its case in court,' Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a statement. 'As I stated when the initial charges were announced, I will not allow American democracy to be undermined - it is far too important. Today´s announcement is a win for the rule of law.'

She had pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings. She made a tearful statement inside the courtroom while entering her plea.

While not a fake elector in Arizona, prosecutors say Ellis made false claims of widespread election fraud in the state and six others, encouraged the Arizona Legislature to change the outcome of the election and encouraged then-Vice President Mike Pence to accept Arizona´s fake elector votes.

The indictment said Ellis, Giuliani and other associates were at a meeting at the Arizona Legislature on Dec. 1, 2020, with then-House Speaker Rusty Bowers and other Republicans when Giuliani and his team asked the speaker to hold a committee hearing on the election.

When Bowers asked for proof of election fraud, Giuliani said he had proof but Ellis had advised that it was left back at a hotel room, the indictment said. No proof was provided to Bowers.

Ellis also is barred from practicing law in Colorado for three years after her guilty plea in Georgia.

Prosecutors in Michigan, Nevada, Georgia and Wisconsin have also filed criminal charges related to the fake electors scheme.

Ellis posted a statement by her lawyers, Matt Brown and Matt Melito. 'We are grateful the Arizona Attorney General’s Office completely dismissed the indictment against Jenna Ellis as she was not involved in the so-called ‘fake elector’ scheme. Jenna was originally told she was not a target and her cooperation is her continued willingness to tell the truth,' they said.

Arizona authorities unveiled the felony charges in late April.

The onetime pro-Donald Trump attorney signed a cooperation agreement on Monday morning in exchange for the state agreeing to dismiss the four pending felony charges against her, according to a press release issued by Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes.

“This agreement represents a significant step forward in our case,” Mayes said in a statement. “I am grateful to Ms. Ellis for her cooperation with our investigation and prosecution. Her insights are invaluable and will greatly aid the State in proving its case in court. As I stated when the initial charges were announced, I will not allow American democracy to be undermined — it is far too important. Today’s announcement is a win for the rule of law.”

In April, the fake electors were indicted along with attorneys Ellis, Rudy Giuliani, Boris Epshteyn, Christina Bobb, and John Eastman — though the names beyond those of the fake electors were redacted in the original indictment. Also indicted were erstwhile Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Trump 2020 campaign aide Mike Roman, who face similar election subversion charges in Georgia.

Ellis, for her part, was charged with one count of conspiracy, two counts of fraudulent schemes and artifices, and six counts of forgery in the Grand Canyon State. She previously pleaded guilty to one election subversion-related charge in the Peach State.

Efforts to subvert the results of the 2020 election in Arizona election included multiple failed lawsuits. Those lawsuits were predicated on an effort to have the GOP-controlled state legislature declare the results invalid and then, later, appoint a slate of electors who would vote for Trump — instead of the actual winner, President Joe Biden.

While the lawsuits and the legislature did not help the effort, the fake electors met anyway — and, to much fanfare and attention, publicly signed a document holding themselves out as legitimate electors. The pageantry was documented, and broadcast, as “The Signing” on the Arizona GOP’s social media accounts.

The full indictment, included as an exhibit to a motion to dismiss Ellis’ charges without prejudice, takes stock of the role she played in the alleged scheme — noting her at-the-time close work with Giuliani.

“She made false claims of widespread election fraud in Arizona and six other states,” the indictment reads. “[She] encouraged the Arizona Legislature to change the outcome of the election. She also encouraged Pence to accept the false Arizona Republican electors’ votes on January 6, 2021.”

The indictment sketches out some more of Ellis’ conduct:

On December 1, 2020, GIULIANI (012) held a meeting at the Arizona Legislature with three associates, including JENNA ELLIS (015). Also present at the meeting were several Republican legislators, including [State House Speaker Rusell “Rusty”] Bowers. GIULIANI (012) and his team asked Bowers to hold a committee hearing on the election. When Bowers asked for any proof of election fraud, GIULIANI (012) said he had proof, but ELLIS (015) that it was left back in the hotel room. Bowers left the meeting shortly thereafter. The alleged proof was never provided to Bowers.

The indictment alleged that Ellis was supposed to take part in a conference call about the electors’ signing efforts. That conference call was specifically intended to address how several members of Trump’s campaign — including at least one attorney — refused to endorse the fake electors scheme.

In June, Ellis sat down with prosecutors at length during a so-called “proffer” or “free talk” and discussed what she knew about the case — and how her knowledge and files might help the state.

“As part of the free talk agreement, the Attorney General’s Office had agreed to evaluate in good faith whether cooperation is in the State’s best interest,” the cooperation agreement reads. “In doing so, the Attorney General’s Office has determined that cooperation is in its best interest.”

Ellis previously faced nine felony counts including fraud, forgery and conspiracy, but in exchange for her cooperation, the charges were dismissed.

In a statement, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes called the agreement a “significant step forward” in the case.

“I am grateful to Ms. Ellis for her cooperation with our investigation and prosecution,” Mayes said. “Her insights are invaluable and will greatly aid the State in proving its case in court. As I stated when the initial charges were announced, I will not allow American democracy to be undermined — it is far too important. Today’s announcement is a win for the rule of law.”

As part of the deal, Ellis agreed to testify “completely and truthfully at any time and any place,” including at a criminal trial. She also vowed not to “protect any person or entity” through false information or omissions.

Ex-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Rudy Giuliani are among the 17 total defendants with remaining charges; they were indicted in April and have pleaded not guilty.

Trump himself is not charged in the case but is described as “unindicted co-conspirator 1.”

Ellis’s charges stemmed from her false claims of election fraud and efforts to pressure the Arizona Legislature into overturning the state’s election results in Trump’s favor.

She was also accused of encouraging then-Vice President Pence to accept slates of fake electors instead of the true electoral votes cast for President Biden. Biden won Arizona by 10,457 votes.

The former Trump campaign lawyer faced charges in Georgia for pushing the fake electors scheme and conspiring to help Trump remain in the White House after losing the 2020 presidential election, too, but later agreed to cooperate with state prosecutors. She pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.

In remarks made after changing her plea to guilty in that case, she said through tears that she would have declined to represent Trump after the election if she “knew then what I know now.”

Ellis’s law license was suspended for three years in Colorado over her role in efforts to overturn the election.

Prosecutors in Michigan, Wisconsin and Nevada have also filed criminal charges related to the fake electors scheme, though the Nevada case was dismissed in June. State prosecutors have appealed that decision.

Jenna Ellis was one of several attorneys who unsuccessfully worked on behalf of former President Donald Trump to invalidate his election loss.

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes announced that all nine felony charges against Ellis will be dropped in exchange for her cooperation.

“This agreement represents a significant step forward in our case,” Mayes said in a statement. “I am grateful to Ms. Ellis for her cooperation with our investigation and prosecution. Her insights are invaluable and will greatly aid the State in proving its case in court. As I stated when the initial charges were announced, I will not allow American democracy to be undermined – it is far too important. Today’s announcement is a win for the rule of law.”

Seventeen defendants remain under indictment on various charges of conspiracy, forgery, and fraud.

A month after the 2020 election, 11 Trump electors met in Phoenix and signed a certificate stating that he was the lawful winner of the state’s 11 electoral votes, even though President Joe Biden won the state.

In the weeks following the election, the former president falsely claimed the election had been rigged against him. He initiated an unprecedented pressure campaign on Republican officials in states he lost to try to get them to overturn their results.

Ellis has also been indicted in Georgia over a similar scheme in which Trump has also been charged. Ellis pleaded guilty while Trump pleaded not guilty.

In May, Ellis agreed to a three-year suspension of her Colorado law license.

“If I knew then what I know now, I would have declined to represent Donald Trump in these post-election challenges,” she said at the time.

Ellis--who, in full disclosure, blocked me on Twitter in 2020--worked so closely with Rudy Giuliani that he gave her COVID-19. She'll now be cooperating with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in the fake electors scheme.

She was charged in Georgia after she appeared with Giuliani at a December 2020 hearing in the Georgia Capitol conducted by state Republican lawmakers, during which she made false allegations of election. She had pleaded guilty in October 2023 to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.

Ellis had previously pleaded Not Guilty to fraud, forgery, and a conspiracy charge in the Arizona case.

Seventeen other people charged in the case have also pleaded not guilty to the felony charges — including Giuliani, Trump's former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, and 11 Republicans who each submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring Trump had won Arizona in the 2020 election.

Months later, we learned that she was very sincere about this: An Arizona grand jury indicted 18 people in April — 11 voter fraud and seven Donald Trump assistants.

The defendants included several high-profile names, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Trump’s former lawyer. Jenna Ellis.

Today one of them turned. NBC News reported:

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes’ office announced Monday that Jenna Ellis, a former Trump attorney and one of 18 defendants in the Arizona “fake voters” case stemming from the 2020 election, is cooperating with prosecutors. Ellis signed the cooperation agreement Monday morning, the announcement said, stating that prosecutors are dropping the charges against her.

The good news for Ellis is that she no longer faces nine felony charges, and she no longer has to worry about ending up behind bars. The good news for prosecutors is that they now have a cooperating witness with important insights to share about the underlying election plot.

If these circumstances sound familiar, it’s not your imagination. It was last fall that Ellis pleaded guilty in Georgia to aiding and abetting false statements. The attorney expressed what she described as “deep remorse” for her misconduct, adding that she should not have represented the former president in the case in the first place.

As part of her deal, the former Team Trump attorney agreed, among other things, to provide evidence to Georgia prosecutors. And as it turns out, she had information she wanted to share.

It makes sense that prosecutors in Arizona would hope to take advantage of a similar arrangement.

There are legal experts who can speak more authoritatively on this than I, but recent history suggests that after one suspect goes belly up, others often follow. With that in mind, Ellis may be the first person to go belly up in the Arizona case, but there’s no reason to believe she’ll be the last.

As for Ellis’ broader trajectory, the attorney has followed an unusual path. It may seem like ancient history, but she was no Trump fan during the 2016 campaign. As regular readers may recall, the Republican attorney repeatedly referred to the then-candidate as an “idiot,” adding that she considered him an “unethical, corrupt, lying, criminal, dirty scumbag.” Ellis even took aim at Trump’s supporters, saying they didn’t care about “facts or logic.”

She later changed her mind. Despite her rhetorical record, Ellis joined Trump’s legal team and became a rather enthusiastic proponent not only of her client’s lies about his 2020 defeat, but also of radical tactics that would allow the then-president to remain in office despite the election results.

Last year she came around and declared, “I simply cannot support him for elected office again.” Ellis added, “The reason I have chosen to step away is because of that downright malignant narcissistic tendency to simply say he has never done anything wrong.”

If Trump goes after Ellis through his social media platform, at least we know why.

"Tropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia.",https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-debby-flooding-storm-surge-high-winds-eb9fc50d578826784824f35ba943a6da,"HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida on Monday with torrential rain and high winds, contributing to at least four deaths in the state and the rescue of hundreds from flooded homes before turning menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard’s low-lying regions and threatening to flood some of America’s most historic Southern cities.

Record-setting rain was causing flash flooding, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) possible in some areas, the National Hurricane Center said.

About 500 people were rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said in a social media post. It was one of the cities hardest hit by flooding on Monday.

“Essentially we’ve had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,” Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said in a social media update.

Just north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.

“We are facing an unprecedented weather event with Hurricane Debby,” said Jodie Fiske, public safety director for Manatee County public. “The safety of our residents is our top priority, and we are doing everything in our power to respond effectively to this crisis.”

A flash flood emergency was issued into Monday evening for the Lake City area in the north central part of the state, where up to a foot (30.5 centimeters) of rain had fallen and more was expected.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that the state could continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.

“It is a very saturating, wet storm,” he said during an afternoon briefing at the state’s emergency operations center. “When they crest and the water that’s going to come down from Georgia, it’s just something that we’re going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.”

Debby made landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It since has weakened to a tropical storm and is moving slowly, covering roads with water and contributing to at least five deaths.

A truck driver died on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff’s office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet (12 meters) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.

A 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, according to the Levy County Sheriff’s Office.

And in Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night. The Florida Highway Patrol said a 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries.

In southern Georgia, a 19-year-old man died Monday afternoon when a large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

Nearly 200,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.

AP AUDIO: Hurricane Debby makes landfall in Florida as Category 1 storm and threatens catastrophic flooding AP correspondent Donna Warder reports, Florida is getting ready for Hurricane Debby.

Airports were also affected. More than 1,600 flights had been canceled nationwide, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com.

The potential for high water also threatened Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina.

Local leaders in Savannah said flooding could happen in areas that don’t usually get high water if Debby stalls out over the city. With winds and rainfall expected to worsen overnight, authorities issued a curfew from 10 p.m. Monday until 6 a.m. Tuesday.

“This type of rain hovering over us, coming with the intensity that they tell us it is coming, it’s going to catch a whole lot of people by surprise,” said Chatham County Chairman Chester Ellis.

In South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a “historic and potentially unprecedented event” three times in a 90-second briefing Monday morning.

The city of Charleston has an emergency plan in place that includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding. Officials announced a curfew for the city starting at 11 p.m. as some of the heaviest rain is expected to fall overnight.

North Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Gov. Roy Cooper declared it in an executive order signed Monday. Several areas along the state’s coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks, according to the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program.

North Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.

In 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding. In 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.

President Joe Biden was briefed on Debby’s progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said. Biden approved a request from South Carolina’s governor for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said he has asked Biden to issue a preemptive federal emergency declaration to speed the flow of federal aid to the state.

Vice President Kamala Harris has postponed a campaign stop scheduled for Thursday in Savannah, Georgia.

Debby made landfall near Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida of less than 1,000 residents. It’s not far from where Hurricane Idalia made landfall less than a year ago as a Category 3 storm.

Sue Chewning lives in nearby Cross City and has weathered both storms. In her nearly 73 years of living in the area, she said she doesn’t recall any direct hits from a hurricane — until this one-two punch from Idalia and Debby.

“Some people may say, ‘I can’t take this anymore’. But I think for the most part … it’s a close-knit community and most of the local people, they’re going to stay, dig down, help each other,” Chewning said.

Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with catastrophic flooding and was blamed for at least four deaths, with Georgia and South Carolina next in line as the system rips across the southeastern United States.

Record-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina, and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches of rainfall in some areas, the National Hurricane Center said. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over the Gulf coast of Florida.

The tropical storm was moving slowly, covering roads with water and contributing to at least four deaths.

More than 300,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.

“When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that’s hazardous,” DeSantis said. “Don’t try to drive through this. We don’t want to see traffic fatalities adding up.”

Airports were also affected. More than 1,600 flights had been canceled nationwide, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday. Nearly 30% of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport were canceled.

Sarasota, a Florida beach city popular with tourists, was one of the hardest hit by flooding.

“Essentially we’ve had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,” said Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun in a social media update.

The storm made landfall early Monday morning near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of fewer than 1,000 residents in northern Florida.

Taylor County, where Steinhatchee is located, closed several roads because of flooding or downed trees and power lines, Sheriff Wayne Padgett said. He advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying or coastal areas to wait before returning to their homes because the tide had not come in, and it was unclear how deep floodwaters might get later.

Looking out over the Steinhatchee River from the condo above the marina he operates, Chris Williams said he was glad the damage wasn’t worse. He said his power went out about 5:30 a.m. Monday as the storm was washing ashore, jamming the dock-studded riverfront with tree debris and barrels.

The small community is roughly 20 miles from where Hurricane Idalia crashed ashore less than a year ago.

“Two in less than a year is pretty bad,” Williams said. “You do everything you can possibly do to prepare. And when you’ve done that, clean up and put it back together and move forward.”

Debby is the fourth named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season after Tropical Storm Alberto, Hurricane Beryl and Tropical Storm Chris, all of which formed in June. In the Eastern Pacific, tropical storms Carlotta, Daniel and Emilia all churned over the ocean, but they weren’t threatening land.

President Biden was briefed on Debby’s progress while at his home in Wilmington, Del., the White House said.

Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign said her planned stop in Savannah, Ga., on Thursday was being put off because of the storm.

On Monday, officials in Savannah said flooding could happen in areas that don’t usually get high water if Debby stalls over the city.

In Savannah, Jim Froncak piled sandbags into his pickup truck on Monday as rain was already falling. He said a recent thunderstorm caused so much flooding that he and a friend were able to kayak down a street.

“That was just a thunderstorm,” he said. “So, who knows what could happen with this?”

Torrential, flooding rainfall is the biggest threat Debby poses to the Southeast and it’ll last for much of the week.

A rare high risk, level 4 of 4, of flooding rainfall is in place Monday from northern Florida to far southern South Carolina. High risks are issued on fewer than 4% of days per year on average, but are responsible for 83% of all flood-related damage and 39% of all flood-related deaths, research from the Weather Prediction Center shows.

Tuesday, that high risk area will focus from southeastern Georgia to much of eastern South Carolina.

“Expect a widespread 4 to 8 inches of rain with locally higher amounts just during (Tuesday),” the Weather Prediction Center warned. “There will likely be numerous instances of significant to catastrophic flooding for both rural and urban areas along with rising streams.”

CNN Weather

The flood threat for Florida will only diminish slightly Tuesday and remain quite concerning.

“Due to the likely hard hit nature of this area by Tuesday, even smaller amounts of rain are likely to result in outsized impacts,” the WPC warned.

Flood threats could become even more dire for parts of Georgia and South Carolina on Wednesday once the area becomes very water-logged.

“By this point, the multi-day storm accumulation will likely be in the double digits with maxes in the 20 to 30 inch range near the Savannah metro and all along the Carolina Coastal Plain,” the WPC continued.

With rainfall totals of this level, “catastrophic flooding would be likely/definite and compounded by coastal surge and waves,” according to the WPC. Impacts will be very serious.”

“With these expected rainfall totals, impacts will be widespread and severe, likely including numerous flooded homes and structures, damage to roadways including washouts, and unprecedented flooding along and near smaller creeks and streams,” the National Weather Service in Charleston, South Carolina, warned. The office covers the region expected to be hit hardest by Debby."

(AP) — Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida on Monday with torrential rain and high winds, contributing to at least four deaths in the state and the rescue of hundreds from flooded homes before turning menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard’s low-lying regions and threatening to flood some of America’s most historic Southern cities.

Record-setting rain was causing flash flooding, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) possible in some areas, the National Hurricane Center said.

About 500 people were rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said in a social media post. It was one of the cities hardest hit by flooding on Monday.

“Essentially we’ve had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,” Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said in a social media update.

Just north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.

“We are facing an unprecedented weather event with Hurricane Debby,” said Jodie Fiske, public safety director for Manatee County public. “The safety of our residents is our top priority, and we are doing everything in our power to respond effectively to this crisis.""

A flash flood emergency was issued into Monday evening for the Lake City area in the north central part of the state, where up to a foot (30.5 centimeters) of rain had fallen and more was expected.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that the state could continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.

“It is a very saturating, wet storm,” he said during an afternoon briefing at the state’s emergency operations center. “When they crest and the water that’s going to come down from Georgia, it’s just something that we’re going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.”

Debby made landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It since has weakened to a tropical storm and is moving slowly, covering roads with water and contributing to at least five deaths.

A truck driver died on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff’s office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet (12 meters) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.

A 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, according to the Levy County Sheriff’s Office.

And in Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night. The Florida Highway Patrol said a 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries.

In southern Georgia, a 19-year-old man died Monday afternoon when a large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

Nearly 200,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.

Airports were also affected. More than 1,600 flights had been canceled nationwide, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com.

The potential for high water also threatened Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina.

Local leaders in Savannah said flooding could happen in areas that don’t usually get high water if Debby stalls out over the city. With winds and rainfall expected to worsen overnight, authorities issued a curfew from 10 p.m. Monday until 6 a.m. Tuesday.

“This type of rain hovering over us, coming with the intensity that they tell us it is coming, it’s going to catch a whole lot of people by surprise,” said Chatham County Chairman Chester Ellis.

In South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a “historic and potentially unprecedented event” three times in a 90-second briefing Monday morning.

The city of Charleston has an emergency plan in place that includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding. Officials announced a curfew for the city starting at 11 p.m. as some of the heaviest rain is expected to fall overnight.

North Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Gov. Roy Cooper declared it in an executive order signed Monday. Several areas along the state’s coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks, according to the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program.

North Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.

In 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding. In 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.

President Joe Biden was briefed on Debby’s progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said. Biden approved a request from South Carolina’s governor for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said he has asked Biden to issue a preemptive federal emergency declaration to speed the flow of federal aid to the state.

Vice President Kamala Harris has postponed a campaign stop scheduled for Thursday in Savannah, Georgia.

Debby made landfall near Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida of less than 1,000 residents. It’s not far from where Hurricane Idalia made landfall less than a year ago as a Category 3 storm.

Sue Chewning lives in nearby Cross City and has weathered both storms. In her nearly 73 years of living in the area, she said she doesn’t recall any direct hits from a hurricane — until this one-two punch from Idalia and Debby.

“Some people may say, ‘I can’t take this anymore’. But I think for the most part … it’s a close-knit community and most of the local people, they’re going to stay, dig down, help each other,” Chewning said.

This story has been updated to correct that the Big Bend area is north of Tampa, not south of Tampa.

Good afternoon. I wanted to do *** quick midday update on the uh tropical situation. Of course, Debbie made landfall as *** hurricane earlier this morning near Steinhatchee, Florida. It is now *** tropical storm, so it's weakened *** little bit over land, still producing lots of heavy rainfall though, over parts of Florida, Georgia into the Carolinas. And uh we've got some time to go before that rain is going to quit. So let's take *** look at the latest track from the National Hurricane Center. As I mentioned, Debbie is now *** tropical storm. It will continue as *** tropical storm as it moves across southeastern Georgia. And then that center of circulation will likely actually move off land back over the water uh along the coast of South Carolina. And it's gonna all the while still be producing very heavy rainfall over parts of Georgia and into the Carolina. So this is Wednesday morning at 7 a.m. System is likely *** tropical storm just off the coast of South Carolina. It's gonna hang out there for the entire day and then eventually move back ashore by the end of the week, likely, uh sometime during the day. Thursday into Friday where that center will be moving over North Carolina and then eventually into Virginia. But notice this track has this system just kind of meandering and means it's going to continue to pull an onshore flow, which means the possibility of coastal flooding along the eastern United States. And also it's going to be picking up moisture that leads to the potential for more heavy rain along the southeastern and eastern coast of the United States in the coming days. Here's the latest rainfall totals and where you see that area that tan color, that's where we could see more than 20 inches of rain from this system before it's all said and done. So this could produce some historic flooding across parts of Georgia into South Carolina. Of course, all the bright colors that really heavy rainfall here in Alabama. We are on the dry side of this system so we're not expecting much in the way of rainfall from Debbie. Uh The latest outlook from the weather prediction center does keep *** high risk of flooding for the pink color you see there across parts of Florida also along the coast of Georgia into South Carolina. That's for today. Now, for tomorrow, we still keep *** high risk of flooding as the system just kind of lingers. So that's gonna include parts of Georgia and also South Carolina where you see the bright pink color there as we move into Wednesday, that flooding risk. Uh continues and shifts just *** little bit farther northward along the, uh South Carolina coast and then starts to include parts of the North Carolina coastline. And then by Thursday, *** moderate risk of flooding over parts of South Carolina and North Carolina. So you can see this is going to be *** multi day flooding risk across the Carolinas and Georgia as the system just kind of lingers. Uh, the latest from the National Hurricane Center, there are still trial storm warnings up for parts of Florida, uh, along the big bend stretching down towards Tampa. And then we've also got that tropical storm warning that stretches from Jacksonville up towards, uh Charleston. And, uh, we are done with any kind of hurricane warnings or anything like that at this point, close to home along our area, beaches. We don't have any kind of watches or warnings. We are not expecting any direct impacts from Debbie along the Alabama beaches or the North Central Gulf. Another thing to consider is as this keeps moving, uh, farther inland, we keep that risk of *** few isolated tornadoes. So the storm prediction center including parts of Florida, the coast of Georgia and the coast of South Carolina in *** slight level two out of five risk for isolated tornadoes as, uh, that system just kind of lingers. I mentioned no direct impacts from Debbie along our area, beaches. But one thing to keep in mind is, uh, today and tomorrow we do have that elevated rip current risk. Of course, any time that we have tropical mischief in the Gulf, we do have to watch for those rip currents. Just make sure you're checking your local beach flag. Another area to watch, we do have *** disturbance that is going to be moving into the Caribbean here pretty soon. National Hurricane Center at this point gives it *** low chance of developing but just something to watch. And of course, something we will be keeping an eye on here in Alabama over the next couple of days, our forecast is trending very hot and very dry. Good afternoon.

Tropical storm Debby live updates: Five killed after storm makes landfall in Florida as hurricane

Hurrcane Debby thrashed thrashed parts of Florida on Monday after making landfall and bringing risks of flooding, dangerous storm surge and power ourages.

The National Hurricane Center announced at around 7am that Debby had made landfall near Steinhatchee, Florida, with winds of 80 mph, making it a Category 1 storm. It has since been downgraded to a tropical storm.

The deadly winds ultimately led to the tragic death of a 13-year-old boy in Levy County after a tree fell on a mobile home and the death of a semi-truck driver in Hillsborough County after the truck veered off into a canal. Two other people, including a 12-year-old boy, were killed in a crash in Dixie County. A falling tree killed a fifth person, a 19-year-old, in Moultrie, Georgia.

Debby will travel across Florida before blowing through southern Georgia on Tuesday. The storm is forecasted to hit South Carolina Wednesday through Friday before calming.

More than 147,000 in the Sunshine State were without electricity as of late Monday, according to utilities tracking site PowerOutage.us.

Coast Guard rescues two adrift boaters during tropical storm

Monday 5 August 2024 16:50 , Ariana Baio

The U.S. Coast Guard announced they successfully rescued two boaters who were adrift on Sunday in the middle of Tropical Storm Debby.

On Saturday, the two boaters headed out from Key West, Florida to sail to Tarpon Springs, Florida. But lost their sail while 73 miles off the coast.

A friend on land contacted the Coast Guard after the boaters missed their check-in.

“Some of the most important factors in any search and rescue case is accurate information and safety equipment,” said Lt Commander Christopher Hooper, a search and rescue mission coordinator at Coast Guard District Seven.

“We received an updated satellite position from the boaters’ friend, which led to them being successfully located. This rescue was a collaborative effort between District Seven and Sector St. Petersburg while Tropical Storm Debby crossed the region.”

No injuries were reported.

Debby downgraded to tropical storm

Monday 5 August 2024 16:19 , Ariana Baio

The National Hurricane Center downgraded Debby from hurricane to tropical storm status late Monday morning.

With maximum sustained winds of approximately 70 mph, Debby no longer qualifies as a hurricane. But that does not mean the storm’s strength should be taken any less seriously

Debby still brings threatening storm surges, flooding, surf swells and flash flooding to Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.

The National Hurricane Center said the storm would weaken further in the next 48 hours.

Georgia Governor deploys national guard

Residents in Steinhatchee, Florida, which flooded during Hurricane Idalia, spent Sunday moving items to higher ground ahead of Hurricane Debby making landfall on Monday morning.

""I've been here 29 years. This isn't the first time I've done it. Do you get used to it? No,"" Mark Reblin, a resident told The Associated Press, as he moved items out of the liquor store he owns.

""Right now, we are trying secure everything from floating away,"" said Sheryl Horne, whose family owns the Shell Island Fish Camp along the Wakulla River in St Marks, Florida, where some customers moved their boats inland.

The Big Bend region was hit last year by Hurricane Idalia, which made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane.

""I am used to storms and I'm used to cleaning up after storms,"" Ms Horne said.

Dixie County woman and boy, 12, die in car crash due to ‘inclement weather’

Monday 5 August 2024 14:35 , James Liddell

Two Dixie County residents died in a single-vehicle crash on Sunday night as storms swirled ahead of Hurricane Debby making landfall on Monday.

A woman, 38, and a boy, 12, both from Crawfordville were pronounced dead at the scene, according to a Florida Highway Patrol statement. A third boy, 14, was seriously injured and taken to UF Health.

The vehicle was said to have struck a guardrail, causing it to flip and lose control, police said. The specific location or identity of those involved have not been disclosed.

A witness told the Florida Highway Patrol that the car lost control “due to inclement weather and wet roadway,” the statement read.

“After losing control, the vehicle struck the guardrail in the center median, then redirected, overturning, leaving the roadway to the right,” it added.

The crash is currently under investigation. The Independent has reached out to Florida Highway Patrol for more details.

Climate change is fueling a stronger hurricane season

Monday 5 August 2024 14:20 , James Liddell

Debby, which made landfall on Monday morning, intensified into a Category 1 hurricane amid a hurricane season that experts warn could be catastrophic as the climate crisis fuels rising ocean temperatures.

A study from Colorado State University published earlier this year predicted 23 tropical storms and hurricanes this year, the highest number they’ve predicted in their 20 years of work. The team says hotter oceans are to blame.

It seems their prediction has already come true: this year’s season started off with Hurricane Beryl, the earliest Category 5 storm on record due to warmer-than-average ocean temperatures. The catastrophic storm killed several people and flattened entire islands in the Caribbean.

Some residents in Citrus County are still finishing up on repairs and renovations after the devastating Hurricane Idalia in August last year as Hurricane Debby made landfall on Monday morning.

Idalia, a Category 3 hurricane, was the most powerful to hit the Big Bend for almost 75 years, causing $3.5bn worth of damage and taking the lives of up to 12 Floridians.

“We’re seeing a bit of a repeat of Hurricane Idalia. Thankfully, this one does not appear to be as strong,” Citrus County Commissioner Jeff Kinnard told CNN on Monday morning.

Kinnard says the county is better prepared to cope with the potential torrential conditions than it was a year ago.

“We’re prepared, the city’s prepared. And we’re just hoping for the best here,” he added.

Hurricane Debby finally made landfall in Steinhatchee in Taylor County – just 20 miles away from Hurricane Idalia’s landfall last year.

Gov. Ron DeSantis urged Florida residents in the Big Bend region to avoid driving as roads are likely to become increasingly flooded.

“When the water rises when, you have streets that could be flooded – that’s hazardous,” the Florida governor said during a live-streamed address on X on Monday.

“Please take the adequate precautions. Don’t try and drive through this. We don’t want to see traffic fatalities adding up because people went out there when the roads aren’t safe yet.”

He continued: “Please don’t tempt fate. Don’t try and go through these flooded streets.”

DeSantis’ warning comes after the National Hurricane Center warned of life-threatening storm surge and major flooding across the region as Hurricane Debby made landfall approximately 7.00 EDT in Steinhatchee on Monday.

Hurricane Debby has finally made landfall in the Big Bend on Monday morning.

The storm came ashore near the coastal town of Steinhatchee in Taylor County, Florida, at approximately 7.00am EDT, according to the National Hurricane Center.

The NHC has warned of major flooding and “life-threatening” storm surge as bands of rain sweep across the region.

“You’re talking about catastrophic flooding,” Jamie Rhome, the deputy director of the Hurricane Center, told the BBC.

More than 200,000 homes and businesses have been left without power at the time the storm made landfall.

Georgia and South Carolina are expected to be hit by the torrential conditions in coming days.

The landfall is within 20 miles of Hurricane Idalia’s landfall in August last year, which came ashore in the Big Bend of Florida as a Category 3 hurricane with 125 mph winds.

What is the difference between a weather watch and warning?

Monday 5 August 2024 11:00 , Stuti Mishra

The National Weather Service has issued several watches and warnings throughout the southeast US as Tropical Storm Debby approaches.

A warning, such as a Hurricane Warning or Storm Surge Warning, means residents should take immediate protective action.

“A warning means weather conditions pose a threat to life or property,” the NWS writes.

Meanwhile, a watch means residents should prepare for extreme weather. These may be issued when meteorologists don’t know the exact timing and severity of the event.

“ People should have a plan of action in case a storm threatens and they should listen for later information and possible warnings especially when planning travel or outdoor activities,” the NWS writes.

Debbie could thrash Florida, Georgia and South Carolina with up to 30 inches of rain

Monday 5 August 2024 08:00 , Stuti Mishra

Debby could thrash the US southeast region with potential record-setting rains totalling up to 30 inches (76 centimetres) starting from Tuesday.

The Category 1 hurricane is expected to move eastward over northern Florida on Monday and then stall over the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina.

Officials also warned of life-threatening storm surge along Florida's Gulf Coast, with 6 to 10 feet of inundation expected Monday between the Ochlockonee and Suwannee rivers.

""There's some really amazing rainfall totals being forecast and amazing in a bad way,"" Michael Brennan, Miami director of the NOAA's National Hurricane Center, said at a briefing.

""That would be record-breaking rainfall associated with a tropical cyclone for both the states of Georgia and South Carolina if we got up to the 30 inch level.""

Flooding impacts could last through Friday and are expected to be especially severe in low-lying areas near the coast, including Savannah, Georgia; Hilton Head, South Carolina; and Charleston, South Carolina. North Carolina officials were monitoring the storm's progress.

Officials in Savannah said the area could see a month's worth of rain in four days if the system stalls over the region.

“It may very well have more impacts in the Tallahassee area than Idalia did,” DeSantis said.

Tropical Storm Debby strengthens into a Category 1 hurricane

Monday 5 August 2024 05:15 , Stuti Mishra

Tropical Storm Debby has strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane as it approaches Florida.

Forecasters at the National Hurricane Centre in Miami said on Sunday evening that the storm has maximum sustained winds of 75mph (120kph). It was located about 100 miles west southwest of Tampa, moving north at 12mph (19kph).

Debby is the fourth named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season after Tropical Storm Alberto, Hurricane Beryl and Tropical Storm Chris, all of which formed in June.

Forecasters warn that heavy amounts of rain from Debby could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia.

Debby could bring ‘potentially historic flooding’

Monday 5 August 2024 04:34 , Stuti Mishra

AccuWeather meteorologists say Debby could rapidly intensify into a hurricane later today in the Gulf of Mexico before it makes landfall in Florida tomorrow and produce potentially catastrophic flooding across the Southeast.

“The flooding threat from Debby could lead to a life-threatening and catastrophic flooding disaster in communities across the Southeast if this storm slows down or stalls out,” said AccuWeather's chief meteorologist Jon Porter.

“The combination of hours of relentless, heavy rain and a persistent onshore flow could prevent rivers and waterways from draining into the Atlantic, making the flooding impacts even worse.""

""Do not be lulled into any false sense of security that Debby is presently rated as a tropical storm on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. There are many cases, such as Florence in 2018, where a Category 1 hurricane or tropical storm caused catastrophic flooding.”

"Tropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/5/hurricane-debby-hits-florida-coast-evacuations-ordered,"Weather agencies warn the storm is expected to dump 6 to 12 inches of rain in Florida and 20 to 30 inches in coastal Georgia and South Carolina.

Hurricane Debby has made landfall as a Category 1 storm in the Big Bend region of Florida in the United States and has begun a slow crawl towards the Atlantic coast.

The hurricane slammed ashore on Monday in the region on the Gulf of Mexico about 7am (11:00 GMT) near Steinhatchee, Florida, about 115km (70 miles) southeast of Tallahassee, delivering winds of up to 130km/h (80mph), the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.

“We have seen significant storm surge. We have seen inundation. We have seen and we’ll continue to see flooding in various parts of the state of Florida,” Governor Ron DeSantis told reporters, warning of a threat of “significant flooding events” in the coming days.

Debby had already dumped up to a foot (30cm) of rain in some parts of the state’s southwest, Florida Division of Emergency Management Executive Director Kevin Guthrie said.

The NHC warned that Debby is expected to dump 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30cm) of rain in parts of Florida and as much as 20 to 30 inches (51 to 76cm) in coastal Georgia and South Carolina before the week is over.

Mandatory evacuations have been ordered for part of Citrus County, Florida, with eight other counties under voluntary evacuation orders, local media reported.

The governors of Georgia and South Carolina have also declared states of emergency ahead of the storm’s arrival.

“This is going to be an event that is going to be probably here for the next five to seven days, maybe as long as 10 days, depending on how much rainfall we get,” Guthrie said.

Meanwhile, more than 300,000 customers have lost electricity so far, according to the tracker poweroutage.us. “We have a lot of restoration personnel ready to go to get it back on,” DeSantis said

Debby was a slow-moving tropical storm as it passed over Cuba, but it gained strength from exceptionally warm waters as it paralleled Florida’s coast on the Gulf of Mexico.

Debby bears some of the hallmarks of Hurricane Harvey, which hit Corpus Christi, Texas, in August 2017. Downgraded to a tropical storm as it moved inland, Harvey lingered over Texas, dumping about 50 inches (127cm) of rain on Houston and causing $125bn in damage.

Climate scientists believe man-made global warming from burning fossil fuels has raised the temperature of the oceans, making storms bigger and more devastating.

The last hurricane to make a direct hit on the Big Bend region was Hurricane Idalia, which briefly gained Category 4 strength before making landfall as a Category 3 storm in August 2023.

The National Centers for Environmental Information estimated it caused $3.5bn in damage. DeSantis described the initial effects of Debby as “modest” compared with Idalia.

Forecasters expect numerous Atlantic hurricanes in the 2024 season, which began on June 1, including four to seven major ones. That would exceed the record-breaking 2005 season, which spawned the devastating Katrina and Rita hurricanes."
"Tropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia.",https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/hurricane-debby-hits-florida-as-category-1-storm-catastrophic-flooding-possible,"TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Hurricane Debby reached the Big Bend coast of Florida early Monday, bringing with it the potential for catastrophic flooding and life-threatening storm surge as it slowly passes over the northern part of the state. Forecasters warned that, in the coming days, record-setting rain could pummel coastal Georgia and South Carolina as the storm heads east.

The storm made landfall as a Category 1 storm near Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida of less than 1,000 residents on Florida’s Gulf Coast. It had maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph) and was moving north-northeast at 10 mph (17 kph), the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. The storm made landfall in one of the least populated areas of Florida, but forecasters warned heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia.

Storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend, according to John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center.

“That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,” he said Monday.

Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.

“We expect to have several rivers and streams go into major flood stage,” said Kevin Guthrie, the state’s director of emergency management.

Nearly 214,000 customers were without power in Florida on Monday morning, according to PowerOutage.com. In Marion County, which is inland and south of Gainesville, sheriff’s officials noted in a Facebook post Monday that crews were responding to reports of downed power lines and trees that have fallen on roadways and homes.

Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.

“When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that’s hazardous,” DeSantis said. “Don’t try to drive through this. We don’t want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don’t tempt fate, don’t try to go through these flooded streets.”

Images posted on social media by Cedar Key Fire Rescue early Monday showed floodwaters rising along the streets of the city, located south of where the storm made landfall. Water was “coming in at a pretty heavy pace,” the post said.

Debby was expected to move eastward over northern Florida and then stall over the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina, thrashing the region with potential record-setting rains totaling up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) beginning Tuesday through Saturday morning. Flooding is expected to be especially severe in low-lying areas near the coast, including Savannah, Georgia; Hilton Head, South Carolina; and Charleston, South Carolina.

Officials in Savannah said the area could see a month’s worth of rain in four days if the system stalls over the region.

Debby is the fourth named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season after Tropical Storm Alberto, Hurricane Beryl and Tropical Storm Chris, all of which formed in June. In the Eastern Pacific, tropical storms Carlotta, Daniel and Emilia all churned over the ocean, but they weren’t threatening land.

Residents hunker down as storm passes through

“Right now, we are to trying secure everything from floating away,” said Sheryl Horne, whose family owns the Shell Island Fish Camp along the Wakulla River in St. Marks, Florida, where some customers moved their boats inland.

The sparsely populated Big Bend region in the Florida Panhandle also was hit last year by Hurricane Idalia, which made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane.

“I am used to storms and I’m used to cleaning up after storms,” Horne said.

“We’re all hanging on here – a bunch of us stayed,” Dawn Perez said Monday by phone, as the eyewall of Hurricane Debby bore down on her home in the small town of Perry, Florida. Perez, the director of the town’s tourism department, said she has a new roof after Hurricane Idalia tore it apart in August 2023.

“The winds are intense – I’ve already lost my porch door and a tree, and stuff is blowing all over the place,” Perez said.

Northeast coast also preparing for storm conditions

Emergency managers in New England and New York were monitoring the path of the storm for the possibility of remnants striking their states. Northeast states including New York and Vermont have been hit by heavy rain and thunderstorms in recent weeks and were still coping with flooding and saturated ground.

"Tropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia.",https://thetandd.com/ap/national/tropical-storm-debby-could-prove-just-as-dangerous-as-a-major-hurricane/article_e4dde067-a70a-5f29-bad8-e2caad1724ca.html,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Tropical Storm Debby came ashore in Florida as a Category 1 hurricane Monday and quickly downgraded, but the storm still poses serious threats as it slogs on toward Georgia and South Carolina.

Tropical storms can be deadlier than some of the strongest hurricanes. In Debby’s case, the storm was expected to slow to a crawl and dump up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain over several days along coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Winds won’t be the biggest danger, making the storm's category far less important than the potential for catastrophic flooding.

The Saffir-Simpson Scale measures only the strength of a hurricane’s winds from Category 1 to Category 5, the strongest. The circumference of a storm, how fast it’s moving, the amount of rain it delivers, storm surge and high tides are all other factors that matter.

Geography plays a role

Where a storm hits and its inland path are also important. Geography, population, quality of infrastructure and the age of homes and businesses in an area can also factor into how much damage a storm can bring. Also, it’s important to remember that tornadoes can form regardless of a storm’s size.

It was fortunate that Debby landed in the region where the Florida's main peninsula meets the Panhandle in the north, one of the least populated areas of the state, but major cities like Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, need to take the storm very seriously.

Although historic downtown Savannah sits on a bluff comfortably above the Savannah River, the surrounding area, including Tybee Island, contains low-lying marshes. Charleston and surrounding areas are very susceptible to flooding — especially if the storm pushes water inland and prevents the myriad of creeks and marshes from draining heavy rains into the Atlantic.

Weaker storms can still be dangerous

As an example of a weaker storm causing major problems, look to Hurricane Beryl, which hit Texas last month as a Category 1 storm yet still knocked out power to 2.7 million customers. The storm was been blamed for at least 36 deaths in Texas, including people who died in their homes from sweltering heat after power in many areas stayed out for days.

Tropical Storm Fay in 2008 may be a good comparison to Debby. Fay didn’t even register on the scale of dangerous storms before it made four separate landfalls in Florida. In this case, it was not Fay’s strength, but its speed — or lack thereof — that turned out to be key. The listless storm parked itself over the state for days, dumping as much as 25 inches (64 centimeters) of rain in some places. Floods killed crops and destroyed homes. Roads were so flooded that alligators swam alongside first responders as they rescued people stranded in their homes.

When monitoring storms, “Don’t focus on the category,” advises Craig Fugate, former director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency who also was emergency management director in Florida during some of the state’s worst storms.

Think local — don't just rely on the national forecast

Fugate also advises resident to seek out local weather information instead of relying too heavily on advisories from the National Hurricane Center and national news and weather channels.

“Everyone focuses on the Hurricane Center,” he said. “They’re responsible for storm intensity and track. They’re not necessarily going to have all the local impacts.”

A better place to go, Fugate says, is the National Weather Service’s homepage, where you can type in a ZIP code and see what’s happening in your area.

“Your (regional) National Weather Service office is taking all that information and they’re localizing it so they can tell you what kind of wind you can expect, what kind of flooding you can expect,” Fugate said. “Are you in a storm surge area? When are the high tides?”

Relying on FEMA flood zone maps to determine a storm’s potential impact is as ill-advised as depending solely on the Saffir-Simpson scale, Fugate warns.

“People think, ‘Well, it’s a flood map. If I don’t live in the zone, I don’t flood.’ No! It’s an insurance rate map. Not being in that special risk area doesn’t mean you don’t flood, it just means the insurance is cheaper,” he said."

Hurricane Debby made landfall at 7 a.m. EDT Monday, August 5, near Steinhatchee, Florida, as a Category 1 storm with 80 mph winds and a central pressure of 979 mb. The storm is expected to produce catastrophic extreme rainfall for coastal Georgia and South Carolina — with 20-30 inches possible in a pocket from the Georgia-South Carolina border to Charleston, South Carolina.

On Monday morning, the stronger right front eyewall of Debby passed over Horseshoe Beach, which recorded sustained winds of 68 mph, gusting to 98 mph, at 5:30 a.m. EDT. In the 24 hours ending at 2 a.m. EDT Monday, Debby intensified from 45 mph to 80 mph, meeting the minimum definition of rapid intensification: a 35 mph increase in sustained winds in 24 hours. Debby’s landfall location was about 10 miles southeast of where Hurricane Idalia made landfall on August 30 last year as a Category 3 storm with sustained winds of 115 mph.

At 11 a.m. EDT Monday, Debby had moved about 30 miles inland and had weakened to a tropical storm with 70 mph winds. Debby was moving north-northeast at a sedate 8 mph, and this forward speed is expected to slow to about 4 mph by Tuesday night, allowing the storm to dump catastrophic heavy rains over a large area.

Already over a foot of rain in western Florida

Debby has already deluged western Florida: Radar-estimated rainfall amounts of 14-18 inches occurred in two counties just south of Tampa Bay (see Tweet below). Observations from the CoCoRaHS rain gage network had many readings in excess of 11 inches for the 24 hours ending at 7 a.m. EDT Monday, with a maximum of 16.04 inches in Manatee County. Flooding from the deluge closed I-75 south of Tampa, where a trucker died on Monday morning after being swept from the road.

Catastrophic extreme rainfall expected for coastal Georgia and South Carolina

The main damage from Debby is going to be flooding from its torrential rains. The trough of low pressure pulling Debby to the northeast is not expected to be strong enough to finish the job, leaving the storm stranded in a region of weak steering currents near the Southeast U.S. coast for multiple days. As of Monday morning, the National Hurricane Center was predicting 16-20 inches of rain for much of the coastal plain of Georgia and South Carolina, with a pocket of 20-30 inches from the Georgia-South Carolina border to Charleston, South Carolina. Such amounts could topple the South Carolina all-time state precipitation record for a tropical cyclone – 23.63 inches from Hurricane Florence in 2018.

NOAA’s Excessive Rainfall Discussion at 4:39 a.m. EDT Monday placed northeastern Florida through southeastern South Carolina in a “High Risk” of heavy rainfall for Monday, with a High Risk area projected for Tuesday for most of the coastal plains of Georgia and South Carolina, and for Wednesday over most of coastal South Carolina and a portion of coastal North Carolina. Only about 4% of days in the U.S. feature High Risk areas, but they account for about one-third of all flood fatalities and some 80% of flood-related damage. The outlook all three days warned of “widespread and numerous instances of flash flooding with significant and potentially catastrophic flooding likely.”

Although most of South Carolina is in moderate to severe drought, widespread rains in excess of 10 inches are sure to cause damaging flooding, especially near the coast where onshore winds and a storm surge will prevent rainwater from draining efficiently.

The exact location of Debby’s maximum flood threat is difficult to estimate since it will heavily depend on how much time the center remains offshore. With water temperatures offshore of South Carolina being 27-28 degrees Celsius (81-82°F), Debby will have plenty of heat energy available to re-intensify once the center is over water on Tuesday afternoon through Thursday morning. With weak steering currents and a storm likely to be very near the coast, slight and unpredictable wobbles in the track will make big differences in how much rain Debby ultimately dumps. The Monday morning runs of the GFS and European models were in agreement that Debby’s deluge over the Southeast U.S. would finally end on Friday, when the storm is expected to get picked up by a trough of low pressure and accelerated to the northeast, up the U.S. East Coast.

Where the Saffir-Simpson scale falls short: A comparison with Hurricane Idalia (2023) and Hurricane Florence (2018)

As regular readers of Eye on the Storm know, the Saffir-Simpson intensity scale is based solely on maximum sustained winds; by design, it does not consider any of the other very real hazards of a landfalling hurricane. Rainfall is a prime example. As hurricanes fed by ever-warmer waters and a moister atmosphere dump ever more rainfall, inland flooding has accounted for more than half of all deaths from landfalling U.S. hurricanes since 2013. Yet a Saffir-Simpson rating tells us practically nothing about how much flooding a given hurricane might produce.

Debby came ashore in Florida’s Big Bend region in virtually the same location where Category 3 Hurricane Idalia made landfall on August 30, 2023, with sustained winds of 115 mph and an eight- to 12-foot storm surge. Idalia killed 12 people and caused $3.6 billion in damage – a very low damage figure for U.S. landfalling major hurricane. This occurred because Idalia hit a sparsely populated coast and did not dawdle over land; the storm’s heaviest rains of five to 10 inches fell along a relatively narrow swath from northern Florida to southern North Carolina (Fig. 1). Thus, even though Idalia was rated a Category 3 storm at landfall, its impacts were more typical of what one might expect from a Category 1 storm, and the name Idalia was not retired from the rotating list of hurricane names.

Figure 1. Observed rainfall from Hurricane Idalia of 2023. (Image credit: NOAA)

Figure 2. Observed rainfall from Hurricane Florence in 2018. (Image credit: NOAA)

Hurricane Florence was a large and very slow-moving hurricane that made landfall as a Category 1 storm at Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, on September 18, 2018, with a destructive storm surge of up to 10 feet and wind gusts over 100 mph. However, the majority of the $30 billion damage caused by Florence – and its 53 storm-related deaths – came from torrential rainfall inland, which caused many rivers to surpass previous record flood heights. Rains in excess of five inches fell across most of North Carolina and almost half of South Carolina, with a substantial area receiving catastrophic rains of 20-35 inches (Fig. 2). Florence broke the all-time tropical cyclone precipitation records for both North Carolina (35.93 inches) and South Carolina (23.81 inches). Florence’s $30 billion price tag ranks this Category 1 hurricane as the 14th-costliest hurricane in U.S. history – behind 11 major hurricanes, one Category 2 hurricane (Ike of 2008), and one Category 1 hurricane (Sandy of 2012). Thus, even though Florence was rated a Category 1 storm at landfall, its impacts were more typical of what one might expect from a Category 3 or 4 storm.

Similarly, if the rains from Debby are as intense and widespread as implied in the strong agreement among forecast models and official outlooks, Debby is likely to cause damage in excess of $10 billion, making this Category 1 hurricane more like a Category 3 or 4 storm in its impacts. Expect to see Debby’s name retired at the conclusion of the 2024 hurricane season.

We can also compare Debby with Idalia last year, and note that Cedar Key surge levels were about two feet higher in that one than in Debby. We can also compare radar images of Debby and Idalia at landfall too. pic.twitter.com/T2VOEgaBwp — Matt Lanza 🤌🏼 (@mattlanza) August 5, 2024

Storm surge from Debby

Debby brought a storm surge of three to four feet to much of the west coast of Florida, from Naples to Tampa Bay, bringing minor to moderate coastal flooding. The highest storm surge at a tide gage was measured at Cedar Key, where over six feet of surge was recorded. Fortunately, the peak surge occurred when the tide was going out, and the station ended up with only its sixth-highest water level on record. Here are the top six water levels at Cedar Key since 1914 (above mean higher high water, or MHHW):

1) 6.84 feet, August 30, 2023, Hurricane Idalia

2) 5.98 feet, September 2, 2016, Hurricane Hermine

3) 5.41 feet, August 31, 1985, Hurricane Elena

4) 5.15 feet, October 8, 1996, Tropical Storm Josephine

5) 5.13 feet, March 13, 1993, Storm of the Century

6) 4.66 feet, August 5, 2024, Hurricane Debby

Debby brought the third-highest water level on record to Naples, Florida, where accurate records go back to 1965. Five of the city’s top-six water levels since 1965 have occurred in the past eight years. This is the kind of behavior one would expect to see in an era of climate change since sea level rise makes it easier to set new high-water records. Here are the top six water levels at Naples since 1965 (above mean higher high water, or MHHW):

1) 6.18 feet, September 28, 2022, Hurricane Ian (gage failed before highest level was recorded)

2) 4.02 feet, September 10, 2017, Hurricane Irma

3) 3.11 feet, August 4, 2024, Hurricane Debby (data from the new North Naples Bay station)

3) 3.11 feet, December 22, 1972, Winter storm

5) 3.08 feet, January 17, 2016, Winter storm

6) 3.02 feet, September 28, 2023, Hurricane Idalia

Debby brought the fifth-highest water level on record to Fort Myers, Florida, where accurate records go back to 1965. Here are their top six water levels (above mean higher high water, or MHHW):

1) 7.26 feet, September 28, 2022, Hurricane Ian

2) 3.41 feet, November 23, 1988, Tropical Storm Keith

3) 3.31 feet, September 14, 2001, Hurricane Gabrielle

4) 3.30 feet, June 18, 1982, Unnamed subtropical storm

5) 3.27 feet, August 4, 2024, Hurricane Debby

6) 3.2 feet, August 30, 2023, Hurricane Idalia

Note that there were multiple reports of inundations from 1960’s Hurricane Donna of eight to 12 feet in the Naples area and seven to 11 feet in the Fort Myers area.

Tornadoes

Debby spawned six tornadoes that caused minor damage over western Florida on Sunday, according to storm reports from NOAA’s Storm Prediction Center. The center has placed a portion of northeastern Florida, coastal Georgia, and coastal South Carolina at “Slight Risk” (level two out of five) for severe weather on Monday, with some weak tornadoes expected to the right of where Debby’s center passes.

The weather service’s most recent briefing stated uncertainty remains about what those impacts may look like. Heavy rainfall and flooding are likely primary threats. Additional potential impacts include increased chances for rip currents and gusty winds later this week, but it’s too soon for specific timing. Current estimates have the storm’s intensity at about 69 mph.

As Debby remains over land Monday night and Tuesday, a gradual weakening is expected, the National Hurricane Center reported Monday. By late Tuesday and into the week, some strengthening is anticipated as the center moves offshore.

How strong Debby will get depends on how far over the Atlantic Ocean the system moves, and how long it remains over water.

According to the Associated Press, Hurricane Debby reached the Big Bend coast of Florida early Monday, bringing with it the potential for catastrophic flooding and life-threatening storm surge as it slowly passes over the northern part of the state. It was later downgraded to a tropical storm, but forecasters warned in the coming days, record-setting rain could pummel coastal Georgia and South Carolina as the storm heads east.

“Dangerous storm surge and tropical storm conditions will spread northward along the southeast U.S. coast from northeastern Florida to North Carolina through the middle of the week,” the center reported. “Storm surge and tropical storm warnings have been issued for portions of these areas, and additional watches and warnings will likely be issued later today.”

Chief Meteorologist Mike Buresh says the closest approach Debby’s center will get to Jacksonville looks to be this afternoon or early this evening.

High tide in the St. Johns River downtown is between 11 a.m. and noon and around midnight. He said there could be significant flooding. High tide at the beaches is at 10 a.m. and 10 p.m. today.

WATCH THE FORECAST | DOWNLOAD THE APPS

UPDATE 11 a.m.- First Alert Meteorologist Garrett Bedenbaugh says Debby has downgraded to a tropical storm with sustained winds now at 70 mph.

ORIGINAL STORY:

Buresh says the biggest concerns for Northeast Florida and Southeast Georgia are heavy rain, rough seas and surf, a high rip current risk and a few tornadoes and waterspouts.

Winds will be gusty and at times, strong from Highway 301 to the beaches. However, it will be more significant and potentially damaging west of Jacksonville along I-10, especially closer to the center. Winds will peak Monday afternoon and into this evening.

Florida is the “fork in the road” for longer range movement, especially forward speed but also a turn more toward the east while over land. Squalls of heavy rain and storms will impact Florida, Georgia and the coastal Carolinas through at least midweek.

Buresh wants to remind everyone that Jacksonville, Northeast Florida and Southeast Georgia are on the “messy” east end of the storm. As a result, he says the impacts of Debby will occur many miles from the center and outside the forecast cone.

Forecasts remain in flux and subject to change.

Action News Jax’s First Alert Weather Team will continue to track Debby and provide updates throughout the day.

LISTEN: Mike Buresh ‘All the Weather, All the Time’ Podcast

Here are specifics based on the current forecast track:

RAINFALL: Severe flooding is legitimate concern. Amounts through Wed. will average 6-12″, locally more. As much as 10-15″ ... nearing 2 feet is well within the realm of ‘possibility’ from Lake City to Waycross eastward across SE Ga. as Debby slows. A strong/steady wind from the south Monday may push water from the St. Johns River into parts of downtown Jacksonville & - during times of heavy rain - flooding could become rather serious for a time. The more north & west over N. Fl & SE Ga., the greater the rain amounts.

WIND: Sustained winds will average 20-30 mph with gusts 40-50 mph from Highway 301 to the coast though some higher speeds will be possible at/near the beaches due to less friction. Sustained winds may peak Monday at 50-60 mph with gusts 70+ mph from Lake City to Waycross due to the closer proximity to the center. The strongest winds for Duval & metro Jacksonville will be Monday afternoon/early evening as the center of then weakening tropical storm Debby will make its closest approach.

TORNADOES/WATERSPOUTS: Isolated threat through Monday then gradually diminishing west to east late Mon. night.

INTERACTIVE RADAR: Keep track of the rain as it moves through your neighborhood

OCEAN: Seas will average 7-12 feet off the Ga. & Fl. coast, possibly higher by Tuesday depending on exactly where Debby is & how strong. Surf will build to 6-10+ feet. The onshore wind component will not be long lasting which is a good thing for the beaches.

RIP CURRENTS: A high to very high rip current risk at area beaches. The best advice is to stay out of the ocean.

STORM SURGE: Little. The majority of the flooding will be due to rainfall. But some surge will occur along coastal Ga. - possibly as much as 2-4 feet.... 1-2 feet, locally 3 feet for NE Fl., the St. Johns River & its tributaries.

POWER OUTAGES: Sporadic for the I-95 corridor but more widespread & significant from Waycross, Ga. to Lake City, Fl., the I-10 corridor & the Fl./Ga. border area.

"Tropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia.",https://www.irishexaminer.com/world/arid-41450881.html,"Tropical Storm Debby hit Florida with catastrophic flooding and was blamed for at least four deaths, with Georgia and South Carolina next in line as the system rips across the south-eastern United States.

Record-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina, and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches of rainfall in some areas, the National Hurricane Centre said.

Debby made landfall early on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over the gulf coast of Florida.

The tropical storm was moving slowly, covering roads with water and contributing to at least four deaths.

A lorry driver died on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below.

Sheriff’s office divers found the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet below the surface, according to the Florida highway patrol.

A 13-year-old boy died on Monday after a tree fell on a mobile home, according to the Levy County sheriff’s office.

And in Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads on Sunday. The Florida Highway Patrol said a 14-year-old boy who was a passenger had serious injuries.

More than 300,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.

Florida governor Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 people were working to restore electricity. He told residents to sit tight until conditions are safe.

“When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that’s hazardous,” Mr DeSantis said. “Don’t try to drive through this. We don’t want to see traffic fatalities adding up.”

Airports were also affected. More than 1,600 flights had been cancelled nationwide, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com.

One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was cancelled on Monday. Nearly 30% of flights scheduled to leave Tampa International Airport were cancelled.

Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, was one of the hardest hit by flooding.

“Essentially we’ve had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,” said Sarasota County fire chief David Rathbun in a social media update.

The storm made landfall early Monday near Steinhatchee, Taylor County, a tiny community in northern Florida of fewer than 1,000 residents.

Several roads were closed because of flooding, sheriff Wayne Padgett said. Trees and power lines had also fallen across some roads.

President Joe Biden was briefed on Debby’s progress at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said.

Vice President Kamala Harris has postponed a scheduled trip to Georgia.

In South Carolina, Charleston County interim emergency director Ben Webster called Debby a “historic and potentially unprecedented event” three times in a 90-second briefing on Monday.

The city of Charleston has an emergency plan in place that includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed.

"Tropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/04/weather/florida-tropical-storm-debby-hurricane-sunday/index.html,"CNN —

Hurricane Debby, the fourth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season and the second named hurricane, has become a Category 1 storm, according to the National Hurricane Center.

The storm, located about 100 miles west-northwest of Tampa, Florida, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph, is expected to strengthen even further before making landfall in Florida’s Big Bend region Monday morning.

“Debby is then expected to move slowly across northern Florida and southern Georgia Monday and Tuesday, and be near the Georgia coast by Tuesday night,” the hurricane center said in its 11 p.m. advisory.

Debby began dumping rain on parts of the state earlier Sunday as a tropical storm and is expected to unload potentially historic amounts of rainfall over the southeastern United States.

Authorities in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina are urging residents to prepare for heavy rain and possible flooding as the storm makes its way through the Gulf.

The cities of Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, could both be drenched with a month’s worth of rain in a single day — and perhaps even an entire summer’s worth of rain over the course of the storm.

Hundreds of thousands of college and K-12 students will be impacted as several schools in the storm’s projected path have canceled classes Monday, including the University of Florida and Georgia Southern University.

Dangerous conditions had already begun Sunday off Florida’s coast. Two boaters were rescued after their vessel lost its sail amid 15- to 20-foot seas and 50-knot winds, the US Coast Guard in Tampa Bay said.

Debby’s arrival continues to cement an exceptionally early start to the hurricane season after Hurricane Beryl tore through the Caribbean and Texas last month as the earliest Category 5 Atlantic hurricane on record. The second Atlantic hurricane does not occur, on average, until August 26.

Hurricane conditions are expected to arrive by Monday morning, with the outer bands of the storm system making their way on shore during the day Sunday. The storm is forecast to reach the coast of the Big Bend around midday Monday, at which point Debby is expected to then crawl across northern Florida and southern Georgia throughout the day and into Tuesday, the hurricane center said.

The main threat will be flooding, both from storm surges up to 10 feet and heavy rainfall. Freshwater flooding, which is caused by rainfall, has become the deadliest aspect of tropical systems in the last decade, according to research conducted by the hurricane center — a threat made more dangerous as the world warms from fossil fuel pollution.

The strengthening storm tracking up the Florida Peninsula’s western coast prompted county and state officials to issue a string of voluntary and mandatory evacuation orders as the hurricane center posted hurricane watches and warnings across several parts of the state, including near Tampa and the Big Bend region.

A hurricane warning has been issued for the Florida Gulf coast from Suwanee River to Yankeetown, the hurricane center said.

Tropical storm and storm surge watches and warnings have also been issued for parts of Florida, coastal Georgia and parts of South Carolina. The hurricane center upgraded a tropical storm watch to a warning for the area west of Indian Pass to Mexico Beach, Florida, in its 5 p.m. ET update, and a tropical storm warning was also issued for the eastern coasts of Florida and Georgia from Ponte Vedra Beach to the Savannah River.

A tornado watch has also been issued for much of the Florida Peninsula and parts of southern Georgia until until Monday morning, covering more than 13 million people, including the cities of Tallahassee, Jacksonville, Tampa and Orlando.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster have declared states of emergency for their states in advance of the storm’s arrival. DeSantis on Sunday said in a news conference that he’d activated the Florida National Guard so it would be poised to assist with humanitarian needs as well as search and rescue.

DeSantis called on residents to finish their preparations and to brace for power outages, “particularly in parts of the state like here in Tallahassee.”

“There’s going to be a lot of trees that are going to fall down. You’re going to have debris. You are going to have power interruption,” the governor said, “so just prepare for that.”

More than 78,000 customers were already without power in Florida by Sunday night, according to PowerOutage.us.

DeSantis also urged Florida residents to avoid floodwaters ahead of the storm’s potentially significant flooding impacts, particularly in North Central Florida.

“Please do not drive your vehicles through flooded streets. The number one way we have fatalities as a result of floods is people trying to drive through the floodwater,” he said.

The docks of Indian Mound Park in Sarasota County, south of Tampa, were underwater by 2 p.m. ET Sunday, the county government posted on X. A little farther south, near Fort Myers, waters from the Gulf began spilling over onto coastal roadways and prompted some road closures after Debby’s outer bands dumped rain along the shoreline Sunday afternoon, Charlotte County emergency management officials said.

President Joe Biden on Sunday approved a disaster declaration for Florida, the White House announced, authorizing federal resources to respond to any disaster relief efforts.

Storm expected to intensify over Gulf

The slower Debby moves and the longer it sits over warm waters, the more likely the storm is to intensify. Studies have shown tropical systems are slowing down over time, making them more likely to produce greater rainfall totals over a given area.

Oceans are also getting warmer and supercharging storms, pumping them full of moisture. A 2022 study published in the journal Nature Communications found climate change increased hourly rainfall rates in tropical storms by 5 to 10% and in hurricanes by 8 to 11%.

“Conditions are favorable for strengthening over the Gulf of Mexico with warm sea surface temperatures and light shear. Intensification is likely to be slow during the first 12–24 hours, then proceed at a faster rate after the cyclone develops an organized inner core,” the National Hurricane Center said of Debby.

By early Monday, Debby is expected to move into the Apalachee Bay area of Florida as it moves northward over the Gulf, according to the Weather Prediction Center.

The Apalachee Bay area, which includes parts of Taylor, Jefferson, Wakulla, and Franklin counties, can expect to get drenched with heavy rain from Debby on Sunday, increasing the possibility of flash flooding in several spots, the hurricane center said.

In the meantime, county officials have urged residents in communities along Florida’s Gulf Coast to evacuate ahead of the storm. Mandatory evacuation orders are in effect for parts of Franklin, Citrus and Levy counties, with voluntary orders issued in Hernando, Taylor and Pasco counties.

“I am worried about the aftermath and seeing how much damage we get (and) how we are going to fix it,” Sue Colson, the mayor of Cedar Key in Levy County, told CNN Sunday. The city sits on the island of Way Key in the Gulf of Mexico, about four miles off the coast. She cited high amounts of anticipated rain as well as the threat of storm surge.

“That is always concerning when you are a low-lying island in the middle of the Gulf,” she said.

On Saturday, Florida Highway Patrol knocked on doors to tell residents to consider leaving, Colson said. Residents were continuing to finish their preparations on Sunday morning.

“I think everybody needs to make wise decisions for themselves and not endanger others by endangering yourself,” she said. “If you’re endangering yourself, you are endangering others, because then they have to rescue you.”

Heavy rain could linger for days

As a slow-moving Debby churns along the Georgia-Carolina coastline heading into the new week, it could lead to seemingly endless amounts of rain for days, with totals potentially reaching over 2 feet.

The heaviest rain amounts could even top 30 inches or more, depending on how long Debby meanders, with some forecast models showing the storm could linger through at least Thursday. “This rainfall will likely result in areas of considerable flash and urban flooding, with significant river flooding expected,” the National Hurricane Center said.

Such exceptional rainfall would challenge state records for rain from a tropical cyclone: In Georgia, the record is 27.85 inches from 1994’s Alberto, while South Carolina’s record is 23.63 inches from Florence in 2018.

A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture and can dump heavier rain. Warmer oceans can fuel stronger hurricanes, packing a punch with higher storm surge thanks to sea-level rise.

With an uptick in the intensity forecast comes an increase in forecasted storm surge, which occurs when ocean water is pushed inland by the onshore winds of a hurricane. Storm surge flooding above ground could rise to 6 to 10 feet along Florida’s Big Bend, and coastal Georgia and South Carolina could see surges reach 2 to 4 feet.

Tampa Bay is expecting 2 to 4 feet of storm surge. Marco Island and other areas of southwest Florida will see 1 to 3 feet of storm surge.

Warmer air and ocean temperatures fueled by human-induced climate change can lead to wetter tropical systems.

The North Florida region nestled between the Panhandle and the rest of the state’s peninsula took a devastating hit last August from Category 3 Hurricane Idalia, and now faces a new threat from Debby.

"Tropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/08/04/debby-hurricane-florida-southeast-flood-forecast/,"Debby strengthened into a hurricane Sunday night on its approach to Florida’s Big Bend, where it is expected to make landfall Monday bringing a “life-threatening” storm surge, damaging winds and torrential rain. But Debby may produce its most serious impacts between southeast Georgia and the eastern Carolinas between late Monday and Thursday when it stalls and unleashes “potentially historic” amounts of rain and “catastrophic flooding,” according to the National Hurricane Center. A few areas could see record-breaking amounts near 30 inches.

Debby was named at 5 p.m. on Saturday, and since then it has been gaining strength over the Gulf of Mexico. It reached hurricane intensity at 11 p.m. Sunday and is forecast to keep intensifying until it comes ashore.

After striking the Big Bend around late Monday morning, it will meander over the Southeastern states and stall, unleashing copious and torrential rains. Widespread amounts of at least 10 to 20 inches are possible in southeast Georgia and South Carolina, along with high-end tropical storm or even hurricane impacts at the coast.

Because of the storm, a state of emergency was declared in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.

Hurricane warnings are in effect for the Big Bend of Florida, with tropical storm warnings extending to the south to around Port Charlotte. A storm surge warning is also in effect for Florida’s Big Bend, where the rise in ocean water above normally dry land could reach up to 10 feet. The surge warning extends as far south as Tampa Bay, where the surge could reach 3 to 5 feet.

After Monday, Debby could live a second life of sorts, deluging southeast Georgia and the Carolinas for multiple days while possibly bringing another batch of tropical storm or hurricane conditions at the shoreline. Tropical storm warnings are in effect for the Georgia coastline and extend north to Charleston, S.C.

The National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center has drawn a rare Level 4 out of 4 “high risk” for flash flooding and excessive rainfall for northern Florida and southeast Georgia on Monday and southeast Georgia and eastern South Carolina on Tuesday. High-risk days account for about one-third of flood deaths and 80 percent of flood damage in the United States. More rain could fall in the region Wednesday and Thursday.

Meanwhile, another tropical wave in the west central Atlantic is expected to enter the Caribbean soon and could gradually develop. If it was to become a threat to land, it would probably be between Aug. 10 and 14.

Where is this hurricane, and how strong is it?

As of late Sunday evening, Debby was located 65 miles west-southwest of Cedar Key, Fla. and moving to the north at 12 mph. Maximum winds were listed at 75 mph. Weather radar showed a calm eye beginning to form at the center of the storm, a sign of intensification.

Debby is moving over a zone of extremely high sea surface temperatures, with waters between 87 and 90 degrees. That will foster additional strengthening. It also exists beneath a zone of divergence, or spreading of air, at the upper levels of the atmosphere. That will help tug up warm, moist air from below, intensifying the storm further.

Subsequently, rapid intensification is possible over the next 12 hours up until landfall. It may move ashore in the Big Bend as a high-end Category 1.

What are the potential impacts for Florida?

As the storm approaches and makes landfall on Monday, myriad impacts are expected for Florida:

Strong winds: Tropical-storm-force winds are likely for much of the west coast of Florida, with widespread gusts over 40 mph across the peninsula. The strongest gusts will occur within bands of downpours that rotate ashore. At the shoreline, gusts will exceed 55 mph. In the Big Bend where the storm makes landfall, however, gusts of 75 to 95 mph are probable Monday morning. Winds gusting over 70 mph are possible from Perry to Chiefland northeast to Interstate 10. Such winds will cause downed trees and wires, some structural damage and power outages.

Storm surge: To the east, or right, of the storm’s center, onshore winds will pile water against the coast. That will lead to a dangerous surge, with a chance of up to 6 to 10 feet of inundation above ordinarily dry ground just east of where the center makes landfall Monday. That would be a big issue for places such as Steinhatchee or Horseshoe Beach. Cedar Key may see the high end of 4 to 7 feet worth of surge. From Apalachicola to Apalachee Bay, about 3 to 7 feet of surge could be realized — with the highest amounts to the east. A surge of up to several feet could extend as far south as around Fort Myers.

8/4 11pm EDT: There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge from Hurricane #Debby along portions of the Gulf Coast of Florida, with 6 to 10 feet of inundation above ground level expected somewhere between Ochlockonee River to Yankeetown late tonight and Monday morning. pic.twitter.com/P2WPvcuOSa — NHC Storm Surge (@NHC_Surge) August 5, 2024

Rainfall: Fortunately Debby will be moving as it progresses northeast across Florida. The same can’t be said for southeast Georgia and the Carolinas. In the Sunshine State, a general 4 to 7 inches is likely from Tampa to Jacksonville southeastward, with lesser amounts in far South Florida. Closer to the core of where the storm tracks, including Perry, Jacksonville and Gainesville, 6 to 12 inches are possible with some locally higher amounts, especially in northern Florida. Some flooding is expected.

Tornadoes: A few twisters may briefly touch down in the spiral rain bands that work ashore Sunday into Monday.

What are the potential impacts for Georgia and the Carolinas?

Between Tuesday and Thursday, Debby may meander unpredictably, which will have bearings on where the most serious rainfall occurs as well as how strong the storm is and conditions along the coast.

That said, a general 10 to 20 inches of rain look likely across southeast Georgia, the eastern half of South Carolina and southeastern North Carolina. Within that zone, some may see 30 inches, and South Carolina’s state rainfall record could be in jeopardy, surpassing amounts seen in Hurricane Florence in 2018.

Tropical storm conditions are also expected at the coastline, with gusts of 60 mph or greater possible if Debby’s center moves offshore and regains strength. If it restrengthens more than expected, hurricane impacts aren’t impossible. Some surge may accompany Debby at the coastline in Georgia and South Carolina.

When will this storm finally pull away?

By Friday, Debby may encounter some jet stream winds to the north, which would tug up it up the East Coast and eventually out to sea. If it is pulled northward, it could produce a period of heavy rain and potential flooding between southeast Virginia and coastal New England depending on how close it tracks to the coast. Substantial rain could affect Virginia Beach, D.C., Philadelphia and New York on Friday and into the weekend.

However, there’s also a chance Debby isn’t captured by the jet stream and dissipates over the Southeast by the weekend. Some models show an outlier scenario in which it meanders back into the Gulf of Mexico and reorganizes, but that is improbable."

Tropical storm Debby live updates: Five killed after storm makes landfall in Florida as hurricane

Hurrcane Debby thrashed thrashed parts of Florida on Monday after making landfall and bringing risks of flooding, dangerous storm surge and power ourages.

The National Hurricane Center announced at around 7am that Debby had made landfall near Steinhatchee, Florida, with winds of 80 mph, making it a Category 1 storm. It has since been downgraded to a tropical storm.

The deadly winds ultimately led to the tragic death of a 13-year-old boy in Levy County after a tree fell on a mobile home and the death of a semi-truck driver in Hillsborough County after the truck veered off into a canal. Two other people, including a 12-year-old boy, were killed in a crash in Dixie County. A falling tree killed a fifth person, a 19-year-old, in Moultrie, Georgia.

Debby will travel across Florida before blowing through southern Georgia on Tuesday. The storm is forecasted to hit South Carolina Wednesday through Friday before calming.

More than 147,000 in the Sunshine State were without electricity as of late Monday, according to utilities tracking site PowerOutage.us.

Residents in Steinhatchee, Florida, which flooded during Hurricane Idalia, spent Sunday moving items to higher ground ahead of Hurricane Debby making landfall on Monday morning.

""I've been here 29 years. This isn't the first time I've done it. Do you get used to it? No,"" Mark Reblin, a resident told The Associated Press, as he moved items out of the liquor store he owns.

""Right now, we are trying secure everything from floating away,"" said Sheryl Horne, whose family owns the Shell Island Fish Camp along the Wakulla River in St Marks, Florida, where some customers moved their boats inland.

The Big Bend region was hit last year by Hurricane Idalia, which made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane.

""I am used to storms and I'm used to cleaning up after storms,"" Ms Horne said.

Dixie County woman and boy, 12, die in car crash due to ‘inclement weather’

Monday 5 August 2024 14:35 , James Liddell

Two Dixie County residents died in a single-vehicle crash on Sunday night as storms swirled ahead of Hurricane Debby making landfall on Monday.

A woman, 38, and a boy, 12, both from Crawfordville were pronounced dead at the scene, according to a Florida Highway Patrol statement. A third boy, 14, was seriously injured and taken to UF Health.

The vehicle was said to have struck a guardrail, causing it to flip and lose control, police said. The specific location or identity of those involved have not been disclosed.

A witness told the Florida Highway Patrol that the car lost control “due to inclement weather and wet roadway,” the statement read.

“After losing control, the vehicle struck the guardrail in the center median, then redirected, overturning, leaving the roadway to the right,” it added.

The crash is currently under investigation. The Independent has reached out to Florida Highway Patrol for more details.

Climate change is fueling a stronger hurricane season

Monday 5 August 2024 14:20 , James Liddell

Debby, which made landfall on Monday morning, intensified into a Category 1 hurricane amid a hurricane season that experts warn could be catastrophic as the climate crisis fuels rising ocean temperatures.

A study from Colorado State University published earlier this year predicted 23 tropical storms and hurricanes this year, the highest number they’ve predicted in their 20 years of work. The team says hotter oceans are to blame.

It seems their prediction has already come true: this year’s season started off with Hurricane Beryl, the earliest Category 5 storm on record due to warmer-than-average ocean temperatures. The catastrophic storm killed several people and flattened entire islands in the Caribbean.

Citrus County residents still recovering from Hurricane Idalia as Debby hits

Monday 5 August 2024 14:01 , James Liddell

Some residents in Citrus County are still finishing up on repairs and renovations after the devastating Hurricane Idalia in August last year as Hurricane Debby made landfall on Monday morning.

Idalia, a Category 3 hurricane, was the most powerful to hit the Big Bend for almost 75 years, causing $3.5bn worth of damage and taking the lives of up to 12 Floridians.

“We’re seeing a bit of a repeat of Hurricane Idalia. Thankfully, this one does not appear to be as strong,” Citrus County Commissioner Jeff Kinnard told CNN on Monday morning.

Kinnard says the county is better prepared to cope with the potential torrential conditions than it was a year ago.

“We’re prepared, the city’s prepared. And we’re just hoping for the best here,” he added.

Hurricane Debby finally made landfall in Steinhatchee in Taylor County – just 20 miles away from Hurricane Idalia’s landfall last year.

DeSantis urges Florida residents to avoid driving over risk of ‘traffic fatalities’

Monday 5 August 2024 12:57 , James Liddell

Gov. Ron DeSantis urged Florida residents in the Big Bend region to avoid driving as roads are likely to become increasingly flooded.

“When the water rises when, you have streets that could be flooded – that’s hazardous,” the Florida governor said during a live-streamed address on X on Monday.

“Please take the adequate precautions. Don’t try and drive through this. We don’t want to see traffic fatalities adding up because people went out there when the roads aren’t safe yet.”

He continued: “Please don’t tempt fate. Don’t try and go through these flooded streets.”

DeSantis’ warning comes after the National Hurricane Center warned of life-threatening storm surge and major flooding across the region as Hurricane Debby made landfall approximately 7.00 EDT in Steinhatchee on Monday.

‘Catastrophic flooding’ expected as Hurricane Debby makes landfall

Monday 5 August 2024 12:31 , James Liddell

Hurricane Debby has finally made landfall in the Big Bend on Monday morning.

The storm came ashore near the coastal town of Steinhatchee in Taylor County, Florida, at approximately 7.00am EDT, according to the National Hurricane Center.

The NHC has warned of major flooding and “life-threatening” storm surge as bands of rain sweep across the region.

The storm is predicted to move slowly across the Sunshine State with as much as 20 inches of rain expected to cause flooding as Debby shifts north.

“You’re talking about catastrophic flooding,” Jamie Rhome, the deputy director of the Hurricane Center, told the BBC.

More than 200,000 homes and businesses have been left without power at the time the storm made landfall.

Georgia and South Carolina are expected to be hit by the torrential conditions in coming days.

The landfall is within 20 miles of Hurricane Idalia’s landfall in August last year, which came ashore in the Big Bend of Florida as a Category 3 hurricane with 125 mph winds.

What is the difference between a weather watch and warning?

Monday 5 August 2024 11:00 , Stuti Mishra

The National Weather Service has issued several watches and warnings throughout the southeast US as Tropical Storm Debby approaches.

A warning, such as a Hurricane Warning or Storm Surge Warning, means residents should take immediate protective action.

“A warning means weather conditions pose a threat to life or property,” the NWS writes.

Meanwhile, a watch means residents should prepare for extreme weather. These may be issued when meteorologists don’t know the exact timing and severity of the event.

“ People should have a plan of action in case a storm threatens and they should listen for later information and possible warnings especially when planning travel or outdoor activities,” the NWS writes.

""We've got our stormwater drains cleared out. We've got our generators all checked and full. We're doing everything that we need to be prepared to face a tropical storm,"" Tampa mayor Jane Castor said.

Emergency managers in New England and New York were already monitoring the path of the storm for the possibility of remnants striking their states.

States including New York and Vermont have been hit by heavy rain and thunderstorms in recent weeks and were still coping with flooding and saturated ground.

A tornado watch was also in effect for parts of Florida and Georgia until 6am Monday.

Debbie could thrash Florida, Georgia and South Carolina with up to 30 inches of rain

Monday 5 August 2024 08:00 , Stuti Mishra

Debby could thrash the US southeast region with potential record-setting rains totalling up to 30 inches (76 centimetres) starting from Tuesday.

The Category 1 hurricane is expected to move eastward over northern Florida on Monday and then stall over the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina.

Officials also warned of life-threatening storm surge along Florida's Gulf Coast, with 6 to 10 feet of inundation expected Monday between the Ochlockonee and Suwannee rivers.

""There's some really amazing rainfall totals being forecast and amazing in a bad way,"" Michael Brennan, Miami director of the NOAA's National Hurricane Center, said at a briefing.

""That would be record-breaking rainfall associated with a tropical cyclone for both the states of Georgia and South Carolina if we got up to the 30 inch level.""

Flooding impacts could last through Friday and are expected to be especially severe in low-lying areas near the coast, including Savannah, Georgia; Hilton Head, South Carolina; and Charleston, South Carolina. North Carolina officials were monitoring the storm's progress.

Officials in Savannah said the area could see a month's worth of rain in four days if the system stalls over the region.

""This is going to a significant storm. The word historic cannot be underscored here,"" Savannah mayor Van R Johnson said during a press conference.

Tropical Storm Debby is expected to take a path similar to Hurricane Ian in 2022, Reuters reports.

Hurricane Ian, which peaked at Category 5, killed nearly 150 people in Florida and caused billions of dollars in damage across the state.

Meanwhile, Debby hit Category 1 before it makes landfall in Florida on Monday. Its path is also similar to Hurricane Idalia in 2023, Governor Ron DeSantis said. However, Debby could impact Tallahassee more than last year’s storm.

“It may very well have more impacts in the Tallahassee area than Idalia did,” DeSantis said.

Tropical Storm Debby strengthens into a Category 1 hurricane

Monday 5 August 2024 05:15 , Stuti Mishra

Tropical Storm Debby has strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane as it approaches Florida.

Forecasters at the National Hurricane Centre in Miami said on Sunday evening that the storm has maximum sustained winds of 75mph (120kph). It was located about 100 miles west southwest of Tampa, moving north at 12mph (19kph).

Debby is the fourth named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season after Tropical Storm Alberto, Hurricane Beryl and Tropical Storm Chris, all of which formed in June.

Forecasters warn that heavy amounts of rain from Debby could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia.

Debby could bring ‘potentially historic flooding’

Monday 5 August 2024 04:34 , Stuti Mishra

AccuWeather meteorologists say Debby could rapidly intensify into a hurricane later today in the Gulf of Mexico before it makes landfall in Florida tomorrow and produce potentially catastrophic flooding across the Southeast.

“The flooding threat from Debby could lead to a life-threatening and catastrophic flooding disaster in communities across the Southeast if this storm slows down or stalls out,” said AccuWeather's chief meteorologist Jon Porter.

“The combination of hours of relentless, heavy rain and a persistent onshore flow could prevent rivers and waterways from draining into the Atlantic, making the flooding impacts even worse.""

""Do not be lulled into any false sense of security that Debby is presently rated as a tropical storm on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. There are many cases, such as Florence in 2018, where a Category 1 hurricane or tropical storm caused catastrophic flooding.”

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has mobilized the National Guard as local officials order thousands of coastal residents to evacuate ahead of Tropical Storm Debby.

The system is expected to strengthen into a Category 1 hurricane as it makes landfall in Florida’s Big Bend region on Monday. 3,000 members of the National Guard are now standing by to help the state through “life-threatening” storm surge, heavy rain and catastrophic flooding.

“Take the situation seriously,” Paul Hasenmeier, Hernando County fire chief, told residents on Saturday night. “We know the water is going to come up as the storm passes.”

DeSantis has placed more than 60 of Florida’s counties under a state of emergency as the storm approaches. He warned that residents should prepare for “pretty catastrophic” weather.

“Just because you are not in the eye of the storm doesn’t mean you’re not going to have major, major effects,” DeSantis said on Sunday morning.

Hurricane Debby has become a Category 1 storm, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Hurricane Debby has become a Category 1 storm, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Hurricane Debby has become a Category 1 storm, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Hurricane Debby has become a Category 1 storm, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Hurricane Debby, the fourth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season and the second named hurricane has become a Category 1 storm, according to the National Hurricane Center.

The storm, located about 100 miles west-northwest of Tampa, Florida, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph, is expected to make landfall in Florida's Big Bend region Monday morning.

""Debby is then expected to move slowly across northern Florida and southern Georgia Monday and Tuesday, and be near the Georgia coast by Tuesday night,"" the hurricane center said in its 11 p.m. advisory.

Debby began dumping rain on parts of the state earlier Sunday as a tropical storm and is expected to unload potentially historic amounts of rainfall over the southeastern United States.

Authorities in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina are urging residents to prepare for heavy rain and possible flooding as the storm makes its way through the Gulf.

The cities of Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, could both be drenched with a month's worth of rain in a single day - and perhaps even an entire summer's worth of rain over the course of the storm.

Debby will likely strengthen further before it reaches the coast, the hurricane center warned.

Hurricane conditions are expected to arrive by Monday morning, with the outer bands of the storm system making their way on shore during the day Sunday. The storm is forecast to reach the coast of the Big Bend around midday Monday, at which point Debby is expected to then crawl across northern Florida and southern Georgia throughout the day and into Tuesday, the hurricane center said.

The main threat will be flooding, both from storm surges up to 10 feet and heavy rainfall. Freshwater flooding, which is caused by rainfall, has become the deadliest aspect of tropical systems in the last decade, according to research conducted by the Hurricane Center - a threat made more dangerous as the world warms from fossil fuel pollution.

The strengthening storm tracking up the Florida Peninsula's western coast prompted county and state officials to issue a string of voluntary and mandatory evacuation orders as the hurricane center posted hurricane watches and warnings across several parts of the state, including near Tampa and the Big Bend region.

Tropical storm and storm surge watches and warnings have also been issued for parts of Florida, coastal Georgia and parts of South Carolina. The hurricane center upgraded a tropical storm watch to a warning for the area west of Indian Pass to Mexico Beach, Florida, in its 5 p.m. ET update, and a tropical storm warning was also issued for the eastern coasts of Florida and Georgia from Ponte Vedra Beach to the Savannah River.

A tornado watch has also been issued for much of the Florida Peninsula and parts of southern Georgia until Monday morning, covering more than 13 million people, including the cities of Tallahassee, Jacksonville, Tampa and Orlando.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster have declared states of emergency for their states in advance of the storm's arrival. DeSantis on Sunday said in a news conference that he'd activated the Florida National Guard so it would be poised to assist with humanitarian needs as well as search and rescue.

DeSantis called on residents to finish their preparations and to brace for power outages, ""particularly in parts of the state like here in Tallahassee.""

""There's going to be a lot of trees that are going to fall down. You're going to have debris. You are going to have power interruption,"" the governor said, ""so just prepare for that.""

More than 60,000 customers were already without power in Florida and more than 14,000 had lost electricity in Georgia by Sunday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.

DeSantis also urged Florida residents to avoid floodwaters ahead of the storm's potentially significant flooding impacts, particularly in North Central Florida.

""Please do not drive your vehicles through flooded streets. The number one way we have fatalities as a result of floods is people trying to drive through the floodwater,"" he said.

The docks of Indian Mound Park in Sarasota County, south of Tampa, were underwater by 2 p.m. ET Sunday, the county government posted on X. A little farther south, near Fort Myers, waters from the Gulf began spilling over onto coastal roadways and prompted some road closures after Debby's outer bands dumped rain along the shoreline Sunday afternoon, Charlotte County emergency management officials said.

President Joe Biden on Sunday approved a disaster declaration for Florida, the White House announced, authorizing federal resources to respond to any disaster relief efforts.

Storm expected to intensify over Gulf

The slower Debby moves and the longer it sits over warm waters, the more likely the storm is to intensify. Studies have shown tropical systems are slowing down over time, making them more likely to produce greater rainfall totals over a given area.

Oceans are also getting warmer and supercharging storms, pumping them full of moisture. A 2022 study published in the journal Nature Communications found climate change increased hourly rainfall rates in tropical storms by 5 to 10% and in hurricanes by 8 to 11%.

""Conditions are favorable for strengthening over the Gulf of Mexico with warm sea surface temperatures and light shear. Intensification is likely to be slow during the first 12-24 hours, then proceed at a faster rate after the cyclone develops an organized inner core,"" the National Hurricane Center said of Debby.

By early Monday, Debby is expected to move into the Apalachee Bay area of Florida as it moves northward over the Gulf, according to the Weather Prediction Center.

The Apalachee Bay area, which includes parts of Taylor, Jefferson, Wakulla, and Franklin counties, can expect to get drenched with heavy rain from Debby on Sunday, increasing the possibility of flash flooding in several spots, the hurricane center said.

In the meantime, county officials have urged residents in communities along Florida's Gulf Coast to evacuate ahead of the storm. Mandatory evacuation orders are in effect for parts of Franklin, Citrus and Levy counties, with voluntary orders issued in Hernando, Taylor and Pasco counties.

""I am worried about the aftermath and seeing how much damage we get (and) how we are going to fix it,"" Sue Colson, the mayor of Cedar Key in Levy County, told CNN Sunday. The city sits on the island of Way Key in the Gulf of Mexico, about four miles off the coast. She cited high amounts of anticipated rain as well as the threat of storm surge.

""That is always concerning when you are a low-lying island in the middle of the Gulf,"" she said.

On Saturday, Florida Highway Patrol knocked on doors to tell residents to consider leaving, Colson said. Residents were continuing to finish their preparations on Sunday morning.

""I think everybody needs to make wise decisions for themselves and not endanger others by endangering yourself,"" she said. ""If you're endangering yourself, you are endangering others, because then they have to rescue you.""

Heavy rain could linger for days

As a slow-moving Debby churns along the Georgia-Carolina coastline heading into the new week, it could lead to seemingly endless amounts of rain for days, with totals potentially reaching over 2 feet.

The heaviest rain amounts could even top 30 inches or more, depending on how long Debby meanders, with some forecast models showing the storm could linger through at least Thursday. ""This rainfall will likely result in areas of considerable flash and urban flooding, with significant river flooding expected,"" the National Hurricane Center said.

Such exceptional rainfall would challenge state records for rain from a tropical cyclone: In Georgia, the record is 27.85 inches from 1994's Alberto, while South Carolina's record is 23.63 inches from Florence in 2018.

A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture and can dump heavier rain. Warmer oceans can fuel stronger hurricanes, packing a punch with higher storm surge thanks to sea-level rise.

With an uptick in the intensity forecast comes an increase in forecasted storm surge, which occurs when ocean water is pushed inland by the onshore winds of a hurricane. Storm surge flooding above ground could rise to 6 to 10 feet along Florida's Big Bend, and coastal Georgia and South Carolina could see surges reach 2 to 4 feet.

Tampa Bay is expecting 2 to 4 feet of storm surge. Marco Island and other areas of southwest Florida will see 1 to 3 feet of storm surge.

Warmer air and ocean temperatures fueled by human-induced climate change can lead to wetter tropical systems.

The North Florida region nestled between the Panhandle and the rest of the state's peninsula took a devastating hit last August from Category 3 Hurricane Idalia, and now faces a new threat from Debby.

"Tropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia.",https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/florida/articles/2024-08-04/tropical-storm-debby-moves-through-gulf-toward-florida-with-hurricane-warnings,"TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Tropical Storm Debby strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane as it approached Florida on Sunday evening, according to the national weather service.

Debby is the fourth named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season after Tropical Storm Alberto, Hurricane Beryl and Tropical Storm Chris, all of which formed in June.

Forecasters warned heavy amounts of rain from Debby could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia.

The storm was expected to make landfall around midday Monday in the Big Bend area of Florida, the hurricane center said. A tornado watch also was in effect for parts of Florida and Georgia until 6 a.m. Monday.

“Right now, we are trying secure everything from floating away,"" said Sheryl Horne, whose family owns the Shell Island Fish Camp along the Wakulla River in St. Marks, Florida, where some customers moved their boats inland. The sparsely populated Big Bend region in the Florida Panhandle was hit last year by Hurricane Idalia, which made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane.

“I am used to storms and I’m used to cleaning up after storms,” Horne said.

Debby was expected to move eastward over northern Florida and then stall over the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina, thrashing the region with potential record-setting rains totaling up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) beginning Tuesday. Officials also warned of life-threatening storm surge along Florida’s Gulf Coast, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation expected Monday between the Ochlockonee and Suwannee rivers.

“There’s some really amazing rainfall totals being forecast and amazing in a bad way,” Michael Brennan, director of the hurricane center, said at a briefing. “That would be record-breaking rainfall associated with a tropical cyclone for both the states of Georgia and South Carolina if we got up to the 30-inch level.”

Flooding impacts could last through Friday and are expected to be especially severe in low-lying areas near the coast, including Savannah, Georgia; Hilton Head, South Carolina; and Charleston, South Carolina. North Carolina officials were monitoring the storm's progress.

Officials in Savannah said the area could see a month’s worth of rain in four days if the system stalls over the region.

“This is going to a significant storm. The word historic cannot be underscored here,” Savannah Mayor Van. R. Johnson said during a press conference.

The hurricane center said at 11 p.m. that Debby was located about 100 miles (161 kilometers) west of Tampa, Florida, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph). The storm was moving north at 12 mph (19 kph).

Debby's outer bands grazed the west coast of Florida, flooding streets and bringing power outages. Sarasota County officials said most roadways on Siesta Key, a barrier island off the coast of Sarasota, were under water. The hurricane center had predicted the system would strengthen as it curved off the southwest Florida coast, where the water has been extremely warm.

At a briefing Sunday afternoon, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned the storm could lead to “really, really significant flooding that will happen in North Central Florida.”

The storm would follow a similar track to Hurricane Idalia but would “be much wetter. We are going to see much more inundation,"" he said.

A hurricane warning was issued for parts of the Big Bend and Florida Panhandle areas, while tropical storm warnings were posted for Florida’s West Coast, the southern Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas. A tropical storm watch extended farther west into the Panhandle.

Tropical storms and hurricanes can trigger river flooding and overwhelm drainage systems and canals. Forecasters warned of 6 to 12 inches (15 centimeters to 30 centimeters) of rain and up to 18 inches (46 centimeters) in isolated areas of Florida.

Storm surge expected to hit Gulf Coast, including Tampa Bay

Flat Florida is prone to flooding even on sunny days and the storm was predicted to bring a surge of 2 to 4 feet (0.6 to 1.2 meters) along most of the Gulf Coast, including Tampa Bay, with a storm tide of up to 7 feet (2.1 meters) north of there in the Big Bend region.

Forecasters warned of “a danger of life-threatening storm surge inundation” in a region that includes Hernando Beach, Crystal River, Steinhatchee and Cedar Key. Officials in Citrus and Levy counties ordered a mandatory evacuation of coastal areas, while those in Hernando, Manatee, Pasco and Taylor counties called for voluntary evacuations. Shelters opened in those and some other counties.

Citrus County Sheriff Mike Prendergast estimated 21,000 people live in his county’s evacuation zone.

Residents, businesses prepare for flooding

Residents in Steinhatchee, Florida, which flooded during Hurricane Idalia, spent Sunday moving items to higher ground.

“I’ve been here 29 years. This isn’t the first time I’ve done it. Do you get used to it? No,” Mark Reblin said as he moved items out of the liquor store he owns.

Employees of Savannah Canoe and Kayak in Georgia said they were busy tying down their watercrafts, laying sandbags, and raising equipment off the ground. Mayme Bouy, the store manager, said she wasn’t too concerned about the forecast calling for a potential historic rain event.

“But we do have some high tides this week so if the rain is happening around then, that could be bad,” Bouy added. “I’d rather play it safe than sorry.”

Governors declare emergencies ahead of landfall

DeSantis declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida’s 67 counties, with the National Guard activating 3,000 guard members. Utility crews from in and out of state were ready to restore power after the storm, he said in a post on X. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster made their own emergency declarations.

In Tampa alone, officials gave out more than 30,000 sandbags to barricade against flooding.

“We’ve got our stormwater drains cleared out. We’ve got our generators all checked and full. We’re doing everything that we need to be prepared to face a tropical storm,” Tampa Mayor Jane Castor said.

Northeast coast also preparing for storm conditions

Emergency managers in New England and New York were already monitoring the path of the storm for the possibility of remnants striking their states. States including New York and Vermont have been hit by heavy rain and thunderstorms in recent weeks and were still coping with flooding and saturated ground.

TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Tropical Storm Debby has strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane as it approaches Florida.

Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Miami said on Sunday evening that the storm has maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph). The storm was located about 100 miles west southwest of Tamapa and it was moving north at 12 mph (19 kph).

Debby is the fourth named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season after Tropical Storm Alberto, Hurricane Beryl and Tropical Storm Chris, all of which formed in June.

Forecasters warn that heavy amounts of rain from Debby could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia.

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.

TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Tropical Storm Debby was strengthening rapidly Sunday and was expected to become a hurricane as it churned through the Gulf of Mexico toward Florida, bringing heavy bands of rain to that state and with it the threat of devastating floods to the southeast Atlantic coast later in the week.

The storm was likely to become a strong Category 1 hurricane before making landfall around midday Monday in the Big Bend area of Florida, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. A tornado watch was also in effect for parts of Florida and Georgia until 6 a.m. Monday.

“Right now, we are trying secure everything from floating away,” said Sheryl Horne, whose family owns the Shell Island Fish Camp along the Wakulla River in St. Marks, Florida, where some customers moved their boats inland.

For the latest on the storm, view USA TODAY's live updates file for Monday, Aug. 5.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. − Debby strengthened into a hurricane late Sunday, moving closer to Florida's Big Bend and potentially bringing the threat of life-threatening storm surge and rain totals that could reach 30 inches in parts of the Southeast by week's end. show less

Debby, which formed Saturday and became the fourth named storm of the season, strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane, the National Hurricane Center announced late Sunday. The storm is located about 100 miles west-northwest of Tampa, Florida, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph.

The hurricane, fueled by warm waters of the Gulf, was moving northward at about 12 miles per hour, the National Hurricane Center said. Hurricane force winds extended up to 45 miles from the center and tropical storm force winds extend outward up to 140 miles from the center.

""This potentially historic rainfall may result in areas of catastrophic flooding,"" Richard Pasch, a senior hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, wrote in a public advisory that warned of a ""life-threatening situation.""

Floridians were bracing for the state's first hurricane strike this year in a season that forecasters say could become one of the worst on record. Mandatory evacuations were being ordered ahead of Debby in parts of multiple counties. Leon County, home to Tallahassee, was opening up six shelters in schools around the county.

A lack of strong steering currents in the atmosphere means Debby will take a slow, soaking stroll after a Florida landfall through the Southeast, making it a multi-state threat. “After landfall, it’s going to slow to a crawl,” Michael Brennan, hurricane center director, said Sunday.

Gov. Ron DeSantis said Sunday that the Florida National Guard and Florida State Guard were activated to support humanitarian assistance and search and rescue missions. He warned that hazards such as strong winds, storm surge and tornadoes can occur before landfall, even outside the forecasted ""cone."" Sustained winds could reach up to 95 mph, he said

President Joe Biden declared an emergency across Florida, authorizing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate disaster relief efforts for the ""purpose of alleviating the hardship and suffering caused by the emergency on the local population.""

Developments:

∎ The National Weather Services issued a series of flash flood warnings. Warnings are in effect for Manatee and Western Sarasota counties until 11:30 p.m.; Hillsborough, Pasco, and Pinellas have warnings until 11:15 p.m.

∎ NWS officials issued a tornado watch for much of Northern Florida and Southeast Georgia Sunday evening. The watch covers an area where nearly 12 million people live and is in effect until 6 a.m. Monday. The Storm Prediction Center shared reports of six tornadoes across Florida by around 11 p.m. Sunday.

∎ Nearly 2,000 flights had been canceled and close to 6,300 were delayed as of 5 p.m. ET, according to flight tracking site FlightAware. American Airlines and JetBlue saw the highest cancellation numbers among major carriers, both scrapping 17% of their schedules.

∎ Carnival Cruise Line’s Carnival Elation rescheduled its return to Jacksonville for Sunday, rather than Monday as planned. The ship departed from the Florida city for a Bahamas cruise on Thursday, according to CruiseMapper.

∎ South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency Sunday afternoon ahead of any potential impact by Debby. He warned that heavy rainfall early in the week could bring flash foods and that residents should begin storm preparations immediately.

∎ The number of power outages reported throughout Florida climbed to over 75,000 by 11:00 p.m. on Sunday, according to USA TODAY's outage tracker. Over 15% of customers in Levy County reported outages.

'Impacts are going to be from water':Debby shows there's more to a storm than wind scale

Debby aims for Florida's Big Bend

The hurricane center forecasts landfall Monday morning in Florida’s Big Bend − where the state's panhandle meets its peninsula − somewhere between the Suwannee River south of Tallahassee and the Ochlockonee River in the Panhandle west of Tallahassee. Debby will make landfall with a maximum sustained winds of 74 to 95 miles per hour, according to AccuWeather Senior Director of Forecasting Operations Dan DePodwin.

Forecasters issued a hurricane warning for the Florida Gulf Coast from Yankeetown to Indian Pass. They issued a tropical storm warning for the area south of Yankeetown to Boca Grande, west of Indian Pass to Mexico Beach; and Ponte Vedra Beach to South Santee River, South Carolina.

The area between the Suwanee and Ochlockonee Rivers could flood with up to 10 feet of water, the hurricane center reported. Accuweather forecasted even greater surges for the Big Bend region of up to 15 feet.

Road closures in Florida due to flooding

Officials across Southwest Florida began reporting roads closed due to flooding Sunday afternoon ahead of Debby’s expected landfall Monday.

Sheriff Carmine Marceno of Lee County deployed the agency's ""swamp buggy,"" a 5,000-pound vehicle that can move through waters up to four feet deep to pick up people stranded by the storm, according to public information officer Todd Olmer.

Marceno said roads throughout Fort Myers Beach were flooded.

Sarasota County officials warned that several roads in the area were shut down due to flooding. The North Casey Key Road was closed, leaving residents unable to get on or off the key; erosion caused by the storm undermined roads leading into Caspersen Beach near the city of Venice; and rocks used for shoreline stabilization were washed onto the Manasota Key Road by flooding that left the area underwater.

Sandra Tapfumaneyi, chief of the county’s Emergency Management Agency, urged residents to stay home, call 311 for help and, if on the road, ""turn around, don’t drown.""

Areas from Sarasota north through Tampa and Tarpon Springs have already seen an impressive 4 to 8 inches of rainfall, the Weather Prediction Center reported. Forecasters expect the rate of rain falling could increase to 2 to 3 inches per hour and add up to 6 more inches of rain to the total, according to the WPC.

Winds around Tampa Bay became so severe that at 10 p.m. the Florida Highway Patrol announced they were closing the Skyway Bridge.

What makes Debby so dangerous?

Debby is big and slow, making the storm particularly dangerous, especially along the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina. The size and increase in the wind speed as Debby gets organized and potentially becomes a hurricane creates a high risk of life-threatening storm surges along the Florida coast early Monday. The surge will be the highest where the storm crosses the coast.

The hurricane center is forecasting that Debby could rapidly intensify, which could put its winds as high as 90 mph at landfall. That could help push a wall of water 6-10 feet above ground level. The higher level would occur if the storm approaches at high tide.

Clouds ahead of the storm already were reaching across much of Florida on Sunday, and the storm’s center is forecast to move near Savannah on Tuesday night and drag along the South Carolina Coast on Thursday night.

""Multiple days of very, very heavy rainfall"" are possible, Brennan said.

The National Weather Service estimates rainfall totals could reach up to 30 inches or more in isolated locations along the coast through Friday. The weather service office in Charleston, South Carolina, called it a ""potentially historic rainfall.""

Mayor warns residents: Don't rely on first responders

The storm arrived less than three months after a tornado outbreak that brought widespread destruction to Tallahassee. Mayor John Dailey said mutual-aid workers were arriving later in the day from Louisiana and Alabama to help with power restoration and that other crews were ready to respond from across Florida.

“Downed trees are expected,” Dailey said. “Power outages are expected. Localized flooding is expected. Please prepare your household, knowing that there could be a time when first responders cannot reach you.”

Storm could trigger tornadoes in Florida, Georgia

A hurricane warning has been issued for the Big Bend region, according to the National Weather Service. That warning stretches west along the Gulf Coast toward the Ochlockonee River. A storm surge warning was issued from Longboat Key to Tampa Bay.

A few tornadoes are possible through Monday morning, mainly over western and northern Florida and southern Georgia, the hurricane center said.

The weather service's Storm Prediction Center shared reports of six tornadoes on Sunday. The reports came from Hardee, Polk, Pinellas, Union and Columbia counties. The reported tornado in Pinellas damaged a fence and a trailer around 10 p.m.

Swells generated by Debby are expected to affect much of the Gulf coast of Florida through Monday, reach the Southeast U.S. coast on Monday, and continue through the middle of the week.

""These conditions are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions,"" Pasch warned.

"Tropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia.",https://www.wjhg.com/2024/08/04/tropical-storm-debby-predicted-reach-hurricane-strength-before-hitting-florida/,"TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Tropical Storm Debby strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane as it approached Florida on Sunday evening, according to the national weather service.

Debby is the fourth named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season after Tropical Storm Alberto, Hurricane Beryl and Tropical Storm Chris, all of which formed in June.

Forecasters warned heavy amounts of rain from Debby could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia.

The storm was expected to make landfall around midday Monday in the Big Bend area of Florida, the hurricane center said. A tornado watch also was in effect for parts of Florida and Georgia until 6 a.m. Monday.

“Right now, we are trying secure everything from floating away,” said Sheryl Horne, whose family owns the Shell Island Fish Camp along the Wakulla River in St. Marks, Florida, where some customers moved their boats inland. The sparsely populated Big Bend region in the Florida Panhandle was hit last year by Hurricane Idalia, which made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane.

“I am used to storms and I’m used to cleaning up after storms,” Horne said.

Debby was expected to move eastward over northern Florida and then stall over the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina, thrashing the region with potential record-setting rains totaling up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) beginning Tuesday. Officials also warned of life-threatening storm surge along Florida’s Gulf Coast, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation expected Monday between the Ochlockonee and Suwannee rivers.

“There’s some really amazing rainfall totals being forecast and amazing in a bad way,” Michael Brennan, director of the hurricane center, said at a briefing. “That would be record-breaking rainfall associated with a tropical cyclone for both the states of Georgia and South Carolina if we got up to the 30-inch level.”

Flooding impacts could last through Friday and are expected to be especially severe in low-lying areas near the coast, including Savannah, Georgia; Hilton Head, South Carolina; and Charleston, South Carolina. North Carolina officials were monitoring the storm’s progress.

Officials in Savannah said the area could see a month’s worth of rain in four days if the system stalls over the region.

“This is going to a significant storm. The word historic cannot be underscored here,” Savannah Mayor Van. R. Johnson said during a press conference.

The hurricane center said at 11 p.m. that Debby was located about 100 miles (161 kilometers) west of Tampa, Florida, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph). The storm was moving north at 12 mph (19 kph).

Debby’s outer bands grazed the west coast of Florida, flooding streets and bringing power outages. Sarasota County officials said most roadways on Siesta Key, a barrier island off the coast of Sarasota, were under water. The hurricane center had predicted the system would strengthen as it curved off the southwest Florida coast, where the water has been extremely warm.

At a briefing Sunday afternoon, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned the storm could lead to “really, really significant flooding that will happen in North Central Florida.”

The storm would follow a similar track to Hurricane Idalia but would “be much wetter. We are going to see much more inundation,” he said.

A hurricane warning was issued for parts of the Big Bend and Florida Panhandle areas, while tropical storm warnings were posted for Florida’s West Coast, the southern Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas. A tropical storm watch extended farther west into the Panhandle.

Tropical storms and hurricanes can trigger river flooding and overwhelm drainage systems and canals. Forecasters warned of 6 to 12 inches (15 centimeters to 30 centimeters) of rain and up to 18 inches (46 centimeters) in isolated areas of Florida.

Storm surge expected to hit Gulf Coast, including Tampa Bay

Flat Florida is prone to flooding even on sunny days and the storm was predicted to bring a surge of 2 to 4 feet (0.6 to 1.2 meters) along most of the Gulf Coast, including Tampa Bay, with a storm tide of up to 7 feet (2.1 meters) north of there in the Big Bend region.

Forecasters warned of “a danger of life-threatening storm surge inundation” in a region that includes Hernando Beach, Crystal River, Steinhatchee and Cedar Key. Officials in Citrus and Levy counties ordered a mandatory evacuation of coastal areas, while those in Hernando, Manatee, Pasco and Taylor counties called for voluntary evacuations. Shelters opened in those and some other counties.

Citrus County Sheriff Mike Prendergast estimated 21,000 people live in his county’s evacuation zone.

Residents, businesses prepare for flooding

Residents in Steinhatchee, Florida, which flooded during Hurricane Idalia, spent Sunday moving items to higher ground.

“I’ve been here 29 years. This isn’t the first time I’ve done it. Do you get used to it? No,” Mark Reblin said as he moved items out of the liquor store he owns.

Employees of Savannah Canoe and Kayak in Georgia said they were busy tying down their watercrafts, laying sandbags, and raising equipment off the ground. Mayme Bouy, the store manager, said she wasn’t too concerned about the forecast calling for a potential historic rain event.

“But we do have some high tides this week so if the rain is happening around then, that could be bad,” Bouy added. “I’d rather play it safe than sorry.”

Florida and Georgia are bracing for what could become a category 1 hurricane. (WFTS)

Governors declare emergencies ahead of landfall

DeSantis declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida’s 67 counties, with the National Guard activating 3,000 guard members. Utility crews from in and out of state were ready to restore power after the storm, he said in a post on X. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster made their own emergency declarations.

In Tampa alone, officials gave out more than 30,000 sandbags to barricade against flooding.

“We’ve got our stormwater drains cleared out. We’ve got our generators all checked and full. We’re doing everything that we need to be prepared to face a tropical storm,” Tampa Mayor Jane Castor said.

Northeast coast also preparing for storm conditions

Emergency managers in New England and New York were already monitoring the path of the storm for the possibility of remnants striking their states. States including New York and Vermont have been hit by heavy rain and thunderstorms in recent weeks and were still coping with flooding and saturated ground.

Pro-Israel interests pour millions into defeating a second ‘Squad’ member.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/05/israel-house-election-cori-bush-aipac/,"ST. LOUIS — The mail carrier arrived to deliver the attack ads at the same time Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) arrived to dispel them. “He’s about to hand you some lies about me,” Bush said as the carrier handed a glossy leaflet to a voter at a home in Old North St. Louis where she was canvassing for votes.

“All we ever see about you are negative ads,” the woman barked back at her as she pulled the handbill out of a stack of mail. “You need to get some of your own!”

“It’s because I called for a cease-fire in Gaza,” Bush replied. “That’s where all of this started.”

In Missouri’s 1st Congressional District, the pro-Israel lobby is pouring millions into a campaign to unseat Bush as part of a broader, well-funded effort to replace critics of the Israeli government and the war in Gaza, such as Bush, with more Israel-friendly Democrats. Outside groups have already spent over $15 million in this race, according to Open Secrets, a Washington nonprofit that tracks campaign finance and lobbying data. More than 80 percent of that money has gone toward ads opposing Bush and supporting her opponent.

Advertisement

A prominent member of the Squad of far-left Democrats, Bush was the first member of Congress to call for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, nine days after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel. She has described Israel’s subsequent invasion of Gaza — which, according to the Gaza health ministry, has killed nearly 40,000 Palestinians — as a genocide. (Israel has denied the allegation in hearings at the U.N.’s top court.)

Bush is facing a tight primary contest Tuesday against St. Louis county prosecutor Wesley Bell, who is backed by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a powerful pro-Israel group. By the end of June, Bell, a former member of the city council who pushed for policy changes after a police officer killed 18-year-old Michael Brown in 2014, had four times more cash on hand than the incumbent.

Bell and Bush are liberal Black Democrats who were born and raised here and who entered public service after protests against police shooting unarmed Black men. Both are beating back allegations of improper behavior: Bush faces a federal investigation over allegations that she misused campaign funds to hire her husband to provide security, and Bell faces a civil trial that has been delayed until January over allegations that he fired people based on their gender, age and race. Both candidates have denied wrongdoing.

But other than their conflicting positions on Israel — which has not been mentioned in any of the ads AIPAC’s Super PAC, the United Democracy Project, has spent $8.86 million on — the dispute seems to be over political style. At the heart of the race is a question: Should voters here elect a candidate who will vote with the Democratic Party, or one who will challenge its direction?

AIPAC and other pro-Israel groups spent $17 million to help defeat Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) in a June contest that became the most expensive House primary in U.S. history but could be surpassed by this race. Bush, an outspoken critic of Israel’s nine-month war in Gaza, is their next target.

The National Black Empowerment Action Fund, founded by AIPAC veteran Darius Jones, threw $1 million to the race last week. Jones described Bush as an “extremist” who uses her position to champion issues that will elevate her own profile to the detriment of the Black community.

At the voter’s home in Old North St. Louis, the constituent and the mail carrier said the huge numbers of ads had left them deeply confused about what to believe.

While Bush says her constituents resent having their tax money funding the bombing of civilians — drawing parallels to the Black Lives Matter movement — Bell said in an interview that she is “wrong” in her stance and that while he does not want to see “a single innocent civilian hurt,” he would continue to stand with Israel against a “genocidal” Hamas.

In interviews, most of the more than a dozen voters across the district did not know that a difference in opinions over the Middle East had triggered the flood of money into their local primary. Most also said that although they found the issue important, it would likely not be a deciding factor in who they vote for. In a district with a lower-than-average median household income and some of the highest rates of violent crime in the country, voters are worried about inflation, the cost of living and safety.

Jovan Manuel, 35, was one of the many voters who said that while the war embroiling the Middle East is awful, it would not affect his vote. “As far as I know, it’s a centuries old issue … We have to prioritize us, our children, our schools, instead of trying to fix that,” he said.

Spending a Saturday afternoon in a park in Ferguson with his family, he said he was not aware that pro-Israel groups were supporting Bell’s campaign. “I don’t know how I feel about that,” he said. “But people around here are fed up of Cori [Bush] and feel like she hasn’t done enough,” he said, adding that his vote would still likely go to Bush’s opponent.

Ads funded by the UDP and Bell’s campaign have largely focused on Bush’s two terms on Capitol Hill, pointing out how the activist-turned-lawmaker voted against several major Democratic or bipartisan bills that President Biden ultimately signed into law. Bell, who was also a liberal activist before becoming a prosecutor for the county, has pledged to work with the Democratic Party to pass major initiatives rather than “grandstand,” as he mentions in his campaign ad.

Patrick Dorton, a spokesman for UDP, said its endorsement of Bell was because of Bush’s “horrific anti-Israel record” as well as her “record of voting against President Biden and the interests of her own St Louis district.”

“I don’t know what Cori Bush is doing in Washington, but she’s not helping us here … She fights with Biden, she votes against our jobs, she gets nothing for us,” a man wearing a hi-vis jacket says in one of UDP’s ads. “I have had enough of Cori Bush, she did not deliver for St. Louis.”

In an interview, Bell denied being actively recruited by AIPAC, saying he had no communication with the group before he decided to run for Congress. He call AIPAC “an interest group just like clean energy is an interest group.”

Those in Bush’s camp see it differently. In her ads, Bush has said “St. Louis is not for sale,” attacking Republicans for meddling in the primary.

“Wesley Bell is taking money directly from the same Republican megadonors spending millions to elect Donald Trump and JD Vance to the White House,” said Usamah Andrabi, a spokesperson for Justice Democrats, a liberal political action committee dedicated to electing far-left candidates to Congress that has poured $2.3 million into the race.

“It’s deceitful,” Bush said in an interview. “If AIPAC and UDP decided to run [Bell] because they want someone who is going to say that they stand 100 percent with Israel … then say that in the commercials.” She views it as a projection of AIPAC’s power. “What they want to do is show that if you go against them, then you are at risk,” she added.

Bush’s personal story resonates with many voters here. She catapulted into the national spotlight as an outspoken activist during the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, which gave her momentum to unseat Rep. William Lacy Clay, a centrist Democrat who held the office for two decades. Bush has since spoken openly — given that abortion is on the ballot in Missouri in November — about being raped and getting an abortion when she was younger. She has also recounted facing eviction. Her most notable act in Congress may have been protesting the expiration of the pandemic eviction moratorium by sleeping three nights on the House steps in 2021, which ultimately resulted in a temporary extension of the policy.

But after four years, Bush’s outsize, outspoken personality now appears to polarize her district. Voters describe her either as one of the most authentic St. Louisans they could have in office and a breath of fresh air, or as someone who has prioritized her personal politics above her district’s interests.

One of her biggest local vulnerabilities is that she voted against Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Act, drawing the ire of local labor unions, many of which are now backing Bell.

Bush has also missed 187 votes between January 2023 and June 2024, making her fifth among lawmakers with the most missed votes, according to an analysis by Derek P. Willis of the University of Maryland and reviewed by The Washington Post. Of the four members who missed more votes, two were being treated for cancer, one had a spouse who died suddenly and one was running for president. Bush’s office acknowledges she missed 100 votes over three days for a covid diagnosis, 56 votes one week after the sudden death of a loved one, and several after surgery.

Bush remains under federal investigation into use of campaign finances over allegations of improperly hiring her husband to provide security. In a Jan. 30 meeting, Bush told staff that improperly using campaign funds could be viewed as “messed up,” according to an audio recording provided to The Post.

“One thing to remember is, there are people who are very, very angry with us, powerful people who are angry with us because we say ‘cease-fire,’” she said then.

Bush also told staff that the Justice Department was investigating her to prevent the appearance of a Democratic administration avoiding looking into Democrats. She encouraged her staff to stick by her — like the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s followers did while he was being investigated — and suggested that the government was using similar tactics as COINTELPRO, a reference to the 1960s-era FBI counterintelligence program to try to derail uprising radical movements.

“Look at what’s happening, the history-making moment that we are in the middle of. Do we run from it because it’s tough … or do we push through and walk through it and come out on the other side victorious for the people who need us the most,” Bush told staff. “Can I make a mistake? Absolutely, we all can make mistakes. I’m not infallible.”

In a statement responding to both the audio and the investigation, Bush said it was her “understanding from my attorneys that the investigation appears to be concluded and we are just waiting on formal word from the Department of Justice,” which she thinks will “find no wrongdoing.”

The Justice Department declined to comment.

Bell awaits a civil trial in a discrimination lawsuit filed against him by a former assistant prosecutor who claims he fired her and other prosecutors because of their age, gender and race. And though he drew support from the activist community early in his career after making his name as someone who mediated between protesters and the police, many were dismayed when he declined to prosecute Darren Wilson, who killed Brown in 2014. The Department of Justice also declined to prosecute Wilson.

Bell’s detractors also accuse him of opportunism, pointing to the fact that he had been running against Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) — a race he was unlikely to win — until shortly after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack in Israel, when he dropped out to challenge Bush. He said that decision was rooted in his view that Bush was more interested in issues he sees as lower priorities for people in the district."

Pro-Israel interests pour millions into defeating a second ‘Squad’ member.,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/rep-jamaal-bowman-faces-tough-043936010.html,"George Latimer, a pro-Israel centrist, defeated U.S. Rep. Jamaal Bowman on Tuesday in a Democratic primary in suburban New York that highlighted the party’s deep divisions over the war in Gaza.

With the victory, Latimer has ousted one of the most liberal voices in Congress and one of its most outspoken critics of Israel. Bowman has accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, where thousands of Palestinians have died in military strikes.

Latimer, who got into the race at the urging of Jewish leaders and had heavy financial backing from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, is a former state legislator who has served as Westchester County executive since 2018.

In a victory speech, Latimer called for more civility following the contentious election.

“We have to fight to make sure we don’t vilify each other and we remember that we’re all Americans, and our common future is bound together,"" he told supporters at an event in White Plains.

“We argue, we debate, we find a way to come together,” he said, adding that all representatives had a duty to find ways to work across political divides and prevent the country from splintering.

Bowman had been seeking a third term, representing a district in New York City’s northern suburbs. His defeat is a blow to the party’s progressive wing and a potential cautionary tale for candidates trying to shape their messaging around the Israel-Hamas conflict.

His loss also disrupted what has generally been a stable primary season for congressional incumbents. Most current members of Congress have been able to repel challenges from within their party, though GOP Rep. Bob Good is in a tight contest with a rival backed by Donald Trump in a race that is too close to call.

“This movement has always been about justice. It has always been about humanity. It has always been about equality,” Bowman said at his election party in Yonkers, conceding that he lost the race but remaining unapologetic about his opposition to the war in Gaza.

The American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s political action committee spent nearly $15 million on the primary, filling airwaves and mailboxes with negative ads in an effort to unseat Bowman, who has accused the influential pro-Israel lobbying group of trying to buy the race.

“The outcome in this race once again shows that the pro-Israel position is both good policy and good politics — for both parties,"" the American Israel Public Affairs Committee said in a statement.

Some major progressive figures have rushed to Bowman’s defense. In the final stretch of the race, he rallied with liberals Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders, while Latimer pulled in the endorsement of former presidential candidate and former New York Sen. Hillary Clinton.

On Israel, both Bowman and Latimer support a two-state solution. They have also both condemned Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel that killed around 1,200 people. But Bowman was one of a few progressives who rejected a symbolic House resolution in support of Israel following the Oct. 7 attack. Latimer firmly backs Israel and said negotiating a cease-fire with Hamas is a non-starter because he believes it is a terrorist group.

Bowman was first elected in 2020 after running as a liberal insurgent against moderate U.S. Rep. Eliot Engel, a 16-term congressman who chaired a House committee on foreign affairs. Bowman, 48, embraced the political outsider strategy this year as well, depicting Latimer as a tool of Republican donors and pro-Israel groups.

Latimer said Bowman’s criticism of Israel was only part of the reason why he decided to challenge the incumbent. He said Bowman hasn’t been attentive to the needs of the district, maintained few relationships with its leaders, and was more interested in getting spots on cable news than he was in helping people.

During the campaign, Latimer, who has more than three decades of political experience, often displayed his deep regional knowledge and connections to make the case that he would be an effective member of Congress. Latimer has said that’s the sort of politics people expect from their elected officials, rather than caustic fights between the far right and far left — a clear dig at Bowman.

Aside from his position on Israel, Bowman has been followed by lingering criticism over an incident last year when he triggered a fire alarm in a House building while lawmakers were working on a funding bill. He said it was unintentional, with the alarm going off when he tried to open a locked door while trying to vote. Bowman was censured by his colleagues in the House, and the incident drew embarrassing news coverage.

The congressional district’s boundaries have shifted since Bowman first won office in 2020, losing most of its sections in the Bronx and adding more of Westchester County’s suburbs.

Today, 21% of its voting-age population is Black and 42% is non-Hispanic white, according to U.S. Census figures, compared to 30% Black and 34% white in the district as it existed through 2022. Bowman is Black. Latimer is white.

Bowman, as the election neared, focused on driving up turnout in what parts of the Bronx remain in his district, telling supporters there that the contest could hinge on their votes. He spent the bulk of his election day in the Bronx, too, and a video posted to the social media site X showed Bowman walking down a street in the Bronx with a drum line behind him on Tuesday.

Latimer, 70, will be the prohibitive favorite to win in the general election. The district, which includes parts of Westchester and a small piece of the Bronx, is a Democratic stronghold.

Nationally, Democratic Party leaders have emphasized moving toward centrist candidates who might fare better in suburban races.

Also on Tuesday, Democratic voters on Long Island picked former CNN anchor John Avlon as the candidate who will challenge incumbent Republican Rep. Nick LaLota in a district that’s been controlled by the GOP for a decade.

Avlon defeated retired chemistry professor Nancy Goroff in the Democratic primary. The Long Island congressional district has become a priority for Democrats as the party tries to flip suburban seats in New York as part of a strategy to win a House majority.

But winning the seat could be an uphill battle for Democrats in November, after Democratic state lawmakers changed its borders during redistricting to make it slightly more friendly to Republicans to improve their chances in other districts.

In central New York, Democrats picked state Sen. John Mannion as the party’s nominee to take on U.S. Rep.

Pro-Israel interests pour millions into defeating a second ‘Squad’ member.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/us/politics/missouri-cori-bush-bell-aipac-israel-democrats.html,"Days before she was set to face a challenger backed by America’s largest pro-Israel lobby in an expensive and contentious Democratic primary, Representative Cori Bush of Missouri doubled down on the stance that has put her job in peril.

Standing outside an early voting location at a public library in Ferguson, on the same streets where she led protests for racial justice in 2014, Ms. Bush declined to call Hamas a terrorist group.

“We were called terrorists during Ferguson,” she said of herself and other Black activists who took to the streets after the killing of Michael Brown, an unarmed Black teenager, by a white police officer. “Have they hurt people? Absolutely. Has the Israeli military hurt people? Absolutely.”

Most voters in this racially segregated blue city in a deep-red state are not talking about Israel’s war against Hamas. Abortion is illegal here, crime is high and downtown is made up of mostly boarded-up storefronts. There are more pressing concerns. “It’s not a priority for my district, necessarily,” she conceded of her pro-Palestinian views."
Pro-Israel interests pour millions into defeating a second ‘Squad’ member.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/05/donalds-trump-harris-race/,"The first night of last month’s Republican convention was centered on the sort of politics the party loudly eschews. The speakers included an array of supporters of former president Donald Trump who weren’t White or male or business leaders — representatives of other groups who were there, very clearly, to indicate that it is acceptable for Black people or Hispanics or union members to pull the lever for Trump.

Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) was one of those speakers. He is probably Trump’s most visible Black supporter, having effectively increased his profile among Trump’s base in recent years. He’s a cable-news fixture who, on Sunday, made the transition to broadcast for an appearance on ABC News’s “This Week.”

It didn’t go very well.

Among the news that occurred last week was Trump’s suggestion that Vice President Harris is some sort of race opportunist. During an interview at the National Association of Black Journalists convention, Trump claimed that Harris had been “Indian all the way” before “all of a sudden she made a turn” to identify as Black.

The California-born vice president is the daughter of a Black father from Jamaica and a South Asian mother from India. She graduated from the historically Black Howard University in 1986.

“This Week” host George Stephanopoulos asked Donalds why Trump was “questioning” Harris’s identity. Trump has gone to great lengths to attempt to appeal to Black voters, which might be aided by presenting Harris as inauthentically Black. In a sense, that was the answer that Donalds offered.

“If we’re going to be accurate, when Kamala Harris went into the United States Senate, it was [the Associated Press] that said she was the first Indian American United States senator,” he said in his response. “It was actually played up a lot when she came into the Senate. Now she’s running nationally. Obviously, the campaign has shifted. They’re talking much more about her father’s heritage and her Black identity.”

The contrast between what Donalds says the Harris campaign is talking about “much more” and an old AP article is not just apples-to-oranges; it’s imaginary apples being compared with another store’s oranges.

Donalds’s answer mostly focused on criticisms of the Biden administration, but Stephanopoulos pressed him on the question of Trump’s attack on Harris. The legislator tried again.

“This is something that’s actually a conversation throughout social media right now,” Donalds said — not mentioning that this was mostly a function of Trump. “There were a lot of people who were trying to figure this out. But again, that’s a side issue, not the main issue.”

The two went back and forth for a while, with Stephanopoulos noting that Donalds repeatedly reiterated Trump’s assertion that there was something suspect about Harris’s presentation of identity. Ultimately it was Donalds, not the host, who suggested that they move on.

What Trump and Donalds were doing with their responses was leveraging Harris’s background to present her as inauthentic. Perhaps the inauthenticity was supposed to be about how Harris campaigned; perhaps it was supposed to be about who Harris actually was. But it is centrally dependent on the fact that we view race as strictly delineated in a way that is both overly reductive and that doesn’t carry over into other personal identifiers.

Consider Trump’s vice-presidential pick, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio). He is a guy who prides himself on being a child of Appalachia, a veteran and someone with a background in venture capital. Depending on his audience, he highlights different elements of that experience — as he probably has for much of his life.

The term code-switching is generally used to describe people who adopt different mannerisms for different contexts, such as a member of a racial minority speaking to members of that community as opposed to a group of White Americans. But it also applies to the sort of shifts Vance might have adopted when interacting with his rural grandmother as opposed to his Yale University classmates.

There’s not necessarily anything contradictory in this; those are elements of who Vance is. There’s undoubtedly some opportunism, but this is politics, where pandering is the name of the game. But Harris offering herself as Black and South Asian — which, mind you, she generally hasn’t done — is presented as unacceptably insincere.

Americans have a very naive understanding of racial boundaries. This is in part because so much rides on racial identity in the United States, with racial categories helping determine social status and power. This disincentives nuance. The naiveté is in part, too, because racial boundaries have shifted throughout American history and particularly in recent decades. “Non-White” used to suggest “Black.” That is no longer the case.

It’s also because our systems for measuring race have been rudimentary. Most people don’t think about their racial identity until they’re prompted, often by some form presented to them. The Census Bureau does this, for example, giving people different boxes to check to identify what their background is. You can see the challenge here: If you’re Harris, what do you check? If she’s forced to choose, it doesn’t change who she is, just how she is recorded by the government.

Something interesting happened with the 2020 Census. There’s a field on the form in which Americans can offer additional details about their heritage — checking “White,” for example, but then adding that they have a Hispanic grandparent. In 2010, only the first 30 characters of those responses were catalogued by the Census Bureau. In 2020, the first 200 were — meaning that much more nuance about identity was recorded.

This contributed to a huge shift: From 2010 to 2020, the number of Americans who identified as “White and Some Other Race” soared from about 2 million to more than 19 million. In 2010, about 3 percent of Americans were categorized as multiracial. In 2020, more than 1 in 10 were. Some of this was an actual increase in diversity. (Younger Americans are much more likely to be non-White and multiracial than older Americans.) Some of it, though, was just a change in our capturing racial identity.

About a million Americans identified as “Black and Some Other Race,” as Harris might. Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data determined that there are probably about 8 million multiracial Black or Black Hispanic Americans. Were any of them running for president, it seems fair to assume that some might point out their familiarity with Black family traditions in some contexts and other traditions in other contexts. As with Vance’s presentations of economic class, this isn’t contradictory. It’s complementary."
Pro-Israel interests pour millions into defeating a second ‘Squad’ member.,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/pro-israel-super-pac-helped-172601663.html,"A pro-Israel super PAC helped defeat one Squad member. Now it's going after another, Cori Bush

ST. LOUIS (AP) — A deep-pocketed pro-Israel super PAC that helped defeat one member of the congressional group known as the Squad is now pushing to oust another — Missouri Democrat Cori Bush.

Bush, of St. Louis, has been a vocal critic of how Israel responded when attacked by Hamas in October, calling the Israeli retaliation an “ethnic cleansing campaign,” and she was among the few House members who opposed a resolution supporting Israel. She boycotted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before Congress last week, calling him a “war criminal.”

The American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s super political action committee, United Democracy Project, has spent more than $8.4 million to unseat Bush in her Aug. 6 Democratic primary against St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell, according to federal campaign finance records.

“AIPAC’s grassroots members are proud to support strong pro-Israel progressive Democrats like Wesley Bell,” an AIPAC statement to The Associated Press read. ""Cori Bush has been one of the most hostile critics of Israel since she came to Congress in 2021 and has actively worked to undermine mainstream Democratic support for the U.S.-Israel relationship.”

The race points yet again to the complications the war in Gaza has caused for Democrats in this year’s elections, with core constituencies at odds over how President Joe Biden's administration has responded. The disagreement has implications up and down the ballot and has already cost one incumbent his seat. United Democracy Project spent nearly $15 million against progressive U.S. Rep. Jamaal Bowman, one of the most vocal critics of the Israeli government in the House, in a June primary election he lost to George Latimer, a pro-Israel centrist in New York.

Afterward, AIPAC said the “outcome in this race once again shows that the pro-Israel position is both good policy and good politics — for both parties.”

Bush, in an interview, said the donors behind AIPAC support former President Donald Trump and other Republicans.

“This is only the beginning,” Bush said. “Because if they can unseat me, then they’re going to continue to come after more Democrats.”

Despite the onslaught of money, Bush said she is confident she has the support of St. Louis voters.

“They know that I’ve had this same belief, this pro-peace, pro-democracy, pro-diplomacy, anti-war, pro-humanity — I’ve been this person all along,"" Bush said.

Soon after the Hamas attack of Israel, Bush wrote on social media that Israel’s “collective punishment against Palestinians for Hamas’s actions is a war crime.""

“I strongly condemn Hamas & their appalling violations of human rights,” she wrote, ""but violations of human rights don’t justify more human rights violations in retaliation.”

Her comments prompted backlash, even among some supporters in her district. Not long after that, Bell announced he was dropping his plans to run for the Senate against incumbent Republican Josh Hawley to instead challenge Bush in the congressional primary.

Bell, like Bush, is Black and was active in Ferguson, Missouri, after Black 18-year-old Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, a shooting that helped launch the national Black Lives Matter movement. After being elected prosecutor in 2018, Bell reopened an examination of Brown’s death but found no grounds to charge the officer, Darren Wilson.

Bell, in an interview, said Bush’s comments about Israel were “wrong and offensive.”

“She has accused the people who have been the target of genocide and ethnic cleansing of doing that, which was just wrong,” Bell said. “Israel was attacked on Oct. 7 by a terror state. They didn’t attack military targets. They attacked (people) at a concert. They attacked women, seniors, children, killed babies.”

Bell said the goal should be to work toward a “peaceful resolution” in the Middle East.

“We don’t want to see any innocent Palestinians, any innocent Israelis, harmed. We want to keep the door open to a two-state solution,” he said.

AIPAC isn’t alone in seeking Bush's ouster. DMFI PAC, which supports pro-Israeli Democrats, is funding TV ads supporting Bell and Yassamin Ansari, an Arizona Democrat running in the primary to replace Rep. Ruben Gallego.

Conversely, nearly two dozen progressive groups have come together to support Bush and other Squad members. The coalition, called Reject AIPAC, includes Jewish peace organizations and Arab American and Muslim groups that have been organizing since the Israel-Hamas war began.

One group that is part of Reject AIPAC, Justice Democrats, has spent around $1.5 million on behalf of Bush in the primary cycle. Justice Democrats spokesperson Usamah Andrabi called AIPAC's record spending in the New York race “an all-out assault on our Democracy” that was being repeated in Missouri.

“Are we willing to let super PACs and lobbies, no matter what interests they represent, purchase elections and congressional seats just because they have more money?” Andrabi asked. “Or are we going to build a Democratic Party that actually reflects the needs and interests of everyday people?”

Bush also is getting moral support from several key Democratic congressional leaders. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, House Minority Whip Katherine Clark and Caucus Chair Rep. Pete Aguilar are among those who have endorsed Bush.

But the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has stayed out of the Missouri race, with no contributions listed for either Bush or Bell.

The answer to this is hard to ascertain specifically because there aren’t that many harpists (extant or aspiring) out there. In 2022, YouGov asked Americans what instruments they learned to play at any point in their lives; only 1 percent nodded when asked about playing the harp.

Among Republicans, that number dropped to zero percent. This is an important point because Republican politics are the prompt for the issue in the first place.

On Saturday, The Washington Post’s Isaac Arnsdorf and Josh Dawsey detailed how Donald Trump’s presidential campaign hopes to leverage outside groups for voter contact before Election Day. They sat in on a presentation from one of those groups, Turning Point Action.

Those contacting voters, staff organizers were told, should not lead with their support for Trump. Instead, the organizers were told that they should “research their marks and start reaching out through Facebook groups, community events, or neighborly gestures,” Arnsdorf and Dawsey documented, “such as recommending plumbers or harp teachers.”

This advice was admittedly at odds with the instructions on another slide: “BE NORMAL. BE NORMAL. BE NORMAL.” Harp-playing is demonstrably not a normal avocation.

You can see why this component of the story attracted so much attention, particularly given the synchronicity between “BE NORMAL” and the left’s recent use of “weird” to describe Trump. But this was not the most important element of the story.

The most important element, instead, was this:

“For the large armies of paid and volunteer door-knockers and canvassers who typically drive turnout in presidential elections, the campaign is largely relying on outside groups such as America First Works, America PAC and Turning Point Action.”

The Republican Party “had been planning an extensive field program, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post,” Arnsdorf and Dawsey report. Those plans, though, have been “discarded” after Trump and his campaign absorbed the party this year.

That takeover was by no means surprising. The year began with Ronna McDaniel leading the Republican National Committee, something she had done since shortly before Trump took office as president. She was robustly loyal to Trump, even reportedly agreeing to drop her maiden name, Romney, in deference to his hostility to her uncle. But she was also seeking to balance the needs of the party with the needs of its most influential figure, to deploy the power of the institution in ways that weren’t always centered around Trump.

And now she’s gone. The party’s new co-chairs include Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara Trump. Her first instinct when presented with a Republican Senate candidate who lightly criticized her father-in-law was to say that the candidate “doesn’t deserve the respect of anyone in the Republican Party.”

Since it became obvious that Trump would be the party’s presidential nominee once again this year — since the first half of 2023, in other words — he has finalized his control over Republican institutions either directly or indirectly. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced that he would step down from caucus leadership ahead of the next Congress. The party’s 2024 platform was a pastiche of Trump-authored Trumpisms. Like the Trump Organization before it, the GOP is mostly just a collection of brands under the control of Trump himself.

This brings us back to voter outreach efforts. Such efforts, generally categorized as “get out the vote,” or GOTV, has not traditionally been one of the Republican Party’s strengths. The Democratic Party, bolstered by labor unions, had a history of strong GOTV efforts in part because its voting base was less likely to turn out of its own accord. Only in more recent elections did the national GOP match that push, investing in GOTV and in building a database of voters that could be used over multiple cycles and by multiple candidates.

For the party, this offered two benefits. It made their candidates more likely to win, given the increased ability to target specific low-propensity voters and push them to vote. More importantly, it built the party. It allowed Republicans to collect new data on voters and on volunteers. It gave them something to offer to candidates — data and resources — that could help them shape candidate campaigns and policies. This increased the institutional power of the Republican Party.

But since Trump first became the front-runner for the Republican nomination in the 2016 presidential contest, he has made obvious that he intends to suck every drop of institutional power out of the GOP for his use. It’s not that he’s hostile to the party, necessarily, though he obviously is often at odds with its traditional power structure. It’s just that the party has something he wants — power and resources — and he’s going to use them as he sees fit … without worrying about replenishing them.

Who benefits from outsourcing GOTV efforts to Turning Point Action (TPA)? The youth-focused group can send its data on harp enthusiasts back to the GOP, but it’s safe to assume that won’t be a priority. TPA is interested in building its own institutional power, and is using its strong relationship with Trump to do so. It’s building its database of volunteers and using the lure of volunteering to help Trump to do so. And, importantly, its effort will be an institutional success even if Trump loses. The central incentive is on raising and spending the $100 million Turning Point Action is budgeting for this year.

The Republican Party is doing some organizing on Trump’s behalf. It plans, according to Lara Trump, to dispatch a small army of poll watchers to polling places on Election Day to ensure that no rampant fraud occurs — as it didn’t in 2020, when the party similarly tried to encourage volunteers to keep an eye on voters. I encountered some in Pennsylvania the weekend before Election Day that year; the party’s original GOTV plan for the state this year noted (according to Arnsdorf and Dawsey) that the failure to instead turn out voters was a central challenge in Trump’s reelection bid."
Pro-Israel interests pour millions into defeating a second ‘Squad’ member.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/05/trump-ye-rapper-adin-ross-interview/,"Donald Trump on Monday called rapper Ye a “really nice guy” who is “complicated” but has “a good heart,” praising the celebrity whose antisemitic remarks in recent years has drawn widespread condemnations and led many companies to cut ties. Trump was widely criticized in 2022 for having dinner with Ye and the far-right activist Nick Fuentes despite their antisemitic comments. On Monday, Trump seemed to allude to the controversy surrounding Ye — formerly known as Kanye West — during a lengthy interview with online streamer Adin Ross.

“He’s very complicated,” Trump said as Ross prompted him for reactions to public figures pictured on a screen. Trump said the rapper “can get himself into trouble” along with “some other people.”

“But, you know, he’s got a good heart,” Trump said. “He does, he does, but he’s complicated, Kanye.”

Advertisement

Ye’s antisemitic statements cost him much of his business empire in 2022. At one point, the rapper said on social media that he planned to go “death con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE.” Later, speaking to the far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, he said he liked Adolf Hitler and praised Nazis.

Trump campaign communications director Steven Cheung noted Trump’s support for Israel and policy achievements including the Abraham Accords and said the former president has fought antisemitism “in America and abroad.”

“As President Trump said, this individual is a complicated person who gets himself into trouble,” Cheung said, referring to Ye. “Kamala Harris talks out of both sides of her mouth to appease Hamas sympathizers while Democrats have emboldened antisemitic protests on college campuses.”

The interview also raised the possibility of campaign finance violations when Ross gave Trump two lavish gifts: a Rolex watch and a custom Cybertruck wrapped in an image from the moments after the assassination attempt on Trump last month. Elon Musk — the chief executive of Tesla, which produces the Cybertruck — has endorsed Trump.

Individual contributions to candidates for federal office are capped at $3,300. Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said they would “submit an advisory opinion to the FEC to seek guidance on how to handle the gifts.” The Federal Election Commission declined to comment on the gifts to Trump. Representatives for Ross did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Adin Ross is about to gift Donald Trump this Cybertruck today 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/jWmqiSuPdy — Teslaconomics (@Teslaconomics) August 5, 2024

Daniel Weiner, director of the elections and government program at the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonprofit law and public policy institute at New York University School of Law, said Ross probably landed himself in hot water with his gifts.

“Since Trump is a candidate, he’s subject to federal contribution limits, which are in the neighborhood of $3,000 per individual per election,” Weiner said. “A contribution isn’t limited to cash. It can be an in-kind contribution, which is a thing of value. A Cybertruck is a thing of value, as is a Rolex. It’s pretty simple.”

Advertisement

“If it’s not Mr. Ross himself that’s giving these gifts but his company or something, then it gets more complicated,” Weiner added. “Although corporations can spend unlimited amounts of money independently on electoral advocacy, corporations are still barred from giving directly to campaigns. And so, I would argue that if it’s a corporation presenting these expensive gifts to a candidate, that’s probably illegal.”

Two years ago, Trump’s meal with Ye and Fuentes drew pushback from across the political spectrum. Matt Brooks, chief executive of the Republican Jewish Coalition, criticized the “virulent antisemitism” of Trump’s dinner guests and said, “We … call on all political leaders to reject their messages of hate and refuse to meet with them.” A representative for RJC did not immediately respond to an inquiry Monday evening.

Ross, the streamer who interviewed Trump, is also deeply controversial. He previously hosted Fuentes, who has denounced “perfidious Jews” and said those “suppressing Christianity … must be absolutely annihilated.” The streamer once responded to a discussion of gender pronouns by saying his pronouns are “kill / them.”

Trump praised the 23-year-old Ross effusively on Monday, saying he heard about the streamer from his youngest son, Barron. “Dad, he’s really big,” Trump recalled Barron remarking. After Ross urged his viewers to “go out there and vote, and vote for the right person,” Trump marveled that Ross had gone further than many other interviewers in showing support. Behind them, about two dozen supporters listened and cheered periodically, as if they were at a rally.

“Outstanding, to do what you’ve done at a young age,” Trump told Ross.

Trump and Ross spent the final part of their hour-and-a-half-long hangout sitting in the Cybertruck listening to music.

Trump’s conversation with Ross was wide-ranging. He criticized Vice President Harris by unfavorably comparing her with potential running mates: “All of the people she’s looking at are considered much better than her,” Trump said, adding that he thinks “virtually every one of them is considered better, smarter, would be a better president than her.”

Harris is expected to name her running mate Tuesday ahead of a scheduled multistate tour with the vice-presidential pick.

Harris’s campaign ridiculed Trump’s appearance with Ross in a statement, branding it “low energy” and saying Trump “spent the hour lying about his record and attacking the media instead of speaking to the issues young voters care about.”

Trump repeatedly attacked ABC News reporter Rachel Scott, who pressed Trump on past offensive comments last week at the National Association of Black Journalists convention. He called her “nasty,” “rude” and “horrible” and said that if he owned the network, he would fire her."

More than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed, Harris’ coronation as her party’s standard-bearer will cap a tumultuous and frenetic period for Democrats prompted by President Joe Biden’s disastrous June debate performance that shattered his own supporters’ confidence in his reelection prospects and spurred extraordinary intraparty warfare about whether he should stay in the race.

Just as soon as Biden abruptly ended his candidacy, Harris and her team worked rapidly to secure backing from the 1,976 party delegates needed to clinch the nomination in a formal roll call vote. She reached that marker at warp speed, with an Associated Press survey of delegates nationwide showing she locked down the necessary commitments a mere 32 hours after Biden’s announcement.

Harris’ nomination will become official after a five-day round of online balloting by Democratic National Convention delegates ends on Monday night and the party announces the results. The party had long contemplated the early virtual roll call to ensure Biden would appear on the ballot in every state.

An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted after Biden withdrew found 46% of Americans have a favorable view of Harris, while a nearly identical share has an unfavorable view of her. But more Democrats say they are satisfied with her candidacy compared with that of Biden, energizing a party that had long been resigned to the 81-year-old Biden being its nominee against former President Donald Trump, a Republican they view as an existential threat.

Already Harris has telegraphed that she doesn’t plan to veer much from the themes and policies that framed Biden’s candidacy, such as democracy, gun violence prevention and abortion rights. But her delivery can be far fierier, particularly when she invokes her prosecutorial background to lambast Trump and his 34 felony convictions for falsifying business records in connection with a hush money scheme.

“Given that unique voice of a new generation, of a prosecutor and a woman when fundamental rights, especially reproductive rights, are on the line, it’s almost as if the stars have aligned for her at this moment in history,” said Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California, who was tapped to succeed Harris in the Senate when she became vice president.

A splash in Washington before a collapse in the 2020 primaries

Kamala Devi Harris was born Oct. 20, 1964, in Oakland, California, to Shyamala Gopalan, a breast cancer scientist who emigrated to the United States from India when she was 19 years old, and Stanford University emeritus professor Donald Harris, a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Jamaica. Her parents’ advocacy for civil rights gave her what she described as a “stroller’s-eye view” of the movement.

Advertisement

She spent years as a prosecutor in the Bay Area before her elevation as the state’s attorney general in 2010 and then election as U.S. senator in 2016.

Harris arrived in Washington as a senator at the dawn of the volatile Trump era, quickly establishing herself as a reliable liberal opponent of the new president’s personnel and policies and fanning speculation about a presidential bid of her own. Securing a spot on the coveted Judiciary Committee gave her a national spotlight to interrogate prominent Trump nominees, such as now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

“I’m not able to be rushed this fast,” then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions said during a 2017 hearing as Harris repeatedly pressed him on potential conversations with Russian nationals. “It makes me nervous.”

Harris launched her 2020 presidential campaign with much promise, drawing parallels to former President Barack Obama and attracting more than 20,000 people to a kickoff rally in her hometown. But Harris withdrew from the primary race before the first nominating contest in Iowa, plagued by staff dissent that spilled out into the open and an inability to attract enough campaign cash.

Harris struggled to deliver a consistent pitch to Democratic voters and wobbled on key issues such as health care. She suggested she backed eliminating private insurance for a full government-run system — “Medicare for All” coverage — before releasing her own health care plan that preserved private insurance. Now, during her nascent general election campaign, Harris has already reversed some of her earlier, more liberal positions, such as a ban on fracking that she endorsed in 2019.

And while Harris tried to deploy her law enforcement background as an asset in her 2020 presidential campaign, it never attracted enough support in a party that couldn’t reconcile some of her past tough-on-crime positions at a time of heightened focus on police brutality.

Joining Biden's team — and an evolution as vice president

Still, Harris was at the top of the vice presidential shortlist when Biden was pondering his running mate, after his pledge in early 2020 that he would choose a Black woman as his No. 2. He was fond of Harris, who had forged a close friendship with his now-deceased son Beau, who had been Delaware’s attorney general when she was in that job for California.

Her first months as vice president were far from smooth. Biden asked her to lead the administration’s diplomatic efforts with Central America on the root causes of migration to the United States, which triggered attacks from Republicans on border security and remains a political vulnerability. It didn’t help matters that Harris stumbled in big interviews, such as in a 2021 sit-down with NBC News’ Lester Holt when she responded dismissively that “I haven’t been to Europe” when the anchor noted that she hadn’t visited the U.S.-Mexico border.

For her first two years, Harris also was often tethered to Washington so she could break tie votes in the evenly divided Senate, which gave Democrats landmark wins on the climate and health care but also constrained opportunities for her to travel around the country and meet voters.

Her visibility became far more prominent after the 2022 Supreme Court ruling that dismantled Roe vs. Wade, as she became the chief spokesperson for the administration on abortion rights and was a more natural messenger than Biden, a lifelong Catholic who had in the past favored restrictions on the procedure. She is the first vice president to tour an abortion clinic and speaks about reproductive rights in the broader context of maternal health, especially for Black women.

Advertisement

Throughout her vice presidency, Harris has been careful to remain loyal to Biden while emphasizing that she would be ready to step in if needed. That dramatic transition began in late June after the first debate between Biden and Trump, where the president’s stumbles were so cataclysmic that he could never reverse the loss of confidence from other Democrats.

Headed to the top of the ticket

After Biden ended his candidacy July 21, he quickly endorsed Harris. And during the first two weeks of her 2024 presidential bid, enthusiasm among the Democratic base surged, with donations pouring in, scores of volunteers showing up at field offices and supporters swelling so much in numbers that event organizers have had to swap venues.

The Harris campaign now believes it has a renewed opportunity to compete in Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia — states that Biden had started to abandon in favor of shoring up the so-called “blue wall” states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

“The country is able to see the Kamala Harris that we all know,” said Bakari Sellers, who was a national co-chair of her 2020 campaign. “We really didn’t allow the country to see her” four years ago. Sellers said: “We had her in bubble wrap. What people are seeing now is that she’s real, she’s talented.”

Yet Democrats are anticipating that Harris’ political honeymoon will wear off, and she is inevitably going to come under tougher scrutiny for Biden administration positions, the state of the economy and volatile situations abroad, particularly in the Middle East. Harris has also yet to answer extended questions from journalists nor sit down for a formal interview since she began her run.

The Trump campaign has been eager to define Harris as she continues to introduce herself to voters nationwide, releasing an ad blaming her for the high number of illegal crossings at the southern border during the Biden administration and dubbing her “Failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal.”

The Republican nominee’s supporters have also derisively branded Harris as a diversity hire, while Trump himself has engaged in ugly racial attacks of his own, wrongly asserting that Harris had in the past only promoted her Indian heritage and only recently played up her Black identity.

His remarks are previewing a season of racist and sexist claims against the person who would be the first woman and the first person of South Asian heritage in the presidency.

“I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black,” Trump said while addressing the annual convention of the National Association of Black Journalists. “So, I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?”

In her response, Harris called it “the same old show — the divisiveness and the disrespect” and said voters “deserve better.”"
Pro-Israel interests pour millions into defeating a second ‘Squad’ member.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/05/presidential-race-shifts-modestly-so-far-toward-harris/,"One way you know that CBS News’s new poll of the presidential race is bad news for former president Donald Trump is that Trump’s campaign is trying to spin it as unreliable. In a “confidential memorandum” sent to reporters on Sunday, a data consultant for the campaign argued that the poll, conducted by YouGov, had been “manipulated” to show an advantage for Vice President Harris — a shift since the last CBS-YouGov poll released last month. It was a return to the days of poll “unskewing,” a central component of Republican optimism about Mitt Romney’s chances in the 2012 presidential election … which he then lost.

The objections from the Trump campaign can be dismissed most easily by considering the motivations of the two parties involved. YouGov is in the business of providing a wide range of businesses and media outlets with reliable evaluations of public opinion, the sort of effort that rewards accuracy over the long term. (YouGov is the fourth-best pollster in 538′s ratings.) Trump’s campaign, on the other hand, is in the business of presenting him as a political juggernaut with an unmatched level of support.

In other words, why the pollster would tweak a midyear presidential poll to benefit the Democrat is not clear. Why the Trump campaign would like to suggest that the poll was tweaked is obvious.

Even given its motivations, the response from Trump’s campaign to this one poll was odd. The poll, as the memo notes, shows a subtle shift in the race, one that puts Harris in front of Trump but still well within the margin of error. There are other indicators that the race is shifting in Harris’s direction (polling analyst Nate Silver’s average has Harris leading nationally and gaining in swing states), but modestly. This isn’t surprising, given that changes in political support are generally gradual. It’s possible that as the campaign progresses, Harris will open up a wider lead — or Trump will regain one. For now, though, the shift is small.

That said, the CBS poll does suggest that a wider Harris lead is quite possible. CBS has published three polls evaluating the presidential contest over the past month. The first asked respondents to choose between Trump and President Biden, his opponent at the time. The second asked for a choice between both Biden and Harris. The third, released this weekend, had only Harris. This lets us see both how the Trump-Harris race compares with the Trump-Biden one — and how Harris’s position has changed since she became the presumptive nominee.

The biggest changes are among independents and Black respondents. In the CBS poll released in the middle of last month, Trump led Harris among independents by 11 points; they're now tied. Among Black respondents, Harris led by 55 points. Now she leads by 63 — much closer to the Biden-Trump split shown in 2020 exit polls, though still less heavily Democratic.

The bigger shift is seen when respondents were asked to select from a wider field of candidates. Here we see bigger shifts over the past month, in large part because respondents considering third-party candidates shifted their support to Harris. Notice, below, that the change in support for Trump is relatively subtle month-to-month. The change in support for his Democratic opponent, though, is often significant.

That's in part because younger voters and non-White voters — two central components of the Democratic base — are more likely to back Harris in a larger field than they were to back Biden. In CBS's new poll, both groups also indicated that the shift of the nomination to Harris made them more motivated to vote in November. Such questions should be taken with a grain of salt, but this comports with polling over the course of the year showing broad apathy about Biden's reelection bid.

Advertisement

We can see how this works when looking at the trend in other questions included in CBS's poll. Last month, half of Biden supporters said their vote was a function of wanting to stop Trump, not of support for the president. Now, about 4 in 10 indicate that their vote is against Trump — meaning that more respondents plan to cast an affirmative vote for Harris.

These numbers are consistent with YouGov’s broader finding that Harris has had a jump in favorability among poll respondents, itself a not-uncommon shift for a new candidate. Trump and his allies are trying to portray the enthusiasm for Harris’s campaign as inauthentic, but they might recall that before Trump’s campaign launch in 2015, his favorability among Republicans was well below water.

YouGov’s poll has also consistently asked respondents who have a preference between the two major-party candidates whether they would ever consider voting for the other party’s candidate. Overall, fewer Trump supporters say they would never support Harris than said they would never support Biden last month. That’s particularly pronounced among younger respondents, women and Hispanic respondents. (There were not enough Black Trump supporters to include in the chart below.)

Some of this is a function of the newness of Harris’s campaign. As her campaign is rolled out, it’s likely that opposition from many of those who support Trump will firm up. It’s possible, too, that she’ll peel away some of that support or, at least, soften the support in a way that dampens turnout in November.

It’s early. That “confidential” Trump campaign memo is correct in noting that the shift in the CBS poll is subtle, though its disparagement of the pollster is not. What this and other polling shows, though, is a shifted presidential contest, one that has moved from mirroring 2016 to one that is potentially, instead, mirroring 2020."

Two progressives — and big money donors — face off in St. Louis

There are few major policy differences between Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) and county prosecutor Wesley Bell — the two Democrats interlocked in a tight primary to represent Missouri’s first Congressional district.

Both are liberal, Black Democrats who were born and raised in St. Louis. Both entered public service after protesting against police shooting unarmed Black men. Both share progressive ideologies and believe the Democratic Party should veer more to the left. Both are beating back allegations of improper behavior.

What constituents will have to decide at the ballot box tomorrow is whether to stick with their two-term congresswoman who often bucks party leadership, or to elect a new candidate who pledges to vote with Democrats on the Hill and in the White House.

Whoever prevails is expected to win the solidly Democratic district in November.

Bush’s outsize, outspoken personality now appears to polarize her district. Voters either described her to our colleague Abbie Cheeseman as one of the most authentically St. Louisans they could have in office and a breath of fresh air, or as someone who has prioritized her personal politics above her district’s interests.

“People around here are fed up of Cori [Bush] and feel like she hasn’t done enough,” said Jovan Manuel, who says he will vote for Bell because he feels the congresswoman is not focused on addressing inflation, the cost of living and safety.

Bell has leaned in on that argument, charging that Bush has prioritized certain issues she values most rather than what the community is seeking.

“You can’t just cheer from the bleachers or grandstand for yourself. You gotta be a team player that stands with President Biden,” Bell says in a campaign ad.

One of Bush’s biggest local vulnerabilities is her vote against Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Act, drawing the ire of local labor unions, many of which are now backing Bell. She has also voted against several major Democratic or bipartisan bills Biden ultimately signed into law.

Bush has also missed 187 votes between January 2023 and June 2024, making her fifth among lawmakers with the most missed votes, according to an analysis by Derek P. Willis of University of Maryland and reviewed by The Washington Post.

House Democrats only need to net four seats to win back the majority. Many Democratic lawmakers are keenly aware that if they seize the reins next year, they could have a narrow majority where any small ideological bloc could stonewall legislation — similar dynamics that have plagued the GOP majority this term.

Several Democratic lawmakers — including some in the Congressional Progressive Caucus — have privately expressed hope that Bush loses her race so that a second member of the House’s far-left “Squad” is replaced with a new, progressive member who will vote with the party.

In a sign of support that House Democratic leadership is behind her, Minority Whip Katherine Clark (D-Mass.) spent Friday campaigning with Bush.

Bush has responded to the attacks that she hasn’t voted with her party. In a recent campaign ad, Bush proudly says she’s “working with President Biden to protect abortion rights, defend democracy and improve affordability.”

Another issue for Bush: she faces a federal investigation for allegations that she misused campaign funds to hire her husband to provide security. In a Jan. 30 meeting, Bush told staff that improperly using campaign funds could be viewed as “messed up,” according to an audio recording exclusively provided to The Post.

“Can I make a mistake? Absolutely, we all can make mistakes. I’m not infallible,” she said then.

In a statement responding to both the audio and the investigation, Bush said it was her “understanding from my attorneys that the investigation appears to be concluded and we are just waiting on formal word from the Department of Justice,” which she believes will “find no wrongdoing.” The Justice Department declined to comment.

Bell is facing his own allegations of scandal as he awaits a civil trial in a discrimination lawsuit filed against him by a former assistant prosecutor who claims he fired her and other prosecutors because of their age, gender and race.

Pro-Israel interests pour millions into defeating Bush

Big money donors could influence the outcome of the race. The pro-Israel lobby is pouring millions into a campaign to unseat Bush as part of a broader, well-funded effort to replace critics of the Israeli government and the war in Gaza with more Israel-friendly Democrats. Bush was the first member of Congress to call for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, nine days after Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel.

Bell is backed by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a powerful pro-Israel group which has poured millions into the race. AIPAC’s super PAC, the United Democracy Project, has spent $8.86 million on ads that have attacked Bush’s record on Capitol Hill rather than focus on her stance on the war.

Outside groups have already spent over $15 million in this race, according to Open Secrets, a Washington nonprofit that tracks campaign finance and lobbying data. More than 80 percent of that money has gone toward ads opposing Bush. Bell has four times more cash on hand than Bush.

AIPAC and other pro-Israel groups spent $17 million to help defeat Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) in a June contest that became the most expensive House primary in U.S. history. It could be surpassed by this race.

Justice Democrats, a liberal political action committee dedicated to electing far-left candidates to Congress, has poured in $2.3 million into the race in defense of Bush. Both Justice Democrats and Bush’s campaign have accused Bell of being supported by a group that also donates to “MAGA Republicans.” Bush often exclaims that “St. Louis is not for sale.”

“It’s because I called for a cease-fire in Gaza,” Bush told a constituent while canvassing last month. “That’s where all of this started.”

While Bush says her constituents resent having their tax money funding the bombing of civilians — drawing parallels to the Black Lives Matter movement — Bell told Abbie in an interview that his opponent is “wrong” in her stance and that while he does not want to see “a single innocent civilian hurt,” he would continue to stand with Israel against a “genocidal” Hamas.

“Most folks in my community are more concerned with a cease-fire in St. Louis,” Bell said. “Gun violence is the leading cause of death of young black males. As a prosecutor, that’s something that’s near and dear to me that I see up close every day.”

What we’re watching

On the trail

We’re all waiting for Vice President Harris to announce which Democrat will be her running mate, perhaps as soon as today. Our colleague Tyler Pager reported that Harris spent Sunday interviewing three finalists for the job: Gov. Tim Walz, Gov. Josh Shapiro, and Sen. Mark Kelly. What is she looking for in a vice-presidential nominee? Her allies tell Tyler she “is not solely concerned with electability but is also looking for a governing partner and someone she feels chemistry with.”

The campaign

Fewer schools serving as polling sites in hostile election environment

Following years of election conspiracy theories and threats against poll workers and election officials, fewer schools are now serving as polling sites than in years past.

Yvonne Wingett Sanchez, Clara Ence Morse and Hannah Natanson. “In the eight years since Donald Trump was first on the ballot, hundreds of schools throughout this fiercely contested battleground county are no longer willing to assume the risks associated with holding elections. In 2016, 37 percent of county polling locations were schools, according to a Washington Post analysis of data obtained through a public records request. So far this year, it’s 14 percent,” report our colleaguesand

Mesa Public Schools, Arizona’s largest public school district, is among those no longer providing polling sites after a particularly hostile election last year. Voters harassed election workers and school staff, making the district’s leadership concerned about how it would handle such behavior at a larger scale with a presidential election this fall.

“I couldn’t imagine it in 2024,” Assistant Superintendent Scott Thompson said. “We just don’t know how to make it work.”

“In this environment, where you have people with body cameras and weapons that are being brandished, that is a concern — that is intimidating for many people,” said Scott Menzel, superintendent of another Arizona school district in Scottsdale. “It just takes one flash point to ignite something that’s catastrophic and I absolutely don’t want that to happen on any one of my campuses.”

Since schools have been a common polling site traditionally, the loss of these locations has proved difficult to replace. As Maricopa County officials have struggled to find new polling locations, the county has had to set aside $1 million to lease private spaces for voting locations. In 2016, they budgeted only $53,000.

“This is people making a cost-benefit analysis,” said Bill Gates, a Republican member of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors. “The costs are perceived as being greater because it could create issues or bring threats of violence — or even violence. And by hosting a vote center, could they be pulled into a conspiracy? Is it worth it?”

Secretaries of state call on Musk to correct AI chatbot election misinformation

Five secretaries of state have written an open letter to Elon Musk after his AI chatbot Grok incorrectly told users that Harris is ineligible to appear on ballots in several states this presidential election.

The letter cites instances in which Grok claimed ballot deadlines in nine states had passed after Harris replaced Biden as the presumptive Democratic nominee. (Grok is available on X, formerly known as Twitter, to subscribers to X Premium and X Premium+.)

Sarah Ellison and Amy Gardner report. “Had the deadlines passed in those states, the vice president would not have been able to replace Biden on the ballot. But the information was false. In all nine states, the ballot deadlines have not passed and upcoming ballot deadlines allow for changes to candidates,” our colleaguesand

It took one week for Grok to be corrected. The letter calls on Musk to ensure Grok is changed to ensure “accurate information in this critical election year” and to direct users to CanIVote.org.

“This latest episode is unfortunate, but it’s also an opportunity to deliver a collective warning about the need for action on behalf of America’s voters,” said Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, who led the effort to write the letter. “We are all united by the goal of ensuring that voters get accurate information — and that they seek out trusted sources for such information.”

Pro-Israel interests pour millions into defeating a second ‘Squad’ member.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/04/harris-trump-electoral-map-votes/,"President Biden’s withdrawal and Vice President Harris’s selection as the presumptive Democratic nominee have reset the 50-state race for the White House. Former president Donald Trump had gained in national and state-level polls after a June debate in which Biden appeared confused and was at times unable to answer questions.

But in the two weeks since Biden dropped out and Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee, Democrats’ poll numbers — and their chances of holding the White House — have rebounded. The path to victory for Harris once again runs through seven key swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

“The Democratic base is coming home,” said Amy Walter, publisher and editor in chief of the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter. “In states that we know that are evenly divided and have been very, very close for these last few elections, they kind of snap back to being very, very competitive and will be the focus of the 2024 campaign.”

Although Trump’s paths to victory were expanding in late June and early July, the race “is now contracting back to the original six or seven battleground states,” Walter added.

Trump and Harris are now in a virtual tie, with Trump at 46.5 percent support and Harris at 46.2 percent support, according to a Washington Post average of national polls. In July, Trump had 46.8 percent support while Biden had 45.2 percent support, according to The Post’s polling average.

As of Sunday, Trump still led in five of the seven battlegrounds, according to The Post’s polling average.

Trump leads Harris by five points in Georgia and Arizona, four points in North Carolina and Nevada and two points in Michigan, The Post’s averages estimate. Trump and Harris are tied in Pennsylvania, while Harris has a slight edge in Wisconsin. Harris is performing about one percentage point better in those states than Biden was before he dropped out.

Harris’s running-mate selection, which she plans to announce by Tuesday, could reshuffle the race yet again. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) are among the finalists Harris interviewed Sunday.

She plans to visit all seven battleground states this week to introduce her vice-presidential pick to the country.

Harris is doing better than Biden was with Black voters, which could help bring Georgia back into play for Democrats, polling suggests. Trump held a rally at an arena in Atlanta on Saturday, less than a week after Harris spoke at the same venue. But she may not be able to replicate Biden’s appeal with White, non-college voters, which could affect her chances in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.

Democrats are “seeing tremendous enthusiasm for Vice President Harris and her vision in the states, whether it’s brand new supporters showing up at field offices in Nevada and Pennsylvania to knock doors or the 1,000 Georgia voters who signed up to volunteer after her rally in Atlanta,” Josh Marcus-Blank, states communications director for Harris, said in an emailed statement.

Strategists from both parties see Pennsylvania as a critical state for both Trump and Harris. Pennsylvania is also the state where Republicans and Democrats are investing the most in TV ad spending. Democrats are spending more than $56 million on television ads in the state between July 21 and the November election, according to the firm AdImpact. Republicans are spending $61 million.

After Pennsylvania, Democrats have spent the most on presidential television ads in Michigan, followed by Georgia, Wisconsin, Arizona, North Carolina and Nevada. For Republicans, television ad spending after Pennsylvania was highest in Georgia, followed by Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, North Carolina and Nevada.

“If I were in their shoes, I wouldn’t be banking on anything outside of the blue wall saving me,” said Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist, of the Harris campaign. “If you’re banking on Arizona and Georgia and North Carolina saving you from losing the blue wall, that’s not a bet I’d want to make … The pivotal state remains Pennsylvania. If you win it, you’ve got a chance.”

Many Republicans say Harris is enjoying a honeymoon period, with the rollout of her candidacy, her upcoming vice-presidential announcement and the Democratic National Convention weeks away. New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu predicted that in his state, Harris’s poll numbers will hit a “high-water mark around mid-to-late August” and said that “if she doesn’t have enough of a buffer they’re going to come back down.”

Trump “has been gaining ground and leading in battleground and blue states,” Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokeswoman, said in a statement. “As more voters understand how weak, failed and dangerously liberal Kamala Harris is, President Trump’s chances in these battleground states and traditionally Democrat strongholds will only get better,” she added.

Still, Democrats see Harris as more competitive than Biden in the Sun Belt states of Nevada, Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina.

“She has appeal to some constituencies within the party that were lagging with Biden,” including younger voters and Black and Hispanic voters, said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama. “That puts into play some of those Sun Belt states that have seemed out of reach. They’re still a stretch, but they’re not nearly the stretch they were.”

Axelrod added that while there’s more energy and optimism for Democrats, “everybody should be sober that given the map, it is still a difficult race.”

At Trump’s rally in Atlanta on Saturday, several Trump voters said they saw Harris as a more formidable opponent than Biden because of her age. But they expected Trump to prevail in Georgia.

Kirk Barnett said Harris is “probably” a tougher opponent. “She is coherent,” he said.

As November approaches, analysts caution that the shape of the race remains uncertain.

In the course of a month, Biden had a debate that changed the direction of the presidential race, Trump was nearly assassinated and Harris replaced Biden at the top of the ticket, Walter noted.

“All those things happened and it’s not like the polls flipped,” she said."
Pro-Israel interests pour millions into defeating a second ‘Squad’ member.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/03/trump-putin-prisoner-swap-gershkovich/,"ATLANTA — Former president Donald Trump congratulated Russian President Vladimir Putin over a prisoner swap that took place this week, saying the Russian strongman had outsmarted U.S. officials as part of the largest such deal since the end of the Cold War. At a rally here on Saturday, Trump did not mention any of the American prisoners who were released in the deal — including Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who was imprisoned for more than a year on charges the U.S. government has denounced as fabricated. In his previous comments on the deal, Trump has not mentioned any of the prisoners by name either, only criticized the U.S. government.

“I’d like to congratulate Vladimir Putin for having made yet another great deal. … We have 59 hostages; I never paid anything. … Boy, we make some horrible, horrible deals. It’s nice to say we got ’em back, but does that set a bad precedent?” Trump said.

He did not mention any of the U.S. officials who worked on the deal for months.

In fact, Trump authorized an agreement to pay $2 million to North Korea for medical bills in the release of Otto Warmbier, the comatose University of Virginia student sent home from Pyongyang in 2017, The Washington Post reported. Trump claimed the bill was never paid. Warmbier died soon after his return.

National security adviser Jake Sullivan said this week that no money changed hands in the latest prisoner swap.

Trump had been reluctant to speak about Gershkovich for about the first year of the reporter’s detention but finally called for his release in May. The former president has repeatedly bragged about his close relationship with Putin, but also says that Putin respects him and would have never invaded Ukraine if Trump was president.

Advertisement

On several public occasions in recent months, Trump has said he would get Gershkovich released as soon as he was elected in November, and Putin would do it “for me, but not anyone else.”

Trump seemed to lash out at the deal Thursday after it was trumpeted by President Biden and Vice President Harris, who met the prisoners at Joint Base Andrews in an emotional ceremony.

“Just curious because we never make good deals, at anything, but especially hostage swaps. Our ‘negotiators’ are always an embarrassment to us!” he said in a Truth Social post on Thursday."
"Bishop Richard Henning named new Archbishop of Boston, replacing Cardinal Sean O'Malley.",https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/archbishop-of-boston-cardinal-sean-omalley-bishop-richard-henning/,"BOSTON - Pope Francis has named Providence Bishop Richard Henning as the next Archbishop of Boston, replacing retiring Cardinal Sean O'Malley, according to the Archdiocese of Boston.

Cardinal O'Malley introduced Archbishop-elect Henning at a news conference Monday at the Pastoral Center in Braintree, after celebrating Mass together at 9 a.m.

Archbishop-elect Henning will officially be installed on Thursday, October 31 in a ceremony at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston.

Who is Bishop Richard Henning?

Henning, 59, grew up on Long Island in New York and was ordained a priest in 1992. He has been a bishop since 2018.

Pope Francis appointed him Coadjutor Bishop of Providence in November 2022. In May 2023, he succeeded Thomas Tobin as the Bishop of Providence. A little more than a year later, he's heading to Boston.

""Originally, it was just shock. But I had a little time to do some praying and to think a lot about it and I've really loved my time in Rhode Island, so that makes it a little bit of a mixed feeling today, but I'm excited for this new ministry,"" he told reporters in Braintree Monday.

""I feel grateful to the Holy Father for his confidence. This seems like an enormous task, so it's going to be something I'll have to throw myself entirely into.""

Bishop Richard Henning talks to reporters in Braintree, August 5, 2024. CBS Boston

His year in Providence was his first time as a diocesan bishop.

""I really loved getting to know the people there and to experience their witness of faith. So, I'm guessing that we have a few people who love the Lord here in Boston too, so I look forward to getting to know them,"" Henning said. ""I can tell you in Providence one of the key things for me was evangelization. I think we need to revive the faith. That's a key priority of the Holy Father as well.""

He was asked what the people of Boston should know about him.

""They should know I'm a sinner in need of grace,"" Henning said. ""I come to them as one of their own. I come from a family of faith. Certainly, my parents, my mom and dad are huge influences on me as a man, as a priest, as a bishop. I want to get to know them and I guess they'll have time to get to know me.""

Cardinal Sean O'Malley

O'Malley, 80, has been Archbishop of Boston since 2003, when he succeeded Cardinal Bernard Law, who had resigned at the height of the church sex abuse scandal. Pope Francis officially accepted his resignation Monday. He is five years past the standard retirement age for Catholic bishops.

Gov. Maura Healey said in a statement Monday that she was ""humbled and privileged to seek and receive his advice many times"" as attorney general and governor.

""I greatly admire his deep faith and his empathy and compassion for all,"" Healey said. ""He will be remembered for his lifesaving support for families experiencing homelessness, his advocacy for more affordable housing, his support for victims of human trafficking and his global leadership in the fight against climate change.""

An Ohio native, O'Malley was named the Bishop of Fall River in 1992 before becoming Bishop of Palm Beach, Florida in 2002. Less than a year later, he became Archbishop of Boston. He was made a cardinal by then-Pope Benedict XVI in 2006.

O'Malley spoke up for accountability in the wake of Cardinal Theodore McCarrick being defrocked in 2019 after the Vatican found him guilty of sex abuse.

""Leadership in the church must enforce accountability for cardinals and bishops…if we hope to have the opportunity to engage the laity in the work of tangible change in the church,"" O'Malley said in a statement at the time.

The cardinal also apologized in 2018 after revealing a secretary never handed him a letter in 2015 detailing allegations of misconduct against McCarrick. O'Malley released a statement at the time saying, ""I understand that not everyone will accept this answer given the way the Church has eroded the trust of our people. My hope is that we can repair the trust and faith of all Catholics.""

On Monday, attorney Mitchell Garabedian, who represents clergy sex abuse survivors, said O'Malley did not do a good job of naming all accused priests publicly.

""Cardinal O'Malley omits naming individuals who have been named one time or who are deceased,"" Garabedian said.

Archbishop of Boston

Henning was asked what he would say to lapsed Catholics who lost faith in the Church over the sex abuse scandal.

""I'll listen to their pain, their woundedness. I certainly lived through that as well. When these crimes and sins were committed, I was also a child. I'm grateful to God I was not affected by it personally, but people in my generation were,"" Henning said. ""If there are Catholics who are scandalized, I understand why they're scandalized. It's scandalous ... but it has not made me lose my faith in God or my faith in the possibility of reconciliation and new life.""

While Henning won't officially take over in Boston until October 31, he does have an early goal.

""I think my first priority has to be - listen. I don't think I should come with answers. I'm new to New England and I've been spending the last year learning Rhode Island so I don't know much yet about Massachusetts or Boston so I think the first year really has to be about visiting, listening, learning before I start setting priorities.""

Henning is fluent in Spanish, something O'Malley said ""will allow him to engage directly with our large Hispanic Catholic population.""

""The arrival of a new archbishop is always a time of renewal and hope,"" O'Malley said. ""Bishop Henning brings the heart of a pastor to his new role."""

BOSTON -- Pope Francis accepted the resignation of Cardinal Seán O’Malley as archbishop of Boston on Monday and named the bishop of Providence, Rhode Island, Richard Henning, to replace him as leader of one of the most important Catholic archdioceses in the United States.

The Vatican announcement didn’t mention O’Malley’s other main role as the pope's main adviser on fighting clergy sexual abuse as head of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, suggesting he would remain in that capacity until a new commission leader is named.

St. John Paul II had tapped O’Malley to take over in Boston in 2003 at the height of the clergy sexual abuse scandal that had exploded there following an investigation by The Boston Globe newspaper. Revelations of years of abuse and coverups by the church led to the downfall of then-archbishop Cardinal Bernard Law, who resigned in disgrace in December 2002.

“When I arrived it was a time of great crisis and of great pain because of the terrible scourge of sexual abuse,” O’Malley said at a news conference as he reflected on all changes the church has seen during his 40 years as a bishop. “But despite all the challenges we’ve had I’m full of hope.”

At age 80, O’Malley is five years beyond the normal retirement age for bishops. His 59-year-old successor, Henning, from Rockville Centre, Long Island, has been bishop of Providence since last year.

In terms of clergy abuse, the torch in Boston is being passed from a man whose contemporaries were the accused to one whose peers were the victims.

“When these crimes and sins were committed, I was also a child. I’m grateful to God that I was not affected by it personally, but people in my generation were,"" Henning said at the news conference. ""Those survivors, they deserve a listening heart. In some ways they have as much to proclaim to us about the gospel as we do to them.”

O'Malley called the arrival of a new archbishop “a time of renewal and hope” and described Henning as “someone who transmits hope to restless hearts.”

The Archdiocese of Boston is the fourth largest archdiocese in the U.S., serving more than 1.8 million Roman Catholics. It had operating expenses of more than $350 million in fiscal 2023, and its schools serve more than 46,000 students.

O'Malley will be remembered for his advocacy and support for families experiencing homelessness and victims of human trafficking, as well as his leadership in the fight against climate change, Gov. Maura Healey said in a statement. “I greatly admire his deep faith and his empathy and compassion for all,"" Healey said.

Henning said he was “deeply shocked and surprised” that he was chosen.

“I am very well aware that I have a lot to learn,” Henning said. “My first job, really, is just to be listener.”

Francis has long expressed his esteem for O'Malley and selected him as a founding member of his core cardinal advisers, known as the C9. O’Malley advised Francis not only on child protection issues, but also helped design the reform of the Vatican bureaucracy.

O’Malley’s relations with Francis haven’t always been easy. In 2018, he issued a blistering rebuke after the pope dismissed claims by survivors of Chile's most notorious abuser. O’Malley’s harsh tone was a wakeup call for Francis, who eventually apologized after commissioning an investigation into the Chilean scandal.

More recently, O’Malley’s commission flagged “serious problems” in the Vatican's handling of allegations against an ex-Jesuit artist, the Rev. Marko Rupnik, prompting Francis to order the case reopened.

Born in Ohio and ordained as a priest of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin in 1970, O’Malley came to Massachusetts in 1992 to serve as the bishop of Fall River, a diocese scandalized by a priest convicted of molesting children. O’Malley was tasked with settling abuse claims.

The experience proved useful in 2003, when, after spending time as Bishop of the Diocese of Palm Beach in Florida, he was appointed by Pope John Paul II as archbishop of Boston. Once again, he took over a district shaken by sexual abuse — this time a much higher-profile crisis involving dozens of priests.

David Clohessy, former national director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, criticized O’Malley for “a masterful job with his public relations but a terribly disappointing job with the church’s on-going abuse and cover up scandal.”

“He’s carefully crafted the impression of a ’reformer, while refusing to take some of the most simple and proven steps toward warning parents, parishioners and the public about potentially threatening clerics,” Clohessy said in a statement.

Henning likely will bring more of the same, said Mitchell Garabedian, an attorney who has represented abuse victims for decades.

“Bishop Henning has not been a strong voice for victims of clergy abuse by any means. He has not been a person who practices transparency concerning clergy sexual abuse. And he has not done any substantive work that would help protect children and help clergy sex abuse survivors to heal,” he said.

Robert Hoatson, co-founder of Road to Recovery, which helps survivors of clergy abuse, described Henning as the “same old, same old” type of bishop who talks about the infallibility of God instead of accountability for perpetrators.

“Guess what, Bishop Henning? No one has ever seen God. But victims have seen bishops running away and covering up. Victims see bishops not taking care of them,” said Hoatson, a clergy abuse survivor himself, as well as a former priest.

But O'Malley was praised by others, including Jennifer Wortham, a research associate at the Human Flourishing Program at Harvard University. Wortham, whose brothers were abused by a priest as children, said she met Pope Francis in 2016 and O'Malley in 2018 and found their concern to be genuine.

""As a sister of survivors of clergy abuse, it was very encouraging for me to hear and to know that the church was so committed to trying to help those that had been harmed with these tragic incidents,” she said.

In 2021, Wortham led a global symposium called “Faith and Flourishing: Strategies for Preventing and Healing Child Sexual Abuse"" that was sponsored by the commission O'Malley leads. She said the Roman Catholic Church’s early response was so focused on prevention that leaders failed to focus enough on the victims’ suffering and on their well being.

“One of the challenges the church grappled with is just not really understanding the extent of damage that’s done to victims and families,” she said.

In a brief interview, Henning said he plans to continue what he considers O'Malley's successful work.

“Obviously, I have work to do in terms of getting to know survivors here in the archdiocese and understanding the current environment,” Henning said. “I do know already that the archdiocese commits itself pretty passionately to the protection of young people in care. I consider that a lifelong passion of my own, so I look forward to understanding and continuing that legacy.""

Kevin Mochen, a parishioner who attended mass at Bethany Chapel in Braintree on Monday, said he expects O’Malley to continue working on behalf of abuse victims. He credited O’Malley with taking over a troubled archdiocese and getting it back on course.

“O’Malley came in and kind of put the diocese back on an even keel. And so that’s his legacy I would think,” Mochen said.

Pope Francis accepted the resignation of Cardinal Sean O'Malley on Monday morning, and appointed Bishop Richard Henning to the Archdiocese of Boston. O’Malley, 80, was the ninth bishop and sixth archbishop in the more than 200-year history of the Archdiocese of Boston.""We're one of the largest archdiocese of the United States, with around 250 parishes, almost 2 million Catholics, more than 900 priests, 300 deacons and almost 100 communities of religious women and men, and 115 Catholic schools.

At the time, the archdiocese was in turmoil, still grappling with the pain and fallout of the clergy sex abuse scandal. Before Boston, O’Malley served for about 10 years as the bishop of the Fall River Diocese and then briefly as the bishop of the Palm Beach, Florida, diocese. The Ohio native was elevated to cardinal by Pope Benedict XVI in 2006.In 1965, O’Malley professed in the Capuchin Order, a religious order dedicated to following in the tradition of St. Francis of Assisi. In 1970, he was ordained a priest in the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin.Traditionally, the retirement age for bishops is 75, but Pope Francis changed the rule eliminating forced retirement.“I want to extend my heartfelt congratulations and gratitude to Cardinal O’Malley on his successful two decades of leadership as the Archbishop of Boston,"" Gov.

""This morning, the Holy Father announced that he has named the Most Reverend Richard G. Henning, S.T.D. as the tenth bishop and seventh Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Boston,"" the Archdiocese of Boston said in its announcement Monday morning.

Henning, 59, will be installed as Archbishop of Boston on Oct. 31, at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston.

""I am grateful to His Holiness Pope Francis for his confidence in me and for his conferral of this new mission as Archbishop of Boston. I receive this appointment relying upon divine Providence, aware that this is the Lord’s Church and that I am no more than an unworthy servant,"" Henning said in a statement released Monday. ""I would also like to express my gratitude to His Eminence Cardinal Sean O’Malley who has served the Church of Boston for many faithful and joyful years. Greetings to the clergy and faithful of Boston. I ask you prayers that I may cling to the Lord’s Holy Cross, honor His mother, imitate His saints, and love you as His people and His ministers.”

O’Malley, who is now 80-years-old, has been archbishop of Boston since 2003.

""On behalf of the entire Archdiocese of Boston, including our priests, religious, deacons, and laity we welcome Archbishop-elect Richard Henning,"" O'Malley said in a statement Monday. ""We extend our deep gratitude to the Holy Father for this appointment demonstrating his ongoing pastoral care for the people of the Archdiocese. I look forward to our people and the wider community getting to know our new Archbishop-elect in the days, weeks, months and years ahead. He ministers with the heart of a pastor with a sincere commitment to serving Christ and the Church.”

O'Malley commented at the press conference about how Henning's ability to speak Spanish will help him engage directly with the large Hispanic population in Greater Boston.

Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey issued a statement Monday on O'Malley's retirement and Henning's appointment.

“I want to extend my heartfelt congratulations and gratitude to Cardinal O’Malley on his successful two decades of leadership as the Archbishop of Boston,"" she said. ""I greatly admire his deep faith and his empathy and compassion for all. He will be remembered for his lifesaving support for families experiencing homelessness, his advocacy for more affordable housing, his support for victims of human trafficking and his global leadership in the fight against climate change. I was humbled and privileged to seek and receive his advice many times during my time as Attorney General and Governor. We wish Cardinal O’Malley the very best in his new chapter and know that he will continue to be a guide and an inspiration for us all. I congratulate Bishop Henning on his appointment and look forward to working with him.""

Prior to his more than two decades serving in Boston, O’Malley served 10 years as the bishop of the Fall River Diocese.

O’Malley is known for calling for accountability following the 2019 church sex abuse scandal, during which a former cardinal with Boston's archdiocese was found guilty of sex abuse by the Vatican.

""My 20 years in Boston have been challenging, wonderful years in many respects,"" O'Malley said Monday. ""I arrived at a time of great crisis and great pain because of the terrible scourge of sexual abuse. Despite all of the challenges we have, I am filled with hope. I see the faith of our people, I see people who come forward to be a part of the mission of the church and have stayed with the church through very, very difficult times. The challenges for the church are very, very great, but the opportunities are very great.""

But David Clohessy, former national director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, criticized O’Malley for “a masterful job with his public relations but a terribly disappointing job with the church’s on-going abuse and cover up scandal.”

“He’s carefully crafted the impression of a ’reformer, while refusing to take some of the most simple and proven steps toward warning parents, parishioners and the public about potentially threatening clerics,” Clohessy said in a statement.

Henning likely will bring more of the same, said Mitchell Garabedian, an attorney who has been representing abuse victims for decades.

“Bishop Henning does not have track record of protecting children through either strongly speaking out against clergy sexual abuse or supporting substantive change,” he said in a statement calling Henning “a company man.”

“Victims believe Bishop Henning will basically ignore the ugly problem of clergy sexual abuse and hope it just goes away,” he said.

Henning is a bit of a surprise pick for some.

He’s a New York native who’s only been a bishop since 2018, and has only served as the bishop of Providence for one year.

Pope Francis first appointed him co-adjutor bishop of Providence back in 2022.

He succeeded Thomas Tobin as the bishop one year later, and now he’s poised to become just the seventh Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Boston.

Some Providence parishioners were surprised by the news.

“It's very surprising, you know, but the Vatican, you know, has its ways,"" one person said.

“It only happens so often. I mean, once the archbishop is set in stone, he'll stay in there for a good time being,"" another said. ""And so every time there's a change, it's a pretty big deal. So it's a pretty big deal for the Catholic Church in New England.""

At Monday morning's press conference, Henning said he was also surprised to received Pope Francis' call.

""Maybe some of you were surprised by this appointment as I was,"" he said. ""I am not worthy of this call. I was deeply shocked and surprised by this call. I think it took me about three minutes to respond. I had to go sit down first.""

Henning said his first thought was for the people of Rhode Island, who have been so good to him over the past year.

""The hardest part is leaving Rhode Island,"" he said. ""But if the Holy Father asks, my answer is always going to be yes. I have no regrets in saying that yes, even as I feel a certain sadness in leaving behind people who have been so kind to me.""

Henning said he sees a great opportunity for the Catholic Church in Boston.

""I know that the church has faced so many large crises. It's not new to us to have upheavals and difficulties. We come to them with that broader perspective that ultimately, God is in charge,"" he said. ""I think right now, I think the wider culture in which we live has also in some sense lost its way. People are searching, they don’t know even what to look for. I think the church has something to offer the wider culture. There’s a wisdom and a passion and a commitment to community there that I hope can be meaningful to all the people of the city, not just of the Catholic faith.""

If appointed, Henning would be responsible for the fourth largest Archdiocese in the U.S., consisting of 250 parishes, 115 Catholic schools, 900 priests and almost 2 million parishioners. It had operating expenses of more than $350 million in fiscal 2023.

I will never cease to pray for you, and I hope for your prayers for me.""

'They've been so good to me for a year'

At a news conference Monday announcing his appointment, Henning said that when he was asked to move to Boston his “first thought was the people in Rhode Island.”

“They have been so good to me for a year,” he said. “That was the hardest part of it for me.”

He was asked about clergy sexual abuse and what he would say to Catholics who turned away from the church because of the scandal.

“My message to them is I’ll listen to their pain, their woundedness,” he said.

He said he was also shocked and hurt by the pain caused by the abuse, but that it “has not caused me to lose my faith in God.”

Asked about other challenges facing the church, Henning said the institution can still be “meaningful to the whole city” and to society as a whole.

“I think the church has something to offer in its upheavals,” he said.

O’Malley welcomed Henning to the Boston Archdiocese.

“The arrival of a new archbishop is always a time of renewal and hope,” he said.

What happens next?

Henning will be installed as archbishop of Boston on Oct. 31, 2024, at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston. Until then, he will remain as the apostolic administrator of the Diocese of Providence, the Diocese explained in its release. Appointing the next bishop of Providence and the timing of such an appointment is the sole prerogative of the pope.

What to know about Bishop Henning

Henning was born in Rockville Centre, New York, in 1964 to Richard and Maureen Henning, the first of five siblings. He grew up in Valley Stream and attended Chaminade High School in Mineola, New York. In the summers, Henning's family enjoyed time on a small island in the Great South Bay where he developed a lifelong passion for the water, sailing, boating, and kayaking.

He studied Licentiates in Biblical Theology at The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., and University of St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome, according to his biography.

Before coming to Rhode Island, he was the auxiliary bishop for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre, which covers Long Island and has about 154 parishes for a population of more than 1.5 million Catholics.

Henning has been active in the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, serving on the Doctrine Committee, the Subcommittee for the Church in Latin America, and as the chairman of the Subcommittee for the Translation of the Sacred Scriptures. He serves on several boards, including those of Providence College and the Pontifical College Josephinum.

What is a bishop?

In the Catholic Church, bishops are considered the successors to the Apostles.

The bishop who leads a diocese is called the diocesan bishop, according to the release. He is the chief legislator, executive, and judge in the diocese.

How is archbishop different from a bishop?

An archbishop is a diocesan bishop of a so-called “metropolitan see.” Dioceses are grouped regionally into ecclesiastical provinces, and within each province one is designated as the metropolitan see and is called an Archdiocese. Sacramentally, an archbishop and a bishop are equivalent, but an archbishop is entitled to greater honor in matters of protocol.

Who is Cardinal O'Malley?

Cardinal Sean O' Malley, 80, served as bishop of Fall River from 1992 to 2002, and wears the brown robes of the Capuchins, an order of priests dedicated to following St. Francis of Assisi. Pope John Paul II appointed O’Malley the archbishop of Boston on July 1, 2003, after the resignation of Cardinal Bernard Law, who stepped down in disgrace over his handling of the clergy sex abuse crisis.

Pope Benedict XVI elevated O'Malley to cardinal on March 24, 2006, and gave him the titular church of Santa Maria della Vittoria in Rome. During a trip to Rome to take formal possession of his titular church in September 2006, Cardinal O’Malley became the first cardinal in the world to launch a personal blog, cardinalseansblog.org, which he continues to update weekly.

According to an Associated Press article in 2013, the leading Italian newspaper, Corriere della Sera, in a poll of experts, found O' Malley topped their list of possible new popes, having received high marks for his care for the poor and dealing with victims of clerical sexual abuse.

Pope Francis selected Cardinal O’Malley to be the only North American member of his Council of Cardinal Advisors, commonly called the “C9,” who advise the Holy Father on the restructuring of the Roman Curia."
"Bishop Richard Henning named new Archbishop of Boston, replacing Cardinal Sean O'Malley.",https://www.pillarcatholic.com/p/the-long-road-to-replacing-cardinal,"The announcement Monday that Bishop Richard Henning will replace Cardinal Sean O’Malley as Archbishop of Boston has ended one of the longest-running points of speculation in the Church in the United States.

Cardinal Sean O’Malley and Bishop Richard Henning at a press conference, Aug. 5, 2024.

O’Malley steps down after more than two decades in charge of what has traditionally been one of the country’s most prominent sees. He turned 80 years old in June, aging him out of participation in a future conclave, and putting him more than five years past the nominal episcopal retirement age.

The announcement of Henning as his replacement follows years of speculation about who would follow the cardinal in Boston, with the Providence bishop something of a surprise choice, having only arrived in Rhode Island in 2023.

From auxiliary bishop of Long Island to Archbishop of Boston in less than two years is something of a meteoric rise for Henning. But his sudden ascent follows a years-long behind the scenes battle over who would replace Cardinal O’Malley.

Although Cardinal O’Malley became theoretically eligible for retirement in 2019, no one seriously expected his to be a prompt departure from office.

In the wake of the Spotlight scandals of the early 2000s and the public disgrace of his predecessor Cardinal Bernard Law, O’Malley arrived in Boston having already made a name for himself as an unflinching confronter of historical scandals. Like his eventual successor in Boston, he spent only a few months in his previous diocesan assignment in Palm Beach before being asked to move to Massachusetts.

Following his election in 2013, Pope Francis named O’Malley as both president of the newly established Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors and a member of Francis’ C9 kitchen cabinet of cardinal advisors — both positions O’Malley still retains for the time being.

After the annus horribilis of 2018, which saw the twin scandals of Theodore McCarrick and the Chilean episcopal abuse crisis, O’Malley emerged as an internationally credible figure on abuse, and as a Churchman who could publicly challenge Pope Francis’ handling of sensitive cases — as he did over the case of Bishop Juan Barros.

As such, few expected Francis to accept O’Malley’s resignation in a hurry, especially given the pope’s marked preference for leaving close collaborators in post past retirement age. But few expected O’Malley to continue past 80, even if only by a few months.

Several sources close to O’Malley have told The Pillar that the cardinal himself was in no hurry to retire and that he himself pushed back against different moves to appoint a successor — a stance which both delayed and influenced conversations over who would eventually follow him.

One senior Boston cleric, who worked closely with O’Malley for years, told The Pillar that O’Malley resisted suggestions he step aside in recent years, both because he felt he was still doing a good job as archbishop and in his other roles, and because he wanted to be a serving diocesan bishop for as long as he was eligible to attend a future conclave.

“I think Cardinal Sean has always been clear he wants to be ‘at work’, and never known as the ‘former’ anything. I think he especially [didn’t] want to go into a conclave as ‘emeritus’ anything.”

The same cleric described O’Malley as someone with “a lot of mental bandwidth.”

“I wouldn’t describe him as a micromanager, but he definitely wants to be involved in everything that is going on,” the cleric said. “I can easily see this playing into talking about who would follow him [in Boston].”

By all accounts, O’Malley did have a considerable influence, directly and indirectly, on the process which led to Bishop Henning’s appointment on Monday.

Sources close to the Dicastery for Bishops in Rome told The Pillar that discussions over the next Archbishop of Boston had been going on “for years” and that O’Malley was one of a number of strong voices in the conversation.

“There were many opinions,” one official told The Pillar, “and not a lot of agreement.”

The official told The Pillar that several influential American prelates had initially lobbied for San Diego’s Cardinal Robert McElroy to be transferred to Boston, led by Chicago’s Cardinal Blase Cupich, who, as a member of the Dicastery for Bishops, wields considerable influence over American episcopal appointments.

“It was a strong push for [McElroy],” the official said. “It was clear this was considered a sensitive appointment and there was a desire [from Cupich] to have his own voice in the matter.”

The same official described Cardinal Christophe Pierre, the apostolic nuncio to the United States, as “very cool” on the suggestion of McElroy.

“The nuncio is, of course, an important point of consultation,” he said, “and without speaking for him I would say he had concerns that the appointment not be polarizing, either for the faithful or among the bishops.”

The senior Boston cleric told The Pillar that the possibility of Cardinal McElroy coming to Boston was discussed among the archdiocese’s priests and staff, calling the prospect “in the water” in the archdiocese, especially in 2022-23.

“A lot of people heard the rumor that this was a possibility,” the cleric said. “I don’t know that many people [in Boston] considered it really likely, but we all heard it.”

But an official at the Vatican’s Secretariat of State told The Pillar that the prospect of a McElroy appointment was being pushed very seriously in Rome, to the point that in the early summer of 2023 the former Archbishop of Washington, D.C., Cardinal Donald Wuerl, flew to Rome to personally lobby Pope Francis about the appointment.

“I think that was the big push,” the official said, recalling that, after successive visits from Cardinals Wuerl and Cupich, Francis appeared to shut down talk of transferring McElroy.

“He became very annoyed, I think. It was too much, [the pope] felt pressured and didn’t want to hear about it.”

But, the official said, Cardinal O’Malley’s own reluctance to retire — and his irritation at his fellow American cardinals effectively lobbying to have him replaced — was a crucial factor in determining the final decision over his successor.

“[Cardinal O’Malley] works very closely with the pope on many issues, in the council [of cardinal advisors] and the commission [for the protection of minors]. He and the pope have a relationship going back many years,” he said. “It’s one thing to ask for a particular appointment without the support of the nuncio, but it’s another to ask the pope to replace a collaborator against his own wishes.”

O’Mally was widely understood, both in Rome and among the U.S. bishops, to be angered by the concerted lobbying effort over his replacement, which he saw as infringing on his own prerogative to inform the decision.

According to several familiar with the process, it was O’Malley himself who eventually made the strongest argument for Henning to be his replacement. Though at one point O’Malley was known to favor the possibility closer to home, with several sources in Rome and Boston telling The Pillar that Boston auxiliary Bishop Mark O’Connell was often mentioned as a potential successor.

One official close to the Dicastery for Bishops told The Pillar that O’Connell, whom O’Malley named vicar general of the archdiocese in January 2023, was at one point considered a strong possibility, especially in the later half of last year.

“I think there was a moment where it was possible, after the pope ruled out McElroy,” the official said, but added that O’Malley “did not seem to favor beginning with [O’Connell] as a coadjutor, and the conversation began all over again.”

Bishop Henning’s emergence as the eventual successor, with O’Malley’s personal backing, the official suggested, owed as much to the years-long stalemate over a nomination as it did to Henning’s own reputation as a pastorally minded and evangelizing bishop, well-liked by all sides.

The newly installed Providence bishop was still an unorthodox pick, having only been in charge of the diocese for a little over a year, after what he called a five-month time of “apprenticeship” as coadjutor to Bishop Thomas Tobin.

Once Cardinal O’Malley approached the age of 80, the official said, there was “a certain urgency” to identify a candidate, and Henning was presented as someone “already known, vetted, and acceptable to everyone” — with O’Malley reportedly feeling eventually confident enough in Henning to lobby for the man as his own successor.

Looking beyond the Boston appointment, with several other American archdioceses due for changes in leadership in the coming months and years, the unspoken subtext of Henning’s appointment may be how contentious the process has become for naming bishops to major U.S. sees.

While some major archdioceses with bishops over 75 — like Galverston-Houston, Washington, and Chicago — will likely be left for a few more years before their cardinal incumbents are replaced, others may not be able to wait that long.

As those appointments come up, the question may become: are there enough Hennings to go around?

"Bishop Richard Henning named new Archbishop of Boston, replacing Cardinal Sean O'Malley.",https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/08/05/archdiocese-of-boston-announces-bishop-richard-henning-as-new-leader/,"Bishop Richard Henning will take over as the new leader of the Archdiocese of Boston, Pope Francis announced Monday.

“As I look forward now to this new ministry in the Bay State, I would like to offer greetings to the clergy, religious and faithful of Boston and to all men and women of goodwill,” said Henning at a press event Monday morning. “I’m humbled by the size and the history of this Archdiocese, and I am very well aware I have a lot to learn, and so I’ll be looking for, eager for your witness of faith and to learn your wisdom.”

Henning, 59, now leads the Diocese of Providence in Rhode Island. The Archbishop-elect will replace Cardinal Sean O’Malley, 80, the long-time head of the Catholic church in Boston.

The Vatican released the news in a memo from Pope Francis early Monday, and the archdiocese confirmed the news at a 10 a.m. joint press conference at the Archdiocese of Boston Pastoral Center in Braintree. Archbishop-elect Henning will be installed as Archbishop of Boston Oct. 31 at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston.

Henning will be the tenth bishop and seventh archbishop of the Archdiocese of Boston, which was created in 1808.

“We’re blessed with a very vibrant Catholic community,” O’Malley said of Boston. “For the two decades that I have been here as Archbishop. I found strength in the deep faith of our Catholic people. They care about the less fortunate, forgotten, sick, single mothers caring for children, persons suffering from addiction, migrants, and for the homeless.”

O’Malley was appointed the Archbishop of Boston in 2003 by Pope John Paul II, succeeding Cardinal Bernard Law after he resigned amid the fallout of the clergy sex abuse scandal. The Archbishop was appointed a cardinal in 2006 by Pope Benedict XVI.

The Ohio-native served as Bishop of Fall River for a decade and briefly as Bishop of Palm Beach before coming to Boston.

During his time as a cardinal, O’Malley was brought into the Council of Cardinal Advisers by Pope Francis after it was formed to help govern and reform the Catholic Church in 2013 and Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors in 2014. He served as president of the Commission from 2014 until 2024, when he reached the age for mandatory retirement from the post.

Gov. Maura Healey issued a statement congratulating the cardinal on his service and retirement and thanking him for the chance to “seek and receive his advice many times” in office.

“I greatly admire his deep faith and his empathy and compassion for all,” Healey said. “He will be remembered for his lifesaving support for families experiencing homelessness, his advocacy for more affordable housing, his support for victims of human trafficking and his global leadership in the fight against climate change.”

O'Malley offered his resignation when he turned 75 in 2019, which is requested of cardinals by the church, but was asked to stay on longer. Cardinals lose their right to vote in a conclave at age 80. Despite his retirement, O’Malley said he’s not planning on “taking up golf” anytime soon and will remain active in the church.

As the head of the Diocese of Providence for just over a year, Henning acknowledged his appointment may come as a surprise to many, “as it was to (him).” He succeeded Bishop Thomas Tobin after his retirement in May 2023, becoming a Bishop.

Originally from New York, Henning was previously appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Providence in 2022 by Pope Francis.

Henning spoke on several issues within the church’s purview, including the fallout of sexual abuse, the local migrant crisis, and abortion.

“I will admit I don't know that I've ever been an activist,” Henning said. “I'm not that exciting. And my stance in Providence has been that I'm a pastor and not a politician.”

The bishop noted he is pro-life, “because I believe that the gospel teaches us sacred dignity of every human life,” but added that “every woman should have a full choice.” Of the migrant crisis, Henning said he will become educated in the role of the Archdiocese and thinks of the issue in the lens of “reverence for the human person.”

Henning noted he was a child as “crimes and sins were committed” during the clergy abuse scandal and expressed the intent to listen to the continued “pain and woundedness” of survivors.

Others expressed concern with Henning’s appointment and O’Malley’s legacy on sexual abuse in the archdiocese.

“To most clergy sexual abuse victims, the replacement of Cardinal O’Malley by Bishop Henning is business as usual within the Catholic Church,” said Mitchell Garabedian, a lawyer for clergy sexual abuse victims. “Bishop Henning does not have track record of protecting children through either strongly speaking out against clergy sexual abuse or supporting substantive change.”

The leadership transition will take place over the next several months, Henning said Monday, stating he will commute regularly from Providence. As a multilingual pastor, he said, he is ""eager to get to know our Spanish-speaking Catholics here in the Archdiocese.""

The Archbishop appointment was the most shocking one of his career, Henning added, and he took three minutes to sit down and respond after picking up the phone and hearing the news.

""I am not worthy of this call,"" Henning said at the press conference. ""I was deeply shocked and surprised by this call, but I know the goodness of God suffices in all things. I will trust in Him. God bless the Archdiocese of Boston."""

ROME – Capping more than twenty years as one of American Catholicism’s most influential leaders, Cardinal Sean O’Malley’s tenure as the Archbishop of Boston ended Monday as the Vatican announced Pope Francis has accepted his resignation and named Bishop Richard Henning of Providence as his successor.

Henning now becomes a metropolitan archbishop, with direct authority over Boston and an indirect supervisory role over six other dioceses in Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.

The Vatican’s Aug. 5 statement confirmed rumors first reported by Rocco Palmo, a veteran Catholic writer, indicating that O’Malley, who turned 80 earlier this summer and is no longer able to vote in the next conclave, was retiring and being replaced by Henning.

A Capuchin Franciscan, O’Malley has served as the Archbishop of Boston since 2003. Prior to Boston, he served as bishop of Saint Thomas in the American Virgin Islands, then as bishop of Fall River, Massachusetts, and then as bishop of Palm Beach, Florida.

Speaking an idiomatically fluent Spanish, O’Malley has long had a reputation for his work with and advocacy on behalf of migrants and the impoverished, having served various immigrant communities.

He is also well known for his efforts to advance child protection, having taken over in Boston for Cardinal Bernard Law, who resigned in 2002 amid the fallout of the clerical sexual abuse scandals, including allegations of coverup, that exploded in the United States after a massive exposé by the Boston Globe, leading the entire national church to adopt a sweeping reform of safeguarding policies.

O’Malley in 2013 was selected as an original member the pope’s then-newly formed Council of Cardinals advising him on matters of church governance and reform, to represent North America. He is one of the few original members to remain in the group.

In large part because of his successful reform efforts in safeguarding, O’Malley in 2014 was also tapped to lead the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors (PCPM), a role in which he has had to navigate several high-profile cases, including the scandals in 2018 surrounding American former cardinal and former priest Theodore McCarrick, and the ongoing case of Slovenian Father Marko Rupnik.

O’Malley recently made waves for penning a letter to the prefects and heads of Vatican departments asking them to exercise “pastoral prudence” in the display, including online, of artwork produced by Rupnik, who is accused of abusing at least 30 adult women.

His letter came shortly after Italian layman Paolo Ruffini, prefect of the Vatican Dicastery for Communications, had caused backlash for defending his departments continued use of Rupnik’s artwork on their website, and for implying that the abuse was not as serious since it did not involve minors.

Despite stepping down as archbishop of Boston, O’Malley is expected to stay on at the commission for the time being at the personal request of Pope Francis."

Cardinal O'Malley introduced Archbishop-elect Henning at a news conference Monday morning at the Archdiocese of Boston's Pastoral Center in Braintree after they celebrated Mass together. ""We trust that your new job here will bring you much happiness and many graces,"" O'Malley said at the news conference. ""It will bring you many challenges, I can promise you that, but there are also many, many joys.""

Henning, 59, grew up on Long Island, N.Y. and was ordained a priest in 1992.

He said getting the call of the new position was shocking and he has much to learn. ""My first job is to be a listener and to begin to understand,"" Henning said.

O'Malley, who is 80, has been Archbishop of Boston since 2003.

He succeeded Cardinal Bernard Law who resigned at the height of the church sex abuse scandal.

Pope Francis officially accepted O'Malley's resignation on Monday.

"Bishop Richard Henning named new Archbishop of Boston, replacing Cardinal Sean O'Malley.",https://catholicvote.org/newly-appointed-boston-archbishop-looks-ahead-at-new-role/,"CV NEWS FEED // Bishop Richard Henning, newly-appointed by the Vatican to replace Cardinal Sean O’Malley as the Archbishop of Boston, said of taking the new position during a presidential election season that he wants to help Catholics in the Archdiocese “form their consciences,” and emphasized Church teaching on lay people’s responsibility to engage in politics.

An August 5 news release from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops announced that Pope Francis appointed Bishop Henning of the Diocese of Providence, Rhode Island, as the new archbishop after accepting the resignation of Cardinal Seán O’Malley, OFM Cap., who has served as archbishop in Boston since 2003. Cardinal O’Malley has been the longest lasting member of the special commission of Cardinals created by Pope Francis at the beginning of his pontificate.

During the August 5 press conference hosted by the Archdiocese of Boston, Cardinal O’Malley introduced Bishop Henning, saying, “The arrival of a new archbishop is always a time of renewal and hope.”

“To the people of the Archdiocese, Bishop-elect Henning brings the heart of a pastor in his new role,” the Cardinal continued:

[Bishop Henning’s] fluency in Spanish will allow him to engage directly with our large Hispanic Catholic population; the archbishop-elect has extensive academic credentials, having received a BA and MA in history from St. John’s University in New York, received his training for priesthood at the Seminary of Immaculate Conception in New York, and following his ordination, in 1992, he earned his licentiate in Biblical Theology at the Catholic University of America, and doctorate from the University of St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome.

Following the introduction, Bishop Henning expressed that he is “very grateful to Almighty God, for the abundance of life made possible by His love and His grace, and I invoke the Lord’s help as I look forward to beginning this new ministry.”

“I’m also grateful to our Holy Father, for his confidence and the gift of this call to shepherd the extraordinary church” in the archdiocese of Boston, he added.

Both Cardinal O’Malley and Bishop Henning fielded questions on what lies ahead for both of them, Bishop Henning responded to questions about current political topics, and the Church’s response to the clergy sex abuse crisis, among other topics.

In response to a question about how “activist” he anticipates being on topics such as abortion and same-sex “marriage” given that he is taking on the new role during a presidential election year, Bishop Henning explained that his “stance in Providence has been that I’m a pastor and not a politician.”

He said that the Church teaches that lay people have the right and obligation to engage in the political process, adding that “it is really, in the sense, their arena first and foremost, so it’s really not for me to comment on candidates or how people should vote, or things like that.”

“The Church does advocate for policy matters related to Church teaching, and that’s a host of things, not all of them always end up in public view,” he continued, emphasizing “there’s a whole host of things that the Church might comment on.”

“So I think what I want to do is to help the Catholics, the faithful, of this Archdiocese, form their consciences,” Bishop Henning said, adding, “and I certainly have opinions. I will vote, you know, as an American citizen. I’ll never tell you for whom I vote. I don’t belong to a party, that’s not my job to advocate for either side.”

Bishop Henning also responded to a question about what his response is to those in the Archdiocese of Boston who have left the Church over their disapproval of how the Church has handled the clergy sex abuse crisis.

“My message to them is, I’ll listen to their pain, their woundedness,” Bishop Henning said.

“I certainly lived through that as well,” he continued. “You know, when these crimes and sins were committed, I was also a child and, I’m grateful to God that I was not affected by it personally, but people in my generation were, so I think those survivors, they deserve, they just deserve a listening heart. In some ways, they often have as much to proclaim to us about the Gospel as we would to them.”

The scandal has “certainly been painful” for him throughout his life, Bishop Henning said, “but it has not made me lose my faith in God, or my faith in the possibility of reconciliation and new life, even in the midst of what may feel devastating.”

“So I would say to them, that if I have failed you, if a leader in the Church has failed you, I’m so sorry. But God has not failed you,” he said. “God is still with you, and it would be tragic for you to lose your relationship with God, the blessings that flow from that, because of my actions or failures, but at the end of the day, all I can do is listen and hope and pray with the person, I think.”

Cardinal O’Malley said that Bishop Henning will be installed as the new archbishop on October 31, after the Synod on Synodality has taken place.

As CatholicVote previously reported, Cardinal O’Malley celebrated his 80th birthday on June 29, marking the end of his eligibility to vote in a future papal conclave, and his eligibility to be elected pope. Cardinal O’Malley has served as the USCCB chairman of the Committee on Pro-Life Activities, and has served on boards for the Catholic University of America and Catholic Relief Services, among other boards.

When Cardinal O’Malley was asked to reflect on what he believes his legacy has been, the Cardinal responded, “Well, I guess I haven’t been thinking in terms of my legacy. My ministry here was done with the support and the help of so many wonderful people that, if there’s any legacy, it’s a work of a communion of people who are loved the Church, love their faith, and love Christ, and have wanted to be a part of the mission that He has entrusted to us.”

Moving forward, Cardinal O’Malley said that his time will likely be divided between Boston and the Capuchin Monastery in Washington, D.C., noting that he has 20 years of experience working in Washington with immigrants and expects to be involved in that ministry again.

During his days as a priest in Washington, D.C., then Fr. O’Malley mastered Spanish, Portuguese and Creole (spoken in Haiti), to serve the immigrant community.

In the press conference, he also noted that Pope Francis has requested that he continue in his role as President for the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors.

Concluding, Cardinal O’Malley said, “I will try and stay out the new archbishop’s way, but to be available to him if he needs me for anything, but I am so grateful to the kindness, the patience of the people of the archdiocese who have put up with me for 21 years and have always been so kind and loving.”"

O’Malley has served more than 20 years as Boston’s archbishop, taking over in the aftermath of the scandal that led to the resignation of his predecessor, Cardinal Bernard Law. O’Malley, 80, has been in the position more than five years past the typical retirement age for bishops.

BRAINTREE- Bishop Richard Henning of Providence has been selected to succeed Cardinal Seán P. O’Malley, who helped lead the Archdiocese of Boston out of the priest sexual abuse scandal that rocked the church more than two decades ago, according to an announcement Monday from the Holy See .

During a 6-minute homily, O’Malley said a new head of the church in Boston represented “a moment of renewal, of joy, and of gratitude.”

“It will bring you many challenges, I promise you that, but it will also bring many, many joys,” he said to Henning.

A press conference is scheduled for 10 a.m, the archidocese said in a statement Monday.

Henning and O’Malley issued a statement ahead of the press conference.

“I am grateful to His Holiness Pope Francis for his confidence in me and for his conferral of this new mission as Archbishop of Boston,” Henning said. “I receive this appointment relying upon divine Providence, aware that this is the Lord’s Church and that I am no more than an unworthy servant. I would also like to express my gratitude to His Eminence Cardinal Sean O’Malley who has served the Church of Boston for many faithful and joyful years.”

O’Malley, in the same statement, said the selection of Henning demonstrates Pope Francis’ “ongoing pastoral care for the people of the Archdiocese.”

“On behalf of the entire Archdiocese of Boston, including our priests, religious, deacons, and laity we welcome Archbishop-elect Richard Henning,” O’Malley said. “I look forward to our people and the wider community getting to know our new Archbishop-elect in the days, weeks, months and years ahead. He ministers with the heart of a pastor with a sincere commitment to serving Christ and the Church.”

Henning will be formally installed into his new duties at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross, the mother church of the archdiocese, in the South End on Oct. 31, the archdiocese said.

Henning, 59, has been in his current role for just over a year. The news that he is has been named the next archbishop of Boston was first reported by Catholic commentator Rocco Palmo in a post on the social media platform X, who described it as a “shock pick.”

O’Malley, named archbishop in 2003 and cardinal in 2006, is a close ally of Pope Francis, who asked him to remain at his post after 2019, when he submitted his required letter of resignation.

O’Malley participated in the 2013 papal conclave that elected Francis and is an original member of the influential Council of Cardinals, formed by Francis soon after his election.

Before becoming bishop of Providence, Henning served as auxiliary bishop for the Diocese of Rockville Centre, N.Y., from 2018 to 2022. He was then a coadjutor bishop alongside Bishop Thomas Tobin in Providence until Tobin’s retirement in 2023.

The Rockville Centre diocese, which covers most of Long Island, filed for bankruptcy in 2020 after hundreds of sexual abuse cases were filed against it under New York’s Child Victims Act, which allowed survivors time to file claims despite the statute of limitations. In May, the case was sent to mediation after the majority of survivors rejected a proposed $200 million settlement and the archdiocese sought to dismiss its own bankruptcy.

When he was named as coadjutant bishop of Providence, Henning told the Globe that Rockville Centre’s bankruptcy has been “a long and difficult process.” He said it was a “learning experience” that he said he hopes to not go through ever again.

“The decision to enter into Chapter 11 was driven by the desire to first have the resources to address survivors, but also to be able to continue the mission of the church,” Henning told the Globe in a 2022 interview.

He said he has respect for Rockville Centre Diocese’s leadership for their handling of the bankruptcy.

Handling of sexual abuse was a central occupation of O’Malley’s tenure, said Massimo Faggioli, a professor at Villanova University’s department of theology and religious studies.

“He was called to clean up the mess left by Cardinal Law and also to clean up the mess created by the Vatican itself in dealing with Cardinal Law,” Faggioli said. “In the US, he was appointed to give a credible face to the fight against the abuses, and in that he has succeeded.”

The Cardinal also criticized Pope Francis on the issue when the pope was dismissive of allegations against a Chilean bishop in 2018.

But O’Malley’s efforts in the Vatican as president of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors have been less successful, Faggioli said.

O’Malley has been the commission’s chief since it was created in 2014. Faggioli said that O’Malley could have asked the Vatican for more resources and personnel.

“Cardinal O’Malley wasn’t really as present in the day-by-day running of the pontifical commission, and he let the pontifical commission lose some of the credibility it could have had,” Faggioli said

In 2023, Jesuit priest and sex abuse expert Hans Zollner resigned from the commission, citing operational concerns, including in areas related to accountability and transparency. O’Malley disputed his criticisms.

Some critics think O’Malley didn’t do enough in terms of accountability, even in his own archdiocese. For example, he was criticized by some abuse victims and their advocates for omitting some names from a list of credibly accused priests in Boston, which the archdiocese released in 2011.

O’Malley said this was because some were from other religious orders. Many of the omitted priests had passed away or were unable to respond to accusations.

Before his time in Boston, O’Malley was praised for how he handled the fallout from clergy sexual abuse scandals as the bishop of Fall River and Palm Beach, Fla. In Fall River, he instituted one of the church’s first comprehensive sexual abuse policies and settled 101 claims.

O’Malley, a Capuchin Franciscan often seen in a brown habit, signifying the order’s simplicity and dedication to supporting the poor, speaks seven languages, worked among poor immigrants in Washington, D.C., and opened homeless shelters and an AIDS hospice as the new bishop in the Virgin Islands in the 1980s.

O’Malley would leave Henning with an archdiocese in much better financial shape than he received it. It had a $15 million annual deficit when he took over in 2003. In 2023, it had a $13 million surplus.

Yet, the archdiocese still faces some headwinds. Weekly church attendance and Catholic school enrollment have continued to decline. Attendance fell from 316,000 in 2003 to 201,000 in 2019, before the COVID-19 crisis. Enrollment dropped from 55,000 in 2003 to 32,000 today.

Thomas H. Groome, a professor of theology and religious education at Boston College, called the decline a worldwide phenomenon in the church that can’t be attributed to any one leader.

“He’s helped us to hang in and cherish the richness of our Catholic faith even while we are embarrassed by and terribly disappointed and betrayed by the clergy sex abuse scandal,” Groome said.

In Providence, Henning was replacing a bishop, Tobin, who was known for his outspoken opposition to gay marriage and abortion rights. Tobin criticized Pope Francis in 2020 for his support for same-sex civil unions.

In contrast, Henning said in his 2022 interview that his beliefs align “entirely” with the pope’s. (Pope Francis has maintained Catholic doctrine against abortion and gay marriage but has said the church should not be “obsessed” with them.”

Henning was born in Rockville Centre, N.Y., in 1964, and is the oldest of five children. His father was a firefighter and his mother was a nurse. He is fluent in Spanish and Italian.

The Reverend Laura Everett, executive director of the Massachusetts Council of Churches, said in a statement she welcomed Henning to Boston and noted that several other denominations have also recently chosen new local leaders.

“We give thanks for Cardinal O’Malley’s pastoral care and dedication over these past twenty-one years,” Everett said. “A number of new Church leaders will begin their episcopacies in the next few months, giving the whole Church a chance to rebuild and grow closer together.”

"Bishop Richard Henning named new Archbishop of Boston, replacing Cardinal Sean O'Malley.",https://www.yahoo.com/news/pope-francis-names-archbishop-boston-103213098.html,"New archbishop of Boston ‘deeply shocked’ after Pope Francis picks him to replace Cardinal O’Malley

Pope Francis on Monday morning named a new archbishop of Boston, replacing Cardinal Sean O’Malley, who is retiring after holding the position for more than 20 years.

O’Malley introduced 59-year-old Reverend Richard G. Henning, the current bishop of Providence, Rhode Island, as the tenth bishop and seventh archbishop of the Archdiocese of Boston, one of the most important Catholic archdioceses in the United States.

“The arrival of a new archbishop is always a time of renewal and hope,” O’Malley said at a news conference. “Pope Francis has said a priest is someone who transmits hope to restless hearts. Archbishop Henning is a joyful pastor who seeks to serve Christ.”

The Archdiocese of Boston is the fourth largest archdiocese in the U.S., serving more than 1.8 million Roman Catholics. It had operating expenses of more than $350 million in fiscal 2023, and its schools serve more than 46,000 students.

Henning said he was “deeply shocked and surprised” by being chosen for his new role.

“I am very well aware that I have a lot to learn,” Henning said. “My first job, really, is just to be listener.”

St. John Paul II had tapped O’Malley to take over in Boston in 2003 at the height of the clergy sexual abuse scandal that had exploded there following an investigation by the Boston Globe newspaper. Revelations of years of abuse and coverups by the church led to the downfall of then-archbishop Cardinal Bernard Law, who resigned in disgrace in December 2002.

At age 80, O’Malley is five years beyond the normal retirement age for bishops. His 59-year-old successor, Henning, from Rockville Centre, Long Island, has been bishop of Providence since last year.

Francis has long expressed his esteem for O’Malley and selected him as a founding member of his core cardinal advisers, known as the C9.

In that role, O’Malley advised Francis not only on child protection issues but also helped design the reform of the Vatican bureaucracy.

Born in Ohio and ordained as a priest of the Order of Friars of Minor Capuchin in 1970, O’Malley came to Massachusetts in 1992 to serve as the bishop of Fall River, a diocese that had been rocked by a sexual abuse scandal involving a priest convicted of molesting children. O’Malley was tasked with settling abuse claims.

The experience proved useful in 2003, when, after spending time as Bishop of the Diocese of Palm Beach in Florida, he was appointed by Pope John Paul II as archbishop of Boston. Once again, he took over a district shaken by sexual abuse — this time a much higher-profile crisis involving dozens of priests.

But David Clohessy, former national director of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, criticized O’Malley for “a masterful job with his public relations but a terribly disappointing job with the church’s ongoing abuse and cover-up scandal.”

“He’s carefully crafted the impression of a ‘reformer while refusing to take some of the most simple and proven steps toward warning parents, parishioners, and the public about potentially threatening clerics,” Clohessy said in a statement.

Henning likely will bring more of the same, said Mitchell Garabedian, an attorney who has been representing abuse victims for decades.

“Bishop Henning does not have a track record of protecting children through either strongly speaking out against clergy sexual abuse or supporting substantive change,” he said in a statement calling Henning “a company man.”

“Victims believe Bishop Henning will basically ignore the ugly problem of clergy sexual abuse and hope it just goes away,” he said.

O’Malley’s relations with Francis haven’t always been easy. In 2018, he issued a blistering statement rebuking Francis after the pope dismissed claims of abuse by Chilean survivors of the country’s most notorious abuser.

O’Malley’s harsh tone was something of a wake-up call for Francis, who eventually apologized after commissioning an investigation into the Chilean scandal.

More recently, O’Malley’s commission flagged “serious problems” in the way the Vatican had handled the case of an ex-Jesuit artist, the Rev. Marko Rupnik, prompting Francis to order the case reopened.

Henning expressed gratitude to Pope Francis for the new appointment and described O’Malley as a faithful servant who “has served the Church of Boston for many faithful and joyful years” during his tenure.

“I am grateful to His Holiness Pope Francis for his confidence in me and for his conferral of this new mission as Archbishop of Boston. I receive this appointment relying upon divine Providence, aware that this is the Lord’s Church and that I am no more than an unworthy servant,” he said in a statement.

O’Malley was appointed archbishop of the Boston Archdiocese in 2003 by Pope John Paul II, according to his official biography. His appointment came in the wake of the resignation of Cardinal Bernard Law as the Archdiocese grappled with the fallout of the revelations of widespread sex abuse among its ranks."
"Bishop Richard Henning named new Archbishop of Boston, replacing Cardinal Sean O'Malley.",https://www.boston25news.com/news/local/pope-francis-names-new-archbishop-boston-replacing-cardinal-sean-omalley/2CE2LWKIMFFU7GNVMQLSEDCRC4/,"BOSTON — Pope Francis on Monday morning named a new archbishop of Boston, replacing Cardinal Sean O’Malley, who is retiring after holding the position for more than 20 years.

O’Malley introduced 59-year-old Reverend Richard G. Henning, the current bishop of Providence, Rhode Island, as the tenth bishop and seventh archbishop of the Archdiocese of Boston, one of the most important Catholic archdioceses in the United States.

“The arrival of a new archbishop is always a time of renewal and hope,” O’Malley said at a news conference. “Pope Francis has said a priest is someone who transmits hope to restless hearts. Archbishop Henning is a joyful pastor who seeks to serve Christ.”

The Archdiocese of Boston is the fourth largest archdiocese in the U.S., serving more than 1.8 million Roman Catholics. It had operating expenses of more than $350 million in fiscal 2023, and its schools serve more than 46,000 students.

Henning said he was “deeply shocked and surprised” by being chosen for his new role.

“I am very well aware that I have a lot to learn,” Henning said. “My first job, really, is just to be listener.”

St. John Paul II had tapped O’Malley to take over in Boston in 2003 at the height of the clergy sexual abuse scandal that had exploded there following an investigation by the Boston Globe newspaper. Revelations of years of abuse and coverups by the church led to the downfall of then-archbishop Cardinal Bernard Law, who resigned in disgrace in December 2002.

O'Malley and Henning (Cardinal Seán O'Malley (LEFT), Reverend Richard G. Henning (RIGHT))

At age 80, O’Malley is five years beyond the normal retirement age for bishops. His 59-year-old successor, Henning, from Rockville Centre, Long Island, has been bishop of Providence since last year.

Francis has long expressed his esteem for O’Malley and selected him as a founding member of his core cardinal advisers, known as the C9.

In that role, O’Malley advised Francis not only on child protection issues but also helped design the reform of the Vatican bureaucracy.

Born in Ohio and ordained as a priest of the Order of Friars of Minor Capuchin in 1970, O’Malley came to Massachusetts in 1992 to serve as the bishop of Fall River, a diocese that had been rocked by a sexual abuse scandal involving a priest convicted of molesting children. O’Malley was tasked with settling abuse claims.

The experience proved useful in 2003, when, after spending time as Bishop of the Diocese of Palm Beach in Florida, he was appointed by Pope John Paul II as archbishop of Boston. Once again, he took over a district shaken by sexual abuse — this time a much higher-profile crisis involving dozens of priests.

But David Clohessy, former national director of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, criticized O’Malley for “a masterful job with his public relations but a terribly disappointing job with the church’s ongoing abuse and cover-up scandal.”

“He’s carefully crafted the impression of a ‘reformer while refusing to take some of the most simple and proven steps toward warning parents, parishioners, and the public about potentially threatening clerics,” Clohessy said in a statement.

Henning likely will bring more of the same, said Mitchell Garabedian, an attorney who has been representing abuse victims for decades.

“Bishop Henning does not have a track record of protecting children through either strongly speaking out against clergy sexual abuse or supporting substantive change,” he said in a statement calling Henning “a company man.”

Pope Francis names new archbishop of Boston, replacing Cardinal Sean O’Malley

“Victims believe Bishop Henning will basically ignore the ugly problem of clergy sexual abuse and hope it just goes away,” he said.

O’Malley’s relations with Francis haven’t always been easy. In 2018, he issued a blistering statement rebuking Francis after the pope dismissed claims of abuse by Chilean survivors of the country’s most notorious abuser.

O’Malley’s harsh tone was something of a wake-up call for Francis, who eventually apologized after commissioning an investigation into the Chilean scandal.

More recently, O’Malley’s commission flagged “serious problems” in the way the Vatican had handled the case of an ex-Jesuit artist, the Rev. Marko Rupnik, prompting Francis to order the case reopened.

Henning expressed gratitude to Pope Francis for the new appointment and described O’Malley as a faithful servant who “has served the Church of Boston for many faithful and joyful years” during his tenure.

Pope Francis has named Providence Bishop Richard Henning as the next Archbishop of Boston. Henning will replace retiring Cardinal Sean O'Malley, according to the Archdiocese of Boston.

Cardinal O'Malley will introduce Archbishop-elect Henning at a news conference in Braintree at 10am today. Henning will officially be installed later this year on October 31, in a ceremony at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston.

O'Malley became Archbishop of Boston in 2003, after he succeeded Cardinal Bernard Law, who resigned amid the church sex abuse scandal.

O’Malley, who is now 80 years old, spoke up after Cardinal Theodore McCarrick was defrocked in 2019 after the Vatican found him guilty of sex abuse.

O’Malley also apologized in 2018 after saying that in 2015, a secretary never handed him a letter detailing allegations of misconduct against McCarrick. He released a statement at the time saying: ""I understand that not everyone will accept this answer given the way the Church has eroded the trust of our people. My hope is that we can repair the trust and faith of all Catholics.""

Bishop Richard Henning, 59, grew up in New York and has been a bishop since 2018.

Henning spoke with reporters Monday morning alongside the archbishop he has been chosen to replace, Cardinal Sean O’Malley, who is now 80 years old and retiring from active ministry, according to church officials. Henning was chosen by Pope Francis to succeed O’Malley, a close ally of the pontiff.

BRAINTREE — Archbishop-elect Richard G. Henning of Providence, selected to be the future leader of the Boston Archdiocese, promised first to be a listener in his new role in Boston.

Henning was named bishop of the Providence Diocese in May 2023 and said he has been warmly welcomed by Rhode Island Catholics during his short tenure. He said he was so surprised at being chosen to succeed O’Malley that it took him three minutes to absorb the news.

Then, he said, he thought about the people in Rhode Island. “They have been so good to me for a year and I’d like to say that I think I’ve kind of, I dove deep into the pool. I just gave myself over to them in every way I knew how, and their response was so moving to me that that was the hardest part of it for me.”

Henning’s appointment was formally announced by the Vatican Monday just after 6 a.m. Eastern Time.

During the press conference, Henning, echoing the teachings of the Catholic Church, described himself “pro-life.”

“I am pro-life because I believe that the Gospel teaches us the sacred dignity of every human life,” he said. “But I know there are people of goodwill who passionately disagree with that, and I think, as the Holy Father keeps reminding us, we have to kind of take the risk of dialogue. We have to try to listen and hear each other.”

Henning said he believes that “every woman should have a full choice. And one of those choices should be to bring your child to term knowing that she will be supported and assisted in that. So, I think there’s room to for us to talk to another, and to really reverence the beauty and sacred nature of human life.”

Earlier Monday, O’Malley and Henning celebrated a Mass in the Bethany Chapel at the archdiocese’s Pastoral Center in Braintree.

Henning will be formally installed as archbishop at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross, the mother church of the Archdiocese of Boston, in the South End on Oct. 31, the archdiocese said.

In a light-hearted moment, O’Malley and Henning joked about the timing of the installation, which falls on Halloween.

“I have my outfit,” Henning joked.

During the homily at Mass, O’Malley said a new head of the church in Boston represented “a moment of renewal, of joy, and of gratitude.”

“It will bring you many challenges, I promise you that, but it will also bring many, many joys,” he said to the archbishop-elect.

Henning began his comments at the press conference by expressing “shock” at the number of media members attending the press conference.

“It’s a bit of a shock to me to see all of you here, but I’m delighted that you’re here. And I understand that your your task is a very important one for the common good,” he said. “So I certainly will pray that the Lord will strengthen you in that work, that commitment to the truth and helping people understand one another and the world that we live in.”

O’Malley was named archbishop in 2003 and cardinal in 2006, and is a close ally of Pope Francis. O’Malley participated in the 2013 papal conclave that elected Francis and is an original member of the influential Council of Cardinals, formed by Francis soon after his election.

During the press conference, O’Malley called for a pathway for citizenship for arriving immigrants and described the system as “broken.”

“Our system is broken and that is what has caused this problem. And unfortunately, it’s causing so much anti-immigrant sentiment in a population which to me, is ridiculous,’’ O’Malley said. “There is no country in the world that has our capacity to assimilate people. Europe would love to have our problems. These children of our immigrants will be American and they will be identified with this country and will make extraordinary contributions.”

O’Malley noted that the Irish Famine in the 1840s killed 1 million people and triggered a mass migration to the US from Ireland. Soon after, one-third of Boston was Irish, he said.

“It must have seemed like an invasion and those people weren’t happy to see us. But I think we’ve made a contribution and become part of that community,” O’Malley said. “And I see many blessings in the presence of these immigrants here.. But we need a system that that deals with immigrants and does it in a way that is humane and fair, and avoids this chaos at the border.”

Henning was born in Rockville Centre, N.Y., in 1964. His father was a firefighter and his mother was a nurse, and both were watching the press conference remotely, Henning said. He is fluent in Spanish and Italian and working on learning Portuguese.

According to his official biography, Henning grew up in Valley Stream, a village in Long Island. One of five children, he “spent a good deal of time on a small island in the Great South Bay where his family has gone for generations. There, he developed a lifelong passion for the water, sailing, boating, and kayaking on the bay.”

Before Providence, Henning served as auxiliary bishop for the Diocese of Rockville Centre, N.Y., from 2018 to 2022. He was then a coadjutor bishop alongside Bishop Thomas Tobin in Providence until Tobin’s retirement in 2023.

The Rockville Centre diocese, which covers most of Long Island, filed for bankruptcy in 2020 after hundreds of sexual abuse cases were filed against it under New York’s Child Victims Act, which allowed survivors time to file claims despite the statute of limitations. In May, the case was sent to mediation after the majority of survivors rejected a proposed $200 million settlement and the archdiocese sought to dismiss its own bankruptcy.

Henning on Monday defended the decision for the Rockville diocese to file for bankruptcy. “I agree with it, it was really the only decision that would have allowed the diocese to meet the obligations to survivors as well as continue the mission of the church,” he said, adding that he had a limited role in the controversial action.

Henning was asked how he would reach out to Catholics who left the church in response to the abuse scandal.

“I will listen to their pain and their woundedness,’’ he said. “I certainly lived through that as well. When these crimes and sins were committed, I was also a child. I am grateful to God that was not affected but this personal. But people in my generation were. They deserve a listening heart.”

Handling of sexual abuse was a central occupation of O’Malley’s tenure, said Massimo Faggioli, a professor at Villanova University’s department of theology and religious studies.

“He was called to clean up the mess left by Cardinal Law and also to clean up the mess created by the Vatican itself in dealing with Cardinal Law,” Faggioli said. “In the US, he was appointed to give a credible face to the fight against the abuses, and in that he has succeeded.”

But O’Malley’s efforts in the Vatican as president of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors have been less successful, Faggioli said.

Some critics think O’Malley didn’t do enough in terms of accountability, even in his own archdiocese. For example, he was criticized by some abuse victims and their advocates for omitting some names from a list of credibly accused priests in Boston, which the archdiocese released in 2011.

At a press conference held on Zoom, Boston attorney Mitchell Garabedian, who said he has has represented “thousands” of victims of clergy sex abuse from the archdiocese for more than 20 years and now represents 24 Rockville victims, called Henning’s selection yet another effort to coverup the church’s role in the scandal.

“Bishop Henning is a company man,’’ said Garabedian. “He has not been a strong voice for victims of clergy sex abuse by any means. He has not been a person who’s practiced transparency concerning clergy sexual abuse, and he has not done any substantive work that would help protect children and help clergy sexual abuse survivors to heal.”

Garabedian has been a frequent critic of O’Malley during the years the retiring cardinal played a major role in the church’s response to the abuse scandal. He continued to fault O’Malley Monday, saying the cardinal has not been as transparent with the public as the scandal requires.

Joining Garabedian was Robert Hoatson, a former Roman Catholic priest who founded a recovery center for clergy sex abuse victims. Hoatson noted that during his press conference Henning kept saying “God will provide, don’t worry about it.” He criticized the choice of Henning as “the same old, same old” by an institution focused on hiding their mistakes, not helping the victims of crimes.

“We must continue to fight this tendency on the on the part of the church to keep smiling and saying it’s God’s will or God will take care of it, because God hasn’t and God will not,” Hoatson said. “We are the ones, human beings, are the ones responsible for what happened to these children. It’s the church that owes these children compensation therapy and any other resources they need to heal.”

In Providence, Henning replaced a bishop, Tobin, who was known for his outspoken opposition to gay marriage and abortion rights. Tobin criticized Pope Francis in 2020 for his support for same-sex civil unions.

In contrast, Henning said in his 2022 interview that his beliefs align “entirely” with the pope’s. (Francis has maintained Catholic doctrine against

The Vatican announcement didn’t mention O’Malley’s other main role as the pope's main adviser on fighting clergy sexual abuse as head of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, suggesting he would remain in that capacity until a new commission leader is named.

St. John Paul II had tapped O’Malley to take over in Boston in 2003 at the height of the clergy sexual abuse scandal that had exploded there following an investigation by The Boston Globe newspaper. Revelations of years of abuse and coverups by the church led to the downfall of then-archbishop Cardinal Bernard Law, who resigned in disgrace in December 2002.

“When I arrived it was a time of great crisis and of great pain because of the terrible scourge of sexual abuse,” O’Malley said at a news conference as he reflected on all changes the church has seen during his 40 years as a bishop. “But despite all the challenges we’ve had I’m full of hope.”

At age 80, O’Malley is five years beyond the normal retirement age for bishops. His 59-year-old successor, Henning, from Rockville Centre, Long Island, has been bishop of Providence since last year.

In terms of clergy abuse, the torch in Boston is being passed from a man whose contemporaries were the accused to one whose peers were the victims.

“When these crimes and sins were committed, I was also a child. I’m grateful to God that I was not affected by it personally, but people in my generation were,"" Henning said at the news conference. ""Those survivors, they deserve a listening heart. In some ways they have as much to proclaim to us about the gospel as we do to them.”

O'Malley called the arrival of a new archbishop “a time of renewal and hope” and described Henning as “someone who transmits hope to restless hearts.”

The Archdiocese of Boston is the fourth largest archdiocese in the U.S., serving more than 1.8 million Roman Catholics. It had operating expenses of more than $350 million in fiscal 2023, and its schools serve more than 46,000 students.

O'Malley will be remembered for his advocacy and support for families experiencing homelessness and victims of human trafficking, as well as his leadership in the fight against climate change, Gov. Maura Healey said in a statement. “I greatly admire his deep faith and his empathy and compassion for all,"" Healey said.

Henning said he was “deeply shocked and surprised” that he was chosen.

“I am very well aware that I have a lot to learn,” Henning said. “My first job, really, is just to be listener.”

Francis has long expressed his esteem for O'Malley and selected him as a founding member of his core cardinal advisers, known as the C9. O’Malley advised Francis not only on child protection issues, but also helped design the reform of the Vatican bureaucracy.

O’Malley’s relations with Francis haven’t always been easy. In 2018, he issued a blistering rebuke after the pope dismissed claims by survivors of Chile's most notorious abuser. O’Malley’s harsh tone was a wakeup call for Francis, who eventually apologized after commissioning an investigation into the Chilean scandal.

More recently, O’Malley’s commission flagged “serious problems” in the Vatican's handling of allegations against an ex-Jesuit artist, the Rev. Marko Rupnik, prompting Francis to order the case reopened.

Born in Ohio and ordained as a priest of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin in 1970, O’Malley came to Massachusetts in 1992 to serve as the bishop of Fall River, a diocese scandalized by a priest convicted of molesting children. O’Malley was tasked with settling abuse claims.

The experience proved useful in 2003, when, after spending time as Bishop of the Diocese of Palm Beach in Florida, he was appointed by Pope John Paul II as archbishop of Boston. Once again, he took over a district shaken by sexual abuse — this time a much higher-profile crisis involving dozens of priests.

David Clohessy, former national director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, criticized O’Malley for “a masterful job with his public relations but a terribly disappointing job with the church’s on-going abuse and cover up scandal.”

“He’s carefully crafted the impression of a ’reformer, while refusing to take some of the most simple and proven steps toward warning parents, parishioners and the public about potentially threatening clerics,” Clohessy said in a statement.

Henning likely will bring more of the same, said Mitchell Garabedian, an attorney who has represented abuse victims for decades.

“Bishop Henning has not been a strong voice for victims of clergy abuse by any means. He has not been a person who practices transparency concerning clergy sexual abuse. And he has not done any substantive work that would help protect children and help clergy sex abuse survivors to heal,” he said.

Robert Hoatson, co-founder of Road to Recovery, which helps survivors of clergy abuse, described Henning as the “same old, same old” type of bishop who talks about the infallibility of God instead of accountability for perpetrators.

“Guess what, Bishop Henning? No one has ever seen God. But victims have seen bishops running away and covering up. Victims see bishops not taking care of them,” said Hoatson, a clergy abuse survivor himself, as well as a former priest.

But O'Malley was praised by others, including Jennifer Wortham, a research associate at the Human Flourishing Program at Harvard University. Wortham, whose brothers were abused by a priest as children, said she met Pope Francis in 2016 and O'Malley in 2018 and found their concern to be genuine.

""As a sister of survivors of clergy abuse, it was very encouraging for me to hear and to know that the church was so committed to trying to help those that had been harmed with these tragic incidents,” she said.

In 2021, Wortham led a global symposium called “Faith and Flourishing: Strategies for Preventing and Healing Child Sexual Abuse"" that was sponsored by the commission O'Malley leads. She said the Roman Catholic Church’s early response was so focused on prevention that leaders failed to focus enough on the victims’ suffering and on their well being.

“One of the challenges the church grappled with is just not really understanding the extent of damage that’s done to victims and families,” she said.

In a brief interview, Henning said he plans to continue what he considers O'Malley's successful work.

“Obviously, I have work to do in terms of getting to know survivors here in the archdiocese and understanding the current environment,” Henning said. “I do know already that the archdiocese commits itself pretty passionately to the protection of young people in care. I consider that a lifelong passion of my own, so I look forward to understanding and continuing that legacy.""

Kevin Mochen, a parishioner who attended mass at Bethany Chapel in Braintree on Monday, said he expects O’Malley to continue working on behalf of abuse victims. He credited O’Malley with taking over a troubled archdiocese and getting it back on course.

“O’Malley came in and kind of put the diocese back on an even keel. And so that’s his legacy I would think,” Mochen said.

After more than twenty years leading the fourth largest archdiocese in the country, Cardinal Seán Patrick O’Malley could be leaving his current role as the Archbishop of Boston, according to some reports.

A source within the archdiocese told Boston.com that a press conference will be held Monday at 10 a.m. to announce a change in leadership but did not comment on any rumors circulating about O’Malley’s status.

Rocco Palmo, a Catholic writer, initially said on X Sunday afternoon that Pope Francis will name Providence Bishop Richard Henning as the new archbishop. The Boston Globe and NBC News confirmed the news with anonymous sources. Palmo called the pick a “shock.”

Henning, 59, became the leader of the Providence diocese in May of last year. He previously served in New York and is fluent in Spanish and Italian and is literate in French, Greek, and Hebrew, according to an online bio from the diocese.

O’Malley was appointed as archbishop in 2003 and, at 80, has already led Greater Boston’s Roman Catholic community for longer than expected. (Catholic bishops are asked to retire at age 75, and 80 is also the age when bishops are no longer eligible to vote for a new pope.)

Previously, he served in Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and then in Fall River starting in 1992 amid sexual abuse scandals involving Rev. James Porter. In 2002, the Globe reported that O’Malley pioneered new policies on clergy sexual abuse and settled more than 101 cases against Porter.

O’Malley played a similar role in Boston in 2003, where a similar, wide-spread scandal “victimized hundreds, eroded church attendance, and has led the church in Boston to the brink of bankruptcy,” the Globe reported at the time. He replaced Cardinal Bernard F. Law, who resigned when it was exposed that he covered up the sexual abuse of children.

Earlier this year, O’Malley, ordained in the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, reflected in the Globe on his decades at the helm of the Archdiocese of Boston and said he’d depart “soon.”

Eric MacLeish, a attorney who represented hundreds of clergy abuse victims, told the Globe in the same story that O’Malley was compassionate, met with all of his clients, and “did the right thing.”

The only thing missing for Harrisburg is the venue.,https://apnews.com/article/harris-democrats-2024-election-1bc413ccbce977b2a4f71242410fee2c,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The dates are set. The venues are chosen. The only thing missing from this week’s campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of the running mate.

After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris must decide on her wingman before the two set off Tuesday on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the stakes of the election.

Everything about her campaign has been rapid-fire out of necessity. She’s only been a candidate for a little over two weeks, since President Joe Biden bowed out of the race following a dismal debate performance and escalating calls within the Democratic party for him to step aside. The Democratic National Committee chair said Friday that Harris had already secured enough votes to become the party’s nominee and will accept the nomination Monday night when voting ends.

And about 8 in 10 Democrats say they would be somewhat or very satisfied if Harris became the Democratic nominee for president, according to a survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, which was conducted after Biden withdrew from the race.

Harris has had to do condensed vetting of her potential running mates as the party’s convention draws near. That means there’s not much time left for advocates for and against different picks get in their final licks.

Harris was zeroing in on three running mate contenders, whom she interviewed Sunday in Washington. They were Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, according to a person familiar with the process who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the negotiations. Three other men have been in the mix: Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.

Walz is in his second term as governor of Minnesota. He has made his state a bastion of liberal policy and, this year, one of the few states to protect fans buying tickets online for Taylor Swift concerts and other live events. He comes from rural America and in his first race for Congress, Walz upset a Republican incumbent.

Walz spoke before an energetic crowd at a fundraiser Monday evening in downtown Minneapolis, but didn’t drop any hints about his status on Harris’ shortlist. But the governor spoke of a “politics of joy” that he hopes to spread on the campaign trail on behalf of Harris.

What to know about the 2024 Election

“We’ve got to run this campaign against the serious threat that’s there, but we have to do it every single day with a sense of joy,” he said.

Walz also criticized Donald Trump and Republicans who wanted to regulate what books children read and undermine abortion rights.

The Minnesota Democratic Party, meanwhile, posted a booster for Walz online. “IMPORTANT PSA: There’s no ‘T’ sound in ‘Walz’ (But there is one in ‘Vice President Walz’),” the group wrote with a winking smiley face emoji.

Some congressional Democrats have promoted Kelly, a former Navy pilot and astronaut whose state has more than 370 miles or 600 kilometers of border with Mexico. They say his selection could help defuse Trump’s arguments that the Biden-Harris administration’s immigration policies are too relaxed.

Shapiro has prominent supporters, too, like Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker. She caused a stir by posting a video Friday depicting several Philadelphia-area officials and Democrats promoting Harris, but also playing up Shapiro as her running mate. A person familiar with the mayor’s thinking said she had no insider knowledge about Harris’ intentions.

When asked about the veepstakes Monday, Shapiro said he had no information.

“I got nothing for you, man,” he told an Associated Press reporter as he arrived at the Pennsylvania state capitol in Harrisburg. “Have a great day.”

Both Kelly and Shapiro have seen their detractors become more vocal as Harris closes in on a decision.

Some labor groups have criticized Kelly, saying he opposes proposed legislation they argue would boost union organizing. The senator’s office counters that while he did not co-sponsor the proposed legislation, he has said he would vote for it.

The nonprofit Institute for Middle East Understanding has been vocal about Shapiro, saying in a statement last week that he was not the right candidate for the job.

Shapiro has aggressively confronted what he views as antisemitism cropping up from pro-Palestinian demonstrations and he has professed solidarity with Israel in its drive to eliminate Hamas as it Israel battles the militants in Gaza. But he’s also criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, while suggesting that any end to the Israel-Hamas war requires the removal of Hamas from power.

Harris and her running mate — whoever that is — will launch Tuesday into an aggressive battleground state tour that begins in Philadelphia on Tuesday and winds later in the week through Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. A scheduled stop in Savannah, Georgia, was canceled due to the expected effects of Hurricane Debby.

Campaign officials are aware that momentum can be fleeting and are working to capitalize on the energy now, while managing expectations by continuing to emphasize that the race with Republican nominee Donald Trump is tight. But the strong rollout has allowed the Harris campaign to put a number of states back in play that had been feared out of reach when Biden remained at the top of the ticket.

Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, was heading out on almost exactly the same campaign schedule as Harris: Philadelphia on Tuesday, Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and Detroit on Wednesday and Raleigh, North Carolina, on Thursday.

He told Fox News on Sunday that Harris’ pick doesn’t matter to him. “Whoever she chooses, the problem is going to be Kamala Harris’ record and Kamala Harris’ policies,” he said, adding, “It’s not going to be good for the country.”

Harris’ early rallies have attracted enthusiastic thousands. Campaign officials say each stop will be loaded with local election officials, religious leaders, union members and more in an effort to show the diversity of her coalition. Some Republicans will also appear with her, according to the campaign.

The campaign this week launched “Republicans for Harris.” The program will be a “campaign within a campaign,” according to Harris’ team, using well-known Republicans to activate their networks, with a particular emphasis on primary voters who backed former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley.

The US officials, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said one of the wounded Americans was seriously injured. The casualty count was based on initial reports which could still change, they said.

""Base personnel are conducting a post-attack damage assessment,"" one of the officials added.

Last week the US carried out a strike in Iraq against individuals US officials said were militants getting ready to launch drones and posed a threat to US and coalition forces.

The US has been watching to see if Iran would make good on its vow to respond to the killing of Haniyeh two days ago in Tehran, one in a series of killings of senior figures in the Palestinian militant group as the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza rages.

The Pentagon has said it will deploy additional fighter jets and Navy warships to the Middle East, as Washington seeks to bolster defenses following threats from Iran and its allies Hamas and Hezbollah.

A rare ally of both the US and Iran, Iraq hosts 2,500 US troops and has Iran-backed militias linked to its security forces. It has witnessed escalating tit-for-tat attacks since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in October.

Iraq wants troops from the US-led military coalition to begin withdrawing in September and to formally end the coalition's work by September 2025, Iraqi sources have said, with some US forces likely to remain in a newly negotiated advisory capacity.

Baghdad has struggled to reign in Iran-backed armed groups that have attacked US forces there and in neighboring Syria dozens of time since October 7.

Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani spoke with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken on Sunday.

An Iraqi official said Blinken asked Sudani to help decrease regional tensions by helping to convince Iran to temper its response to an Israeli strike in Tehran that killed the leader of Hamas last week.

Three US officials confirmed several personnel injuries were caused by the rockets.

This report comes amid rising tensions in the Middle East, as several sources believe that Iran may attack Israel as early as Monday in retaliation to recent assassinations widely attributed to Israel.

US forces have previously been targeted in the region, including three US service members killed and at least 25 wounded in a drone attack on an output in Jordan near the Syrian border in January.

Two Katyusha rockets were fired at al Asad airbase in western Iraq, two Iraqi security sources said. One Iraqi security source said the rockets fell inside the base. It was unclear whether the attack was linked to threats by Iran to retaliate over the killings.

Biden, 81, said he discussed “developments in the Middle East” with his national security team, according to a post on his X account which did not acknowledge the latest attack on US troops in the region.

“We received updates on threats posed by Iran and its proxies, diplomatic efforts to de-escalate regional tensions, and preparations to support Israel should it be attacked again,” the president said.

“We also discussed the steps we are taking to defend our forces and respond to any attack against our personnel in a manner and place of our choosing,” he added.

US officials said “several” Americans were wounded in the attack against Al Asad airbase in western Iraq, Reuters reported.

“Base personnel are conducting a post-attack damage assessment,” one US official told the outlet.

At least one of the two Katyusha rockets fired at US forces fell inside the airbase, according to the report.

The attack comes as the US and Israel brace for retaliation from Iran and its proxies over the deaths of two top Hamas and Hezbollah officials last week.

Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was reportedly assassinated when a covertly placed bomb detonated inside his Tehran guesthouse, while Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr, who is believed to have ordered the rocket attack on a soccer field in the Israel-controlled Golan Heights that killed 12 children last month, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in the Lebanese capital of Beirut.

The US has denied any involvement in the deaths of the terrorist groups’ leaders. Iran has blamed Israel for the attacks and has vowed to take revenge.

It’s unclear whether Iran or one of its many proxies were behind Monday’s attack.

On Friday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered more US troops, ships, fighter jets and “land-based ballistic missile defense” systems to the Middle East to counter potential retaliatory strikes from Iran.

The “posture adjustments” were made “to improve US force protection, to increase support for the defense of Israel, and to ensure the United States is prepared to respond to various contingencies,” according to the Pentagon.

The Israel Defense Forces have been on “high alert” since last week over fears of an attack from Iran.

Last week, the US conducted its first airstrike against Iranian-backed militia groups in Iraq since February, hitting a base south of Baghdad used by Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces – killing four PMF members.

US officials described the airstrike as defensive and aimed at militants preparing to launch an attack.

The Institute for the Study of War notes that PMP – a formal Iraqi security force – has been “infiltrated” by Iran and is used to “wield significant influence in Iraq.”

Since last October, in response to US support for Israel’s war against Hamas, Iran-backed militia groups have launched more than 170 attacks on US military personnel in Iraq, Syria and Jordan, wounding dozens of US troops.

Three US soldiers were killed in one such attack on a US outpost in Jordan in January, which prompted a series of retaliatory US airstrikes."

Officials have not released the exact number of injuries. A source told Reuters that the rockets fell inside the base.

The incident comes as tensions in the Middle East escalate amid the Israel-Hamas war. Last week, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran, causing the Iranian government to vow retribution against Israel.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has not claimed responsibility for the death of Haniyeh, but Iran reported plans to launch attacks against Israel soon.

""They will see the result of their mistake,"" Iranian General Hossein Salami said after the death of Haniyeh. ""They will see when, how and where they will get their response.""

Two Katsuyasha rockets were fired at Iraq’s Ain al-Asad air base on Monday, which hosts U.S. and other international forces in western Iraq, according to multiple security sources.

Three U.S. officials confirmed that multiple people were left with injuries caused by the rockets.

“Initial indications are that several U.S. personnel were injured,” the spokesperson said. “Base personnel are conducting a post-attack damage assessment. We will provide updates as more information becomes available.”

Iranian proxy terror groups operating in Iraq and Syria attack U.S. troops more during times of increased tension.

The latest attack comes amid rising tensions in the Middle East, as several sources believe that Iran will attack Israel as early as Monday in retaliation to recent assassinations against Hamas leaders attributed to Israel.

U.S. forces have been previously targeted in the region, which included three U.S. service members being killed and over 25 wounded in a drone attack on an output in Jordan near the Syrian border in January.

President Joe Biden was scheduled to meet with his national security team on Monday, looking to ease tensions between Israel and Iran.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke to the G7 yesterday, stating that an attack in response to Israel’s killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and Fuad Shukr in Beirut was imminent, Axios reported.

This would mark the second time during the escalating crisis that Iran has directly attacked Israel, the first being in April when it sent an onslaught of missiles and drones in the middle of the night.

The head of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, General Hossein Salami, also threatened Israel, stating that the Jewish state is ‘digging its own grave’ by carrying on its war against the terrorist group Hamas.

Meanwhile, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel is already in a “multi-front war” with Iran, adding during a Cabinet meeting on Sunday that his country is prepared for any scenario.

In late July, multiple rockets were launched at Ain al-Asad airbase. No damage or casualties were reported. Two US officials said the base itself had not been struck in the attack.

The Ain al-Asad base had come under attack by two armed drones the previous week as well, but that attack was the first one against US forces in Iraq since early February, when Iranian-backed groups in Iraq announced they would stop their attacks against US troops.

That announcement came two days after a drone attack in Jordan killed three US service members and wounded dozens of others."

Reuters initially reported that two Katyusha rockets were fired at the Ain al-Asad air base. It later reported the injury of at least five American soldiers, saying the condition of one of the wounded was not good.

Some other American media outlets, however, cited a Pentagon spokesperson as saying that a number of American soldiers stationed in the base were injured.

“Initial indications are that several US personnel were injured,” the spokesperson said, adding that the full extent of the injuries and the exact number of affected personnel remain unclear at this time.

Some media outlets of the Zionist regime are reporting the death of 2 American soldiers in the attack.

Lebanon’s Al-Mayadeen network, quoting sources, reported that three explosions caused by a rocket and drone attack were heard at the Ain al-Assad base.

A White House official also confirmed that President Joe Biden was briefed on the incident. No group in Iraq or elsewhere in the region had taken responsibility for the attack so far.

Few hours later, on Tuesday morning, news sources announced another attack on Ain al-Asad but gave no details about new possible casualties or damage.

According to reports, the base was targeted again at the time a military plane was flying to transport wounded soldiers from there.

About 10 days ago, security sources reported that four rockets landed at the same base amid growing anti-American sentiment in the region over Washington’s policies, including its support for the ongoing Israeli genocide of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.

The base in the west of the country was targeted by two Soviet-made Katyusha rockets amid soaring tensions in the Middle East - with Iran threatening to strike Israel as early as tonight.

The rocket fire is the latest in a series of attacks targeting the base in western Iraq, which hosts American troops as well as personnel from the US-led coalition against the Islamic State jihadist group.

Israel has been braced for an Iranian assault on five fronts ‘at any moment’ in revenge following the assassination Wednesday of Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, in Tehran a day after an Israeli strike in Beirut killed Fuad Shukr, a senior military commander from the Lebanese group Hezbollah.

The White House Press Office and Joe Biden's own social media accounts said that the president and Kamala Harris have been briefed by national security advisors on the attack.

'They discussed the steps we are taking to defend our forces and respond to any attack against our personnel in a manner and place of our choosing,' a spokesperson said.

The base in the west of the country was targeted by two Soviet-made Katyusha rockets amid soaring tensions in the Middle East - with Iran threatening to strike Israel as early as tonight

The Department of Defense also confirmed the severity of the attack.

'There was a suspected rocket attack today against US and coalition forces' at the base, a US defense spokesperson said. 'Initial indications are that several US personnel were injured.'

'Base personnel are conducting a post-attack damage assessment' and updates will be provided as more information becomes available, the spokesperson added.

An Iraqi military source had earlier said that multiple rockets were fired at base, with some landing inside it and another hitting nearby village but not causing damage.

A commander in a pro-Iran armed group told AFP that at least two rockets targeted the base, without saying who had carried out the attack.

Another source in the group and a security source confirmed an attack occurred.

Such attacks were frequent early in the war between Israel and Hamas Palestinian militants in Gaza but since then have largely halted.

The latest rocket fire comes as fears grow of an attack by Iran and its allies on Israel in retaliation for the killing of top Hamas and Hezbollah figures in strikes last weeks either blamed on or claimed by Israel.

The White House Press Office said that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have been briefed by national security advisors on the attack

It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack, however Iran's proxy forces in Iraq and Syria frequently attack US bases at times of heightened tension.

Joe Biden was already scheduled to meet with his national security team in the Situation Room today as the lame-duck president seeks to soothe blistering tensions between Israel and Iran after the Jewish state assassinated Hamas leaders in Tehran and Beirut, Lebanon, last week.

The Islamic Republic could attack Israel in the next 24 to 48 hours following a major attack by Hezbollah that left two IDF soldiers injured, top western diplomats have warned.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the G7 yesterday that an attack in response to Israel's killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut was imminent, Axios reported.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III reportedly spoke to his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant on Sunday to assure the Jewish state of U.S. support.

It would mark the second time during the growing crisis in the Middle East that Iran has directly attacked Israel, the first being in April when it sent a salvo of missiles and drones overnight.

Iran has clearly signaled that it intends to attack its foe, claiming it has the 'legal right' to respond to Haniyeh's assassination. Foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanani told a news conference: 'No one has the right to doubt Iran's legal right to punish the Zionist regime.'

The head of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, General Hossein Salami, also threatened Israel, warning that the state was 'digging its own grave' by carrying on its war against the terror group Hamas.

Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his nation is already in a 'multi-front war' with Iran

'They will see the result of their mistake. They will see when, how and where they will get their response,' Salami said during a speech.

The threat from Iran comes just hours after Hezbollah, backed by the Iranian regime, launched a silo of 30 missiles from Lebanon towards upper Galilee.

The escalating tensions between Israel, Hezbollah and Iran have led to growing fears of an all-out war breaking out in the Middle East between Israel and Tehran's proxies.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his nation is already in a 'multi-front war' with Iran, adding during a Cabinet meeting on Sunday that Israel is prepared for any scenario.

Netanyahu has also been accused of not being 'sincerely interested in a ceasefire', as Hamas' Haniyeh was the terror group's lead ceasefire negotiator.

The U.S. said on the G7 call on Sunday that its choice to increase its military capability in the region was to bolster defense.

Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas in retaliation for its unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.

The Al-Asad Airbase is an Iraqi airbase located in western Iraq. It was the second-largest US military airbase in Iraq during the Iraq war.

The missile attack comes amid rising tensions in the Middle East. It's feared Iran will launch an attack on Israel imminently, sparking an all-out war in the region.

Iran vowed ""severe"" retaliation for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last Wednesday. His death, which Iran blames Israel for, came just hours after Israel killed Hezbollah senior commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut. Hossein Salami, leader of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), said on Monday that Israel was “digging its own grave”.

“They will see the result of their mistake. They will see when, how and where they will get their response,” he warned. Joe Biden met with his national security team on Monday to discuss “developments in the Middle East”, according to the White House.

It comes after Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the G7 on Sunday that Iran could attack Israel in 24 to 48 hours. On Monday, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said it launched a drone attack on northern Israel that the Israeli military said wounded two Israeli troops.

The Iranian-backed Hezbollah said it targeted a military base in northern Israel in response to “attacks and assassinations” by Israel in several villages in southern Lebanon. The attack did not appear to be the more intense retaliation that’s expected from Iran and its allied militias."

It is unclear who officials believe carried out the attack, but Iranian proxies in the Middle East are known to target US controlled areas when tensions reach boiling point.

In April, another US military base in Syria was struck by rockets in a Iraqi drone strike.

Earlier this week, the US deployed a fleet of warships and fighter jets to the Middle East amid fears of an attack from Iran in response to recent Israeli blasts.

Officials in America, Israel's most powerful ally, expect a retaliatory April 13th-style attack from Iran which could hit in the next few days.

President Joe Biden reportedly held a crisis meeting with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday to discuss the Middle East melting pot.

Biden assured Netanyahu that US military deployments would be sent out to help Israel defend itself against the looming threats.

A recent spate of targeted high-profile assassinations by Israel, killing two senior Hamas leaders and a Hezbollah commander, has led to serious WW3 fears.

Israel ready to ‘cut the head off the snake’ as Iran hours away from revenge strikeIran

On April 1 Iran's Syrian embassy in the capital Damascus was destroyed in a suspected Israeli strike - killing several top brass IRGC commanders.

Iran and its proxy groups Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis have all made threats to seek revenge for the deaths of their allies and leaders in the past week.

And as boiling tensions in the region flare, Tehran’s nuclear capabilities remain a “serious” concern for the future of the Middle East.

An expert in the war-torn region told The Sun that Israel is gearing up to finally defeat arch enemy Iran - with a brutal attack possibly happening within hours.

Tel Aviv is preparing to ""cut the head off the snake"" of Tehran and its sprawling proxy network as they plan an imminent coordinated strike that could spark all-out war, she warned.

It comes as several countries including Britain and the US have told their citizens in Lebanon to leave the country immediately.

Over the weekend up to 30 Hezbollah rockets were obliterated by Israel's incredible $1billion Iron Dome air defence system.

Dramatic footage showed the one-of-a-kind air defence beast kicking into action and shooting down missiles over Galilee.

Rising tensions in the Middle East By Ellie Doughty, Foreign News Reporter TENSIONS in the Middle East have long been a fluctuating and dangerous area of global concern. Conflict between Israel and Palestine in the Gaza Strip, West Bank and on Israeli territory itself is nothing new. Iran and Israel have long been in conflict with each other too. But after a brutal terrorist attack by Hamas on Israeli soil in October last year, things entered a new phase. Israel hit back like never before, unleashing almost ten months of ground warfare and airstrikes on the decimated enclave in a bid to destroy Hamas and rescue its hostages. The Iran-backed terror group had killed some 1,200 Israeli people and kidnapped 250 more in the hideous October 7 massacre. The UN estimates that at least 39,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the fresh war there broke out. This figure includes data from the health ministry in Gaza which falls under Hamas domain and has sparked concerns from officials about accuracy. Now, after almost ten months of war in Gaza, tensions have appeared to enter an all new high after a series of deadly strikes and high-profile assassinations in late July and early August. On Saturday July 27, a rocket strike fired from southern Lebanon hit a football pitch in Golan Heights - a Druze village occupied by Israel - killing 12 young people including children. Israel and the US both said Hezbollah, the largest of Iran’s terror proxy groups, operating out of Lebanon, were responsible for the deadly strike. On Monday July 28, the IDF dropped an airstrike on an area of Beirut, Lebanon’s capital, killing Hezbollah’s most senior military commander Fuad Shukr. Less than two days later, at around 2am on Wednesday July 30, Israel killed Hamas’ top political leader Ismail Haniyeh as he slept in Iran’s capital Tehran. Israel has yet to explicitly claim responsibility for the hit, but after vowing to take out all of Hamas last year, they are widely believed to be behind it. US officials have also said they suspect Israel of being behind the assassination. On the morning of Thursday August 1 morning the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) announced that a strike on Khan Younis, southern Gaza, had killed Mohammed Deif on July 13. Dief had worked as head of Hamas' ruthless military wing, the al-Qassam brigades, since 2002. It marked another major loss for Iran’s terror proxy groups in the region. Early reports this week suggested Ismail Haniyeh was taken out in a precision strike, when a rocket was fired from a drone outside his window and detonated inside the room. Then an investigation by the New York Times suggested a bomb had been planted in his room at the military-run compound where he was staying and detonated remotely. Unnamed Iranian officials also shared the explosive theory with The Telegraph, further confusing the murky details around Haniyeh’s death. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), concluded its investigation into the humiliating security breach on Saturday August 1 and said he died after a “short-range projectile” was fired from outside the building. A statement shared on Iranian state TV said a 7kg rocket warhead was used in the attack. Iran and its proxy groups; Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen all vowed to seek revenge on Israel over the assassination of Haniyeh. Then, on the night of Saturday August 3, Hezbollah fired some 30 rockets from Lebanon towards Galilee in northern Israel. Tel Aviv’s impressive Iron Dome Defence system launched into action, destroying “most” of the missiles and no one was hurt. But the UK, US and France have all urged their citizens to evacuate from Lebanon as fears of a wider war breaking out in the region continue to spiral.

"Rockets fired at Iraq's Ain al-Asad air base, which houses US forces.",https://legalinsurrection.com/2024/08/several-injured-in-rocket-attack-on-iraq-base-housing-u-s-personnel/,"U.S. defense officials said a rocket attack on Ain al-Asad air base in Iraq injured several personnel.

From Reuters:

At least five U.S. personnel were injured in an attack against a military base in Iraq on Monday, U.S. officials told Reuters, as the Middle East braced for a possible new wave of attacks by Iran and its allies following last week’s killing of senior members of militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah. Two Katyusha rockets were fired at al Asad airbase in western Iraq, two Iraqi security sources said. One Iraqi security source said the rockets fell inside the base. It was unclear whether the attack was linked to threats by Iran to retaliate over the killings.

The report could still change.

“Base personnel are conducting a post-attack damage assessment,” said an official. “We will provide updates as more information becomes available.”

One American is seriously injured.

No group took responsibility. Iranian-backed Iraqi militias have attacked “bases housing U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria after a lull of several months, following a strike on a base in Jordan in late January that killed three American soldiers and prompted a series of retaliatory U.S. strikes.”

Tensions have risen in the Middle East, with Iran threatening to attack Israel soon.

Due to the threats, the U.S. has sent more fighter jets and Navy warships to the Middle East.

Iraq has 2,500 U.S. troops.

RFK Jr. says he left a dead bear in Central Park as a joke.,https://apnews.com/article/robert-kennedy-rfk-bear-cub-central-park-f7e6cba9aa19dc2066a8d9c543974a97,"WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. once retrieved a bear that was killed by a motorist and left it in New York’s Central Park with a bicycle on top, sparking a mystery that consumed the city a decade ago.

Kennedy described the 2014 incident in a video that was posted to social media Sunday, adding it would be included in a New Yorker article that he expected to be damaging.

The article was published Monday and included a photo of Kennedy with his fingers in the bear’s bloodied mouth, a mock grimace on his face. His left pant leg appears to have a bloodstain on it.

It’s the latest bizarre incident in Kennedy’s quixotic campaign that has divided his famous family and left Republicans and Democrats alike concerned about his potential impact on the presidential contest. Kennedy has acknowledged a parasite that lodged in his brain and died. He denied eating a dog after a friend shared a photo with Vanity Fair magazine showing Kennedy dramatically preparing to take a bite of a charred animal; Kennedy said it was a goat.

In the video, Kennedy recounts the story to actress Roseanne Barr. He says he was heading to a falconry excursion with friends when a woman driving ahead of him hit and killed the young bear with her vehicle. He says he put it in his own vehicle, intending to skin it and eat the meat, but the day got away from him.

Eventually, he says, he was in Manhattan and needed to get the bear carcass out of his vehicle. His friends, fueled by alcohol, concocted the Central Park plan as a prank, he said, adding he was not drunk himself. At the time, bicycle accidents were getting significant media attention, so Kennedy and his friends thought it would be funny to make it look like the bear was hit by a bicycle.

Two women walking their dogs found the dead bear and alerted authorities, touching off a mystery that captivated the city for a few days. Bears are not among the park’s known wildlife population.

AP AUDIO: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says he left a dead bear in Central Park as a prank AP correspondent Julie Walker reports Robert F. Kennedy Jr. confesses to leaving a dead bear in Central Park years ago.

The bike was dusted for prints and the animal sent to Albany for a necropsy, which determined the bear was likely hit by a vehicle and was not a victim of animal cruelty. But how the bear ended up in Central Park remained a mystery.

“I was worried because my prints were all over that bike,” Kennedy tells Barr in the video.

Kennedy declined to speak to reporters Monday in Albany, New York, where he was attending a civil trial related to his efforts to get on the ballot in that state. A group trying to exclude him from New York’s ballot filed a lawsuit claiming Kennedy lied on nomination papers about where he lives.

New York’s Department of Environmental Conservation, which enforces laws regarding wildlife, said in a statement Monday that it closed its investigation after a forensic analysis concluded that the cub died from injuries consistent with a high-speed collision.

Possessing a bear without a tag or permit, or illegally disposing of a dead bear, are offenses punishable by fines of up to $250 in New York, but the department said charges cannot be brought for violations that occurred more than a year ago."
RFK Jr. says he left a dead bear in Central Park as a joke.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/08/05/rfk-jr-dead-bear-central-park-new-yorker/,"In fall 2014, a bizarre mystery gripped New York: The carcass of a 44-pound bear cub was discovered in Central Park next to an abandoned bicycle. The state’s Department of Environmental Conservation later determined that the bear had died after being hit by a car, but questions abounded. Who had killed the bear cub? How had the bear made its way to the most popular park in one of the world’s populous cities? And who on earth would have left a bicycle next to its carcass?

On Sunday night, independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. seemed to resolve many of those decade-old questions by revealing in a three-minute-long video posted to social media that he was the one who had left the dead bear in Central Park — as a practical joke.

As Kennedy told it, the bear had been run over earlier in the day by a vehicle ahead of Kennedy while he had been on a falconing trip in New York’s Hudson Valley, and he had collected the body to skin the bear.

“And it was in very good condition. I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator — and you can do that in New York state,” Kennedy, now 70, explained in the video to comedian Roseanne Barr, who can be seen drinking from a coffee cup and nodding through the tale.

But after a busy day — which reportedly included a late dinner at Peter Luger Steak House in New York City — Kennedy said his companions egged him on to drop the bear’s body in Central Park to make it look as though a cyclist had hit the bear, as a commentary on how cyclists had recently struck and killed pedestrians in the city. (Pedestrian deaths caused by cyclists are extremely rare, but two people had died after being struck by bikers in New York in the two months before the bear was discovered in October 2014, according to news reports at the time).

“I wasn’t drinking, of course, but people were drinking with me who thought this was a good idea,” Kennedy said in the video. “I had an old bike in my car that somebody had asked me to get rid of. I said, ‘Let’s go put the bear in Central Park, and we’ll make it look like he got hit by a bike. It will be fun for people.’”

The discovery of the bear carcass turned out to be less fun and more macabre, receiving widespread news coverage and prompting an investigation by the New York Police Department’s animal cruelty squad, according to a 2014 New York Times article.

“This is a highly unusual situation,” a spokeswoman for the Central Park Conservancy told the Times then. “It’s awful.”

A necropsy showed that the 6-month-old bear had died after being struck by a vehicle, not by a bicycle as it was made to appear, according to another Times article, which happened to be written by Kennedy’s first cousin once removed, Tatiana Schlossberg, who was a Metro reporter at the paper at the time.

“I was worried because my prints were all over that bike,” Kennedy said in the video. “Luckily, the story died after a while and it stayed dead for a decade.”

Advertisement

The story was set to resurface now, Kennedy added, because fact-checkers from the New Yorker had called to confirm details in advance of an article about his campaign.

“Looking forward to seeing how you spin this one, @NewYorker,” Kennedy wrote in an X post that included the video, in an apparent effort to get ahead of the story.

The magazine’s lengthy piece, which published Monday morning, recounts the bear incident in much the same way Kennedy did in the video and also includes a photo of Kennedy posing in the trunk of a vehicle with the cub’s carcass — or, at least, a cub’s carcass — with three fingers inside its bloody mouth. A gaping wound can be seen on the cub’s body.

According to New Yorker reporter Clare Malone, when asked about the bear incident, Kennedy responded, “Maybe that’s where I got my brain worm,” a reference to what may now be the second-most-bizarre tidbit about the independent presidential candidate.

Advertisement

Representatives for Kennedy’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. On social media, several posts from Kennedy on Monday suggested that he was downplaying the hubbub over the bear story as “trivial.”

It is unclear what effect Kennedy’s admission that he was the one responsible for a dead bear cub appearing in Central Park a decade ago will have on his long-shot White House bid, which has already encountered several controversies. Last month, Kennedy faced accusations of sexual assault from a woman who later told The Washington Post that he reached out by text to privately apologize to her for his behavior.

“I’ve said this from the beginning: I am not a church boy,” he said on a podcast in response to the allegations. “… I have so many skeletons in my closet that if they could all vote, I could run for king of the world.”

Kennedy was already running without the support of most of his famous political family, many members of which formally endorsed President Biden this year before Biden dropped out of the race. Democrats have repeatedly accused Kennedy of running as a spoiler candidate in the election and on Monday jumped on the story to criticize him.

“The RFK Jr. running for president is the same RFK Jr. portrayed in this [New Yorker] story: a deeply troubled, reckless, and dangerous man,” Democratic National Committee spokesman Matt Corridoni said in a statement that also noted that the magazine reported that Kennedy was not opposed to serving in a Donald Trump administration. “He doesn’t think the rules apply to him and he refuses to consider the consequences of his actions.”

Kennedy Jr., the independent presidential candidate, confessed on Sunday that he had left a dead bear cub in Central Park in Manhattan in 2014 because he thought it would be “amusing.”

Mr. Kennedy posted a video detailing the bizarre story on social media ahead of an article in The New Yorker that mentions the incident.

“Looking forward to seeing how you spin this one,” he said, tagging the magazine.

In the video, Mr. Kennedy appears to be seated in a kitchen as he casually tells the actress Roseanne Barr about the ordeal. He says that he was driving through the Hudson Valley when he saw a woman in a van hit and kill a young bear.

“I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was going to skin the bear,” he says. “It was very good condition and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator.”"
RFK Jr. says he left a dead bear in Central Park as a joke.,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/05/rfk-jr-kennedy-bear-story-central-park-new-york,"Robert F Kennedy Jr released a bizarre video on Sunday in which he admitted that, a decade ago, he dumped a dead bear cub in New York City’s Central Park and staged the scene to make it look like a bicyclist had run over the animal.

The video was apparently an effort to combat an upcoming New Yorker story that he predicted will be a “bad story”.

In the video, the presidential candidate is speaking to the actor Roseanne Barr and recounts the story of travelling through New York’s Hudson valley on a falconry expedition and coming across a young bear that had been hit and killed by another driver.

In 2014, the female black bear was found in some bushes by a dog in a mystery that consumed the city.

At the time, Florence Slatkin, who lives near the park, said that her friend’s terrier spotted something near a bicycle lying on the ground.

“At first, we thought it was a bag of clothes or maybe a dead dog,” she told the Associated Press.

But then, as they got closer, they realised it was a very small bear “with its mouth wide open and scratches on the side”.

When police arrived, they observed that the bear had trauma to its body but it was not clear how it died, prompting an investigation that was never solved - until Sunday.

In the video, Kennedy says he picked up the carcass and put it in his van, planning to skin it and eat it later. However, he ran out of time to take the bear home before having to catch a flight.

Kennedy said he and the group he was with – some of whom had been drinking – then came up with a plan to take an old bike he happened to have in his van and place the bear’s carcass in Central Park to make it look like the bear had been hit by a bike, taking advantage of a recent rash of bicycle crashes in New York.

“We thought it would be amusing for whoever found it,” Kennedy said.

“The next day it was on every television station,” Kennedy said to Barr. “I was like, ‘Oh my God, what did I do?’

“I was worried because my prints were all over that bike … Luckily, the story died down after awhile.”

He and Barr shared a laugh as he said that the New Yorker had found out about his role in the event. “It’s gonna be a bad story,” he said.

It’s the latest bizarre incident in Kennedy’s quixotic campaign that has divided his famous family and left Republicans and Democrats alike concerned about his potential impact on the presidential contest.

Some other notable events include Kennedy acknowledging a parasite that lodged in his brain and died. He also denied eating a dog after a friend shared a photo with Vanity Fair magazine showing Kennedy dramatically preparing to take a bite of a charred animal; Kennedy said it was a goat.

RFK Jr. says he left a dead bear in Central Park as a joke.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2j3353vvdvo,"RFK Jr admits dumping bear carcass in New York's Central Park

In a video posted on X, RFK Jr confessed to dumping a dead bear cub in New York's Central Park in 2014.

Robert F Kennedy Jr has recounted how he dumped a dead bear cub in New York's Central Park in 2014. The clip, posted on X account on Sunday, shows the independent presidential candidate describing to US actress Roseanne Barr the incident that mystified New Yorkers 10 years ago. Mr Kennedy said a woman had killed the bear with her car when he was driving outside the city, and he put it in his van with the intention of harvesting its meat. He shared the anecdote as the New Yorker magazine published a story about the incident on Monday.

According to the New Yorker, Mr Kennedy was ""tickled"" by the discovery of the bear while heading to a falconry outing in the rural Hudson River Valley. An image included in the article shows Mr Kennedy grimacing with his hand inside the dead bear's mouth after he loaded the carcass in the back of his car. The magazine quoted an anonymous source as saying that Mr Kennedy ""thought it would be funny to make it look like an errant cyclist"" had killed it. The account is broadly similar to the one provided by Mr Kennedy on Sunday. In his video, Mr Kennedy tells Barr that he was driving to go falcon-hunting near Goshen, New York in 2014 when the bear was killed. ""I was going to skin the bear... and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator,"" he says. ""And you can do that in New York state: Get a bear tag for a roadkill bear."" New York state allows for roadkill to be taken, but authorities must be notified. Mr Kennedy does not appear to have done that. Instead, he says he continued to his falconry event, then went on to dinner at Peter Luger Steakhouse in New York City, about 75 miles (121km) south of Goshen.

""At the end of the dinner, it was late and I realised I couldn't go home,"" Mr Kennedy says. ""I had to go to the airport, and the bear was in my car, and I didn't want to leave the bear in my car because that would have been bad."" That is when, he says, it occurred to him that there had been a series of bicycle accidents in New York and that he had an old bicycle in his car. ""We thought it would be amusing for whoever found it,"" he says. ""The next day... it was on every television station. It was a front page of every paper and I turned on the TV and there was like a mile of yellow tape and 20 cop cars, there were helicopters flying, and I was like, 'Oh my God. What did I do?'"" He then notes that a fact-checker from the New Yorker called him and asked whether he was involved, which appears to have prompted him to release this video. The bear's corpse was discovered by a woman walking her dog, The New York Times said in its 2014 story. The carcass had been placed under some bushes and an abandoned bicycle. New York's Department of Environmental Conservation told the BBC on Monday that an investigation determined the bear had died from a high-speed collision. It added that charges cannot be brought for incidents more than a year old. The Times' story from 2014 was written by a one of Mr Kennedy's relatives - Tatiana Schlossberg, the granddaughter of former president John F Kennedy. Mr Kennedy's story comes as support for his presidential campaign has dwindled to single digits in polls since Kamala Harris entered the race for the Democrats. He maintains that he has no intention of ending his presidential bid."

Independent presidential candidate Robert Kennedy Jr. on Sunday confessed that he was behind the incident after a fact-checker from The New Yorker called him to verify the story.

In a video he posted on X, Kennedy said he had come across the bear in the morning when he was going falconing; a woman in a van in front of him hit and killed the bear.

But the falconing day went longer than expected, and he had to go straight to a dinner in the city at Peter Luger Steakhouse, he recounted. That, too, ran late, and Kennedy said he realized he had to go to the airport and would not be able to go home to Westchester first.

""And the bear was in my car, and I didn't want to leave the bear in the car because that would have been bad,"" he said. ""So, then I thought you know at that time this was the little bit of the redneck me.

He said, ""I wasn't drinking, of course, but people were drinking with me who thought this was a good idea.""

Kennedy mentioned that in addition to the dead bear cub, he had ""an old bike in my car that somebody asked me to get rid of.""

""I said let's go put the bear in Central Park and we'll make it look like it got hit by a bike,"" Kennedy recalled. What he did not expect was the media attention the stunt would attract.

""The next day, it was like it was on every television station. It was the front page of every paper and I turned on the TV and there was like a mile of yellow tape and there were 20 cop cars, there were helicopters flying over it. And I was like, 'Oh my God, what did I do?' And then they were, there was some people on TV and Tyvek suits with gloves on lifting up the bike and they're saying they're gonna take this up to Albany to get it fingerprinted,"" he said. ""And I was worried because my prints were all over that bike.""

In another odd twist, one of the reporters who wrote about the mystery at the time was Kennedy's niece and John F. Kennedy's granddaughter, Tatiana Schlossberg, who was working for The New York Times, a social media user noted.

""So many questions remain unanswered,"" she wrote. ""How did the bear end up in Central Park? Was there foul play involved? Did she die in the park, or was she dumped there?""

Kennedy said that luckily, the story had died off until The New Yorker reported on it and asked him to verify it for an article about him and his campaign in the magazine.

""It's going to be a bad story,"" Kennedy predicted.

The New Yorker article, published Monday, included a photo of Kennedy with his hand in the bear cub's mouth, pretending he was being bitten.

""When I asked Kennedy about the incident, he said, 'Maybe that's where I got my brain worm,'"" the story's author, Clare Malone, wrote.

A spokesperson for the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation told WCBS' John Doyle that RFK Jr. will not face charges in the 2014 incident, saying the investigation did not uncover sufficient evidence to determine if violations occurred. ""The statute of limitation was one year, which has long expired,"" the spokesperson said.

RFK Jr. says he left a dead bear in Central Park as a joke.,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/05/politics/rfk-jr-new-yorker-bear-cub/index.html,"CNN —

Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s 2014 disposal of a dead bear cub in New York City’s Central Park may have violated state law, punishable by a fine of up to $250, but the statute of limitations for the law in question expired after one year, the state agency that led the investigation said in a statement to CNN.

Kennedy has made light of a decade-old incident in which he drove a dead bear cub carcass from upstate New York to New York City and placed it in Central Park, joking, “maybe that’s where I got my brain worm,” referring to a past medical abnormality he has said was caused by a parasitic worm in his brain.

The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation led the 2014 investigation into how a bear cub carcass had made into the famous Manhattan public park.

The New Yorker published a profile of Kennedy on Monday morning that included the anecdote and a photo of Kennedy with the dead bear cub, which he had picked up from the side of the road while on a trip upstate. When Kennedy returned to Manhattan later that day, he left the carcass in the park in a way to make it look like it had been hit by a cyclist, the New Yorker reported, and the discovery of the bear carcass attracted news coverage and prompted an investigation by local authorities. Kennedy revealed the incident on social media on Sunday as part of an effort to get ahead of the magazine’s story.

In a statement Monday afternoon, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation said that it “led the 2014 investigation and forensic analysis into the Central Park bear cub and concluded the bear died from blunt-force trauma consistent with a high-speed collision.”

The investigation closed later that year due to “a lack of sufficient evidence to determine if violations occurred,” the statement said. It noted that state law “includes offenses such as illegal possession of a bear without a tag or permit and illegal disposal of a bear,” carrying fines of up to $250 for first-time offenders.

The Kennedy campaign did not respond to a request for comment on the statement.

The bear incident is the latest in a series of bizarre episodes from Kennedy’s life that have been revealed over the course of his 2024 presidential campaign.

The New Yorker article includes an image of Kennedy sticking his hand in the dead bear’s mouth, pantomiming as if the bear is biting his hand. The image echoes a photo published by Vanity Fair last month of Kennedy pretending to eat a cooked animal carcass. Vanity Fair reported Kennedy sent the photo to a friend while suggesting they try eating dog. The publication consulted with a veterinarian who said the carcass in the photo appeared to be a dog.

When asked about the bear incident, he told the magazine, “Maybe that’s where I got my brain worm,” referencing a 2010 incident in which Kennedy experienced short-term memory loss and “brain fog” he said was caused by a parasitic worm that entered his brain and died.

Kennedy has often referenced the brain worm episode for comedic effect at campaign events and in interviews since it was first reported by The New York Times in May. He has previously said he believes he contracted the parasite from eating undercooked meat.

‘Everybody thought, ‘That’s a great idea”

In the video Kennedy published on his X account Sunday, Kennedy tells actress Roseanne Barr about traveling through New York’s Hudson Valley to go hawking and coming across a “young bear” that had been hit and killed by another driver. He says in the video he decided to put the dead bear in his car.

“I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was gonna skin the bear,” he said on the video. “It was in very good condition and I was gonna put the meat in my refrigerator.”

Kennedy referenced the process New York has for someone to lawfully possess a bear carcass, if they obtain a permit known as a “tag.”

Kennedy then tells Barr he spent the day hawking before driving to New York City for a dinner — with the bear still in his car. At the end of the dinner, Kennedy said, he had to go to the airport and couldn’t take the bear back to his home. He said he broached to friends the idea of taking the bear to Central Park and making it appear as if a biker had hit it.

“I had an old bike in my car that somebody had asked me to get rid of and I said, ‘Let’s go put the bear in Central Park and we’ll make it look like he got hit by a bike,’” Kennedy says in the video, prompting laughs from Barr and others in the room not visible in the video. “Everybody thought, ‘That’s a great idea.’ So we did that and we thought it would be amusing for whoever found it or something.”

Kennedy said the media coverage “worried” him because he’d left behind fingerprints and suggested he was not blamed for the incident at the time.

“Luckily, the story died down after a while and it stayed dead for a decade. The New Yorker somehow found out about it, and they just — they’re gonna do a big article on me. … So they asked me, the fact-checkers,” he said.

New Yorker article comes as RFK campaign falters

The magazine also spoke to Kennedy’s campaign manager and daughter-in-law, Amaryllis Fox Kennedy, who shared details of his meeting with former President Donald Trump during the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee last month. Fox Kennedy told the magazine Trump suggested to Kennedy he drop out of the race in exchange for a position in his administration if he wins.

“They said, ‘You know, we know that you take more from us than you take from Biden,’ she told the magazine, and said Trump and his team asked Kennedy, ‘Is there something that you would want to do?’” Fox Kennedy reiterated that Kennedy is open to serving in a future Trump administration, and called the idea of Kennedy potentially being nominated as secretary of Health and Human Services “an incredibly interesting one.”

Fox Kennedy also told the magazine she believes Kennedy has clear paths to victory in November and said the campaign will focus on Democrats in traditionally Republican states and Republicans in traditionally Democratic states. She also told the New Yorker she believes Kennedy can become president by way of a contingent election if no candidate receives 270 electoral votes.

The wide-ranging article – which also details Kennedy’s history with drug addiction, his previous marriages and infidelity, and his relationship to his family – comes at a moment in which the Kennedy campaign is struggling to find its footing as Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris appear to be solidifying their support in the final months before November’s election. In a Quinnipiac national poll of registered voters released last month, Kennedy received 8% support, trailing Trump’s 44% and President Joe Biden, who was still running at the time of the poll, at 39%.

Kennedy’s campaign also continues to struggle with fundraising after pulling in $5.3 million in June and spending more than $6.2 million, according to federal campaign finance records. Last month, the campaign established a joint fundraising committee with the Libertarian Party to help boost fundraising.

Kennedy has scaled back his campaign events in recent weeks as his campaign says it’s focused on meeting ballot access deadlines in states around the country. He hasn’t hosted an in-person campaign event in over a month. Kennedy is expected to appear in court this week in New York, where he’ll testify in defense of his campaign’s ballot petition in the state.

For more on the 2024 election, head to the NPR Network's live updates page.

A decade after the shocking discovery of a bear cub carcass in Manhattan’s Central Park, the mystery of who dumped it there has finally been solved.

And the man taking responsibility is none other than presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

The conspiracy theorist-turned-third-party candidate’s campaign has weathered a series of increasingly improbable-sounding scandals in recent months, from Kennedy’s admission that a worm ate part of his brain to his denial of reports that he once ate barbecued dog (he said it was a goat).

RFK unleashed this latest one himself, in a three-minute video posted to X (formerly Twitter) on Sunday.

It shows him sitting at a kitchen table, telling an incredulous-looking Roseanne Barr (yes, the canceled comedian) about how the dead bear ended up in his van upstate and, ultimately, on top of a bicycle beneath a bush in New York City’s largest urban park.

Kennedy, an animal lover and former environmental lawyer, says he was driving upstate early one morning to take a group of people falconing in the Hudson Valley when a driver in front of him fatally hit a bear cub.

“So I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van, because I was gonna skin the bear,” he explains matter-of-factly. “It was in very good condition and I was gonna put the meat in my refrigerator.”

Kennedy added that it is legal in New York State to get a bear tag to take home a roadkill bear. Such a tag must be written up by a law enforcement officer.

The bear never made it back to his Westchester home, however.

Kennedy says he got waylaid by a busy day of falconry, and then had to rush back to New York City for a dinner at Peter Luger Steak House, which ran late.

“I had to go to the airport, and the bear was in my car, and I didn’t want to leave the bear in the car because that would have been bad,” Kennedy continues.

Then, as he put it, “the little bit of the redneck in me” had an idea.

Kennedy just happened to have an old bike in his car, which he said someone had asked him to get rid of. He recalled that the city “had just put in the bike lanes” after a number of serious accidents, and decided to stage the bear in Central Park as if it had been hit by a bike.

“I wasn’t drinking, of course, but people were drinking with me who thought this was a good idea,” Kennedy said. “So we went and did that and we thought it would be amusing for whoever found it, or something.”

The six-month-old, 44-pound cub made national news after a dog walker stumbled upon it that fateful October morning, in a wide-open part of the park right near the path where thousands of people run and bike each day.

Weirdly enough, one of the New York Times reporters who covered the mystery was Caroline Kennedy’s daughter Tatiana Schlossberg, RJK Jr.'s first cousin once removed. She told the paper this weekend that “like law enforcement, I had no idea who was responsible for this when I wrote the story.”

Law enforcement took the bear to Albany for analysis and determined that it had been hit by a car, likely outside the park. They also confiscated the bicycle to test for fingerprints.

“I was worried because my prints were all over that bike,” Kennedy says in the video, drawing laughs from the room.

But the mystery remained unsolved, and the story eventually faded away. Now, almost 10 years later, Kennedy said he was prompted to come clean ahead of an anticipated New Yorker exposé: “Looking forward to seeing how you spin this one,” he captioned the video.

“They asked me, the fact checkers, and, you know, it’s gonna be a bad story,” he says with a laugh.

The New Yorker piece, published online Monday morning, situates the bear anecdote within a larger look at Kennedy’s famously checkered past and motivations for running.

It also includes a photo of Kennedy, who was 60 at the time, posing with his hands inside the bear’s bloody mouth and an exaggerated grimace on his face.

“Maybe that’s where I got my brain worm,” he told the magazine.

Kennedy also made headlines during the Republican National Convention in July after a leaked call with former President Donald Trump captured the Republican nominee criticizing vaccines (a stance for which Kennedy is famous) and appealing to Kennedy with a vague, “I would love for you to do something.”

Kennedy apologized to the president and, seeking to quash speculation, vowed to stay in the race. But he has seen his support dwindle — down to single digits in several national polls — in the weeks since President Biden announced his withdrawal. His fight to get onto state ballots has reportedly been a financial drain, and he’s canceled multiple campaign appearances over the last month."

Kennedy Jr. acknowledged Sunday that he abandoned a young dead bear in Central Park after he initially planned to skin the cub for meat.

Kennedy said in a three-minute video on X that The New Yorker magazine found out about the incident, the date of which is unknown, and asked him for confirmation. Kennedy described driving north of New York City to go falconing with a group when he saw a woman in a van hit and kill a young bear.

“So I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was going to skin the bear, and it was very good condition,"" Kennedy said in the video, talking to Roseanne Barr. ""And I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator.”

Kennedy described his schedule that day as running late, prompting him to drive back to New York City for a dinner with the dead bear still in his car. When the dinner ran late, he said, he had no time to stop at his home in Westchester County before he was due to head to the airport.

He described thinking about a series of bicycle accidents that had happened around that time in the city and hatching a plan.

""I wasn’t drinking, of course, but people were drinking with me who thought this was a good idea. And I said I had an old bike in my car that somebody asked me to get rid of. I said, 'Let's go put the bear in Central Park, and we’ll make it look like he got hit by a bike,'"" Kennedy said as Barr and a person offscreen laughed.

""We thought it would be amusing for whoever found it or something,"" Kennedy said, adding that the move instead garnered massive media attention.

Kennedy did not specify when the incident took place. But the New Yorker indicated that it occurred in the fall of 2014 in a report published Monday. That timing aligns with media coverage of a dead bear cub found in Central Park in 2014.

The New Yorker reported that Kennedy passed by a “furry brown mound” on the side of the road in upstate New York while on his way to a falconry outing. After pulling over and realizing that it was the carcass of a black bear cub, Kennedy reportedly loaded the dead bear into the back of his car and later showed it to his friends. A photo obtained by The New Yorker shows Kennedy holding the dead bear, placing his fingers inside its mouth and appearing amused, with a grimace across his face.

Kennedy reportedly drove to Central Park in Manhattan after the falconry outing that day. The dead bear was then found by two women who were walking their dogs in the park the next day, according to the magazine.

Neither the magazine nor Kennedy’s campaign immediately responded to requests for comment on Sunday evening.

“It’s going to be a bad story,” Kennedy predicted in the video as people laughed.

The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation referred NBC News’ request for comment to the New York Police Department, which did not immediately respond.

Kennedy hit at the news media in a Monday post to X after the publication of The New Yorker’s report. Without mentioning the magazine, the independent presidential candidate wrote that the press highlights “trivial stories” to disparage certain political figures.

“The press is often called the ‘fourth estate,’ to emphasize its independence and high purpose,” he wrote. “But these days it is in eerie, almost comical lockstep, amplifying trivial stories to damage disfavored political figures.”

“Meanwhile, parents in our country can’t afford groceries,” he added. “Brothers won’t speak to each other because of partisan loyalties. Small towns sink under addiction and depression. And the world careens toward WW3. Let’s hold our media to a higher standard!”"

Independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr is once again firefighting a wild story from his past after he bizarrely confessed to dumping a dead bear cub in New York City’s Central Park a decade ago.

Seemingly attempting to get ahead of the publication of a forthcoming article in The New Yorker magazine, RFK Jr posted a video on X recounting the tale to former sitcom actress Roseanne Barr.

In the three-minute clip, RFK Jr claims he had set out from the Big Apple in October 2014 to spend a weekend falconing with friends in upstate New York, when he saw a motorist ahead of him hit the bear with her car.

The cub was killed instantly, he says.

RFK Jr says he pulled over and retrieved the dead animal, loading it into his own vehicle, adding: “I was going to skin the bear – and it was in very good condition – and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator.

“And you can do that in New York State. Get a bear tag for a roadkill bear.”

Under state law, RFK Jr was legally able to pick up the creature, although he would have needed to notify the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation in order to obtain the necessary tag.

Resuming the story, he tells Barr that he drove on and continued with his day’s sport near Goshen in the Hudson Valley before attending dinner at Peter Luger Steakhouse some 75 miles south.

“At the end of the dinner, it was late and I realised I couldn’t go home,” he continues.

“I had to go to the airport, and the bear was in my car, and I didn’t want to leave the bear in my car because that would have been bad.”

RFK Jr says it was at this moment that he landed on the idea of leaving the bear cub’s carcass in Central Park next to an old bicycle he had in his vehicle as part of a ploy to make the cub’s death look like an accident involving a cyclist.

The scheme was cheerily endorsed by his fellow diners, he claims.

“So we did that and we thought it would be amusing for whoever found it or something,” continues RFK Jr, seen sitting at a messy dinner table while Barr listens intently.

The following day, RFK Jr learned that the discovery of a dead bear cub was all over the news.

“The next day... it was on every television station. It was a front page of every paper and I turned on the TV and there was like a mile of yellow tape and 20 cop cars, there were helicopters flying, and I was like, ‘Oh my god. What did I do?’” he says in the video.

When The New Yorker’s profile of the long-shot contender for the White House did emerge later on Monday, the anecdote about the bear and its disposal was included along with a picture of RFK Jr, seemingly taken by a friend, posing with his hand in the dead cub’s jaws.

“Maybe that’s where I got my brain worm,” he joked when asked to comment.

The photo has since gone viral across social media, alongside a swathe of X users sharing their disgust.

“That he thought… any of this was ‘funny’ is beyond disturbing. What kind of sick person does this? It’s revolting,” one person wrote on X.

“What a disgusting man,” another wrote, with a third teasing: “Definitely presidential material.”

Back in October 2014, the dead cub hit headlines and sparked a mystery as to how it wound up there.

Central Park Conservancy said at the time that a dog walker had stumbled across the three-foot-tall creature’s carcass under a bush near West 69th Street and West Drive in the park and alerted authorities.

The NYPD’s animal cruelty squad investigated the incident but it remained a mystery – until now.

In a curious twist, The New York Times’ 2014 report of the shock discovery was written by journalist Tatiana Schlossberg, a relative of RFK Jr.

In recent weeks, Kennedy has seen his campaign’s popularity overshadowed after Joe Biden’s decision to drop out paved the way for the astonishing ascent of Vice President Kamala Harris.

He had previously threatened to peel crucial votes away from both the Democratic Party’s ticket and from Republican rival Donald Trump, whom Kennedy reportedly offered to endorse in exchange for a job in his administration.

As the son of the former US attorney general Robert F Kennedy and nephew of 35th US president John F Kennedy, both of whom were assassinated in the 1960s, RFK Jr has been dogged by controversy throughout his run, notably over his scepticism towards vaccines.

His campaign has also been plagued by other extraordinary tales.

Disowned politically by most of his fabled family, he has previously had to address stories about him suffering from a “brain worm”, being shot at with arrows in Peru and allegedly eating a barbecued dog.

RFK Jr. says he left a dead bear in Central Park as a joke.,https://www.scrippsnews.com/us-news/rfk-jr-says-he-dumped-a-dead-bear-in-new-yorks-central-park-a-decade-ago,"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is raising eyebrows again after he confessed to disposing of a dead bear carcass in New York's Central Park a decade ago.

In a three-minute video shared on social media, the former environmental lawyer can be seen telling comedian Roseanne Barr the story about how a 2014 trip in upstate New York led to a dead bear in his car and then ultimately under a bush with a bike in the central Manhattan park.

Kennedy said he was driving to meet a group of people falconing in New York's Hudson Valley when a woman driving in front of him fatally struck the bear cub with her vehicle.

""So, I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was going to skin the bear and it was in very good condition,"" Kennedy said. ""And I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator, and you can do that in New York, you can get a bear tag for roadkill bear.""

However, the bear apparently never made it back to Kennedy's home. He went on to say that — with the dead animal still in his car — a long day of falconry turned into a dinner in the city, which went late. That's when Kennedy realized he had to hurry to catch a flight, but still needed to do something with the bear carcass.

""I didn't want to leave the bear in the car because that would've been bad,"" he said. That's when, according to Kennedy, ""the little bit of redneck in me"" gave him an idea.

He recalled there had been several news stories at the time about bicyclists being involved in crashes.

""I wasn't drinking, of course, but people were drinking with me who thought this was a good idea,"" Kennedy continued. ""I had an old bike in my car that somebody had asked me to get rid of and I said, 'Let's go put the bear in central park and we'll make it look like he got hit by a bike.'""

He went on to say, ""everybody thought, 'That's a great idea!'""

However, by the next day, the mysterious fatal bear bike crash story made national headlines after the animal was discovered by two New York dog walkers. Law enforcement then determined the bear had likely been struck by a vehicle outside the park and confiscated the bicycle to dust it for fingerprints.

""I was worried because my prints were all over that bike,"" Kennedy said as Roseanne Barr and others in the room laughed.

However, nothing happened. The story ultimately died down and the mystery would go unsolved for the next decade, until Kennedy said Sunday he wanted to come clean ahead of an expected exposé in The New Yorker magazine.

""The New Yorker somehow found out about it and they just, they're gonna do a big article on me and that's one of the articles,"" he said.

""Looking forward to seeing how you spin this one, @NewYorker,"" Kennedy captioned the video.

The New Yorker did publish the piece Monday morning and the bear story was featured alongside a photo of Kennedy holding his hand inside the animal's bloodied mouth with a whimsical scowl on his face.

""Maybe that's where I got my brain worm,"" he jokingly told the publication.

RELATED STORY | Third-party presidential candidate RFK Jr. apparently said a parasite ate part of his brain

The dramatic story comes as Kennedy's presidential campaign has faltered in recent months amid rumors he was considering dropping out of the race and planning to endorse former President Donald Trump. However, he told Scripps News on July 26 that he ""never intended to get out of the campaign"" and called the reports ""fake news.""

""I have no plans to endorse any other candidate. I'm in it to win it,"" Kennedy said. ""Our donations are way up, our social engagement up a thousand percent since President Biden dropped out. Our volunteers are up, our email engagement is up. We have tremendous momentum right now and we intend to win this campaign.""

Kennedy has kept up an active presence on social media and continues to hold campaign events across the country. However, the independent candidate has still not managed to garner more than single-digit support in various national election polls, and faces an uphill battle with the election now less than 100 days away."
RFK Jr. says he left a dead bear in Central Park as a joke.,https://www.aol.com/rfk-jr-could-faced-fine-233427930.html,"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could have been hit with a fine for dumping a dead bear cub in New York's Central Park, but the state agency that investigated the bizarre incident said the statute of limitations for the decade-old offense has long since expired.

The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation ""led the 2014 investigation and forensic analysis into the Central Park bear cub,"" the agency said in a statement Monday.

The discovery of the dead cub in the middle of Manhattan made headlines in October of 2014, but investigators at the time were not able to determine how it got there.

Kennedy acknowledged in a video he posted on social media Sunday that he was the culprit, in an effort to get ahead of a story in the New Yorker that mentioned he was responsible. Kennedy told Roseanne Barr in the video that he'd picked up the dead cub outside of the city after someone had hit it with their car. He said he had plans to skin it and eat it, but time got away from him and he wound up leaving it near a bike path in the park as a joke. He was 60 at the time.

The DEC statement said its probe had indeed ""concluded the bear died from blunt-force trauma consistent with a high-speed collision.""

""The investigation was closed later that year due to a lack of sufficient evidence to determine if violations occurred,"" the statement said.

The agency said it's against the law to dispose of a dead bear the way Kennedy said he did.

""The State’s Environmental Conservation Law includes offenses such as illegal possession of a bear without a tag or permit and illegal disposal of a bear, both of which are violation-level offenses typically subject to fines of up to $250 for the first offense,"" the agency said. ""The statute of limitations for these offenses is one year; charges cannot be brought for incidents that occurred more than one year ago.""

Ron Kuby, a veteran New York criminal defense lawyer, said Kennedy could have faced additional penalties from the city for illegal dumping.

""It's barely illegal,"" Kuby said in a phone interview, adding that while Kennedy could have faced a heftier civil fine from city authorities, up to $1,000, he would not have faced criminal charges.

As for the state violation, it's ""akin to a traffic violation,"" Kuby said.

Kennedy's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.

The city Department of Sanitation used the odd political news as a teaching moment on social media.

“Wondering how to dispose of a dead animal in New York City?” a post on the department’s X account read. It included a figure standing in front of three trash bags in descending sizes, marked “Paddington,” “Fozzie” and “Gummy,” referring to the fictional children's book character, the Muppet and the candy, respectively.

The post also linked to information on the department's website about how to properly dispose of a dead animal in New York City.

The statement from DEC, meanwhile, included a link on how to dispose of animals outside the city. ""To legally possess a deer, moose, or bear unintentionally killed by a collision, individuals are required to report and obtain a permit from either DEC or local law enforcement,"" the agency said."

At the time, passersby speculated that the cub had been separated from her mother, and experienced a traumatic death, The New York Times reported in October 2014. The discovery rattled New Yorkers, who by all means, can usually say with confidence that they'd ""seen it all."" Nearly a decade later, the mystery of how the bear cub's body got to the park's Main Loop may be a step closer to being solved — or not.

On Sunday, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — independent candidate for president whose campaign has been bogged down by numerous controversies such as whether or not he lives in Westchester County, questionable opinions on vaccines and his affinity for conspiracy theories — admitted to Roseanne Barr in a bizarre video post to X that he dumped the dead body of a ""young black bear"" in Central Park in 2014.

Here's everything we know about RFK Jr.'s viral admission so far.

RFK Jr. says he was driving to the Hudson Valley when he saw bear get hit

Kennedy said he was on his way to meet people in the Hudson Valley when he saw a van hit a young bear.

""I pulled over, and put him in the back of my van, because I was gonna skin the bear, and it was in very good condition, and I was gonna put the meat in my refrigerator,"" he said. ""And you can do that in New York State. You can get a bear tag for roadkill bear.""

Kennedy said that he then went ""hawking"" with the bear in his car.

After late dinner at Peter Luger, Kennedy didn't want to leave bear in car

""Instead of going back to my home in Westchester, I had to go right to the city 'cause there was a dinner at Peter Luger Steak House,"" RFK Jr. says in the video.

Because the dinner went late, Kennedy realized he had to go the airport instead of heading home. He didn't want to leave the bear in the car, ""because that would have been bad.""

RFK Jr. says he staged scene to look like bear got hit by a bike

""This was a little bit of the redneck in me,"" he said, going on to reference that there had been a series of bike accidents in the city at the time, and since he had an ""old bike"" in his car, he suggested that they ""go put the bear in Central Park and we'll make it look like it got hit by a bike.""

RFK Jr.'s account is consistent with details of the scene reported by the New York Times in 2014: a bystander saw the cub's body partially obscured by an abandoned bicycle.

2014 investigation revealed cause of death for black bear cub

A necropsy conducted by the New York State Department of Conservation in 2014 on the black bear cub's body inferred that she had died from “blunt force injuries consistent with a motor vehicle collision.”

This is consistent with RFK Jr.'s account: he says he saw the bear cub get hit by a van while driving to the Hudson Valley.

What was RFK Jr. up to in 2014?

RFK Jr. was known as an environmental advocate by 2014, having been named one of the ""Heroes of the Planet"" in 1999 by Time Magazine, for his work in helping to restore and protect the Hudson River with Riverkeeper. At the time, he was a practicing environmental justice attorney.

On September 30, 2014, he was slated to give a lecture titled “Our Environmental Destiny” at Western Connecticut State University. The bear cub was discovered less than a week later in Central Park.

In 2005, he wrote ""Crimes Against Nature: How George W. Bush and His Corporate Pals Are Plundering the Country and Hijacking Our Democracy"" , published by Harper Collins.

RFK Jr.'s residency in Westchester on trial this week in Albany

Meanwhile, Kennedy is at the center of another odd fiasco, this one centered on the question of his residency in Westchester County. He moved out to California with his wife in 2014, but insists his true home is in Westchester County, at a home owned by friends in Katonah. This, he argues, allowed him to claim New York residency on petitions in New York (and 17 other states) for a long-shot independent campaign for president.

But an ongoing court case is challenging those residency claims, saying Kennedy in fact does not live in Katonah and that his petitions should be tossed, keeping him off the ballot in New York in November. The case will be heard this week in Albany, with a decision expected in coming days.

The USA TODAY Network's New York State team contributed reporting for this article."
RFK Jr. says he left a dead bear in Central Park as a joke.,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/robert-kennedy-jr-left-dead-bear-central-park-112566475,"WILMINGTON, Del. -- Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. once retrieved a bear that was killed by a motorist and left it in New York's Central Park with a bicycle on top, sparking a mystery that consumed the city a decade ago.

Kennedy described the 2014 incident in a video that was posted to social media Sunday, adding it would be included in a New Yorker article that he expected to be damaging.

The article was published Monday and included a photo of Kennedy with his fingers in the bear's bloodied mouth, a mock grimace on his face. His left pant leg appears to have a bloodstain on it.

It's the latest bizarre incident in Kennedy's quixotic campaign that has divided his famous family and left Republicans and Democrats alike concerned about his potential impact on the presidential contest. Kennedy has acknowledged a parasite that lodged in his brain and died. He denied eating a dog after a friend shared a photo with Vanity Fair magazine showing Kennedy dramatically preparing to take a bite of a charred animal; Kennedy said it was a goat.

In the video, Kennedy recounts the story to actress Roseanne Barr. He says he was heading to a falconry excursion with friends when a woman driving ahead of him hit and killed the young bear with her vehicle. He says he put it in his own vehicle, intending to skin it and eat the meat, but the day got away from him.

Eventually, he says, he was in Manhattan and needed to get the bear carcass out of his vehicle. His friends, fueled by alcohol, concocted the Central Park plan as a prank, he said, adding he was not drunk himself. At the time, bicycle accidents were getting significant media attention, so Kennedy and his friends thought it would be funny to make it look like the bear was hit by a bicycle.

Two women walking their dogs found the dead bear and alerted authorities, touching off a mystery that captivated the city for a few days. Bears are not among the park's known wildlife population.

The bike was dusted for prints and the animal sent to Albany for a necropsy, which determined the bear was likely hit by a vehicle and was not a victim of animal cruelty. But how the bear ended up in Central Park remained a mystery.

“I was worried because my prints were all over that bike,” Kennedy tells Barr in the video.

Kennedy declined to speak to reporters Monday in Albany, New York, where he was attending a civil trial related to his efforts to get on the ballot in that state. A group trying to exclude him from New York's ballot filed a lawsuit claiming Kennedy lied on nomination papers about where he lives.

New York's Department of Environmental Conservation, which enforces laws regarding wildlife, said in a statement Monday that it closed its investigation after a forensic analysis concluded that the cub died from injuries consistent with a high-speed collision.

Possessing a bear without a tag or permit, or illegally disposing of a dead bear, are offenses punishable by fines of up to $250 in New York, but the department said charges cannot be brought for violations that occurred more than a year ago."

He relayed the unusual story apparently in an effort to get ahead of a New Yorker piece on the incident. The publication published the profile this morning, including a photo of Kennedy putting his fingers inside the bear’s mouth.

In the video, Kennedy is speaking to Roseanne Barr, in a kitchen area.

Kennedy said that he had been in the Hudson Valley area, early one morning, when a woman in a van in front of him hit a bear and killed it.

Roseanne Barr and Robert Kennedy

“So I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van, because I was going to skin the bear, and it was in very good condition,” Kennedy told Barr. He said he was going to put the meat in his refrigerator.

After spending the day hawking, Kennedy said that instead of going back to his home in Westchester he had to get to a dinner in New York City.

“At the end of the dinner, it went late, and I realized I couldn’t go home, I had to go to the airport,” he said. “And the bear was in my car, and I didn’t want to leave the bear in my car, because that would have been bad.”

He said that he and his friends at the dinner decided to take the bear to Central Park “and we will make it look like he got hit by a bike.”

They thought that whoever found the bear would find it amusing, but instead it created a bit of a media sensation. “The next day it was on every television station. It was the front page of every paper,” Kennedy said.

In 2014, The New York Times reported on the discovery of a dead bear cub, “The initial details of the case were clear: A woman was walking her dog in Central Park when she noticed the dead bear cub, which was lying under some bushes, partially concealed by an abandoned bicycle. The Police Department’s Animal Cruelty Investigation Squad began looking into the bear’s death, and the cub was taken to Albany for analysis by the conservation department’s wildlife health unit.” Authorities determined that the bear had been hit by a car.

The Times added, “But so many questions remain unanswered: How did the bear end up in Central Park? Was there foul play involved? Did she die in the park, or was she dumped there?”

In the story, experts surmised that it was the latter, commenting that it would be highly unusual for a bear to travel through the city to the park.

That said, the story had remained a public mystery until Kennedy’s revelation.

His campaign has had its share of other unusual revelations. In May, The New York Times reported that Kennedy had said in a deposition that a worm got into his brain and ate a portion of it. Kennedy told the Times that he had recovered from the memory loss and fogginess caused by the parasite.

Last month, Vanity Fair published a report that Kennedy texted a 2010 photo to a friend that featured him posing alongside a charred animal carcass, apparently being prepared to be eaten. Kennedy denied that the animal was a dog, and instead claimed that it was a goat."

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. probably won’t win the 2024 presidential race, but when it comes to making weird admissions about past run-ins with animals, the independent candidate continues to set a historic pace. First, there was his brain worm. Then there was the dead dog he posed for a photo with but denied eating. Now there’s the caper of Central Park’s dead black-bear cub.

In case you don’t remember, back in October 2014, New Yorkers were shocked to learn that a woman walking her dog in Central Park had come upon the body of a fatally traumatized six-month-old bear. Per the New York Times at the time:

The furry black mass lay hidden under a bush near Central Park’s main loop, unnoticed, unmoving and partially concealed by an abandoned bicycle. A dog rustling in the brush drew the first eyes to the bush and a sight rarely, if ever, found in modern Manhattan: a baby black bear, dead. A call to 911 followed and soon yellow police tape cordoned off the area near West 69th Street as detectives found themselves facing a mysterious crime scene on a sunny Monday morning. How the animal, a three-foot-long female, got to that spot remained a mystery at day’s end: a cub, probably born this year, somehow separated from her mother and from anything resembling a natural habitat. …

﻿The police described the bear as having had trauma to her body, but it was not immediately clear how she had died. … Nearby, New Yorkers increasingly familiar with wildlife sightings — a coyote in the park, a dolphin off Throgs Neck in the Bronx — offered theories of their own. Some suspected foul play. Others guessed an accident with a car. One man confidently pronounced the bear old enough to have wandered over from Morris County, N.J.

A necropsy later determined that the bear had died from “blunt force injuries consistent with a motor vehicle collision,” but no one could have possibly guessed the bizarre sequence of events that had led to the bear lying there.

RFK Jr. has now admitted he staged the whole thing via a video shared on Sunday in which he tells the story to Roseanne Barr. The admission was meant to preempt the reporting of the story in a New Yorker profile which was published one day later.

Here’s what he told Barr he did: While driving off to do some upstate falconing in Goshen, New York, Kennedy saw a woman run over the bear cub. Kennedy stopped his van and collected the fresh roadkill with the intention of skinning and eating it, because “it was in very good condition” and he wanted to put the meat in his fridge. But alas, he didn’t get back home right away, as he went falconing and later had some dinner plans at Peter Luger Steak House down in Brooklyn. Then he had a flight to catch, but still had a dead bear in his van.

So what’s a 60-year-old Kennedy scion to do? He hatched up a “redneck” scheme with his apparently drunk friends to drive to Manhattan and plant the dead bear in Central Park, along with an old bicycle Kennedy also happened to have in his van, in what was supposed to look like the aftermath of a fatal bike-on-bear accident. He thought this would be “amusing.”

He also got worried, he told Barr, when the dead bear was big local news and, amid the subsequent animal-cruelty investigation, it appeared as though the bike would be taken to a lab so it could be fingerprinted. “My prints were all over that bike,” he said.

But Kennedy’s secret remained safe, at least for a time. He would have gotten away with it, too, if it weren’t for the meddling New Yorker.

“Luckily, the story died after a while, and it stayed dead for a decade, and The New Yorker somehow found out about it,” Kennedy told Barr, explaining that the magazine’s fact-checkers had contacted him to confirm the details of his roadkill high jinks. “It’s going to be a bad story,” he said.

Looking forward to seeing how you spin this one, @NewYorker… pic.twitter.com/G13taEGzba — Robert F. Kennedy Jr (@RobertKennedyJr) August 4, 2024

On Monday, the New Yorker published its profile of RFK Jr. by Clare Malone, which did indeed include the bear cub incident:

One day, in the fall of 2014, Kennedy was driving to a falconry outing in upstate New York when he passed a furry brown mound on the side of the road. He pulled over and discovered that it was the carcass of a black-bear cub. Kennedy was tickled by the find. He loaded the dead bear into the rear hatch of his car and later showed it off to his friends. In a picture from that day, Kennedy is putting his fingers inside the bear’s bloody mouth, a comical grimace across his face. (When I asked Kennedy about the incident, he said, “Maybe that’s where I got my brain worm.”)

After the outing, Kennedy, who was then sixty and recently married to Hines, got an idea. He drove to Manhattan and, as darkness fell, entered Central Park with the bear and a bicycle. A person with knowledge of the event said that Kennedy thought it would be funny to make it look as if the animal had been killed by an errant cyclist.

They also published a photo of Kennedy posing with the carcass:

Another fun fact: One of the followup stories on the dead bear mystery at the time was written by John F. Kennedy’s granddaughter, then Times climate reporter Tatiana Schlossberg. One bear expert Schlossberg spoke with for that report correctly guessed what had happened, at least in part:

Dr. Lana Ciarniello, a bear expert in Canada, said that most bear experts in the United States were attending a conference in Greece and would be hard to reach for comment. She could not make the trip, so she was able to offer her thoughts on the mystery. She guessed that someone killed the bear and took it to Central Park. It was highly unlikely that a bear cub would travel across the concrete jungle.

In a comment to the Times after RFK Jr. acknowledged his responsibility, Schlossberg said, “Like law enforcement, I had no idea who was responsible for this when I wrote the story.”

On Monday morning, the DSNY put out a timely reminder on how to properly get rid of dead animals:

Roseanne Barr has distanced herself from Robert F Kennedy Jr’s social media video in which the presidential hopeful confessed to dumping a dead bear cub in New York City’s Central Park a decade ago.

In the video, the Roseanne star, 71, can be seen holding a mug and listening on as RFK Jr, 70, tells the outlandish anecdote.

Writing on X/Twitter, Barr explained: “This was not filmed by me or my team.

“This was off the cuff after the interview. There is no spin here- just a funny story. It’s nice to see RFK finally get some press- Albeit during an economic crash by the Biden Harris administration. Great job journos!”

RFK Jr posted the three-minute video on X seemingly in an attempt to get ahead of the publication of a forthcoming article in The New Yorker magazine.

In the clip, RFK Jr claims he had set out from the Big Apple in October 2014 to spend a weekend falconing with friends in upstate New York, when he saw a motorist ahead of him hit the bear with her car.

The cub was killed instantly, he says.

RFK Jr says he pulled over and retrieved the dead animal, loading it into his own vehicle, adding: “I was going to skin the bear – and it was in very good condition – and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator.

“And you can do that in New York State. Get a bear tag for a roadkill bear.”

Under state law, RFK Jr was legally able to pick up the creature, although he would have needed to notify the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation in order to obtain the necessary tag.

Resuming the story, he tells Barr that he drove on and continued with his day’s sport near Goshen in the Hudson Valley before attending dinner at Peter Luger Steakhouse some 75 miles south.

“At the end of the dinner, it was late and I realised I couldn’t go home,” he continues.

“I had to go to the airport, and the bear was in my car, and I didn’t want to leave the bear in my car because that would have been bad.”

RFK Jr says it was at this moment that he landed on the idea of leaving the bear cub’s carcass in Central Park next to an old bicycle he had in his vehicle as part of a ploy to make the cub’s death look like an accident involving a cyclist.

The scheme was cheerily endorsed by his fellow diners, he claims.

“So we did that and we thought it would be amusing for whoever found it or something,” continues RFK Jr, seen sitting at a messy dinner table while Barr listens intently.

The following day, RFK Jr learned that the discovery of a dead bear cub was all over the news.

“The next day... it was on every television station. It was a front page of every paper and I turned on the TV and there was like a mile of yellow tape and 20 cop cars, there were helicopters flying, and I was like, ‘Oh my god. What did I do?’” he says in the video.

When The New Yorker’s profile of the long-shot contender for the White House did emerge later on Monday, the anecdote about the bear and its disposal was included along with a picture of RFK Jr, seemingly taken by a friend, posing with his hand in the dead cub’s jaws.

The photo has since gone viral across social media, alongside a swathe of X users sharing their disgust."

In a video shared on his social media Sunday, Kennedy Jr. is shown telling a story to Roseanne Barr about an incident that occurred in 2014. He had noted he was sharing the story because he was contacted by the New Yorker’s fact-checkers who informed him that they were doing a story on the event.

The caption to the three-minute video social media reads, “Looking forward to seeing how you spin this one, @NewYorker….”

Kennedy began his story sharing that at the time he was “taking a group of people falconing up in Goshen, New York, up in the Hudson Valley” and while he was driving, a woman in a van in front of him “hit a bear and killed it. A young bear.”

“So I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van, because I was going to skin the bear,” he said. “And it was very good condition, and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator. And you can do that in New York state — you can get a bear tag for a roadkill bear.”

He continued, “And so then we went hawking and I had the bear in my car. And then we had a really good day, and we went late. We were catching a lot of game, and the people really loved it, so we stayed late. And instead of going back to my home in Westchester, I had to go right to the city, because there was a dinner at Peter Luger’s Steak House. And at the end of the dinner, it went late, and I realized I couldn’t go home — I had to go to the airport. And the bear was in my car, and I didn’t want to leave the bear in the car, because, well, that would have been bad.”

“So then I thought, you know, at that time — this was the little bit of the redneck in me — there’d been a series of bicycle accidents in New York, they had just put in the bike lanes,” Kennedy said. “And some people, a couple of people had gotten killed, and it was every day, and people had been badly injured. Every day, it was in the press. And so I thought — I wasn’t drinking, of course, but people were drinking with me who thought this was a good idea.”

He continued, “I had an old bike in my car that somebody had asked me to get rid of, and I said, ‘Let’s go put the bear in the Central Park, and we’ll make it look like he got hit by a bike’ — it would be fun, funny for people. So everybody thought, ‘That’s a great idea,’ so we went and did that. And we thought it would be amusing for whoever found it or something.”

However, Kennedy recalled the next day “it was on every television station” and on the “front page of every paper.”

“And I turned on the TV and there was like a mile of yellow tape and there were 20 cop cars, there were helicopters flying over it and I was like, ‘Oh my God. What did I do?’ And then there were some people on TV in tie-back suits with gloves on, lifting up the bike, and they were saying they were going to take this up to Albany to get it fingerprinted.”

Barr, who is shown standing listening to the story, smiled and added “uh oh” before Kennedy continued.

“And I was worried, because my prints were all over that bike,” Kennedy said. “And luckily the story died down after a while, and it stayed dead for a decade. And the New Yorker somehow found out about it and they’re going to do a big article on me, and that’s one of the articles. So they asked me, the fact-checkers. It’s going to be a bad story.”

At the end of the video, Kennedy could be seen laughing with Barr and others in the room.

On Monday, Barr addressed being in the video writing on X, “This was not filmed by me or my team. This was off the cuff after the interview. There is no spin here- just a funny story. It’s nice to see RFK finally get some press – Albeit during an economic crash by the Biden Harris administration. Great job journos!”

The bear being found in a Central Park was in fact reported on at the time. In a New York Times article published Oct. 7, 2014 and written by John F. Kennedy’s granddaughter, Tatiana Schlossberg, it was noted that a dead bear cub was found by a woman walking her dog in Central Park and was lying under some bushes, partially concealed by an abandoned bicycle. It was also reported that the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation had announced that necropsy results showed the cause of death was “blunt force injuries consistent with a motor vehicle collision.” However, despite it being concluded how the bear was killed, it was a mystery as to how it ended up in Central Park.

In the New Yorker article, published on Monday, an image from that day in 2014 shows Kennedy grimicing as he puts his fingers inside the bear’s bloody mouth. “Maybe that’s where I got my brain worm,” the feature article’s author, Clare Malone, says Kennedy suggested to her.

Though no other context was given for the reason for Kennedy’s video, the story follows other claims the independent presidential candidate has made, including that a parasitic worm ate part of his brain as well as sharing some other deemed conspiracy theories.

In a July 2 Vanity Fair article, a 2010 photo was unearthed of Kennedy and an unidentified woman posing with the barbecued remains of what resembled a dog. According to Vanity Fair, last year Kennedy texted the picture to a friend who was traveling to Korea, recommending a restaurant there that served canine. Vanity Fair also consulted with a veterinarian, who confirmed that the carcass in the picture did indeed appear to be a dog. Vanity Fair also reported that after the story was published, Kennedy said publicly that the picture is of a goat in Patagonia.

RFK Jr. says he left a dead bear in Central Park as a joke.,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/rfk-jr-says-he-staged-bear-cub-murder-scene-in-central-park,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s quixotic bid for the White House took yet another hit over the weekend, when the independent candidate admitted, in a video that grew exponentially more insane by the second, that he planted a dead bear cub—which he’d originally planned to eat—in Central Park and tried to make it look like the bear had been killed by a bike that had his prints “all over” it.

Speaking to Roseanne Barr (yes), Kennedy explained that in October 2014, he was en route to upstate New York for a day of falconing with friends, when a van in front of him struck and killed the bear. “So I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was going to skin the bear, and it was in very good condition, and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator,” Kennedy said. “And you can do that in New York State. You can get a bear tag for a roadkill bear.”

Unfortunately for Kennedy, who apparently has a taste for bear flesh, the falconing outing ran long and he had dinner plans at Peter Luger Steak House in Brooklyn. That also ran late and, Kennedy told Barr, he needed to head straight to the airport and would not have time to stop by his home in Westchester first. “The bear was in my car, and I didn’t want to leave the bear in the car ’cause that would have been bad,” he said. Which clearly left him with only one thing to do.

Smiling, he told Barr that “there’d been a series of bicycle accidents in New York, they had just put in the bike lanes, and so a couple of people were getting killed and it was every day, people badly injured. Every day it was in the press.” As luck would have it, Kennedy, who was not 10 or 12 at the time, but 60, had “an old bike” in his car “that somebody asked me to get rid of,” and, well, if you have the judgment of a sociopathic frat boy, you can probably guess where this is going. “I said, let’s go put the bear in Central Park and we’ll make it look like it got hit by a bike,” Kennedy said, feeling the need to note that he “wasn’t drinking, of course, but people were drinking with me,” and that his drunk buddies thought the plan was “a good idea.” Kennedy, who should probably have his brain examined (again), added that—while completely sober—he thought the scene would be “amusing for whomever found it.”

In the light of morning, though, panic set in. “The next day it was, like, it was on every television station. It was the front page of every paper, and I turned on the TV and there was, like, a mile of yellow tape and there were 20 cop cars. There were helicopters flying over it,” Kennedy recounted. “And I was like, Oh my God, what did I do? And then there was some people on TV and Tyvek suits with gloves on lifting up the bike, and they’re saying they’re gonna take this up to Albany to get it fingerprinted. And I was worried because my prints were all over that bike.” (In a twist to the weirdest story of all time, Tatiana Schlossberg, one of John F. Kennedy’s granddaughters, wrote a story about the incident for The New York Times.)

Happily for Kennedy—who, we should take a moment to remind people, thinks he should be president—he was never caught. But fast-forward 10 years, and thanks to those busybody reporters at The New Yorker, he was forced to go public. “Luckily the story died after a while, and it stayed dead for a decade, and [then] The New Yorker somehow found out about it,” Kennedy told Barr, saying that fact-checkers at the magazine had called him to confirm the details of Beargate, for a story that was published today. At that point, he decided to get ahead of it, saying he knew it was “going to be a bad story,” which, if you’re keeping track, is the first time Kennedy has demonstrated any judgement whatsoever. (In a caption to the video in which he admits to the whole thing, Kennedy wrote, “Looking forward to seeing how you spin this one, @NewYorker,” which, uh, hello? They don’t have to spin anything? You just admitted to putting a dead bear, which you initially planned to eat, in the park and trying to make it look like it had been hit by a cyclist, and then panicking about “prints” like a serial killer would?)

Anyway, The New Yorker’s story basically confirms what Kennedy himself said, adding: “In a picture from that day, Kennedy is putting his fingers inside the bear’s bloody mouth, a comical grimace across his face.” Asked about the incident, Kennedy told the magazine: “Maybe that’s where I got my brain worm.” Later, on X, he wrote: “The press is often called the ‘fourth estate,’ to emphasize its independence and high purpose. But these days it is in eerie, almost comical lockstep, amplifying trivial stories to damage disfavored political figures. Meanwhile, parents in our country can’t afford groceries. Brothers won’t speak to each other because of partisan loyalties. Small towns sink under addiction and depression. And the world careens toward WW3. Let’s hold our media to a higher standard!”

In fact, one could argue that this story is a pretty important piece of journalism, because it demonstrates that Kennedy (like Trump!) has horrible judgement and should not be allowed within a million feet of the White House, let alone the Central Park Zoo. (As did the ones about the worm, the emu, and animal carcass.)"
RFK Jr. says he left a dead bear in Central Park as a joke.,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/04/politics/rfk-jr-bear-central-park/index.html,"CNN —

Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a social media video on Sunday that he drove a dead bear cub carcass from upstate New York and placed it in New York City’s Central Park 10 years ago, sharing the story in what he said was an effort to combat a forthcoming New Yorker article he predicted will be “a bad story.”

In the video, which was posted to his X account, Kennedy tells actress Roseanne Barr about traveling through New York’s Hudson Valley to go hawking and coming across a “young bear” that had been hit and killed by another driver. He says in the video he decided to put the dead bear in his car.

“I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was gonna skin the bear,” he said. “It was in very good condition and I was gonna put the meat in my refrigerator.”

Kennedy then tells Barr he spent the day hawking before driving to New York City for a dinner — with the bear still in his car. At the end of the dinner, Kennedy said, he had to go to the airport and couldn’t take the bear back to his home. He said he broached to friends the idea of taking the bear to Central Park and making it appear as if a biker had hit it.

“I had an old bike in my car that somebody had asked me to get rid of and I said, ‘Let’s go put the bear in Central Park and we’ll make it look like he got hit by a bike,’” Kennedy says in the video, prompting laughs from Barr and others in the room not visible in the video. “Everybody thought, ‘That’s a great idea.’ So we did that and we thought it would be amusing for whoever found it or something.”

Kennedy said the bear’s discovery appeared on “the front page of every paper,” drawing wide media coverage and prompting investigations from law enforcement, which he said “worried” him because he’d left behind fingerprints. Kennedy suggested he was not blamed for the incident at the time.

“Luckily, the story died down after a while and it stayed dead for a decade. The New Yorker somehow found out about it, and they just — they’re gonna do a big article on me. … So they asked me, the fact checkers,” he said.

Kennedy suggested the upcoming story would portray him in a negative light.

“You know, it’s gonna be a bad story,” he said while laughing.

Some of the details Kennedy describes in the video appear to align with an October 2014 incident in which a dead bear cub was discovered in Central Park, attracting coverage from major news outlets around the country. The woman who discovered the bear told reporters at the time that she found it with its head resting on a bike. The state’s Department of Environmental Conservation said shortly after the bear was discovered that it had died after being hit by a car.

In a caption on the post containing the video, Kennedy wrote, “Looking forward to seeing how you spin this one, @NewYorker.”"

Proverbs 17:12 says “Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.”

It takes a once-in-a-generation political talent — say, third-party presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — to say “Why not both?”

Kennedy has previously made headlines for having a parasitic brainworm, appearing to eat a dog (he said it was a goat but elsewhere admitted to dining on man’s best friend), and having most members of his family call him a threat to the United States. But as you may have heard, either from Kennedy’s confession or the New Yorker profile that prompted it, he also dumped the corpse of a baby bear in Central Park back in 2014. Call it a reverse Teddy Roosevelt.

In a presidential race that has so far featured the wanton murder of a puppy, you may be asking yourself, just how bad is this for Kennedy? Well, to get biblical — and a bit Larry Davidian — it may not exactly spell his death in politics.

To hear Kennedy tell the story — to Mama Barr Roseanne of all people — this is all just a prank gone wrong born out of a singular instance of inconvenience.

Kennedy says he was driving to Goshen to do some falconry — as one does — when a woman in front of him hit and killed the baby black bear. Kennedy pulled over, picked up the bear and popped it in his van with the intent of skinning the animal and refrigerating its meat. (“You can do that in New York City, you can get a bear tag for a roadkill bear,” he said.)

But his plans changed. He couldn’t go straight back home to Westchester because he had dinner at Peter Luger’s, and by the time that was over he had to go to the airport and obviously didn’t want to leave a decaying carcass in his car “because that would have been bad.” Kennedy’s next move, he admits, betrays “a little bit of the redneck in me.” (Kennedy, as Clare Malone’s New Yorker article notes, spent much of his childhood in McClean, Virginia, albeit in a mansion where he cared for an impressive menagerie of animals; hilariously, he wanted to be a veterinarian.)

At the time, Kennedy explained, bike lanes had just been put in for the city, and there were a lot of accidents making the news. Kennedy happened to have an old bike someone asked him to get rid of in his trunk (as one does). He left it and the bear in the park — they were discovered in a bush, not a bike lane — to make it look like a bike rider had hit the bear. Kennedy’s friends, who had been drinking, thought it would be funny. Take that, New York cyclists.

The casual way Kennedy tells this story, with a tray of ribs before him, expecting his audience to relate to this superlatively strange, carrion-centric action, recalls a moment from the Book of Judges where Samson, entertaining his wedding guests, poses the following riddle: “Out of the eater came something to eat, and out of the strong came something sweet.”

This, of course, is a reference to the one time Samson killed a young lion and found bees and honey inside its dead body. A charming anecdote, whether for entertaining guests at one’s nuptials, heads of state or comedians cancelled for racist social media posts!

But beyond the biblical, there is something about Kennedy’s delivery, which makes this bonkers scenario seem somewhat plausible, and even maybe the best and only option available to him, that recalls a connection closer to home.

As reported in The New Yorker and elsewhere, Kennedy met his wife, Cheryl Hines, through her Curb Your Enthusiasm co-star Larry David and had recently married her at the time of the incident. In his video confession, Kennedy explains his terrified reaction when his hijinks made the news, describing scenes of police tape, helicopters over the crime scene and talk of having the bike fingerprinted up in Albany.

Cue the theme and the “directed by Robert B. Weide.”

While Larry David, who does not endorse his old friend RFK Jr., probably isn’t the sort to handle roadkill or take up falconry, the confluence of events that led to a young bear in Central Park feels decidedly Curbian. It has all the hallmarks — inconvenient scheduling, lucking into having a pivotal prop from a B-plot on hand (someone else’s bike), commentary on city planning and a demented act of disrespect that seemed like a good idea at the time. It’s not quite on the level of stealing shoes from a Holocaust museum because it’s raining outside and you disposed of your old kicks after you stepped in dog poop, but it’s not too far a cry either.

Even the decades-in-the-making revelation that a high-profile guy was behind this bizarre behavior feels nearly inseparable from David’s misadventures, not least because of the crazy coincidence that one of the initial articles about the bear was written by Kennedy’s cousin and JFK’s granddaughter Tatiana Schlossberg, who said she had no idea he was responsible.

But then, the real David would almost certainly never do such a thing. He is no Kennedy just as he is no hirsute Samson. At best David might be like the prophet Elisha, who, after children mocked his bald head, seemed to conjure two she-bears to tear them apart.

Elisha and his bears have long been a source of Talmudic debate. It is only right to expect RFK and his bear will generate a similar level of discussion — at least until the next animal-themed exposé.

Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that Kennedy left the bear carcass and bicycle in a bike lane. They were discovered beneath a bush."

WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. once retrieved a bear that was killed by a motorist and left it in New York’s Central Park with a bicycle on top, sparking a mystery that consumed the city a decade ago.

Kennedy describes the incident in a video that was posted to social media Sunday, adding it will be included in a forthcoming New Yorker article that he expects to be damaging.

RFK Jr. says he left a dead bear in Central Park as a joke.,https://kslnewsradio.com/2123117/robert-f-kennedy-jr-bear-carcass-in-central-park/,"NEW YORK — Independent Presidential Candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that he once left a dead bear in New York City’s Central Park. He shared the story with actress Roseanne Barr in a video posted to Instagram.

In the video, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he picked up the bear while he was on his way to go falconing in Goshen, New York.

Tune in to Dave & Dujanovic

“A woman in a van in front of me hit a bear and killed it,” said Kennedy in the video. “So I pulled over and picked up the bear and put it in the back of my van.”

According to the video, Kennedy intended to skin the bear and eat it. However, the animal remained in his car all day while he was falconing.

“We had a really good day and we went late,” said Kennedy. “So we stayed late.”

Due to the delay, Kennedy said that he didn’t have time to stop at his Westchester home. He had to go straight to New York City for dinner. The bear remained in his car as he had dinner at Peter Luger Steakhouse.

At the end of the dinner, Kennedy said he realized that he still couldn’t go home. He had to go to the airport.

“I didn’t want to leave the bear in my car because that would have been bad,” said Kennedy. He began to consider how he could get rid of the bear.

Although he said he had not been consuming alcohol, Kennedy said some of his friends had been.

Bicycle accidents had been getting heavy media coverage at the time, so Kennedy and his friends decided to put the bear in Central Park. They would also dump an old bicycle that was also in Kennedy’s car.

“We’ll make it look like he got hit by a bike,” said Kennedy.

According to Kennedy, the group thought it would be entertaining to the person who found it. The next morning, it was receiving heavy media coverage.

Park users discover the bear

Associated Press reported that two women discovered the bear while walking their dogs. They contacted New York City authorities.

Kennedy said that there was a heavy police presence in the park after the discovery. He worried, as his fingerprints had been on the bike.

The bear was sent to Albany, where a necropsy report revealed that it had been hit by a car. Its arrival in Central Park remained a mystery and the story died down.

Kennedy said that fact-checkers from The New Yorker recently reached out to verify the tale.

Getty Images

The 70-year-old's recent confession about dumping a dead bear in Central Park is just the latest strange twist to a campaign that was already sagging in the polls. Mr Kennedy seems determined to test the proposition that there’s no such thing as bad publicity. In a move to get ahead of a lengthy profile published on Monday in the New Yorker magazine, he released a video where he discusses an accident involving a bear cub a decade ago – and the unlikely series of events that followed. In the video, Mr Kennedy is speaking to actress and comedian Roseanne Barr over a half-eaten meal of takeaway beef ribs. He describes how he watched a nearby car hit and kill a bear cub while on a day trip hunting with a falcon. He said he initially wanted to take the dead animal home and skin it. After his schedule changed, he decided to discard the carcass in New York City’s Central Park – along with an old bicycle, in an effort to make it look like a cycling accident. When someone discovered the bear and the bicycle the next day, it became a headline story in the New York City tabloids and television news programmes.

RFK Jr recounts bear carcass story to Roseanne Barr

Needless to say, the entire episode - which sounds like a youthful practical joke gone wrong, but took place when the candidate was 60 - is odd. The falconry trip. The photograph, published in the New Yorker, of RFK Jr posing with the dead bear. The planned skinning and eating. The animal's final resting place in New York’s famous urban park. Even the video itself with Ms Barr – who has herself been embroiled in more than a few controversies – holding a teacup and nodding along as Mr Kennedy recounted his tale. His explanation, that the decision to pick up the dead bear was his “little bit of redneck” coming out, doesn’t quite fit for the nephew of former President John F Kennedy – a member of an American political dynasty. All this is standard fare for Mr Kennedy, however, whose top news lines during his campaign have veered from scandalous to plain bizarre. In May, the New York Times ran an article revealing he had told lawyers involved in his 2012 divorce proceedings that he was suffering from a memory issue relating to a dead brain parasite. In mid-July, Mr Kennedy texted an apology to a former family nanny after Vanity Fair magazine published a story in which she accused him of unwelcome sexual advances. “I have no memory of this incident but I apologise sincerely for anything I ever did that made you feel uncomfortable,” he wrote. In comments to the media, he said the Vanity Fair article contained a lot of “garbage” but conceded that he had a “very, very rambunctious youth” and that he was “not a church boy”.

There was a point earlier this year when Mr Kennedy – who launched his independent presidential bid after initially running for the Democratic nomination – was averaging around 15% in presidential preference polls. He narrowly missed qualifying for the first presidential debate in late June. Mr Kennedy appeared to be capitalising on voter dissatisfaction with both Donald Trump and Joe Biden. His pitch blended anti-establishment and anti-corporate rhetoric with liberal social positions and a heavy dose of environmentalism and controversial vaccine scepticism. With Mr Biden’s dismal performance during that first debate, the door may have opened for Mr Kennedy to elbow his way into the American political conversation. Instead, he virtually disappeared off the presidential campaign trial. He has spent little on advertising and grassroots organising. His biggest headlines involved the aforementioned brain worms, sex-harassment allegations and bear-cub escapades. Meanwhile, his polling support has dropped to the low single digits. According to Clifford Young, president of Ipsos public affairs, Mr Kennedy’s decline was inevitable, even without all distracting headlines. “He was a protest option,” he said. “There was a lot of indifference when it came to the two candidates. People didn’t like either choice and it was an expression of indifference or disdain.” Now, he says, Democrats and Republicans have consolidated their political support.

Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has revealed a peculiar incident from a decade ago, where he recovered a bear that had been hit by a car and left it in New York's Central Park with a bicycle on top, sparking a city-wide mystery.

Kennedy detailed the event in a video posted to social media on Sunday, hinting that it will feature in an upcoming New Yorker article that he anticipates will be damaging.

This is just the latest strange episode in Kennedy's unconventional campaign, which has caused divisions within his renowned family and raised eyebrows among both Republicans and Democrats over its potential influence on the presidential race. Kennedy has admitted to having a parasite that lodged in his brain and died.

He also refuted claims of eating a dog after a friend shared a photo with Vanity Fair magazine showing Kennedy dramatically preparing to take a bite of a charred animal; Kennedy clarified it was a goat.

In the video, Kennedy narrates the story to actress Roseanne Barr. He explains that he was en route to a falconry outing with friends when a woman driving ahead of him struck and killed a young bear with her vehicle.

He says he placed it in his own vehicle, intending to skin it and consume the meat, but the day got away from him.

Kennedy recounts that he ended up in Manhattan with a bear carcass in his vehicle. After some drinks, his friends came up with the idea to dump it in Central Park as a joke, he explains, clarifying that he himself hadn't been drinking.

They thought it'd be a laugh to stage the scene like the bear had been knocked over by a bike, especially since bike accidents were all over the news at the time.

The dead bear was stumbled upon by two dog walkers who promptly informed the authorities, sparking a city-wide mystery for several days. It's well-known that bears aren't residents of the park's wildlife.

The bicycle was checked for fingerprints and the bear was sent off to Albany for an autopsy, which revealed it probably got hit by a motor, not abused by humans. Still, the question of how the bear got to Central Park puzzled everyone.

""I was worried because my prints were all over that bike,"" Kennedy admits to Barr in the footage."

Here are three revelations from the magazine’s profile on Kennedy:

A New Yorker profile of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., published on Monday disclosed new details about the independent presidential candidate , including the story behind his decision to leave a dead bear cub in Central Park a decade ago and a recent text exchange regarding former president Donald Trump.

The magazine published an image of Kennedy putting his hand in the mouth of the dead bear cub, posing as if the bear was biting his hand.

When asked about the bear incident, he responded with a quip, telling the magazine, “Maybe that’s where I got my brain worm.” Kennedy was referring to a period in 2010 when he suffered from memory loss, which led to the discovery that a worm had entered his brain and died.

Ahead of the story’s publication, RFK Jr. confirmed Sunday in a video posted online that he drove the dead bear cub to New York City’s Central Park around 10 years ago. The New Yorker reported that the incident took place in the fall of 2014, which coincided with media reports of a dead bear cub discovered in the park.

Kennedy recounted taking a trip north of New York City for falconing with a group when he witnessed a woman in a van hit and kill a young bear. He said he loaded the bear carcass into his vehicle with plans to skin it and eat the meat but said the day got away from him.

“I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was going to skin the bear, and it was very good condition,” Kennedy said in the video, talking to comedian Roseanne Barr. “And I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator.”

Eventually, he says, he found himself in Manhattan and realized he needed to remove the dead cub from his vehicle. With bicycle accidents receiving considerable media coverage at the time, Kennedy said, he and his friends thought it would be amusing to stage a scene in Central Park as if the bear had been struck by a bicycle.

The image of Kennedy posing with a dead bear cub echoes another controversial photo, published in July in Vanity Fair. In that picture, Kennedy poses as if ready to eat a barbecued animal carcass alleged to be a dog. The photo was captured in 2010, the same year he was diagnosed with a dead worm in his brain.

Vanity Fair reported that Kennedy sent the image to his friend that they might enjoy a restaurant in Korea that serves dogs, possibly suggesting that he had tried it himself. The publication consulted with a veterinarian who said the carcass in the photo appeared to be a dog. Kennedy refuted the claims that the animal was a dog, saying instead that it was a goat.

In a recent text exchange, RFK Jr. says Trump is ‘a sociopath’

In a recent text exchange reported by The New Yorker, Kennedy described former president Trump as a “terrible human being” and referred to him as the “worst president ever.”

“He is probably a sociopath,” Kennedy said, referring to Trump, in texts to an unidentified recipient, the magazine reported.

Kennedy went on to say said President Biden was “more dangerous to the Republic and the planet” than Trump, according to the magazine.

Prior to last month’s Republican National Convention, where Trump was officially named the GOP presidential nominee, he and Kennedy had a phone call.

A video of the private call posted online by Kennedy’s son revealed Trump seeming to agree with Kennedy’s false claims about vaccines and vaguely pitching Kennedy on endorsing his campaign.

On the call, Trump is heard saying, “A vaccination that is like 38 different vaccines and it looks like it’s meant for a horse, not a, you know, 10-pound or 20-pound baby.”

“And then you see the baby all of a sudden starting to change radically,” Trump added.

Kennedy later apologized after the video was posted online saying that a videographer was taping and he “should have ordered the videographer to stop recording immediately.”

Kennedy’s campaign director said Trump offered RFK Jr. a job

Amaryllis Fox Kennedy, Kennedy’s daughter-in-law and campaign director, told the New Yorker that Trump and his team had asked Kennedy, “Is there something that you want to do?” after the former president suggested the possibility of Kennedy ending his campaign.

Fox Kennedy told the magazine that Kennedy is open to serving in the Trump administration, noting that the possibility of leading the Department of Health and Human Services would be “an incredibly interesting” role.

Fox Kennedy also informed the New Yorker that Kennedy would be open to offers from a Harris administration.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s copping to a viral mystery that once had New Yorkers baffled ... admitting he dumped a dead bear carcass into Central Park and tossed a bike on top of it as a joke.

The independent candidate for president posted a video to his official X account Sunday describing the incident seemingly to get ahead of a story soon to be published by The New Yorker.

In the bizarre video, RFK Jr. is sitting in a dining room explaining he once went to Goshen, New York on a falconing trip and while driving there he claims a woman in front of him hit and killed a bear cub.

Kennedy, not one to waste good bear meat, says he grabbed the cub and tossed it in his car -- an action he says is allowed under New York state law.

After a day of falconing, which went later than expected, Kennedy says he drove to dinner in NYC with friends instead of heading home to Westchester to refrigerate the bear.

The dinner also went long ... and RFK Jr. had a flight to catch -- but, he didn't want to leave the bear inside his car.

Instead of calling someone to come pick up the car with the bear in it, he and his dinner companions thought it would be funny to take the bear and put it in Central Park with an old bicycle on top of it.

At the time, RFK Jr. explained, a series of pedestrians had been hit and killed by bicyclists in the park ... and he and his -- admittedly drunken -- companions thought whoever found the bear would find it amusing.

Of course, they didn't -- and, authorities, including the NYPD's Animal Cruelty Investigation Squad, rushed to Central Park to investigate ... ultimately though the investigation lost steam, and Kennedy says no one ever contacted him until the New Yorker researchers put two and two together.

Mr Kennedy said in the video that he was driving to the Hudson Valley in New York state when a woman in a van in front of him hit a young bear and killed it.

He put the bear's body into the back of his car because he was going to skin the bear and store its meat at his house, he said.

But after a late dinner in New York City at the Peter Luger Steak House, he had to go straight to the airport and did not want to leave the bear in his vehicle.

“I had an old bike in my car that somebody asked me to get rid of. I said, 'Let's go put the bear in Central Park and we'll make it look like he got hit by a bike’,” he said and then laughed, saying it would be “amusing” for whoever found it.

The Kennedy campaign did not immediately comment further on the incident.

In October 2014, the body of a black bear cub was found in the bushes of Central Park and police launched a criminal investigation into the death.

Foul play was suspected in the case, Reuters reported at the time, and state wildlife officials later concluded it was likely struck and killed by a vehicle.

Mr Kennedy said in the video that the New Yorker had asked him about the incident and was planning on doing a “big article” about him.

The New Yorker did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

The video, which runs a little over 3 minutes, appears to show Barr and Kennedy discussing the story over breakfast in a spacious kitchen.

“A woman in a van in front of me hit a bear and killed it — a young bear,” Kennedy recalled. “So, I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was going to skin the bear, and it was in very good condition, and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator.

Kennedy said he had an idea that involved an “old bike in my car that somebody asked me to get rid of.”

“I said, ‘Let’s go put the bear in Central Park and we’ll make it look like he got hit by a bike,'” Kennedy said in the video. He insisted that he hadn’t been drinking at the time, but the people he was with were drinking and thought it was a “great idea.”

“The next day, it was, like, it was on every television station. It was the front page of every paper and I turned on the TV and there was like a mile of yellow tape and there were 20 cop cars, there were helicopters flying over it.

Kennedy noted that “the story died down after a while” until the New Yorker recently reached out to him to verify details about the bear incident.

Variety has reached out to representatives from the New Yorker for comment.

Kennedy’s decision to release a video conversation with Barr will also raise eyebrows. Barr, the outspoken blue-collar comedian who starred in the hit 1980s and ’90s sitcom “Roseanne,” has been on the fringe of entertainment in recent years. In 2018, Barr’s comeback with a revival of “Roseanne” on ABC was cut short when she made a racist statement on Twitter about former Obama White House advisor Valerie Jarrett."

Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appeared to fess up to being one of the culprits who dumped a dead bear cub in Central Park a decade ago — after abandoning a plan to skin it.

Seemingly trying to preempt a forthcoming story from the New Yorker magazine, Kennedy, 70, bizarrely recounted in a video posted to social media how some of his buddies were drinking and thought it would be a good idea to dump the dead bear in the park and “make it look like he got hit by a bike.”

The Kennedy scion insisted that he wasn’t drinking when he opted to put an “old bike in his car” — which someone had asked him to throw away — next to the deceased animal.

There had been a spate of local biking accidents that were making headlines at the time.

“Everybody thought that’s a great idea. So we went and did that and thought it would be amusing for whoever found it,” Kennedy recounted in a video posted on X that featured sitcom actress Roseanne Barr.

A media frenzy quickly ensued in 2014 after a woman discovered the dead bear under some bushes and concealed in part by a bike.

The bear was described in reports at the time as a cub, though Kennedy simply called it “a young bear.”

“I turned on the TV and there was like a mile of yellow tape, and there were 20 cop cars. There were like helicopters flying over it. And I was like, ‘Oh, my God, what did I do?'” he said.

“I was worried because my [finger]prints were all over that bike. Luckily the story died after a while.”

Locals were puzzled by the sudden appearance of the dead bear at the time and many people were horrified.

Kennedy claimed in the video that he stumbled upon the dead bear while trekking through New York state for a falconing trip in Goshen, New York.

During his ride up there in the wee hours of the morning, Kennedy claims that a woman in front of him hit a bear with her vehicle and killed it.

“So I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was going to skin the bear and it was very good condition and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator,” he recalled.

The environmental lawyer explained that he planned to obtain a bear tag for a road kill bear and put the meat in his refrigerator later. But the falconing trip ran late.

He then had to dash over to New York City instead of heading back to his home in Westchester County due to a dinner that he needed to attend. At that point, he realized he needed to go to the airport, but had the dead bear in his car.

All of this prompted his decision to dump the dead bear in Central Park.

“This was the little bit of the redneck in me,” Kennedy quipped.

Kennedy predicted that the forthcoming reporting about his handling of the dead bear would be negative.

CENTRAL PARK (WABC) -- A nearly-decade-old New York City mystery may have been solved.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claims it was he who dumped the carcass of a bear cub in Central Park in 2014.

WATCH | Eyewitness News coverage of dead bear cub found in Central Park (2014)

The next day, it was on every television station and it was the front page of every paper - after all, dead bears don't just turn up in Central Park.

On Sunday, almost 10 years after that October day in 2014... RFK Jr. is offering an answer.

The independent candidate posted a video to X tonight explaining that on a 'falconing trip' to Goshen in the Hudson Valley, 'a woman in a van in front of me hit a bear and killed it. A young bear.'

He goes on to confess to a speechless and incredulous-looking Roseanne Barr that he scooped up the roadkill and put it in his truck, hoping to skin it.

""And I was gonna put the meat in my refrigerator. And you can do that in New York State. You can get a bear tag for a roadkill bear,"" he added.

However, time got away from him that day. After dinner back in the city with friends went late, he tells Barr, he realized it the carcass might start to go bad, so of course he and his pals looked for the next best thing to do with it in the city - and that was to stage an accident.

""I had an old bike in my car that someone had asked me to get rid of, and I said let's put the bear in Central Park and make it look like he got hit by a bike.""

Sure enough, somebody found the bear and bike in the morning and described it to Eyewitness News.

""We looked closer we saw something under the back wheel, it could have been a raccoon, I didn't know what it was, but then I thought it was the head of a big dog, that was obviously dead,"" said the witness.

Police were dusting that bicycle for fingerprints. Neither police nor a state lab would make a connection to Kennedy or anyone else and the case went cold.

So why come clean about it now? Perhaps one of his friends let the cat- or bear- out of the bag.

""The New Yorker found out about it and they're going to do a big article on me,"" Kennedy said.

Much like he claims he scooped that bear, he now claims he wanted to scoop the magazine by posting that recent conversation publicly to acknowledge he does in fact bear responsibility for the incident. His campaign tells ABC News that he is not worried about any legal ramifications.

Eyewitness News has reached out to the NYPD to ask if there might be any. The Parks Department is also deferring any questions about the incident to the NYPD.

In the video, RFK and Barr are situated around a dinner table in a home, as the independent candidate tells his story. He explains that he's trying to get ahead of a story The New Yorker is working on.

RFK says he was taking a group of people falconing in Goshen, New York, about a two-hour drive north of New York City.

RFK tells Barr he was on his way there when a woman in a van in front of him hit a young bear and killed it.

RFK says he continued hawking with his group of acquaintances and ended up staying late. Instead of going home, RFK says he had a dinner obligation in New York City.

RFK then admits, without elaborating, that he had to go the airport after dinner and couldn’t go home.

RFK tells Barr he had had an old bike in his car and came up with the idea to put the bear in Central Park and ""make it look like he got hit by a bike.""

""So, everybody thought, ‘That’s a great idea.’ So, we went and did that,"" RFK says, clarifying that he hadn’t been drinking, unlike his acquaintances. ""And we thought it would be amusing for whoever found it.""

The prank apparently got noticed the next day. According to RFK, ""It was on every television station. It was on the front page of every paper.""

""I turned on the TV and there was a mile of yellow tape. And there were 20 cop cars. There were helicopters flying over it. And I was like, ‘Oh my God. What did I do?'"" RFK says, noting that his prints ""were all over that bike.""

""Luckily the story died after awhile and it stayed dead for a decade,"" RFK says.

The presidential candidate tells Barr that The New Yorker had ""somehow found out about"" the incident and is planning to publish an article.

""It’s going to be a bad story,"" RFK says in the video, eliciting laughter from Barr and others in the room.

Though Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has not been considered a frontrunner in the upcoming presidential race, he's made headlines for a variety of reasons. For starters, he's claimed that a worm devoured part of his brain, resulting in some pretty significant memory loss (that he also claims to have recovered from). Now, there's news that he was the person who left a dead bear in the middle of Central Park a decade ago.

The politician claims that he initially planned to skin and eat the bear, though instead dumped it in the middle of the New York City park when he realized he would otherwise be late for his flight and didn't want to leave the bear in his car while he was gone. This confession was shared in a conversation with controversial comedian and actress Roseanne Barr, who had conducted an interview with the presidential candidate. But are the pair friends?

Are Roseanne Barr and RFK Jr. friends?

Despite Roseanne's sometimes odd political views and frequent posts of various political conspiracy theories, it doesn't seem that she has any personal connection to RFK Jr., despite the single interview they did together. It's not entirely clear what the initial interview was — it seems that it's long been buried by the shocking news about the bear incident.

In a tweet responding to the news going viral, Roseanne clarified that the comment wasn't something that was planned. ""This was not filmed by me or my team. This was off the cuff after the interview,"" she said. ""There is no spin here- just a funny story. It’s nice to see RFK finally get some press."" In the video, viewers can see Roseanne get increasingly uncomfortable as RFK Jr. continues his story — and her ex-husband, Tom Arnold, points this out in a tweet of his own.

RFK Jr. says he left a dead bear in Central Park as a joke.,https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/08/04/robert-f-kennedy-jr-dumped-dead-bear-cub-central-park/,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. once left a road-killed bear cub in Central Park because his falconing expedition encroached on his airport-arrival time, he revealed in a video released Sunday.

“Looking forward to seeing how you spin this one, @NewYorker,” he captioned the three-minute clip of him regaling Donald Trump-supporting comedian Roseanne Barr with the tale of a roadkill supper gone awry. The magazine is about to publish a profile of the independent presidential hopeful.

It all happened about 10 years ago, he said, detailing the uncompleted exploit in a kitchen as the view panned between him and Barr, and chortling could be heard off-camera. He was supposed to meet friends for a falconing expedition in Goshen, N.Y., when a woman driving a van in front of him “hit a bear and killed it,” he said. “A young bear.”

RFK Jr. sprang into action, without detailing the condition of the woman or her vehicle.

“So I pulled over and picked up the bear and put it in the back of my van, because I was gonna skin the bear, because it was in very good condition, and I was gonna put the meat in my refrigerator,” he said to a nodding Barr. “You can do that in New York State, you can get a bear tag for a roadkill bear.”

He then proceeded to go hawking, bear in car, catching a lot of game and having a much better day than said bear, he said. The partying went late, and instead of going home to Westchester County he realized he’d have to head straight to a dinner at Peter Luger in NYC, apparently swapping beef for bear.

That party, too, went late, forcing him to head straight to the airport.

“And the bear was in my car, and I didn’t want to leave the bear in my car,” he said.

Blaming “the little bit of the redneck in me,” he sketched his plan, which his drunk friends convinced him was a great idea.

“There had been a series of bicycle accidents in New York,” he said, with people badly injured. “And I said, ‘Look, I’ve got an old bike in my car that somebody asked me to get rid of. I said, ‘Let’s go put the bear in Central Park, and we’ll make it look like he got hit by a bike. So we went and did that, and we thought it would be amusing for whoever found it or something.”

The next day, he said, every television station and newspaper were leading with the mysterious story, and there was “like a mile of yellow tape, and there were 20 cop cars,” he said, as Barr’s jaw dropped. “There were helicopters flying over it.”"

(AP) — Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. once retrieved a bear that was killed by a motorist and left it in New York’s Central Park with a bicycle on top, sparking a mystery that consumed the city a decade ago.

Kennedy described the 2014 incident in a video that was posted to social media Sunday, adding it would be included in a New Yorker article that he expected to be damaging.

The article was published Monday and included a photo of Kennedy with his fingers in the bear’s bloodied mouth, a mock grimace on his face. His left pant leg appears to have a bloodstain on it.

It’s the latest bizarre incident in Kennedy’s quixotic campaign that has divided his famous family and left Republicans and Democrats alike concerned about his potential impact on the presidential contest. Kennedy has acknowledged a parasite that lodged in his brain and died. He denied eating a dog after a friend shared a photo with Vanity Fair magazine showing Kennedy dramatically preparing to take a bite of a charred animal; Kennedy said it was a goat.

In the video, Kennedy recounts the story to actress Roseanne Barr. He says he was heading to a falconry excursion with friends when a woman driving ahead of him hit and killed the young bear with her vehicle. He says he put it in his own vehicle, intending to skin it and eat the meat, but the day got away from him.

Eventually, he says, he was in Manhattan and needed to get the bear carcass out of his vehicle. His friends, fueled by alcohol, concocted the Central Park plan as a prank, he said, adding he was not drunk himself. At the time, bicycle accidents were getting significant media attention, so Kennedy and his friends thought it would be funny to make it look like the bear was hit by a bicycle.

Two women walking their dogs found the dead bear and alerted authorities, touching off a mystery that captivated the city for a few days. Bears are not among the park’s known wildlife population.

The bike was dusted for prints and the animal sent to Albany for a necropsy, which determined the bear was likely hit by a vehicle and was not a victim of animal cruelty. But how the bear ended up in Central Park remained a mystery.

“I was worried because my prints were all over that bike,” Kennedy tells Barr in the video.

Kennedy declined to speak to reporters Monday in Albany, New York, where he was attending a civil trial related to his efforts to get on the ballot in that state. A group trying to exclude him from New York’s ballot filed a lawsuit claiming Kennedy lied on nomination papers about where he lives.

New York’s Department of Environmental Conservation, which enforces laws regarding wildlife, said in a statement Monday that it closed its investigation after a forensic analysis concluded that the cub died from injuries consistent with a high-speed collision.

Possessing a bear without a tag or permit, or illegally disposing of a dead bear, are offenses punishable by fines of up to $250 in New York, but the department said charges cannot be brought for violations that occurred more than a year ago.

RFK Jr. says he left a dead bear in Central Park as a joke.,https://dailycaller.com/2024/08/05/rfk-jr-dead-bear-cub-central-park/,"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. answered a nearly decade-old question Thursday about who left a dead bear cub in Central Park.

In October 2014, a dead bear cub was left underneath an old bicycle in Central Park in New York City, according to CBS News. Kennedy confessed Thursday that he left behind the cub after a New Yorker Magazine fact checker called to verify the information for an upcoming story, the outlet reported.

In a video shared on X, formerly Twitter, Kennedy recounted the incident with the caption, “Looking forward to seeing how you spin this one, @NewYorker…”

Kennedy said he was driving on his way to go falconing when a woman in a van in front of his struck and killed the bear. (RELATED: RFK Jr. Apologizes For Leaked Trump Phone Call).

“So, I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was going to skin the bear, and it was in very good condition, and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator,” Kennedy said. “And you can do that in New York state. You can get a bear tag for roadkill bear.”

The deceased bear remained in his car as he went about his day with friends. After falconing, Kennedy returned to New York City for a dinner reservation that ran late. Kennedy realized he didn’t have the time to make it to his home in Westchester as he was due to catch a flight at the airport.

Kennedy said he “didn’t want to leave the bear in the car because that would have been bad.”

He noted how, at the time of the incident, there were numerous reports of bike accidents, and he had an old bicycle in his car “that somebody asked [him] to get rid of.”

“I said let’s go put the bear in Central Park and we’ll make it look like it got hit by a bike,” Kennedy stated.

Looking forward to seeing how you spin this one, @NewYorker… pic.twitter.com/G13taEGzba — Robert F. Kennedy Jr (@RobertKennedyJr) August 4, 2024

Kennedy explained he was shocked at how much media attention the bear incident received.

“And I was like, ‘Oh my God, what did I do?’ And then they were, there was some people on TV and Tyvek suits with gloves on lifting up the bike and they’re saying they’re gonna take this up to Albany to get it fingerprinted,” he said. “And I was worried because my prints were all over that bike.”

Kennedy said he expects the New Yorker article, which has not yet been released as of Thursday night, to be a “bad story.”"

RFK Jr. says he left a dead bear in Central Park as a joke.,https://www.thewrap.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-dead-bear-cub-central-park/,"In a bizarre story shared by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on social media, he explained how he took a dead bear cub and dumped it in Central Park as a prank aimed at getting people to believe a bicycle had hit it and caused the animal’s death. He said that he was sharing the 2014 story because the New Yorker’s fact-checkers called him and indicated they were doing a story on the event.

The three-minute video’s social media caption reads, “Looking forward to seeing how you spin this one, @NewYorker…” It’s unclear what there would be to spin about the story that the independent presidential candidate tells, but watch the New Yorker for more.

Sitting at a kitchen table, he laid the story out for actress and comedian Roseanne Barr, who he was hanging out with for some reason.

“I was taking a group of people falconing up in Goshen, New York, up in the Hudson Valley, and I was supposed to meet them there at like maybe 8 or 9,” Kennedy began. “I was driving up maybe, you know, really early, like 7, and then a woman in a van in front of me hit a bear and killed it. A young bear.”

Looking forward to seeing how you spin this one, @NewYorker… pic.twitter.com/G13taEGzba — Robert F. Kennedy Jr (@RobertKennedyJr) August 4, 2024

“So I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van, because I was going to skin the bear,” Kennedy said. “And it was very good condition, and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator. And you can do that in New York state — you can get a bear tag for a roadkill bear.”

The politician and activist continued his strange tale, adding, “And so then we went hawking and I had the bear in my car. And then we had a really good day, and we went late. We were catching a lot of game, and the people really loved it, so we stayed late. And instead of going back to my home in Westchester, I had to go right to the city, because there was a dinner at Peter Luger’s Steak House.”

“And at the end of the dinner, it went late, and I realized I couldn’t go home — I had to go to the airport.” That’s when he had a realization: “And the bear was in my car, and I didn’t want to leave the bear in the car, because, well, that would have been bad.”

Barr agrees at this point. Kennedy clearly had the good sense to not leave a dead bear in his car for a prolonged period of time while he traveled.

“So then I thought, you know, at that time — this was the little bit of the redneck in me. There’d been a series of bicycle accidents in New York, they had just put in the bike lanes,” Kennedy ominously continued .”And some people, a couple of people had gotten killed, and it was every day, and people had been badly injured. Every day, it was in the press.”

“And so I thought — I wasn’t drinking, of course, but people were drinking with me who thought this was a good idea,” he continued. Kennedy has long been sober after overcoming a 14-year heroin addiction when he was young, but apparently still thought it was a great idea to take advice from people drinking around him. “And I said, I had an old bike in my car that somebody had asked me to get rid of, and I said, ‘Let’s go put the bear in the Central Park, and we’ll make it look like he got hit by a bike’ — it would be fun, funny for people.”

“So everybody thought, ‘That’s a great idea,’ so we went and did that,” Kennedy said, continuing his description of the kind of idea that people think is genius while they’re drunk. “And we thought it would be amusing for whoever found it or something.”

“The next day, it was like, it was on every television station. It was the front page of every paper,” Kennedy added. Oops. “And I turned on the TV and there was like a mile of yellow tape and there were 20 cop cars, there were helicopters flying over it and I was like, oh my God. What did I do?”

“And then there were some people on TV in tie-back suits with gloves on, lifting up the bike, and they were saying they were going to take this up to Albany to get it fingerprinted.”

A smiling Barr added, “uh oh” and chuckled as he continued.

“And I was worried, because my prints were all over that bike,” Kennedy said. He did not say whether or not he ever came forward to authorities, but the implication was that he did not.

“And luckily the story died down after a while, and it stayed dead for a decade,” Kennedy added. “And the New Yorker somehow found out about it and they’re going to do a big article on me, and that’s one of the articles. So they asked me, the fact-checkers… and, you know, it’s going to be a bad story.”

It was unclear from his tone if he meant that the story would be bad journalistically, bad for Kennedy or something else.

The clip concludes as Barr delivers another “uh oh” and laughs again as someone in the background notes, “I think it’s a great story, personally.” The video then closes with an iris out film effect, narrowing down like the end of a “Looney Tunes” cartoon. Which feels vaguely appropriate for the grim yet cartoonish story.

He was correct that it was widely covered when it happened, including on CNN. You can watch the network’s anchors noting that authorities had figured out that someone had brought the dead bear and left it there, as there had been no bears in the park “for a long, long time. It seems as if someone brought the thing there, which is really sad.”

While polling in the low double digits behind former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden, Kennedy’s poll numbers have collapsed since Biden dropped out of the race, with the member of the famed political clan seeming to have little chance of making a significant impact on the 2024 presidential race."
RFK Jr. says he left a dead bear in Central Park as a joke.,https://www.today.com/news/rfk-bear-cub-central-park-controversy-rcna165197,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is raising eyebrows after saying in a video he once left a dead bear cub in New York City’s Central Park.

In a video posted Aug. 4 on Kennedy’s official X account, the 70-year-old independent presidential candidate tells comedian Roseanne Barr that he and his friends left the dead cub’s corpse in the park because they thought it would be “amusing.”

Read on to learn about Kennedy said about the dead bear he left in Central Park, and why he publicly shared the news. NBC News reached out to Kennedy’s campaign on Aug. 4 and did not hear back.

How did Robert F. Kennedy end up with a bear cub?

In his video, Kennedy says he was in Goshen, New York, about an hour and a half outside of New York, to take a group of people falconing.

Early that day, he watched a van in front of him strike and kill a baby bear while he was driving near

“So I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was going to skin the bear, and it was very good condition,” Kennedy says in the video. “I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator.”

With the bear in the back of his car, Kennedy went hawking. “We had a really good day so we stayed late,” he says in the video.

As a result, was running behind schedule and, instead of stopping at his house in Westchester, had to go directly to dinner at Peter Luger’s Steakhouse in Brooklyn.

How did the bear end up in Central Park?

When the dinner also ran late, the younger Kennedy says he decided not to return to his home. Instead, he planned to drive to an airport to catch a pre-scheduled flight.

“I didn’t want to leave the bear in the car because that would have been bad,” he tells Barr.

Kennedy then schemed up a plan to discard the cub’s body after remembering “a series of bicycle accidents” that had happened in New York City at that time.

“I wasn’t drinking, of course, but people were drinking with me who thought this was a good idea. And I said I had an old bike in my car that somebody asked me to get rid of. I said, ‘Let’s go put the bear in Central Park, and we’ll make it look like he got hit by a bike,’” Kennedy says, prompting Barr and others in the room, not seen on camera, to laugh.

“Everybody thought, ‘That’s a great idea!’” he says.

“We thought it would be amusing for whoever found it or something,” he adds.

Kennedy says he was worried when officials launched an investigation about the crime scene, “because my prints were all over that bike.”

The discovery of the dead cub in Central Park was reported in the media in 2014

NBC affiliate WNBC in New York reported in October 2014 that a dead black bear cub was found in Central Park.

Other New York-based media, including The New York Times, also reported about the incident. The Times specified that the cub, whose mouth was splattered with blood, was a three-foot-long female, likely born the same year.

“This is a highly unusual situation,” Elizabeth Kaledin, a spokeswoman for the Central Park Conservancy, told The Times. “It’s awful.”

Kennedy decide to go public with the bear story after getting a call from the New Yorker

Kennedy, who married former “Curb Your Enthusiasm” star Cheryl Hines earlier that year in 2014, then tells Barr that the incident initially received media attention but “the story died after a while” and “stayed dead for a decade.”

That is, until The New Yorker “found out about it” and decided to report about it, he says. The publication, says Kennedy, had fact checkers reach out to him asking him to confirm he was the person who left the dead cub in the park.

“It’s going to be a bad story,” Kennedy predicts in the video as people laugh.

Kennedy captioned his video, “Looking forward to seeing how you spin this one, @NewYorker.”

A day later, The New Yorker shared details in an Aug. 5 news story about how Kennedy and his friends dumped a black bear cub’s “carcass” in Central Park in 2014.

The publication also published a photo of Kennedy jokingly placing his hand in the dead cub’s mouth and grimacing.

According to The New Yorker report, the dead cub was discovered the next day in the park by two women walking their dogs. The New York Police Department subsequently launched an investigation.

Kennedy responded to the article on X.

“The press is often called the ‘fourth estate,’ to emphasize its independence and high purpose,” he wrote. “But these days it is in eerie, almost comical lockstep, amplifying trivial stories to damage disfavored political figures.”

“Meanwhile, parents in our country can’t afford groceries,” he added. “Brothers won’t speak to each other because of partisan loyalties. Small towns sink under addiction and depression. And the world careens toward WW3. Let’s hold our media to a higher standard!”"

RFK Jr. says he left a dead bear in Central Park as a joke.,https://www.mediaite.com/news/watch-rfk-jr-admits-he-was-behind-infamous-dead-bear-incident-in-central-park/,"A recent video from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. answers the question to how a six-month-old female bear cub was found dead in New York City’s Central Park almost a decade ago.

The independent presidential candidate admitted he was responsible for staging the scene of a dead cub in the massive park after he found the bear on the road, and says in the video he saw a woman hit the animal with her van.

RFK Jr. admitted he only came out with the truth now, a decade later, because a New Yorker reporter was preparing to publish an article on his involvement.

In a video, which he posted on X, Kennedy notes he found the dead cub while out falconing one morning.

“So, I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was going to skin the bear, and it was in very good condition, and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator,” Kennedy claimed. “And you can do that in New York state. You can get a bear tag for roadkill bear.”

However, Kennedy then revealed he continued falconing longer than expected before going to dinner at steak house in the city. The dinner ended late and Kennedy realized he had to catch a flight and would not be able to make it home to drop off the dead bear.

“And the bear was in my car, and I didn’t want to leave the bear in the car because that would have been bad,” he continued. “So, then I thought you know at that time this was the little bit of the redneck me. There’d been a series of bicycle accidents in New York they had just put in the bike lanes and so a couple of people were getting killed and it was every day and people badly injured every day it was in the press.”

Kennedy also had an old bike in his car and thought it would be a good idea to plan the bike next to the bear’s body.

“I said let’s go put the bear in Central Park and we’ll make it look like it got hit by a bike,” he added. However, the hailstorm of media coverage that soon followed after the bear was discovered was not something Kennedy expected.

He concluded “The next day, it was like it was on every television station. It was the front page of every paper and I turned on the TV and there was like a mile of yellow tape and there were 20 cop cars, there were helicopters flying over it. And I was like, ‘Oh my God, what did I do?’ And then they were, there was some people on TV and Tyvek suits with gloves on lifting up the bike and they’re saying they’re gonna take this up to Albany to get it fingerprinted…And I was worried because my prints were all over that bike.”

At the time, the story made national news with CNN covering it back in 2014.

RFK Jr. says he left a dead bear in Central Park as a joke.,https://borneobulletin.com.bn/robert-f-kennedy-jr-left-dead-bear-in-central-park-as-prank/,"WILMINGTON (AP) – Independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr once retrieved a bear that was killed by a motorist and left it in New York’s Central Park with a bicycle on top, sparking a mystery that consumed the city a decade ago.

Kennedy described the incident in a video that was posted to social media on Sunday, adding it will be included in a forthcoming New Yorker article that he expects to be damaging.

It’s the latest bizarre incident in Kennedy’s quixotic campaign that has divided his famous family and left Republicans and Democrats alike concerned about his potential impact on the presidential contest. Kennedy has acknowledged a parasite that lodged in his brain and died. He denied eating a dog after a friend shared a photo with Vanity Fair magazine showing Kennedy dramatically preparing to take a bite of a charred animal; Kennedy said it was a goat.

In the video, Kennedy recounted the story to actress Roseanne Barr. He said he was heading to a falconry excursion with friends when a woman driving ahead of him hit and killed the young bear with her vehicle. He said he put it in his own vehicle, intending to skin it and eat the meat, but the day got away from him.

Eventually, he said, he was in Manhattan and needed to get the bear carcass out of his vehicle. His friends, fuelled by alcohol, concocted the Central Park plan as a prank, he said, adding he was not drunk himself. At the time, bicycle accidents were getting significant media attention, so Kennedy and his friends thought it would be funny to make it look like the bear was hit by a bicycle."

RFK Jr. says he left a dead bear in Central Park as a joke.,https://www.yahoo.com/news/rfk-jr-says-planned-skin-010505995.html,"RFK Jr. says he planned to skin a dead bear cub after it was hit by a van but later dumped it in Central Park

Robert Kennedy Jr. said he dumped a dead bear cub in Central Park a decade ago.

Kennedy said he picked up the roadkill after it was hit by a van and planned to skin it.

The incident became national news after a woman found the bear.

Presidential candidate Robert Kennedy Jr. once claimed that parasitic worms may have eaten his brain — and yet something even weirder regarding his past has come to light.

In a video posted to X on Sunday, Kennedy said that ten years ago, he picked up a dead bear cub from the road with the intention of skinning it and storing the meat in his fridge.

In New York, hunters are allowed to take one bear a year as long as it is appropriately reported to authorities and tagged — though residents are not allowed to intentionally kill a bear cub.

""I was driving up really early, and a woman in a van in front of me hit the bear and killed it, a young bear. So I pulled over, and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van,"" Kennedy said to actress Roseanne Barr in a video on X.

Kennedy later realized, after driving around with the bear in his trunk for hours, that he had to go to the airport.

""I didn't want to leave the bear in the car because that would have been bad,"" he said in the video.

He then said his friends, who had been drinking, encouraged him to abandon the carcass in Central Park in New York. Kennedy said he was sober but decided to go along with the plan.

To dispose of the carcass, Kennedy said he intentionally left the dead bear on the side of the road to make it appear like a car had hit the bear. Kennedy said he had also left a bicycle near the bear.

""We thought it would be amusing for whoever found it,"" Kennedy said.

Kennedy said that he believed the story would go away, but instead, it became national news after a woman walking her dog discovered the animal. ""Luckily, the story died after a while, and it stayed dead for a decade,"" he said.

A 2014 New York Times story appears to detail the incident though the exact timeline is unclear. Per the Times, a woman ""noticed the dead bear cub, which was lying under some bushes, partially concealed by an abandoned bicycle.""

Ironically, the author of the Times story, Tatiana Schlossberg, is John F. Kennedy's granddaughter. This makes Schlossberg and Kennedy, JFK's nephew, cousins.

Kennedy said he chose to reveal that he and his friends were behind the dumping to get ahead of a New Yorker story detailing the incident.

""The New Yorker somehow found out about it, and they're gonna do a big article on me, and that's one of the articles. So they asked me, the fact-checkers. It's gonna be a bad story,"" Kennedy said before he and Barr burst into laughter.

This isn't Kennedy's first controversy related to a dead animal carcass. The independent presidential candidate recently fought off claims that he barbecued and ate a dog.

A representative for Kennedy's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

RFK Jr. says he left a dead bear in Central Park as a joke.,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13668025/robert-kennedy-jr-dead-bear-central-park.html,"Robert Kennedy Jr. has finally admitted he was involved in the shocking discovery of a bear found dead in Central Park a decade ago.

The bear was found in the New York park in October 2014 by a dog walker who then notified a Central Park Conservancy worker who contacted police.

An investigation by the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) concluded that the six-month-old bear was run over and killed by a vehicle, but they could not figure out how it ended up in the park.

In a video with comedian Roseanne Barr, Kennedy now claims he was there when the bear died and said he was responsible for it being located in Central Park.

'A woman in the van in front of me hit a bear and killed it, a young bear,' he recalled. 'So I pulled over, and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was going to skin the bear, and it was in very good condition, and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator.

'You can do that in New York state. You can get a bear tag for roadkill bear,' he said.

The 70-year-old presidential candidate said he then proceeded to go hawking with the dead bear in his car.

He said they were catching a lot of game and stayed late, so instead of heading home to Westchester, NY he had to go straight to New York City for a dinner.

But then the dinner also went late, and according to Kennedy, he needed to go to the airport instead of his home.

'The bear was in my car, and I didn't want to leave the bear in the car because that would have been bad,' Kennedy said.

Kennedy said there was 'a little bit of the redneck in me' when he explained there had been a series of bicycle accidents in the city and multiple people had gotten killed or badly injured.

Kennedy recalled it was in the press every day and that he also had an old bike in his car someone asked him to get rid of.

'I said let's go put the bear in Central Park, and we'll make it look like it got hit by a bike,' Kennedy said as he and Barr laughed. 'So everybody thought that's a great idea.'

Kennedy said he had not been drinking when the decision was made but others had been.

It appeared Kennedy was attempting to the story now because he is trying to get ahead of an article by the New Yorker.

When he posted the video of him telling the story he used the caption tagging the New Yorker: 'Looking forward to seeing how you spin this one.'

DailyMail.com reached out to the Kennedy campaign for comment.

Kennedy said in his video that the next day after leaving the dead bear in the park, it was on every television station and in every paper.

'I turned on the TV and it was like, mile of yellow tape, and there were 20 cop cars. There were helicopters flying over it,' Kennedy said. 'I was like ""oh my god. What did I do?""'

Kennedy said he was worried because his prints were all over the bike. But Kennedy said the story died after a while and 'it stayed dead for a decade.'

He said the New Yorker somehow found out about it and were going to do a big article on him.

'It's going to be a bad article,' Kennedy said.

At the time, the DEC was investigating potential law violations. If caught, a person could face charges including illegal possession to disposing of an untagged bear."
RFK Jr. says he left a dead bear in Central Park as a joke.,https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/rfk-jr-says-he-placed-a-dead-bear-cub-in-central-park-10-years-ago-1.6989210,"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a social media video on Sunday that he drove a dead bear cub carcass from upstate New York and placed it in New York City’s Central Park 10 years ago, sharing the story in what he said was an effort to combat a forthcoming New Yorker article he predicted will be “a bad story.”

In the video, which was posted to his X account, Kennedy tells actress Roseanne Barr about traveling through New York’s Hudson Valley to go hawking and coming across a “young bear” that had been hit and killed by another driver. He says in the video he decided to put the dead bear in his car.

“I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was gonna skin the bear,” he said. “It was in very good condition and I was gonna put the meat in my refrigerator.”

Kennedy then tells Barr he spent the day hawking before driving to New York City for a dinner — with the bear still in his car. At the end of the dinner, Kennedy said, he had to go to the airport and couldn’t take the bear back to his home. He said he broached to friends the idea of taking the bear to Central Park and making it appear as if a biker had hit it.

“I had an old bike in my car that somebody had asked me to get rid of and I said, ‘Let’s go put the bear in Central Park and we’ll make it look like he got hit by a bike,’” Kennedy says in the video, prompting laughs from Barr and others in the room not visible in the video. “Everybody thought, ‘That’s a great idea.’ So we did that and we thought it would be amusing for whoever found it or something.”

Kennedy said the bear’s discovery appeared on “the front page of every paper,” drawing wide media coverage and prompting investigations from law enforcement, which he said “worried” him because he’d left behind fingerprints. Kennedy suggested he was not blamed for the incident at the time.

“Luckily, the story died down after a while and it stayed dead for a decade. The New Yorker somehow found out about it, and they just — they’re gonna do a big article on me. … So they asked me, the fact checkers,” he said.

Kennedy suggested the upcoming story would portray him in a negative light.

“You know, it’s gonna be a bad story,” he said while laughing.

Some of the details Kennedy describes in the video appear to align with an October 2014 incident in which a dead bear cub was discovered in Central Park, attracting coverage from major news outlets around the country. The woman who discovered the bear told reporters at the time that she found it with its head resting on a bike. The state’s Department of Environmental Conservation said shortly after the bear was discovered that it had died after being hit by a car."

The incident captivated the city, as bears are not common in Central Park, and a mystery ensued.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says he left a dead bear in Central Park as a prank

Newslooks- WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) —

Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. once retrieved a bear that was killed by a motorist and left it in New York’s Central Park with a bicycle on top, sparking a mystery that consumed the city a decade ago. Kennedy describes the incident in a video that was posted to social media Sunday, adding it will be included in a forthcoming New Yorker article that he expects to be damaging.

It’s the latest bizarre incident in Kennedy’s quixotic campaign that has divided his famous family and left Republicans and Democrats alike concerned about his potential impact on the presidential contest. Kennedy has acknowledged a parasite that lodged in his brain and died. He denied eating a dog after a friend shared a photo with Vanity Fair magazine showing Kennedy dramatically preparing to take a bite of a charred animal; Kennedy said it was a goat.

In the video, Kennedy recounts the story to actress Roseanne Barr. He says he was heading to a falconry excursion with friends when a woman driving ahead of him hit and killed the young bear with her vehicle. He says he put it in his own vehicle, intending to skin it and eat the meat, but the day got away from him.

Eventually, he says, he was in Manhattan and needed to get the bear carcass out of his vehicle. His friends, fueled by alcohol, concocted the Central Park plan as a prank, he said, adding he was not drunk himself. At the time, bicycle accidents were getting significant media attention, so Kennedy and his friends thought it would be funny to make it look like the bear was hit by a bicycle.

Two women walking their dogs found the dead bear and alerted authorities, touching off a mystery that captivated the city for a few days. Bears are not among the park’s known wildlife population. The bike was dusted for prints and the animal sent to Albany for a necropsy, which determined the bear was likely hit by a vehicle and was not a victim of animal cruelty. But how the bear ended up in Central Park remained a mystery. “I was worried because my prints were all over that bike,” Kennedy tells Barr in the video.

In an effort to give his side of the story before a New Yorker story is published about the incident, the 2024 presidential election nominee recalled how he was the person who placed the dead bear cub in the famous park and made it look like it was a bicycle accident.

While speaking to actress and comedian Roseanne Barr, Robert F Kennedy shared how he had been in the Hudson Valley in 2014 hawking when he came across the dead bear cub. He said a woman in a van in front of him was the one who hit and killed the animal.

“So I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van,” Kennedy explained. “Because I was going to skin the bear, and it was in very good condition.”

Robert F Kennedy pointed out he was going to put the meat in his refrigerator. He left the dead animal in his vehicle while he spent the day hawking. Instead of going back to his home in Westchester, he went to New York City to have dinner with some friends.

“At the end of the dinner, it went late, and I realized I couldn’t go home,” he noted. “I had to go to the airport. And the bear was in my car.”

He then said, “I didn’t want to leave the bear in my car, because that would have been bad.”

Robert F Kennedy and His Friends Make an Odd Plan to Leave the Bear Cub in Central Park

Robert F Kennedy and his friends at the dinner then hatched a plan to take the bear to Central Park. They would “make it look like he got hit by a bike.”

He had an old bike in his car that somebody asked him to get rid of. He was planning to use it for the plan.

“So, then I thought you know at that time this was the little bit of the redneck me,” he said. “There’d been a series of bicycle accidents in New York they had just put in the bike lanes and so a couple of people were getting killed and it was every day and people badly injured every day it was in the press.”

The politician said he and his friends thought whoever discovered bear cub would find it “amusing.” However, the incident quickly went viral in a strange, unexpected way for him.

“The next day it was on every television station. It was the front page of every paper,” Kennedy said. “I turned on the TV and there was like a mile of yellow tape and there were 20 cop cars, there were helicopters flying over it. And I was like, ‘Oh my God, what did I do?’ And then they were, there was some people on TV and Tyvek suits with gloves on lifting up the bike and they’re saying they’re gonna take this up to Albany to get it fingerprinted. And I was worried because my prints were all over that bike.”

The Presidential Nominee Says the New Yorker Story is Going to Be ‘Bad’

To add to the very odd story, Kennedy’s niece and John F. Kennedy’s granddaughter, Tatiana Schlossberg, had written about the discovery of the dead bear cub. This was when she worked at the New York Times.

Robert F Kennedy then added that “thankfully” the story died down after a while. However, he pointed out that the story in The New Yorker isn’t going to make him look good.

“It’s going to be a bad story,” Kennedy predictably added."

The Levy County Sheriff’s Office responded to reports of a tree that had fallen onto a mobile home around 8 a.m. in Fanning Springs, Florida, Lt. Scott Tummond told USA TODAY in an email.

Responding deputies and the Levy County Department of Public Safety confirmed the death of the teenage boy who ""was crushed inside the home,"" according to Tummond. No other injuries were reported, he added.

Sheriff Bobby McCallum responded to the scene and spent time with the family, Tummond said.

A 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a single-vehicle crash in Dixie County on Sunday night, the eve of Hurricane Debby’s landfall. Witnesses told the Florida Highway Patrol that the car lost control “due to inclement weather and wet roadway.”

'A life-threatening situation'

Debby, the fourth named storm of what is forecasted to be a historic hurricane season, made landfall Monday at 7 a.m. near the coastal town of Steinhatchee with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Steinhatchee, the home of about 500 people, is 10 miles from where Hurricane Idalia came ashore last year.

As Debby moves inland, widespread flooding and inundating storm surge is expected to affect the state of Florida, officials said. The storm's winds, which extended over 25 miles from the eye, have already uprooted trees and toppled utility poles, causing more than 250,000 homes and businesses across northern Florida to be without power.

Forecasters also anticipate Debby's powerful winds to spawn tornadoes while storm surges could get up to 10 feet in some areas.

""This is a life-threatening situation,"" the hurricane center warned.

WE’RE INTERRUPTING PROGRAMING AS GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS PROVIDING AN UPDATE ON HURRICANE DEBBIE. LET’S LISTEN IN SHORTLY. WE ARE STILL AT A LEVEL ONE ACTIVATION. WE CONTINUE TO UTILIZE ALL AVAILABLE RESOURCES AT THE STATE EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM. UH, TO RESPOND TO THIS STORM. THIS IS A CATEGORY ONE HURRICANE. UH, IT HAS FOLLOWED A TRACK VERY, VERY SIMILAR TO HURRICANE IDALIA 11 MONTHS AGO. UH, THE MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS FOR DEBBY HAVE REACHED 80 MILES AN HOUR WITH HIGHER GUSTS THROUGHOUT THE STORM AREA.

UH, SO FAR WE HAVE ABOUT 143,000 FLORIDIANS WITHOUT POWER. UH, WE HAVE A LOT OF RESTORATION PERSONNEL READY TO GO TO GET IT BACK ON. I THINK BECAUSE THIS IS A CATEGORY ONE WITH 80 MILE AN HOUR SUSTAINED WINDS. UH, THE TOTAL NUMBER OF POWER OUTAGES ARE NOT GOING TO REACH THE LEVEL LEVEL THAT THEY DID WITH HURRICANE IDALIA, AND CERTAINLY NOT THE LEVEL THAT THEY DID WITH HURRICANE IAN. UH, BACK IN 2022.

UH, WE’VE ALSO HAVE ON ON HAND FOR THIS STORM STATEWIDE. UH, 11 MILLION BOTTLES OF WATER, ALMOST 3 MILLION SHELF STABLE MEALS. UH, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE, UH, NEEDING TO TO PUT A MAJOR, MAJOR DENT IN THAT AT THIS TIME. UH, BUT WE WILL BE READY IF THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE.

WE’VE ALREADY EXPERIENCED 10 TO 12IN OF RAIN IN SOME PORTIONS OF SOUTHWEST FLORIDA TO INCLUDE SARASOTA AND MANATEE COUNTY, MANY STREAMS AND RIVER UH RIVERS ARE RAPIDLY RISING. IF YOU LOOK AT THE USGS RIVER GAUGE SUMMARY, YOU WILL SEE THAT A LOT OF THOSE ARE TURNING BLACK OR VERY, VERY DARK BLUE. THAT MEANS THAT THOSE RIVERS ARE RESPONDING VERY QUICKLY. SO AGAIN, WE EXPECT TO HAVE SEVERAL RIVERS AND STREAMS GO INTO MAJOR FLOOD STAGE. SO PLEASE BE CAREFUL IF YOU LIVE ALONG THOSE AREAS. SOME OF THESE AREAS WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE UPWARDS OF 15 TO 20IN OF RAIN. ALL OF THAT WILL DRAIN INTO THE RIVER BASINS. UM, THIS IS GOING TO BE A EVENT THAT IS GOING TO BE PROBABLY HERE FOR THE NEXT 5 TO 7 DAYS, MAYBE AS LONG AS TEN DAYS, DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH RAINFALL WE GET. SO WE ARE NOT RUNNING ANYWHERE. WE ARE STAYING PUT, AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE’RE HERE TO RESPOND. I WANT TO REITERATE THE HAZARDS FROM THIS STORM, UH, WILL BE SEEN AND FELT FAR OUTSIDE THE CENTER OF THE CONE. FLOOD IMPACTS ARE GOING TO BE FELT EVERYWHERE ACROSS NORTH CENTRAL FLORIDA. THIS STORM IS MASSIVE WITH HURRICANE FORCE WINDS EXTENDING 25 MILES FROM THE CENTER, AND TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS EXTENDING 140 MILES FROM THE CENTER, CUTTING COVERING MUCH OF THE STATE FROM THE I-4 CORRIDOR.

THE GOVERNOR TALKED ABOUT THAT WE WILL HAVE POWER OUTAGES. THE NICE THING IS, IS THIS A CAT ONE HURRICANE? IT’S AGAIN, IT’S NOT GOING TO BE AS WIDESPREAD AS WE SAW IN HURRICANE ADELIA.

I MEAN, ALL THAT, ALL THAT RAIN AND ALL THE WATER WHEN, WHEN THAT’S THERE, THAT EVENTUALLY COMES DOWN INTO THE NORTHERN PART OF FLORIDA. SO WHEN YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT FLOODING, YOU’RE LOOKING TO SEE THE WATER THAT’S HAPPENING IN REAL TIME. AS THE STORM PASSES YOU. BUT THEN THERE’S GOING TO BE AFTER EFFECTS FROM THIS STORM. UH, YOU’RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEE SOME OF THESE RIVERS RISE. SO THERE’S GOING TO BE AN ONGOING THREAT OF FLOODING THAT IS NOT GOING TO END SIMPLY WHEN THE STORM PASSES. SO, SO JUST BE BE AWARE OF THAT. UH, BE PREPARED FOR THAT. WE HAVE A LOT OF ASSETS IN PLACE. AND, YOU KNOW, WE’RE GOING TO BE THERE TO HELP PEOPLE GET THROUGH IT. AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE PROBABLY MARSHALED MORE ASSETS THAN WE’RE GOING TO NEED TO BE ABLE TO TO RESPOND. BUT THERE WILL LIKELY BE MANY DAYS WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK TO SEE WHAT’S HAPPENING WITH THE WATER, PARTICULARLY AS WE TALK ABOUT GETTING INTO THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE. SO I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY WHO’S WORKED TO TO GET TO THIS POINT. UH, THEY’VE, UM, STARTED PREPARING WHEN THIS THING WASN’T EVEN AN ORGANIZED STORM. JUST BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW THESE THINGS CAN HAPPEN. AND SO SO THE PREPARATION HAS BEEN GOOD, AND NOW WE’RE PREPARED TO RESPOND ACCORDINGLY. OKAY. ANY QUESTIONS? WHEN DO YOU EXPECT YOU’LL BE ABLE TO GET OUT? START DOING SO. UM, WE THINK MAYBE MAYBE LATER TODAY. UM, I DON’T KNOW IF WE WILL FLY TODAY. UH, BUT YOU KNOW, IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE PLACES IN THE BIG BEND THAT’S OBVIOUSLY ACCESSIBLE VIA VIA GROUND TRANSPORTATION. SO WE MAY DO THAT. I KNOW KEVIN’S ALSO GOING TO HE HAS STAGING AREAS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE. HE’S GOING TO MOVE SOME OF THE RESOURCES CLOSER TO THE SARASOTA BRADENTON AREA. UH, JUST BECAUSE THEY’VE HAD REALLY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WATER DUMPED ON THEM. AND WE’RE SEEING SEEING THE EFFECTS OF THAT. BUT WE WILL WE WILL GET OUT AS SOON AS WE CAN. HOW HOW’S THE FLOOD CONTROL AROUND THE POWER SUBSTATIONS HELD UP SO FAR? WELL, I’LL LET KEVIN IF HE WANTS TO SAY, UH, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE POWER OUTAGE NUMBERS, UM, THIS IS INCREDIBLY MODEST COMPARED TO WHAT WE’VE DEALT WITH IN PAST STORMS. I MEAN, HURRICANE IAN, I MEAN, YOU HAD MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT THAT WERE OUT THE RESTORATION WAS THE FASTEST. HAS EVER BEEN FOR FOR A MAJOR HURRICANE. UH, BUT NOW WE’RE TALKING ABOUT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS, OBVIOUSLY, AS THIS STORM GOES THROUGHOUT THE NORTHERN PART OF FLORIDA, YOU MAY SEE YOU MAY SEE MORE OUTAGES. BUT WHAT WE’RE SEEING IS, IS NOT AT THE LEVEL OF IDALIA. AND CERTAINLY NOT AT THE LEVEL OF IAN. NOW, WHETHER THAT’S BECAUSE OF THE DEVICES THAT WE’VE PUT IN OR JUST BECAUSE THE STORM IS, IS NOT AS AS POWERFUL AS THOSE. MAYBE IT’S A COMBINATION. YEAH. I MEAN, THE GOVERNOR CERTAINLY SAID IT BEST. CODY. AND THAT IS UM, YOU KNOW, WE’VE GOT STUFF OUT RIGHT NOW AND IT’S STILL BEING IMPACTED. BUT AS OF RIGHT NOW, THE SUBSTATIONS WHERE WE HAVE INSTALLED STUFF WITH FLORIDA POWER AND LIGHT AND A COUPLE OF OTHER LOCATIONS, NO ISSUES WHATSOEVER ON THOSE SUBSTATIONS. THE PLACES WHERE WE HAVE PUT IT OUT AT HOSPITALS, NO ISSUES OF FLOOD INUNDATION INTO THE HOSPITALS. SO THESE ARE AGAIN, WE LEARNED THIS OVER IDALIA AND IAN. THESE ARE BEST PRACTICES. AND IT IMPROVES THAT THE NATION TAKING FLORIDA’S LEAD. AND UNDERNEATH THE GOVERNOR’S LEADERSHIP OF BUILDING CAPABILITY AND CAPACITY THROUGH DISASTERS. WE CAN BE GOOD AT FLOOD RESPONSE EVENTS. SO AGAIN UM, IT AS THE GOVERNOR HAS SAID, WE HAVEN’T HAD ANY ISSUES TO DATE. I JUST, UH, ONE MORE REMINDER. THESE, UH, WHEN THE WATER RISES, WHEN YOU HAVE STREETS THAT CAN BE FLOODED, UH, THAT’S HAZARDOUS. AND IN SOME RESPECTS, YOU KNOW, THAT THAT’S EVEN MORE HAZARDOUS THAN THAN SOME OF THE OTHER ASPECTS OF THESE STORMS. UH, SO, SO JUST PLEASE TAKE THE ADEQUATE PRECAUTIONS. UH, DON’T TRY TO DRIVE THROUGH THIS. UH, WE DON’T WANT TO SEE TRAFFIC FATALITIES. UM, YOU KNOW, ADDING UP BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE OUT THERE WHEN THE ROADS AREN’T AREN’T SAFE YET. IT’S GOING TO. IT’LL BE FINE. ALL THIS STUFF GETS TAKEN CARE OF. ALL THE ROADS WILL BE WILL BE OPEN. UM, IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE, THESE GUYS ARE WORKING REALLY HARD. BUT SOMETIMES WHEN THERE’S, WHEN THERE’S A LOT OF WATER ON THE ROADS, IT CAN BE VERY, VERY HAZARDOUS. SO. SO PLEASE, UH, DON’T TEMPT FATE. DON’T TRY TO GO AND AND GO THROUGH THESE, UH, FLOODED STREETS. UH, AND AS THAT HAPPENS, TAKE THE PROPER PRECAUTIONS. AND I THINK THAT WE’LL ALL BE BETTER OFF FOR THAT. I KNOW PEOPLE WANT TO GET DIFFERENT PLACES. UH, BUT SOMETIMES THESE ROADS CAN BE VERY, VERY HAZARDOUS. WE DO ANTICIPATE A LOT OF WATER TO CONTINUE TO BE DROPPED WITH THIS STORM. AND THIS IS JUST SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE VERY, VERY AWARE OF. UH, SO WE’LL BE BACK WITH WITH ANOTHER UPDATE AND WE WILL PROBABLY END UP SOMEWHERE BY, UH, BY THE END OF THE DAY, AS WELL. THANK YOU. WERE YOU WERE JUST LISTENING TO GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS THERE IN TALLAHASSEE TALKING ABOUT HURRICANE DEBBIE MAKING LANDFALL THIS MORNING. JUST ABOUT 7 A.M. IT HAPPENED BETWEEN WE DID WE DO AND MAYBE SPEAKING, UH, IN DIXIE COUNTY OF A CAR HYDROPLANING AND CRASHING. UH, WE ALSO HAVE, UH, REPORT, UH, WHAT WAS IT?

The boy was the first known casualty of Hurricane Debby, though three other people have died in car accidents that may be connected to weather-related limited visibility and slick roads.

Debby walloped the Gulf Coast’s Big Bend Monday morning, approximately 100 miles north of Tampa.

Debby made landfall as a Category 1 storm near Steinhatchee, a small town in Northern Florida. With sustained winds of 75 MPH, Debby brought heavy rains and flash flooding.

Bands of the massive storm have spread across the state, leaving more than 274,000 customers without power. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has declared a state of emergency in 61 counties.

Now downgraded to a severe tropical storm, Debby continues to pound Florida as it heads northeast towards Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina.

In Georgia, the National Weather Service has predicted major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden.

Although those rivers have not yet hit flood stage, authorities warn that their water levels could double as the storm passes through.

Authorities in the path of Hurricane Debby have warned residents to shelter in place until the storm passes."

MOULTRIE, Ga. — A 19-year-old reportedly died after a tree fell on a home in south Georgia Monday as Tropical Storm Debby continued its impact.

The Moultrie Observer reported that the Moultrie police chief confirmed the death, saying it happened at a home along 13th Avenue SW. The teen's identity has not been released.

The City of Moultrie shared updates to its Facebook page Monday afternoon, which shows some of the damage Colquitt County has seen behind the storm. Just before 1. p.m., city officials said wind gusts were between 40 and 45 miles per hour; trees were down, and some areas were experiencing power outages.

One photo showed crews near 3rd Street and 1st Avenue, where there was damage to a building.

Debby made landfall in Florida as a category 1 hurricane and was later downgraded to a tropical storm.

No other injuries were reported, deputies said.

The Sheriff’s Office posted a statement to their website about the tragedy:

Debby threatened to bring catastrophic flooding and life-threatening storm surge as it slowly passes over the northern part of Florida.

Forecasters warned that, in the coming days, record-setting rain could pummel coastal Georgia and South Carolina as the storm heads east.

The storm made landfall as a Category 1 storm near Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida of less than 1,000 residents on Florida’s Gulf Coast.

The small community where Hurricane Debby made landfall is roughly 20 miles from where Hurricane Idalia crashed ashore less than a year ago.

Forecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend.

“That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,” John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.

In Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week.

Nearly 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday, according to PowerOutage.com.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.

“When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that’s hazardous,” DeSantis said. “Don’t try to drive through this. We don’t want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don’t tempt fate, don’t try to go through these flooded streets.”

A truck driver was killed early Monday after he lost control of his tractor trailer along a wet Interstate 75 in the Tampa area.

In Union County, some roads were already under water and numerous trees and power lines were down. The Union County Sheriff’s Office said Monday that residents were cleaning up from a tornado that touched down in the county Sunday night, damaging at least one home. No injuries were reported.

Hurricane Debby has followed a track “very similar to Idalia 11 months ago,” DeSantis said. Hurricane Idalia came ashore near Keaton Beach, Florida on Aug. 30, 2023, with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph. Keaton Beach is about 20 miles north of Steinhatchee. He noted there were fewer power outages with Debby.

Images posted on social media by Cedar Key Fire Rescue early Monday showed floodwaters rising along the streets of the city, located south of where the storm made landfall. Water was “coming in at a pretty heavy pace,” the post said.

Debby was expected to move eastward over northern Florida and then stall over the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina, thrashing the region with potential record-setting rains totaling up to 30 inches beginning Tuesday through Saturday morning. Flooding is expected to be especially severe in low-lying areas near the coast, including Savannah, Georgia; Hilton Head Island, South Carolina; and Charleston, South Carolina. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has called up 2,000 members of the Georgia National Guard."

There have been deaths related to Debby, the fourth named storm in the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season. While no official death toll has been released, incidents over the past two days may be related to the storm.

Debby continued to dump water across North Florida while on its way to Georgia after making landfall in Steinhatchee, Florida, as a Category 1 hurricane at 7 a.m. Monday, Aug. 5, 2024. Hours later, the storm downgraded to a tropical storm. However, reports of massive storm surges, rainfall and local flooding are still coming in and Kevin Guthrie, head of the state’s Division of Emergency Management, has warned that residents may see flooding from Debby for another 5-10 days.

Truck driver killed in Florida after truck goes into canal

The Hillsborough County Fire Rescue responded to a call at 2:35 a.m. about an 18-wheel truck traveling southbound on Interstate 75 near Fowler Avenue that had gone over the guard rail and was hanging mostly over it, according to a Facebook post. As they worked to bring the truck up, the front cab became submerged.

By 3 a.m. Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office deputies and a dive team began working to get to the cab, now under 40 feet of water in the Tampa Bypass Canal. The driver was found deceased inside, the HCSO said.

""While we're on the way here we're getting hurricane warnings, tornado warnings, everything like that,"" said Sheriff's Diver Deputy Jeremy Pollack on Instagram. ""About every 10 minutes we're getting squalls coming through, heavy winds, heavy rain, making it really difficult for our boats down in the water.""

The name of the driver has not been released. An FHP report said he was a 64-year-old man from New Albany, Mississippi. The report said he lost control in wet conditions. The FHP is investigating.

Woman, 12-year-old boy from Crawfordville, Florida, killed in crash; another boy injured

According to the Florida Highway Patrol, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed in a single-vehicle crash in Dixie County on Sunday night, when Debby was a tropical storm bringing massive rain to parts of Florida. A 14-year-old boy was seriously injured and taken to a local hospital. All three involved were from Crawfordville, Florida.

Witnesses told the Florida Highway Patrol that the car lost control “due to inclement weather and wet roadway.”"
13-year-old boy killed when a tree falls on home during Hurricane Debby.,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/08/05/hurricane-debby-live-updates/74666168007/,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. − Debby, now a tropical storm, roared ashore Monday along the Big Bend coast of Florida, killing at least four people, flooding streets, and causing widespread power outages as the storm roared toward Georgia and South Carolina, where it's expected to bring catastrophic flooding this week.

""Tornadoes, catastrophic flash and urban flooding, coastal flooding, rip currents, strong gusty winds are all expected,'' in parts of the Southeast over the next several days, the National Weather Service said.

Debby, the fourth named storm of what is predicted to be a historic hurricane season, made landfall Monday at 7 a.m. near the coastal town of Steinhatchee as a Category 1 storm with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. Steinhatchee, about 70 miles west of Gainesville and home to some 500 people, is just 10 miles from where Hurricane Idalia came ashore last year.

After more than three hours moving across northern Florida, Debby was downgraded to a tropical storm with sustained winds of 70 mph, the hurricane center said in its 11 a.m. ET update. By 8 p.m., the winds had diminished to 45 mph, though the storm was still dropping copious amounts of rain.

State officials reported widespread flooding and inundating storm surge as Debby moved inland. The storm's winds uprooted trees and toppled utility poles, knocking out power to more than 250,000 homes and businesses throughout northern Florida. Forecasters said Debby's powerful winds could also spawn tornadoes, and storm surge could reach 10 feet in some areas.

""This is a life-threatening situation,"" the hurricane center warned.

On Sunday, President Joe Biden declared an emergency across Florida, authorizing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate disaster relief efforts. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the Florida National Guard and Florida State Guard were activated to support humanitarian assistance and search-and-rescue missions.

Developments:

∎ Vice President Kamala Harris postponed her campaign rally scheduled for Friday in Savannah, Georgia, because of the expected deluge there, campaign officials said.

∎ The storm surge produced by Debby brought 25 packages of cocaine with a street value of more than $1 million to a Florida beach, where a passer-by noticed them and alerted authorities, a Border Patrol official posted on the X platform.

∎ The National Hurricane Center recorded a 98 mph wind gust near Horseshoe Beach, according to the Florida Severe Weather Network, a collection of state-run weather stations.

∎ The National Water Prediction Service projected major flooding in three locations on the Santa Fe River and a location on the Suwannee River in north Florida.

∎ Debby wreaked havoc on travel. More than 1,700 flights had been canceled and upwards of 5,800 were delayed Monday, according to flight tracking site FlightAware. The Federal Aviation Administration said all flights at Orlando International Airport have been grounded while airports in Tallahassee and Gainesville were closed.

What lies ahead for the Southeast coast

Debby is projected to move slowly across northern Florida before unleashing ""potentially historic heavy rainfall"" across the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina, according to the Weather Prediction Center.

Widespread rainfall totals of 10-20 inches are expected from northern Florida to southeastern North Carolina, while parts of northern Georgia and South Carolina, including Charleston, could get upward of 30 inches of rain through this weekend, Michael Brennan, director of the National Hurricane Center, said in a YouTube livestream.

Debby is expected to head into the Atlantic Ocean by late Tuesday night, then regain strength for a day or two before soaking the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina, whose governors have already declared states of emergency as they urge residents to prepare.

North Carolina and the mid-Atlantic will start getting heavy rain by midweek, the prediction center said, and tropical storm effects could be felt as far north as southern New England late in the week, AccuWeather reported.

Death toll up to four after truck driver is killed

At least four storm-related deaths have been reported in Florida.

The driver of a semi-truck was killed overnight near Temple Terrace after losing control of his vehicle on a wet Interstate 75 northeast of Tampa, the National Weather Service reported.

The three previously reported deaths linked to the storm included a woman and a 12-year-old boy killed in a car crash and a teenage boy killed when a tree fell on a mobile home.

The truck driver, a 64-year-old man from New Albany, Mississippi, lost control of the truck at around 2:30 a.m., Sgt. Steve Gaskins, a public affairs officer with the Florida Highway Patrol, said in a news release. The truck rotated on the wet highway, collided with a concrete barrier and went over the wall, coming to rest hanging over a bridge. Gaskins said the cab came loose from the trailer and fell into a deep canal below.

Divers from the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office responded shortly afterward and found the deceased driver still inside the cab underwater in the canal, according to an X post by the Sheriff’s office.

Lt. Scott Tummond, a spokesperson for the Levy County Sheriff's Office, told USA TODAY on Monday that more trees could fall after torrential downpours soaked the ground, posing a threat to residents on the road at night.

""If you're moving around after dark, you might not see it until it's too late, especially if you're driving,"" he warned.

Fallen tree kills 13-year-old amid Hurricane Debby

A 13-year-old boy was killed as Hurricane Debby made landfall along the Florida coast Monday morning, the Levy County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.

Deputies responded to a report of a tree that had fallen onto a mobile home around 8 a.m. in Fanning Springs, about 35 miles east from where the hurricane came ashore. The boy who died was ""crushed inside the home,"" the sheriff's office said.

“Our thoughts and prayers are with this family as they deal with this tragedy,” the sheriff’s office said, urging people to be careful as they begin to assess the storm damage. “Downed power lines and falling trees are among the many hazards. One life is too many. Please be safe.”

Where is Debby?

After making landfall, Debby crawled north across northern Florida, drenching the state's interior as the coast experienced several feet of storm surge.

As of 8 p.m. ET, Debby was 50 miles east of Valdosta, Georgia, moving northeast at 6 mph, according to the hurricane center.

Debby is expected to decrease in forward speed as it turns toward the northeast and east and moves across northern Florida and southern Georgia on Monday and through Tuesday, before approaching the Georgia coast Tuesday night.

Town still recovering from Idalia gets walloped by Hurricane Debby

Donna Luce lost power at 6 a.m. Monday and said rain came down for hours as the storm approached and eventually made landfall. Her home’s rain gauge showed 7 inches of rain fell Sunday alone, she said.

“It is still raining pretty hard and we expect to get that most of the day, kind of like it’s sitting right here on top of us,” Luce told USA TODAY on Monday morning.

Many fellow residents in Mayo, a small town about 30 miles north of where Debby came ashore, have spent the past year recovering from Hurricane Idalia, said Luce, 65.

“Most people had just gotten their roofs repaired, and had gotten back up on their feet,” she said, adding that several of her neighbors still had tarps on their roofs this summer. “Now it’s hitting us again one year later and we are a little discouraged.""

Flooding from Hurricane Debby could last 5-10 days

The widespread flooding and significant storm surge Debby has caused across northern Florida are expected to last several days, DeSantis said Monday.

Kevin Guthrie, the executive director for the Florida Division of Emergency Management, said some parts of southwest Florida received up to a foot of rain as Debby approached the Big Bend region. He added that flooding in northern Florida will be widespread as up to 20 inches could fall over the next few days.

Guthrie cautioned people to stay indoors as flash floods break out inland and storm surge continues to inundate coastal communities.

The flood threat from Hurricane Debby, Guthrie said, ""is probably going to be here for the next five to seven days, maybe as long as 10 days depending on how much rainfall we get.”

Storm sounds like a freight train, uproots trees

Alice Brown and her husband were awoken by what sounded like a freight train early Monday morning. They soon realized it was the wind and rain lashing their home as Hurricane Debby approached the Big Bend region and eventually made landfall.

“This was the strongest wind and most rain I’ve ever seen,” Brown told USA TODAY.

Brown, 68, lives in downtown High Springs, a small city of some 6,000 people outside Gainesville. While she did not lose power, several of her friends had their power knocked out overnight and were still without it Monday afternoon.

Jordan Huey, one of Brown’s neighbors, woke up to a tree falling within inches of his son’s bedroom. Another tree in his yard uprooted and destroyed at least 20 feet of his fence. Huey still had not been able to assess the damage because powerful wind gusts were still hurling tree limbs and other debris outside.

“This is the worst it’s ever been in our area,” said Huey, 52.

Several reports of more than 10 inches of rainfall

Debby is leaving behind some eye-popping rain totals, including the 16.56 inches over two days reported by a weather station at Lakewood Ranch in Manatee County. There have been several reports of more than 10 inches of rain across the county, including 12.43 inches at the Sarasota Bradenton airport.

The weather service in Jacksonville issued a flash flood warning for parts of four counties in north Florida, saying between 7 and 14 inches of rain have fallen, and another 3 to 6 inches are possible.

With Debby's center still over north Florida by early afternoon, a daily rainfall record was set at Charleston International Airport in South Carolina, with 2.29 inches to that point, according to meteorologist Steven Taylor with the National Weather Service in Charleston.

Taylor also reiterated the forecast of 10-20 inches of rain with localized amounts near 30 inches is still on track. ""The situation still looks favorable for a historic rainfall event with areas of catastrophic flooding. This is a potentially significant and life-threatening event,"" he said.

Woman, boy die in crash as Hurricane Debby approached Florida coast

A woman and a boy died in a single-vehicle crash in Dixie County on Sunday night, the eve of Hurricane Debby’s landfall, according to a law enforcement report.

Florida Highway Patrol troopers arrived at the scene of the crash around 9:30 p.m. A 38-year-old woman and 12-year-old boy were pronounced dead, while a 14-year-old boy was seriously injured and rushed to a hospital for treatment.

Witnesses told the Florida Highway Patrol the car lost control “due to inclement weather and wet roadway.”

“After losing control, the vehicle struck the guardrail in the center median, then redirected, overturning, leaving the roadway to the right,” the Florida Highway Patrol said. The crash is under investigation.

More than 250K without power after Debby makes landfall

More than 135,000 homes and businesses in Florida, the majority of them in the north, were without power by 9 p.m. ET as Debby continued its path across the state.

The outages were most abundant from Wakulla to Levy County, according to Poweroutage.us. In Taylor County, where Hurricane Debby made landfall at 7 a.m., more than 97% of utility customers lost power at one point. In several surrounding counties, that figure was well over 80%.

At a news conference Monday morning, DeSantis said 17,000 linemen across the state were poised to begin restoring power once the storm passes.

Forecasters watching tropical system near Caribbean

Debby wasn't the only storm forecasters were watching Monday. They were also keeping an eye on another developing tropical system that was approaching the Caribbean Sea.

Although chances for development were low as of Monday afternoon, the National Hurricane Center said ""environmental conditions are expected to become more conducive for development later this week as the system moves across the western Caribbean Sea or the southern Gulf of Mexico.""

If its winds eventually reach 39 mph, the system would become a named tropical storm. The next name on the list is Ernesto. It's too early to determine if there will be any impact to the U.S. from this system.

Pacific sets 50-year record for storms

The eastern Pacific hurricane season has also heated up: The Pacific currently has four named storms spinning at the same time: Carlotta, Daniel, Emilia and Fabio. This is the first time since August 1974 that the eastern North Pacific has had four named storms simultaneously, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.

None of the four storms are forecast to approach or impact land as they spin far out to sea in the Pacific, the National Hurricane Center said.

The activity in the Pacific comes after a very slow start to the season. For the first time since the satellite era began in 1966, the entire North Pacific saw no named storm activity between June 1 and July 3, Klotzbach said.

What makes Debby such a treacherous storm?

Debby is a large and slow-moving storm, making the system particularly dangerous as record amounts of rain inundate many areas, especially along the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina in the coming days.

The storm’s center was forecast to move near Savannah, Georgia, on Tuesday night and drag along the South Carolina Coast on Thursday night. ""Multiple days of very, very heavy rainfall"" are possible, Brennan said. The National Weather Service estimates rainfall totals could reach up to 30 inches or more in isolated locations along the coast through Friday.

Debby shows there's more to a storm than wind scale

The widespread flooding caused by Debby even after being downgraded to a tropical storm illustrates how the wind scale categories used to define hurricanes can fall short of telling the whole story of their impact, scientists say.

""This is another example of a storm where the primary impacts are going to be from water, rather than wind,"" said James Franklin, a retired branch chief of the hurricane specialist unit at the National Hurricane Center.

Jennifer Collins, a professor in the Geosciences School at the University of South Florida, has studied how to better communicate all of a storm’s threats. Looking at the forecasts of up to 30 inches of rain in isolated locations between Savannah and Charleston, Collins said she’s very concerned about the likelihood of “catastrophic flooding.""

Spaghetti models

Illustrations include an array of forecast tools and models, and not all are created equal. The hurricane center uses only the top four or five highest performing models to help make its forecasts.

When is the Atlantic hurricane season the most active?

The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30. The peak of the season is Sept. 10, and the most activity usually happens between mid-August and mid-October, according to the hurricane center.

After Hurricane Beryl's deadly rampage in July, forecasters from Colorado State University raised their already record hurricane forecast. They now expect an additional hurricane (a total of 12 for the season) and two more named storms (25 for the season).

The severe rain and wet conditions led to a wreck Sunday night in Dixie County.

Florida Highway Patrol reports that the vehicle lost control, hit a guardrail rail and overturned. First responders declared a 38-year-old driver and 12-year-old boy dead at the scene with a 14-year-old boy taken to the hospital. None were wearing seatbelts and all three were from Crawfordville.

Alachua County warned that they expect conditions to worsen into Monday as Debby brings loads of rain to a drenched North Florida. Alachua County has already received 6 to 8 inches of rain since midday Sunday, however if the storm continues to slow down, the county said rainfall could reach 20 inches.

Flash flood warnings are already in place for the rest of the week. Data from the UF campus showed that the rain was falling at a rate slightly over an inch per hour at 6 a.m. on Monday before slowing down.

“This is a good day to stay home,” Gainesville Mayor Harvey Ward tweeted Monday morning. “I encourage you to do so if at all possible to keep the roads clear for emergency personnel and to keep you safe.”

Alachua County said that several roads have been closed because of downed trees. Westbound lanes on Newberry Road were temporarily closed near Westside Baptist Church.

As of 10 a.m., poweroutage.us reports 7,600 customers without power in Alachua County, the majority within Duke Energy and Gainesville Regional Utilities (GRU) territories. GRU reported it had restored power to 15,600 residents from Sunday night through Monday morning.

In the Big Bend region, where Hurricane Debby made landfall, Taylor, Madison, Suwannee and Jefferson counties are reporting 100% outages. Duke Energy says it has 96,000 customers without power, including 24,000 in Clearwater.

Although the storm skirted past Cedar Key, it lashed the coastline with wind gusts nearing hurricane strength and produced life-threatening storm surge. Social media users posted numerous photos and videos showing flooding in Cedar Key, which was also pummeled by Idalia last year.

The bridge that connects the island city to mainland Florida has been closed, and Cedar Key Fire Rescue said it is working to remove all hazards while monitoring for a second surge.

Though last year's Hurricane Idalia was a Category 3, the similarities are eerie. Debby hit with 80 mph winds mere miles from where Idalia came ashore and at about the same time.

Like before, Florida's capital appears to have dodged a bullet, leaving its eastern neighbors to bear the brunt of dangerous winds, life-threatening surge and untold amounts of rain.

However, forecasters warned that Tallahassee could still see tropical storm force gusts along with downed trees and power lines as Debby pushes through and brings expected ""catastrophic rains to the southeast"" before a second landfall.

Here's the latest:

City of Tallahassee utilities: 'Substantial restoration' made

""Crews have made substantial restoration progress overnight and throughout the day, joined by crews from Alabama and Louisiana. We experienced over 35,000 outages and have restored power to 33,216 customers,"" the city said in a news release.

""We expect to be 99% restored by 10 p.m., within 24 hours of storm impacts. Crews will continue to work through the night to address remaining scattered outages.""

Storm shelters shutting down in Leon County

""As of now, all shelters have been closed down with the exception of SAIL High School, where there are 11 people waiting for power to be restored before they return to their homes,"" the Leon County Schools X account posted Monday afternoon.

""The Red Cross will take over operations at 6:00 p.m. and the Leon Sheriff's Department will provide security overnight if needed. The shelter will close at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning. Thank you to StarMetro for aiding with transportation.""

Levy County Sheriff's Office: 13-year-old boy killed by tree as Debby made landfall

As Hurricane Debby was making landfall early Monday, a 13-year-old boy died when a tree fell on a mobile home, according to a news release from the Levy County Sheriff’s Office.

Deputies and other first responders arrived around 8 a.m. to a Fanning Springs address. The boy was inside; no one else was injured.

Sheriff Bobby McCallum “responded to the scene personally and is with the family,” the release said.

“Our thoughts and prayers are with this family as they deal with this tragedy,” it added. “We encourage everyone to use extreme caution as they begin to assess and clean up the damage.

“Downed power lines and falling trees are among the many hazards. One life is too many. Please be safe.”

Three Florida counties are completely in the dark

According to our Power Outage Tracker, at least three counties in the path of then Hurricane Debby are completely off the grid. The counties of Jefferson (8,777 customers), Taylor (13,991) and Suwannee (25,013) are 100% without power.

Madison, Hamilton and Dixie aren't fairing much better. Madison is 95% in the dark with Hamilton at 83.7% and Lafayette at 80.9%. Dixie isn't far behind with 79.8% powerless. Gilchrist is at 63% and Columbia at 51%.

In Leon County, 9.4% of customers are in the dark (12,456 customers of 132,015 total). According to the city of Tallahassee's outage map, about 4,000 customers are still disconnected from the power grid.

All told, more than 250,000 are still without power in the Sunshine State.

City of Tallahassee: 7,500 without power

The city of Tallahassee's latest storm report, received via text message at 1:06 p.m., says ""electric crews continue working to restore power to approximately 7,500 customers currently without power following Hurricane Debby.

""Additional mutual aid resources from Louisiana have arrived in Tallahassee and are actively working to replace broken utility poles. City crews with support from mutual aid resources have restored power to over 24,000 customers and will continue working. For updates on power restoration efforts, go to Talgov.com.""

Leon County administrator provides updates

In a memo to county commissioners, Leon County Administrator Vince Long shared the following highlights, among others:

""At this time, we are experiencing the distant rain bands from Hurricane Debby and sustained winds of about 20 miles per hour with gusts near 40 miles per hour. At this time, about 40 trees have fallen onto or near roadways and County and City Public Works crews immediately clear them.""

""Leon County has been very fortunate this storm—we ​will not experience widespread, significant impacts from Hurricane Debby.""

""NOAA has issued its highest flood outlook for the coming days, warning of dangerous storm surge, strong winds, and possible tornadoes. Flooding is exacerbated by onshore winds preventing floodwaters from draining towards the ocean, causing catastrophic conditions in some areas.""

""All Leon County risk shelters will remain open until 4 p.m. After that time, any persons remaining in our shelters will be transported to and welcomed at SAIL High School, 2006 Jackson Bluff Road. At this time, we expect no more than 30 evacuees to remain in Leon County overnight. SAIL High School will remain open until Tuesday, August 6 when American Red Cross will then open a host shelter ... At its peak, Leon County Schools facilities sheltered 98 citizens .... In comparison, the County previously sheltered more than 3,000 people during Hurricane Irma (2017).""

Debby downgrade: It's back to a tropical storm

The National Weather Service-Tallahassee released this update as of 11:35 a.m. Highlights include:

Debby is now a Tropical Storm

Hurricane Warnings have been replaced with Tropical Storm Warnings

Tropical Storm Warning dropped for Gulf County

Storm Surge Warning dropped for Franklin County

Storm Surge values have adjusted slightly: 4 to 6 feet from Suwanee River to Aucilla, 2 to 4 feet from the Aucilla River to Ochlocknee River, 1 to 3 feet from Ochlocknee River to Indian Pass

""Tropical Storm Debby remains over the Florida Big Bend and will continue to track east/northeast toward the FL/GA border this afternoon. The worst impacts should occur along and east of the track with heavy flooding rains being the primary concern.""

Dateline Perry, Florida: A lower blow than Hurricane Idalia

In the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Debby, Perry was a ghost town.

Most of the businesses remained closed as of 10:30 a.m., with power out across the community.

People largely either remained in their houses or drove by in their cars, no doubt because any other option would leave them drenched in rain.

The area saw its fair share of damage — downed trees and power lines mixed with occasional damaged roofs. But it seemed minimal when compared with the stunning shredding Perry took during Hurricane Idalia less than a year.

Measuring Debby's bluster

Hurricane Debby is leaving her mark at weather stations across north Florida and even in inland areas.

The highest official gust on record may have come out of inland Mayo in Lafayette County at 70 mph. A WeaterStem station at Madison County High School measured winds of 62 mph. A 50 mph gust was recorded in Monticello with a 44 mph gust at Tallahassee International Airport and a 47 mph gust at Florida A&M University.

On the coast, an Alligator Point weatherflow station recorded winds that gusted to 54 mph. Cedar Key clocked a 66 mph gust and the St. Mark's Lighthouse saw 50 mph winds.

Expect tropical storm conditions for hours in Tallahassee as crews work to restore power

City of Tallahassee officials expect that the capital city may be buffeted with tropical storm force conditions over the next 5 to 7 hours ""with up to 40-50 mph wind gusts and continuous rainfall as Hurricane Debby moves through our area.""

A Tropical Storm Warning remains in effect until 7:30 p.m. Generally the city should see sustained winds of 10-20 mph with gusts to 35 mph, according to the National Weather Service.

""Electric crews continue to work to restore power and have restored 10,500 customers,"" the city wrote in a text alert sent to resident. ""Approximately 12,600 customers are currently without power.""

Line crews are also replacing a power pole after a truck collided with a power pole at Miccosukee & Miles Johnson roads. The driver was on his way to work and was uninjured.

""Wet roads and windy conditions aren't a great match,"" the city wrote on Facebook.

Already, mutual aid line crews from Alabama are assisting Tallahassee crews. They will soon be joined by Louisiana reinforcements.

Taylor County urges residents to stay indoors

Taylor County Emergency Management and the county sheriff’s office are asking residents to stay indoors because of downed trees and powerlines in Perry and throughout Taylor County.

“Please don’t put yourself at risk,” the sheriff’s office said in a Facebook post at 9:30 a.m.

More than 13K electric customers without power in Leon County; state of Florida total tops 300K

Nearly 308,000 electric customers across North and Central Florida were in the dark as of 9 a.m., according to the Public Service Commission.

In Leon County, 13,289 customers, most with Talquin Electric Cooperative, were without power. Some 10,545 Talquin customers were offline, while the number of city of Tallahassee customers without power was down tow 2,744. More than 91% of customers countywide in Leon had power as of 9 a.m.

By 10 a.m., about 12,000 Tallahassee Utilities' customers were out of power in 224 outages, according to the city's power outage map.

Jefferson and Lafayette counties remained largely without power. More than 87% of customers in Jefferson County and 78% in Lafayette County were without power.

Flooding from Debby could last 5-10 days

Gov. Ron DeSantis and Kevin Guthrie, head of the state’s Division of Emergency Management, appeared at 7:30 a.m. at the state’s emergency operations center with an update on the Category 1 hurricane that landed in Steinhatchee, a fishing village on the state's Nature Coast.

Guthrie said flooding will be an ongoing issue, perhaps for up to 10 days after Hurricane Debby makes its way through north Florida.

Little tree debris seen on Tallahassee roads

Compared to previous storms, there was minimal tree debris on canopy roads and city streets in Tallahassee Monday morning as Hurricane Debby plowed into the Big Bend south of the city.

Traffic was light on Centerville and Miccosukee roads between 7 and 8 a.m. The two tree-lined roads are main arteries from the northeast suburbs.

While Debby is mostly following the path of Idalia when it made landfall south of Perry last August, the storm is having much less of an impact on Tallahassee.

Idalia made much of the city’s 78 miles of canopy roads impassable. Leon County collected 22,000 cubic yards of debris after Idalia, more than 400 dump truck full of downed trees.

Monday morning, however, Debby’s tree debris amounted to an occasional branch on Centerville and scatterings of twigs and clumps of Spanish moss along Call Street and Park Avenue downtown.

Wreck killed two in Florida as Debby approached; FHP says victims from Crawfordville

A woman and a boy died in a single-vehicle crash in Dixie County on Sunday night, the eve of Hurricane Debby’s landfall, according to a law enforcement report.

Florida Highway Patrol troopers arrived at the scene of the crash — U.S. 19, just north of 483rd Avenue — around 9:30 p.m. where both the 38-year-old woman and the 12-year-old were pronounced dead.

A 14-year-old boy was seriously injured and taken to UF Health to be treated. All three involved were from Crawfordville in Wakulla County.

Witnesses told the Florida Highway Patrol that the car lost control “due to inclement weather and wet roadway.”

“After losing control, the vehicle struck the guardrail in the center median, then redirected, overturning, leaving the roadway to the right,” FHP said.

The crash is currently under investigation.

Leon County Public Works, ambulances responding normally to calls as Debby pushes onshore to the east

Leon County Emergency Management officials said residents shouldn’t let their guard down after Hurricane Debby made landfall well to the east.

Debby made landfall at 7 a.m. this morning near Steinhatchee, a small fishing hamlet in southern Taylor County. With that track, the “heavier weather impacts” will be to the east, said Kevin Peters, director of Leon County Emergency Management.

“We’re being told by the National Weather Service that our rainfall forecast is more along the lines of 1 to 2 inches of rain,” Peters said. “And currently the winds that we’ve seen have been around 20 mph sustained, with gusts near 40 mph. With the storm moving away on that more easterly track, we would not expect to see those get too much stronger than that.”

Peters said there have been no major reports of damage and that crews have cleared a few fallen trees that blocked roadways. Conditions have been safe enough for other critical crews to be out in the field.

“Our ambulances and our Public Works crews are still responding to every call for service and every downed tree,” said Matt Cavell, director of Community Relations and Resilience.

Peters urged people to be careful, especially on the roadways.

“The roads are wet,” he said. “People need to use caution just as they would in any rainstorm. Due to those gusty winds, we may still see trees down or tree limbs that break and may fall on power lines and roadways. We will have the rain hanging around for a bit and things will continue to be breezy.”

Power outages in Tallahassee down to 3,000

Electric crews worked through the night, trying to restore nearly 7,000 power outages.

Shortly after landfall, the City of Tallahassee said roughly 3,000 customers were still without power. Residents should expect more outages throughout the day as Hurricane Debby creeps closer to the capital.

“Crews will continue to work as conditions allow,” the city said in an email.

'Stinging rain ... hammering Perry'

Reporter Douglas Soule in Perry reports at 7:30 a.m.:

""Forceful winds and strong, stinging rain are hammering Perry as the eye wall grinds through the area. The gusts threaten to knock over broadcast reporters’ cameras – and the reporters themselves.

""The power is out at a hotel many journalists are staying at, and water is puddling through some of the first floor doors.""

Evacuees shelter at Leon County Schools

As Hurricane Debby makes landfall, 98 people are sheltering at six campuses of the Leon County School District, according to a post on X.

Debby makes landfall at 7 a.m. near Steinhatchee

Hurricane Debby has made landfall near Steinhatchee, Florida, the National Hurricane Center says in its 7 a.m. update. That's just 45 minutes and ten miles shy of where and when Hurricane Idalia made landfall as a Category 3 in late August 2023.

""Data from the Hurricane Hunters indicate that the minimum pressure at landfall was around 979 mb and the maximum winds were estimated to be around 80 mph,"" forecasters wrote in the update.

Editor's note – Forecasters later corrected their previous tropical cyclone report from Tallahassee International Airport. ""The Tallahassee airport gusted to 39 mph,"" they said.

Debby will make landfall near Steinhatchee, mere miles from where Idalia came ashore

""Hurricane Debby will make landfall in eastern Taylor County just west of the town of Steinhatchee,"" according to WeatherTiger meteorologist Ryan Truchelut, who writes forecasts for the USA TODAY NETWORK. ""Remarkably, that's only about 10 miles southeast of where Category 3 Hurricane Idalia made landfall in Keaton Beach less than one year ago.""

The small town of Steinhatchee holds an outsized role in hurricane lore, though we are well past ""Steinhatchee Season"" – so-named because June storms tend to exhibit a bizarre attraction to the Gulf fishing village of Steinhatchee.

The community was also hammered by Hurricane Idalia, a late August storm, which brought in what longtime resident called an unstoppable storm surge that flooded building and swallowed docks.

Keaton Beach resident had just repaired his home from Idalia. Then Debby came calling

Repairs on Spyridon Aibejeris’ Keaton Beach house were only just completed.

“Like, two weeks ago,” he said, before a powerful gust of wind and rain interrupted his interview with a USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida reporter.

He and his family rode out Hurricane Idalia last year in the same Perry hotel he stood in front of early Monday morning, waiting for yet another hurricane to bear down on Florida – and his house.

“Man, I’ve done this so many times. You just go back and see what you’ve got to do,” said Aibejeris, who owns a campground near his house that was also damaged by Idalia.

“I hope I don’t have to go back to that again,” he added.

Gust of 98 mph reported in Horseshoe Beach

The Florida Severe Weather Network, a collection of state-run weather stations, has just recorded an unconfirmed 98 mph gust near Horseshoe Beach. If the name Horseshoe Beach seems familiar, you likely read about it in our Hurricane Idalia coverage here.

Read about how the small community grappled with Idalia in the wake of the storm.

Meanwhile, the top gust at Tallahassee Airport is 39 mph.

Radar shows eyewall on shore with Debby just 65 miles from Tallahassee

Doppler radar images from Tallahassee indicate Debby is close to making landfall in the Florida Big Bend region.

The northern and eastern portions of the eyewall are already onshore and the hurricane will be making landfall later this morning. Debby is located 65 miles SSE of Tallahassee.

She is packing 80 mph winds and moving NNE at 10 mph.

""Hurricane Debby is poised to make landfall later this morning at the Taylor-Dixie Coast,"" the National Weather Service of Tallahassee wrote. ""Worst impacts should be along/east of the track with heavy flooding rains being the biggest concern. Storm surge is also expected across Apalachee Bay.""

The slowing storm is also posing a particular threat.

""The slow NNE motion with occasional eye wobbles may prolong landfall/storm surge for another few hours before gradually tracking inland where strong winds + flooding rains are expected,"" NWS wrote.

Power outages surging as Debby nears

As Hurricane Debby closes in and blows by the city of Tallahassee, power outages are starting to stack up. As of about 6 a.m., the City of Tallahassee Utilities Outage Map is showing that about 3,500 customers are in the dark in 61 outages.

The power outages began in the early evening after the first rain band pushed through, but by about midnight Sunday most homes and businesses were restored.

Meanwhile, 177,447 customers are out of power through the state of Florida, according to the Tallahassee Democrat's Power Outage Tracker. Almost half of customers in Jefferson County and Suwanee County are out of power at this hour.

Leon County has more than 7,500 who are powerless, or about 6% of total accounts in the county.

Reporting from Perry as Hurricane Debby nears

The USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida has a reporter stationed in Perry, Florida, in advance of Hurricane Debby’s landfall.

Douglas Soule, a Tallahassee-based journalist, is currently standing at the entrance of a hotel, waiting in ramping-up rain and wind with other journalists and storm chasers.

He covered Hurricane Idalia in 2023 from Cedar Key and Suwannee.

""It’s pouring, but the loudest sound is the whipped branches of the surrounding trees,""

One injury reported as Debby approaches Big Bend landfall

One injury related to Hurricane Debby occurred around 2 a.m. Monday in Newberry, according to the National Weather Service storm reports. The person was injured when a tree came down and caused a traffic crash on State Road 45.

There were also numerous reports of tornadoes Sunday night in the Columbia County area. Twisters were reported on the ground near the Lake City Airpark and Worthington Springs.

Numerous Florida counties remain under a tornado watch until 6 a.m., including Jefferson, Madison and Taylor counties and coastal waters from Keaton Beach to the Ochlockonee River. Leon County is not currently under a tornado watch.

Debby 'very near' landfall, expected to bring life-threatening storm surge and major flooding

Hurricane Debby was ""very near landfall"" along the eastern Big Bend coast and expected to bring life-threatening storm surge and major flooding as it moves on shore.

The National Hurricane Center said in its 5 a.m. update that Debby was located about 45 miles northwest of Cedar Key and about 70 miles south-southeast of Tallahassee. It had maximum sustained winds of 80 mph and was moving north-northeast at 10 mph.

A hurricane warning was in effect along the coast from Yankeetown to Indian Pass in Gulf County. Storm surge warnings were also in place, with 6-10 inches of surge possible from Yankeetown to the Ochlockonee River.

""This is a life-threatening situation. Persons located within these areas should take all necessary actions to protect life and property from rising water and the potential for other dangerous conditions,"" the Hurricane Center said.

Tallahassee likely to escape brunt of Hurricane Debby

Hurricane Debby appears to be headed for landfall southeast of Tallahassee, putting towns like Perry, Cross City, Mayo and Madison in the crosshairs.

However, forecasters warned that Tallahassee could still see tropical storm force winds, along with downed trees and power outages.

""We're not on the dirty side of the storm,"" said Israel Gonzalez, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Tallahassee. ""But we're still looking at a decent combination of rain and winds. We have some of those outer bands that have been spreading steadily inland into the eastern Big Bend, and we're kind of on the fringe of those bands there.""

The highest wind gust recorded at Tallahassee International Airport was around 40 mph, Gonzalez said. Debby is producing sustained winds in the Capital City around 15 mph.

He said Tallahassee could see rainfall amounts of around 2 inches from Debby.

""If you overlay that with the strong winds ... that can certainly be more than enough to cause trees to topple over, get on top of a power line and cause an outage,"" Gonzalez said.

As of about 4:45 a.m., the city of Tallahassee was reporting 55 outage orders affecting only about 546 customers.

Debby's eye wall grazing Florida's coast near Taylor, Dixie counties

Hurricane Debby's eyewall is grazing Florida's coast near Taylor and Dixie counties as it nears landfall, according to the National Weather Service in Tallahassee.

""It's knocking on the door of landfall,"" said Israel Gonzalez, NWS meteorologist, ""because if you look at radar, the eye wall is grazing the coast right now. But the eye is still slightly offshore, so ... we can't consider that landfall yet.""

Gonzalez said that Debby is expected to make landfall around Dixie and Taylor county and that the core of the storm could pass through an area that includes Perry, Madison and Mayo.

""The concavity of the Nature Coastline makes the pin-down of the timing of the landfall a little bit difficult, especially with those eye wobbles that we've been seeing all night,"" Gonzalez said. ""On top of that, it's overall motion has been gradually slowing down as its kind of crawled its way into Apalachee Bay.""

Leon County remains under a tropical storm warning, though points to the south and east remain under a hurricane warning.

Hurricane Debby nearing landfall in Florida's Big Bend

The National Hurricane Center said in a 4 a.m. update that Debby is nearing landfall this morning in the Big Bend.

""Doppler radar images from Tallahassee indicate that Debby is nearing landfall and the eastern portion of the eyewall is moving onshore in the Florida Big Bend,"" the Hurricane Center in Miami said.

An observation in Cedar Key recorded a sustained wind of 50 mph and a gust of 66 mph, according to NHC.

As of 4 a.m., Debby was located about 40 miles west-northwest of Cedar Key and about 80 miles south-southeast of Tallahassee. It had maximum sustained winds of 80 mph and was moving north-northeast at 12 mph.

Two people, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy, died Sunday night in Dixie County after the vehicle they were in overturned on U.S.19 while driving through heavy rain produced by Debby. A 14-year-old boy was transported to the University of Florida Health with serious injuries.

The cab of a tractor-trailer fell into the water at the Tampa Bypass Canal early Monday after losing control, killing the driver after being found later Monday morning, Florida Highway Patrol said. The semi was southbound on I-75 when it lost control and hit a barrier before its cab fell into the canal.

A 19-year-old teenager died in Moultrie, Ga., after a tree fell on the side of a house Monday afternoon, according to Colquitt County Coroner C. Verlyn Brock. Moultrie is located about 200 miles south of Atlanta.

As Debby slows down, it is expected to bring heavy flooding from heavy rain in Florida and Georgia on Monday with some forecasts predicting up to 20 inches in Savannah, Ga.

Debby created havoc on power, with PowerOutage.us reporting 300,714 locations without power in Florida and another 24,880 in Georgia early Monday. The numbers were down to 149,392 in Florida and 24,382 in Georgia at 8:30 p.m.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who declared a state emergency in 61 of 67 counties on Thursday, said damage assessment teams will be in the field Tuesday.

Debby ""did not bring the catastrophic hurricane-force winds that we've seen in previous storms like Hurricane Ian and Michael, but it has and continues to produce lots of water,"" DeSantis said at the state's Emergency Operations Center in Tallahassee.

""We are going to see flooding, particularly in the northern part of the state, (so) be very careful. Don't go out into flood waters. There can be hazards, debris and downed electrical cables. Please do not go driving if roads are underwater.""

As of 3 p.m. Monday, all airports in the state were open.

Man killed when storm topples large tree onto home in south Georgia, officials say

Heavy winds and rain associated with Debby toppled a large tree onto a porch at a home in south Georgia, killing a 19-year-old man, authorities said Monday.

Colquitt County Coroner C. Verlyn Brock said the man died at the home in the city of Moultrie, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Valdosta, Georgia, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.

The storm has damaged roofs and downed power lines in Moultrie, Police Chief Chad Castleberry told WALB-TV.

Charleston, South Carolina, announces curfew, roads into historic city to be closed

Charleston, South Carolina, officials announced a curfew starting at 11 p.m. Monday for the peninsula that makes up much of downtown and the older parts of the 350-year-old city as some of the heaviest rain from Tropical Storm Debby is expected to fall overnight.

Police will barricade all eight roads leading into the peninsula and only let essential workers and emergency personnel in or out. High-water vehicles will also be staged to go into the area as needed, Charleston Mayor William Cogswell said at a Monday evening news conference.

“We need people to make their way out. This is not something you can stay at the bar until 10:45. We need you to take this seriously,” Cogswell said.

The mayor said forecasters told him 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain could fall in Charleston overnight.

City officials will assess the situation early Tuesday and decide how and when to reopen roads and lift the curfew.

No evacuations planned for now in South Carolina, officials say

State officials don’t plan any evacuations in South Carolina for now as Tropical Storm Debby slowly spins toward the state.

Large-scale evacuations typically bring people inland from the coast, and forecasters say Debby’s biggest impacts could be as much as 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain in localized areas throughout the state, causing floodwaters to rise quickly in small areas. So any evacuations will up to local leaders.

“This storm may not have the high winds of a hurricane, but it has the potential to cause life-threatening floods across the state. And I would like to emphasize that Tropical Storm Debby is not just a coastal event, but it is a statewide event,” state Emergency Management Division Director Kim Stenson said at a Monday afternoon news conference.

Biden approves request from South Carolina's governor for emergency declaration

The White House said Monday that President Joe Biden has approved a request from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida.

In a statement, the White House said personnel from the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Coast Guard are deploying to the region and are prepared to support recovery efforts.

North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday ahead of Debby’s anticipated rainfall. Flooding and power outages are expected to start Tuesday and continue through the rest of the week, according to North Carolina Emergency Management officials.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis previously had declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida’s 67 counties, with the National Guard activating 3,000 guard members. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp also had made his own emergency declaration.

Curfew announced for Savannah and surrounding county as Debby approaches

With Debby’s winds and rains expected to worsen overnight, officials for Savannah and surrounding Chatham County announced that an overnight curfew will take effect at 10 p.m. Monday and run to 6 a.m. Tuesday. The National Hurricane Center says the region can expect rains that could exceed 20 inches (51 centimeters).

By Monday afternoon, the storm’s outer bands were lashing Tybee Island, home to Georgia’s largest public beach, blowing sheets of rain sideways and rattling street signs near the beach pier. The island of 3,100 residents east of Savannah was bracing for a potential double-dose of flooding from an expected 2 to 4 feet of storm surge on top of rainfall.

“This is unprecedented rainfall,” said Michelle Owens, Tybee Island’s interim city manager. She added: “We don’t know what that looks like. So we have to be prepared for the worst. But we are definitely hoping for the best.”

Public works crews used earthmoving equipment to heap sand over beach access points to help fortify a storm surge buffer offered by surrounding dunes. Owens said the city also had given out about 2,000 sandbags to island residents.

Angela Thompson had several sandbags ready by the front door of her ground-level apartment near Tybee Creek on the island’s west side. She had just started moving in earlier this week and hoped to ride out the storm while unpacking.

“I have food and water and batteries and the things that I need, and I’m going to stay as long as I can,” Thompson said.

Florida will be on alert for flooding for the next week, Gov. Ron DeSantis says

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because Tropical Storm Debby is moving toward Georgia, that doesn’t mean the state won’t continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.

“It is a very saturating, wet storm,” DeSantis said during a briefing at the state’s emergency operations center. “When they crest and the water that’s going to come down from Georgia, it’s just something that we’re going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.”

Record-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, according to the National Hurricane Center. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over Florida’s gulf coast. The storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast and was expected to slow down as it turns to the east.

No deaths or injuries in Florida county where Debby made landfall, sheriff says

The sheriff of Florida’s Taylor County, where Debby came ashore as a hurricane Monday, says there are no deaths or injuries in the sparsely populated area located in the state’s northern Big Bend region.

But Sheriff Wayne Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying and coastal areas to wait before returning because the tide will be coming in and it’s unknown how deep the water might get. Several roads are closed due to flooding as well as trees and power lines downed by the storm, Padgett said.

Debby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of less than 1,000 residents.

Mayor warns tourists, residents on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island: Don't let your guard down

No evacuations were planned Monday on South Carolina’s Hilton Head Island, one of the state’s most popular beach destinations. But Mayor Alan Perry warned tourists and residents not to let their guard down with forecasts predicting up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain this week from Debby.

“We don’t know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,” Perry said. “If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.”

In a video posted on Facebook, Perry asked island residents and visitors to check on each other before the heavy rain starts — and maybe help the city out by checking storm drains. “If you are able to go out and pull some debris from those drains so they can drain, that’s is really key to preventing additional flooding,” he said.

Hilton Head Island has about 38,000 residents. Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days.

In saturated Savannah, residents prepare for potentially historic rains

As Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rains across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city’s suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area already is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service.

Jim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won’t be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors.

“A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,” Froncak said. “So whatever’s coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.”

City crews spent days ahead of Debby’s arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago.

Packages containing cocaine wash up on beach in Florida Keys during storm, Border Patrol says

In the Florida Keys, Debby blew packages containing 70 pounds (32 kilograms) of cocaine onto a beach, the U.S. Border Patrol’s Miami sector reported Monday.

A “good Samaritan” found the drugs and contacted authorities, the agency said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $1 million, the agency said on social media. It’s didn’t say exactly where the cocaine was found.

Vice President Harris postpones trip to Georgia

Vice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby.

Harris’ campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.

Harris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting on Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been canceled for now.

Debby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to Georgia and South Carolina as it heads east.

Debby forces flight cancellations at Florida airports

More than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there.

Nearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers.

Biden briefed on Debby's progress

President Joe Biden was briefed on Debby’s progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday.

The White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida’s request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said.

A 13-year-old boy dies when tree falls on mobile home in Florida, and officials report other deaths in storm

A 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff’s Office.

Officials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.

A truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.

East of Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida near where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.

Debby weakens to a tropical storm but flooding threat continues

Debby has weakened into a tropical storm with top winds hovering around 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was moving slowly to the northeast. It was expected to cross southeastern Georgia and to slow to a crawl as it turns to the east. Debby made landfall as a hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida, one of the state’s least populated areas.

Forecasters are still warning that heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Substantial rainfall was expected as well in central and northeast North Carolina through Wednesday morning.

Big worry is storm surge from Debby

Forecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend.

“That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,” John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.

In Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week.

Hundreds of thousands without power

More than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.

“When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that’s hazardous,” DeSantis said. “Don’t try to drive through this. We don’t want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don’t tempt fate, don’t try to go through these flooded streets.”

13-year-old boy killed when a tree falls on home during Hurricane Debby.,https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/dry-in-metro-atlanta-as-tremendous-rain-falls-in-south-georgia/M7HRSA35XRC25IYZF3JBSEOX7M/,"Debby has claimed the life of a teenager in South Georgia after walloping Florida with heavy rain and strong winds. Officials believe the tropical storm’s impact will be felt for several more days.

Colquitt County Coroner C. Verlyn Brock told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that a 19-year-old man died around 3:40 p.m. Monday after a large tree fell onto a side porch at a home along 13th Avenue in Moultrie, about 40 miles northwest of Valdosta. He was the first reported death in Georgia from Debby, after four others were killed in Florida since Sunday.

The system was downgraded to a tropical storm after making landfall in Steinhatchee, Florida, at 7 a.m. Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, according to the National Hurricane Center.

An hour later, Levy County Sheriff’s Office deputies got a call about a tree that had fallen onto a mobile home, crushing a 13-year-old boy in the small Gulf Coast town of Fanning Springs, Florida.

Also in Florida, a semi-truck driver was killed when his vehicle went into a canal in the Tampa area. Three hours north, in Dixie County, a driver lost control due to the weather, killing a 28-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy. A 13-year-old boy was also seriously injured.

The storm’s track is pushing it over South Georgia and toward the East Coast, where between 10 to 20 inches of rain are anticipated. That is in addition to several inches of rainfall that some areas have already seen in July.

“We have one farm in my area that had 21 inches of rain in July alone,” said state Sen. Russ Goodman, a South Georgia farmer. “Whoever has been praying for rain can stop now.”

Gov. Brian Kemp has issued a state of emergency that will be in effect through Thursday due to the threat of historic rainfall with the slow-moving storm. On Monday, Kemp signed an emergency order authorizing the call-up of as many as 2,000 Georgia National Guard troops.

“The big story with this is this thing is going to slam on the brakes,” Channel 2 Action News meteorologist Brian Monahan said. “It’s not going to move, and that is not good with tropical systems.”

5 am EDT: Hurricane #Debby very near landfall in the Florida Big Bend. Life-threatening storm surge expected in portions of Florida and major flooding is forecast for the southeastern U.S. Here are the Key Messages. https://t.co/tW4KeGdBFb pic.twitter.com/iPUOesfYM6 — National Hurricane Center (@NHC_Atlantic) August 5, 2024

On Sunday night, the storm registered 75 mph, upgrading it from a tropical storm to a hurricane at that point, according to the National Weather Service.

Dangerous storm surge conditions are expected along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts through the middle of the week, the NWS warns. Flash flooding is also expected along those coastlines.

The flooding, along with strong winds, will bring down trees and powerlines, causing the potential for extended outages.

“Get out,” Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency Director Chris Stallings said during a news conference Sunday evening.

“Get you and your family out ahead of time ... Just because the system isn’t a hurricane doesn’t mean that it’s not going to be impactful. Some of our most impactful floods have been tropical storms and tropical depressions here in Georgia,” he added.

Motorists should avoid driving into water that appears shallow. The water can be much deeper than expected, and currents could be swift enough to sweep vehicles from the road.

“This is a life-threatening situation,” the Hurricane Center warned. “Persons located within these areas should take all necessary actions to protect life and property from rising water and the potential for other dangerous conditions.”

As a result of the storm, Vice President Kamala Harris postponed her rally Friday in Savannah. She was set to headline with her yet-to-be-named running mate, part of a four-day swing through several battleground states.

It is the second time in less than a year that Valdosta and surrounding areas were expecting hurricane or tropical storm conditions. Hurricane Idalia brought damaging winds and flooding to the area last year.

As the core of Debby chugged toward Valdosta, there were moderate gusts of wind and rain. Locals like Jared O’Neal, whose power was out and whose home suffered $50,000 in damage last year during Idalia, were buying generators. The Lowe’s store on St. Augustine Road sold around 30 of them Monday morning.

“There is still a possibility to see some flooding rains with a total of 10 to 15 inches, which is what was forecasted,” Meghan Barwick, spokesperson for the Lowndes County Emergency Management Agency, said Monday afternoon. “We’re still heavy winds and some gusts. We’ve got power lines down, trees down. Nothing like Hurricane Idalia, but we still want our folks to be vigilant and stay off the roads and at home if they can. We haven’t gotten reports of extensive damage with trees through houses like we did with Idalia.”

In St. Simons, pounding rain and strong winds kept tourists and fisherman away from the main pier and nearby shops and restaurants Monday. Beaches were also deserted as residents and visitors still on the island prepared to hunker down.

The F.J. Torras Causeway, which connects Brunswick to St. Simons Island, remains open. According to a joint emergency declaration from Glynn County and Brunswick City commissioners, the causeway will remain open unless there are water hazards and flooding. The Sidney Lanier Bridge will remain open unless wind speeds reach 40 mph sustained. Any decision to close the bridge will be made by the Georgia Department of Transportation.

Glynn County and Brunswick are also opening an emergency shelter in Selden Park at 100 Genoa Martin Drive.

“The shelter’s first priority is to assist people displaced by high storm waters and flooding,” officials said.

While numerous restaurants on St. Simons Island are typically closed on Mondays, Southern Soul BBQ and sister eatery Frosty’s operate seven days a week. However, co-owner Griffin Bufkin opted to shut both of his restaurants Monday.

”The past three hurricanes that have come at us have done this behind the Gulf thing coming at us from the west. The part that really is the most dangerous is the nor’easter that comes with it,” Bufkin said.

Airlines have canceled hundreds of flights, including routes to and from cities in Florida. There were about 125 flights canceled at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport Monday, according to FlightAware.com. That includes more than 70 Delta Air Lines and Delta Connection flights.

Delta issued a travel waiver for Fort Myers, Gainesville, Jacksonville, Key West, Sarasota, Tallahassee and Tampa, as well as Valdosta. It is allowing people who had flights booked to, from or through those cities over the weekend through Monday to reschedule their flights to avoid the impact of the storm without paying a higher fare, subject to certain conditions.

Joe Marinelli, president and CEO of Visit Savannah, the local convention and visitors bureau, said one saving grace of the storm impact is that it will hit the area during the early part of the week — a slower period for tourism, with no citywide conventions in town. Marinelli said he didn’t want to discourage people from visiting later in the week or next weekend.

”It will have some impact on those that were maybe planning to come into Savannah a couple days early (before the weekend) … but you know, this too shall pass,” he said.

Marinelli said he suspects some restaurants, tour operators and museums may close Tuesday and Wednesday, but he was not aware of any hotels in Savannah relocating guests.

Marinelli said on Monday morning: “It’s raining right now, but nothing more than a normal rain. … The concern is that it’s going to rain nonstop for three days.”

Hurricane Debby has been downgraded to a tropical storm, with 70 mph winds, after making landfall early Monday morning as a Category 1 storm.

TAMPA, Fla. -- Hurricane Debby has been downgraded to a tropical storm, with 70 mph winds, after making landfall early Monday morning as a Category 1 storm. At least one person has also died from the storm, officials say.

Debby reached the Big Bend coast of Florida around 7 a.m. ET, bringing with it the potential for record-setting rains, catastrophic flooding and life-threatening storm surge as it moves slowly across the northern part of the state before stalling over the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina.

At least four people have been killed from Debby, authorities said.

A 13-year-old boy was killed when a tree fell on a mobile home Monday morning in Levy County, Florida, which encompasses Cedar Key, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.

""Our thoughts and prayers are with this family as they deal with this tragedy,"" the sheriff's office said in a statement. ""We encourage everyone to use extreme caution as they begin to assess and clean up the damage. Downed powerlines and falling trees are among the many hazards.""

In Hillsborough County, Florida, which encompasses Tampa, a driver of a semi was killed when the truck went into a canal off Interstate 275 Monday morning, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office.

Deputies recovered the semi and found the driver dead inside the cab, authorities said.

""It's just heartbreaking,"" Tampa Mayor Jane Castor told ABC News Live. ""We really ask everyone, one, to be aware of the weather situations in your area, and then heed the warnings. Especially the high wind and the water.""

In Dixie County, Florida, a driver ""lost control due to the inclement weather and wet roadway"" on Sunday night, crashing into the center median guardrail and then overturning the car, the Florida Highway Patrol said.

The driver, a 38-year-old woman, and a passenger, a 12-year-old boy, were killed, authorities said.

Another passenger, a 14-year-old boy, was seriously injured, the highway patrol said.

The storm made landfall as a Category 1 storm near Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida of less than 1,000 residents on Florida's Gulf Coast. It had maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (129 kph) and was moving northeast at 10 mph (17 kph), the National Hurricane Center in Miami said.

The storm weakened to a tropical storm just before 11 a.m. ET.

It made landfall in one of the least populated areas of Florida, but forecasters warned heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Nearly 214,000 customers were without power in Florida on Monday morning, according to PowerOutage.com.

A tornado watch also was in effect for parts of Florida and Georgia on Monday.

""Right now, we are to trying secure everything from floating away,"" said Sheryl Horne, whose family owns the Shell Island Fish Camp along the Wakulla River in St. Marks, Florida, where some customers moved their boats inland.

The sparsely populated Big Bend region in the Florida Panhandle also was hit last year by Hurricane Idalia, which made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane.

""I am used to storms and I'm used to cleaning up after storms,"" Horne said.

The National Weather Service in Tallahassee said Monday morning that heavy flooding was the biggest concern in the Big Bend regions, with storm surge expected across Apalachee Bay.

In Marion County, which is inland and south of Gainesville, sheriff's officials noted in a Facebook post Monday that crews were responding to reports of downed power lines and trees that have fallen on roadways and homes.

Images posted on social media by Cedar Key Fire Rescue early Monday showed floodwaters rising along the streets of the city, located south of where the storm made landfall. Water was ""coming in at a pretty heavy pace,"" the post said.

Debby was expected to move eastward over northern Florida and then stall over the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina, thrashing the region with potential record-setting rains totaling up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) beginning Tuesday.

Officials also warned of life-threatening storm surge along Florida's Gulf Coast, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation expected Monday between the Ochlockonee and Suwannee rivers.

""There's some really amazing rainfall totals being forecast and amazing in a bad way,"" Michael Brennan, director of the hurricane center, said at a briefing. ""That would be record-breaking rainfall associated with a tropical cyclone for both the states of Georgia and South Carolina if we got up to the 30-inch level.""

Flooding could last through Friday and is expected to be especially severe in low-lying areas near the coast, including Savannah, Georgia; Hilton Head, South Carolina; and Charleston, South Carolina. North Carolina officials were monitoring the storm's progress.

Hurricane Debby made landfall around 7 a.m. ET on Monday along Florida's Gulf Coast.

Officials in Savannah said the area could see a month's worth of rain in four days if the system stalls over the region.

""This is going to a significant storm,"" Savannah Mayor Van. R. Johnson said during a press conference.

Debby's outer bands earlier grazed the west coast of Florida, flooding streets and bringing power outages. Sarasota County officials said most roadways on Siesta Key, a barrier island off the coast of Sarasota, were under water.

At a briefing Sunday afternoon, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned the storm could lead to ""really, really significant flooding that will happen in North Central Florida.""

The storm would follow a similar track to Hurricane Idalia but would ""be much wetter. We are going to see much more inundation,"" he said.

Debby is the fourth named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season after Tropical Storm Alberto, Hurricane Beryl and Tropical Storm Chris, all of which formed in June. In the Eastern Pacific, tropical storms Carlotta, Daniel and Emilia all churned over the ocean, but they weren't threatening land.

Residents, businesses prepare for flooding



Residents in Steinhatchee, Florida, which flooded during Hurricane Idalia, spent Sunday moving items to higher ground to prepare for Debby.

""I've been here 29 years. This isn't the first time I've done it. Do you get used to it? No,"" Mark Reblin said as he moved items out of the liquor store he owns.

Employees of Savannah Canoe and Kayak in Georgia said they were busy tying down their watercrafts, laying sandbags and raising equipment off the ground. Mayme Bouy, the store manager, said she wasn't too concerned about the forecast calling for a potential historic rain event.

""But we do have some high tides this week so if the rain is happening around then, that could be bad,"" Bouy added. ""I'd rather play it safe than sorry.""

Governors declared emergencies ahead of landfall



DeSantis declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida's 67 counties, with the National Guard activating 3,000 guard members. Utility crews from in and out of state were ready to restore power after the storm, he said in a post on X.

In Tampa alone, officials gave out more than 30,000 sandbags to barricade against flooding.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster made their own emergency declarations.

Northeast coast also preparing for storm conditions



Emergency managers in New England and New York were monitoring the path of the storm for the possibility of remnants striking their states. Northeast states including New York and Vermont have been hit by heavy rain and thunderstorms in recent weeks and were still coping with flooding and saturated ground.

13-year-old boy killed when a tree falls on home during Hurricane Debby.,https://www.wftv.com/news/tropical-storm-debby/YARYDGTYEZFMZDVHXADOBI3UJ4/,"HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. — (AP) — Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida on Monday with torrential rain and high winds, contributing to at least four deaths in the state and the rescue of hundreds from flooded homes before turning menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard's low-lying regions and threatening to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities.

Record-setting rain was causing flash flooding, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) possible in some areas, the National Hurricane Center said.

About 500 people were rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said in a social media post. It was one of the cities hardest hit by flooding on Monday.

“Essentially we’ve had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,” Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said in a social media update.

Just north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.

“We are facing an unprecedented weather event with Hurricane Debby,” said Jodie Fiske, public safety director for Manatee County public. “The safety of our residents is our top priority, and we are doing everything in our power to respond effectively to this crisis.""

A flash flood emergency was issued into Monday evening for the Lake City area in the north central part of the state, where up to a foot (30.5 centimeters) of rain had fallen and more was expected.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that the state could continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.

“It is a very saturating, wet storm,” he said during an afternoon briefing at the state’s emergency operations center. “When they crest and the water that’s going to come down from Georgia, it’s just something that we’re going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.”

Debby made landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It since has weakened to a tropical storm and is moving slowly, covering roads with water and contributing to at least five deaths.

A truck driver died on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff’s office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet (12 meters) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.

A 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, according to the Levy County Sheriff’s Office.

And in Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night. The Florida Highway Patrol said a 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries.

In southern Georgia, a 19-year-old man died Monday afternoon when a large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

Nearly 200,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.

Airports were also affected. More than 1,600 flights had been canceled nationwide, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com.

The potential for high water also threatened Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina.

Local leaders in Savannah said flooding could happen in areas that don’t usually get high water if Debby stalls out over the city. With winds and rainfall expected to worsen overnight, authorities issued a curfew from 10 p.m. Monday until 6 a.m. Tuesday.

“This type of rain hovering over us, coming with the intensity that they tell us it is coming, it’s going to catch a whole lot of people by surprise,” said Chatham County Chairman Chester Ellis.

In South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a “historic and potentially unprecedented event” three times in a 90-second briefing Monday morning.

The city of Charleston has an emergency plan in place that includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding. Officials announced a curfew for the city starting at 11 p.m. as some of the heaviest rain is expected to fall overnight.

North Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Gov. Roy Cooper declared it in an executive order signed Monday. Several areas along the state's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks, according to the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program.

North Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.

In 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding. In 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.

President Joe Biden was briefed on Debby’s progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said. Biden approved a request from South Carolina’s governor for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said he has asked Biden to issue a preemptive federal emergency declaration to speed the flow of federal aid to the state.

Vice President Kamala Harris has postponed a campaign stop scheduled for Thursday in Savannah, Georgia.

Debby made landfall near Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida of less than 1,000 residents. It's not far from where Hurricane Idalia made landfall less than a year ago as a Category 3 storm.

Sue Chewning lives in nearby Cross City and has weathered both storms. In her nearly 73 years of living in the area, she said she doesn’t recall any direct hits from a hurricane — until this one-two punch from Idalia and Debby.

“Some people may say, ‘I can’t take this anymore’. But I think for the most part … it’s a close-knit community and most of the local people, they’re going to stay, dig down, help each other,” Chewning said.

Gainesville neighborhoods impacted by flooding

Some Gainesville neighborhoods weren't as lucky as others when it came to issues of flooding caused by Hurricane Debby. The Weatherly subdivision off Southwest 23rd Avenue near Fort Clark Boulevard had flooding in both directions inside its entrance, with water beginning to creep up some residents' driveways.

A few miles southwest, the entrance to the Hayes Glen subdivision off Southwest Eight Avenue was flooded, as were the yards of a couple of homes. One home with a large front yard appeared to have water nearly all the way to its front door. A mobile pump was setup to help with the problem.

The usual flood-prone neighborhoods of Robin Lane and the Hills of Sante Fe were spared thanks to permanent pumps installed by the county.

Alachua County update: Rain totals, road closures and more

In a brief interview with The Sun, Alachua County spokesperson Mark Sexton said Monday morning that the county has not yet suffered any ""critical damage"" as a result of Hurricane Debby.

He said utility crews, public works and law enforcement are all out and providing services to residents.

Sexton said the county has received between 1 to 4 inches of rain, with the most being in the Archer and Newberry areas. The area has seen sustained winds of 10 to 20 mph with gusts over 40 mph.

Sexton said because of how slow the storm is moving, some areas could see as much as 20 inches of rain.

“A huge concern was how wet the ground was before this storm even came. That’s why we did the evacuations yesterday,” Sexton said.

Sexton said nine people used the special-needs shelter while a combined 11 people used the two general shelters. All three shelters remain open.

Sexton also noted that the county has seen 10 times the normal number of minor traffic crashes due to the storm. He said road closures due to downed trees include the 8700 block of Southwest 24th Avenue, and Southwest 171st Street south of Southwest 170th Street.

Hurrcane Debby thrashed thrashed parts of Florida on Monday after making landfall and bringing risks of flooding, dangerous storm surge and power ourages.

The National Hurricane Center announced at around 7am that Debby had made landfall near Steinhatchee, Florida, with winds of 80 mph, making it a Category 1 storm. It has since been downgraded to a tropical storm.

The deadly winds ultimately led to the tragic death of a 13-year-old boy in Levy County after a tree fell on a mobile home and the death of a semi-truck driver in Hillsborough County after the truck veered off into a canal. Two other people, including a 12-year-old boy, were killed in a crash in Dixie County. A falling tree killed a fifth person, a 19-year-old, in Moultrie, Georgia.

Debby will travel across Florida before blowing through southern Georgia on Tuesday. The storm is forecasted to hit South Carolina Wednesday through Friday before calming.

More than 147,000 in the Sunshine State were without electricity as of late Monday, according to utilities tracking site PowerOutage.us."
13-year-old boy killed when a tree falls on home during Hurricane Debby.,https://nypost.com/2024/08/05/us-news/at-least-4-dead-as-debby-weakens-to-tropical-storm-while-flooding-rain-storm-surge-continue-to-lash-florida/,"STEINHATCHEE, Fla. – At least four deaths have been attributed to Hurricane Debby, which made landfall along Florida’s Big Bend early Monday morning.

The now-tropical storm continues to blast the state as it moves inland with flooding rain, damaging winds and a life-threatening storm surge.

The Category 1 storm hit near Steinhatchee about 7 a.m. ET with winds estimated at 80 mph.

After landfall, power outages skyrocketed to more than 300,000 utility customers in the Sunshine State, according to PowerOutage.us.

Officials confirmed two deaths in Dixie County, Florida, as Debby approached the coastline.

A 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy, both from Crawfordville, were killed in a crash just before 9:30 p.m. Sunday on US Highway 19 after their car lost control and struck a guardrail.

Witnesses told troopers that it appeared as if the vehicle lost control due to the inclement weather and wet roadway.

A 13-year-old boy was also killed about 8 a.m. Monday after a tree fell on a mobile home in Levy County. No other injuries were reported, deputies said.

“Our thoughts and prayers are with this family as they deal with this tragedy,” the sheriff’s office said. “We encourage everyone to use extreme caution as they begin to assess and clean up the damage. Downed powerlines and falling trees are among the many hazards. One life is too many. Please be safe.”

A fourth person died after the tractor-trailer he was driving on southbound Interstate 75 near the Tampa Bypass Canal lost control on the wet roadway, troopers said.

The 64-year-old New Albany, Mississippi, man’s semi collided with a concrete barrier wall. The trailer came to rest hanging from the bridge while the cab separated and fell into the canal.

Divers from the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office located the cab submerged approximately 40 feet below the surface with the driver found dead inside the cab.

By midweek, Debby is expected to dump extreme amounts of nearly 2 feet of rain on parts of Georgia and South Carolina.

The National Hurricane Center is forecasting “potentially historic rainfall” across southeastern Georgia and South Carolina through Friday, causing widespread flash flooding and life-threatening conditions.

The governors of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina have declared a state of emergency and are urging residents to prepare for the multiple impacts the storm will bring.

“I think what’s going to make this much different than what we had with Idalia is it is going to move very slowly once it enters Florida – it’s going to be southern Georgia, northern Florida – and it is just going to drop an inordinate amount of water on the north-central Florida region,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis told FOX Weather on Sunday.

Where is Tropical Storm Debby now?

The center of Debby is situated about 35 miles west of Lake City, Florida. The now-tropical storm’s winds are estimated at 70 mph.

What impacts will Debby have?

Flooding rain, strong winds and storm surge were already lashing the Sunshine State before Debby made landfall Monday morning.

Several feet of storm surge and hurricane-force winds are forecast to pummel Florida as the storm continues to move inland.

Views from the Fort Myers area showed feet of flooding Sunday afternoon as rainbands from Debby lashed the state.

In St. Petersburg, waves lashed the coast as tropical-storm-force winds howled.

Now that Debby has made landfall, the storm is expected to move northeastward through Florida and bring historic rain and life-threatening storm surge to Georgia and the Carolinas.

Where is Tropical Storm Debby headed?

Debby will move northeastward and track across southeastern Georgia on Monday night and Tuesday. From there, the forecast becomes less certain.

Hurricane Debby has been downgraded to a tropical storm, with 70 mph winds, after making landfall early Monday morning as a Category 1 storm.

TAMPA, Fla. -- Hurricane Debby has been downgraded to a tropical storm, with 70 mph winds, after making landfall early Monday morning as a Category 1 storm. At least one person has also died from the storm, officials say.

Debby reached the Big Bend coast of Florida around 7 a.m. ET, bringing with it the potential for record-setting rains, catastrophic flooding and life-threatening storm surge as it moves slowly across the northern part of the state before stalling over the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina.

At least four people have been killed from Debby, authorities said.

A 13-year-old boy was killed when a tree fell on a mobile home Monday morning in Levy County, Florida, which encompasses Cedar Key, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.

""Our thoughts and prayers are with this family as they deal with this tragedy,"" the sheriff's office said in a statement. ""We encourage everyone to use extreme caution as they begin to assess and clean up the damage. Downed powerlines and falling trees are among the many hazards.""

In Hillsborough County, Florida, which encompasses Tampa, a driver of a semi was killed when the truck went into a canal off Interstate 275 Monday morning, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office.

Deputies recovered the semi and found the driver dead inside the cab, authorities said.

""It's just heartbreaking,"" Tampa Mayor Jane Castor told ABC News Live. ""We really ask everyone, one, to be aware of the weather situations in your area, and then heed the warnings. Especially the high wind and the water.""

In Dixie County, Florida, a driver ""lost control due to the inclement weather and wet roadway"" on Sunday night, crashing into the center median guardrail and then overturning the car, the Florida Highway Patrol said.

The driver, a 38-year-old woman, and a passenger, a 12-year-old boy, were killed, authorities said.

Another passenger, a 14-year-old boy, was seriously injured, the highway patrol said.

The storm made landfall as a Category 1 storm near Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida of less than 1,000 residents on Florida's Gulf Coast. It had maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (129 kph) and was moving northeast at 10 mph (17 kph), the National Hurricane Center in Miami said.

The storm weakened to a tropical storm just before 11 a.m. ET.

It made landfall in one of the least populated areas of Florida, but forecasters warned heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Nearly 214,000 customers were without power in Florida on Monday morning, according to PowerOutage.com.

A tornado watch also was in effect for parts of Florida and Georgia on Monday.

""Right now, we are to trying secure everything from floating away,"" said Sheryl Horne, whose family owns the Shell Island Fish Camp along the Wakulla River in St. Marks, Florida, where some customers moved their boats inland.

The sparsely populated Big Bend region in the Florida Panhandle also was hit last year by Hurricane Idalia, which made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane.

""I am used to storms and I'm used to cleaning up after storms,"" Horne said.

The National Weather Service in Tallahassee said Monday morning that heavy flooding was the biggest concern in the Big Bend regions, with storm surge expected across Apalachee Bay.

In Marion County, which is inland and south of Gainesville, sheriff's officials noted in a Facebook post Monday that crews were responding to reports of downed power lines and trees that have fallen on roadways and homes.

Images posted on social media by Cedar Key Fire Rescue early Monday showed floodwaters rising along the streets of the city, located south of where the storm made landfall. Water was ""coming in at a pretty heavy pace,"" the post said.

Debby was expected to move eastward over northern Florida and then stall over the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina, thrashing the region with potential record-setting rains totaling up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) beginning Tuesday.

Officials also warned of life-threatening storm surge along Florida's Gulf Coast, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation expected Monday between the Ochlockonee and Suwannee rivers.

""There's some really amazing rainfall totals being forecast and amazing in a bad way,"" Michael Brennan, director of the hurricane center, said at a briefing. ""That would be record-breaking rainfall associated with a tropical cyclone for both the states of Georgia and South Carolina if we got up to the 30-inch level.""

Flooding could last through Friday and is expected to be especially severe in low-lying areas near the coast, including Savannah, Georgia; Hilton Head, South Carolina; and Charleston, South Carolina. North Carolina officials were monitoring the storm's progress.

Hurricane Debby made landfall around 7 a.m. ET on Monday along Florida's Gulf Coast.

Officials in Savannah said the area could see a month's worth of rain in four days if the system stalls over the region.

""This is going to a significant storm,"" Savannah Mayor Van. R. Johnson said during a press conference.

Debby's outer bands earlier grazed the west coast of Florida, flooding streets and bringing power outages. Sarasota County officials said most roadways on Siesta Key, a barrier island off the coast of Sarasota, were under water.

At a briefing Sunday afternoon, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned the storm could lead to ""really, really significant flooding that will happen in North Central Florida.""

The storm would follow a similar track to Hurricane Idalia but would ""be much wetter. We are going to see much more inundation,"" he said.

Debby is the fourth named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season after Tropical Storm Alberto, Hurricane Beryl and Tropical Storm Chris, all of which formed in June. In the Eastern Pacific, tropical storms Carlotta, Daniel and Emilia all churned over the ocean, but they weren't threatening land.

Residents, businesses prepare for flooding



Residents in Steinhatchee, Florida, which flooded during Hurricane Idalia, spent Sunday moving items to higher ground to prepare for Debby.

""I've been here 29 years. This isn't the first time I've done it. Do you get used to it? No,"" Mark Reblin said as he moved items out of the liquor store he owns.

Employees of Savannah Canoe and Kayak in Georgia said they were busy tying down their watercrafts, laying sandbags and raising equipment off the ground. Mayme Bouy, the store manager, said she wasn't too concerned about the forecast calling for a potential historic rain event.

""But we do have some high tides this week so if the rain is happening around then, that could be bad,"" Bouy added. ""I'd rather play it safe than sorry.""

Governors declared emergencies ahead of landfall



DeSantis declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida's 67 counties, with the National Guard activating 3,000 guard members. Utility crews from in and out of state were ready to restore power after the storm, he said in a post on X.

In Tampa alone, officials gave out more than 30,000 sandbags to barricade against flooding.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster made their own emergency declarations.

Northeast coast also preparing for storm conditions



Emergency managers in New England and New York were monitoring the path of the storm for the possibility of remnants striking their states. Northeast states including New York and Vermont have been hit by heavy rain and thunderstorms in recent weeks and were still coping with flooding and saturated ground.

13-year-old boy killed when a tree falls on home during Hurricane Debby.,https://www.wftv.com/news/hurricane-debby/YARYDGTYEZFMZDVHXADOBI3UJ4/,"HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. — (AP) — Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida on Monday with torrential rain and high winds, contributing to at least four deaths in the state and the rescue of hundreds from flooded homes before turning menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard's low-lying regions and threatening to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities.

Record-setting rain was causing flash flooding, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) possible in some areas, the National Hurricane Center said.

About 500 people were rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said in a social media post. It was one of the cities hardest hit by flooding on Monday.

“Essentially we’ve had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,” Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said in a social media update.

Just north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.

“We are facing an unprecedented weather event with Hurricane Debby,” said Jodie Fiske, public safety director for Manatee County public. “The safety of our residents is our top priority, and we are doing everything in our power to respond effectively to this crisis.""

A flash flood emergency was issued into Monday evening for the Lake City area in the north central part of the state, where up to a foot (30.5 centimeters) of rain had fallen and more was expected.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that the state could continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.

“It is a very saturating, wet storm,” he said during an afternoon briefing at the state’s emergency operations center. “When they crest and the water that’s going to come down from Georgia, it’s just something that we’re going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.”

Debby made landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It since has weakened to a tropical storm and is moving slowly, covering roads with water and contributing to at least five deaths.

A truck driver died on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff’s office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet (12 meters) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.

A 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, according to the Levy County Sheriff’s Office.

And in Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night. The Florida Highway Patrol said a 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries.

In southern Georgia, a 19-year-old man died Monday afternoon when a large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

Nearly 200,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.

Airports were also affected. More than 1,600 flights had been canceled nationwide, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com.

The potential for high water also threatened Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina.

Local leaders in Savannah said flooding could happen in areas that don’t usually get high water if Debby stalls out over the city. With winds and rainfall expected to worsen overnight, authorities issued a curfew from 10 p.m. Monday until 6 a.m. Tuesday.

“This type of rain hovering over us, coming with the intensity that they tell us it is coming, it’s going to catch a whole lot of people by surprise,” said Chatham County Chairman Chester Ellis.

In South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a “historic and potentially unprecedented event” three times in a 90-second briefing Monday morning.

The city of Charleston has an emergency plan in place that includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding. Officials announced a curfew for the city starting at 11 p.m. as some of the heaviest rain is expected to fall overnight.

North Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Gov. Roy Cooper declared it in an executive order signed Monday. Several areas along the state's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks, according to the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program.

North Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.

In 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding. In 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.

President Joe Biden was briefed on Debby’s progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said. Biden approved a request from South Carolina’s governor for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said he has asked Biden to issue a preemptive federal emergency declaration to speed the flow of federal aid to the state.

Vice President Kamala Harris has postponed a campaign stop scheduled for Thursday in Savannah, Georgia.

Debby made landfall near Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida of less than 1,000 residents. It's not far from where Hurricane Idalia made landfall less than a year ago as a Category 3 storm.

Sue Chewning lives in nearby Cross City and has weathered both storms. In her nearly 73 years of living in the area, she said she doesn’t recall any direct hits from a hurricane — until this one-two punch from Idalia and Debby.

“Some people may say, ‘I can’t take this anymore’. But I think for the most part … it’s a close-knit community and most of the local people, they’re going to stay, dig down, help each other,” Chewning said.

TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Hurricane Debby reached the Big Bend coast of Florida early Monday, bringing with it the potential for record-setting rains, catastrophic flooding and life-threatening storm surge as it moves slowly across the northern part of the state before stalling over the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina.

The storm made landfall as a Category 1 storm near Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida of less than 1,000 residents on Florida’s Gulf Coast. It had maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (129 kph) and was moving northeast at 10 mph (17 kph), the National Hurricane Center in Miami said.

Here’s the Latest:

Curfew announced for Savannah and surrounding county as Debby approaches

With Debby’s winds and rains expected to worsen overnight, officials for Savannah and surrounding Chatham County announced that an overnight curfew will take effect at 10 p.m. Monday and run to 6 a.m. Tuesday. The National Hurricane Center says the region can expect rains that could exceed 20 inches (51 centimeters).

By Monday afternoon, the storm’s outer bands were lashing Tybee Island, home to Georgia’s largest public beach, blowing sheets of rain sideways and rattling street signs near the beach pier. The island of 3,100 residents east of Savannah was bracing for a potential double-dose of flooding from an expected 2 to 4 feet of storm surge on top of rainfall.

“This is unprecedented rainfall,” said Michelle Owens, Tybee Island’s interim city manager. She added: “We don’t know what that looks like. So we have to be prepared for the worst. But we are definitely hoping for the best.”

Public works crews used earthmoving equipment to heap sand over beach access points to help fortify a storm surge buffer offered by surrounding dunes. Owens said the city also had given out about 2,000 sandbags to island residents.

Angela Thompson had several sandbags ready by the front door of her ground-level apartment near Tybee Creek on the island’s west side. She had just started moving in earlier this week and hoped to ride out the storm while unpacking.

“I have food and water and batteries and the things that I need, and I’m going to stay as long as I can,” Thompson said.

Florida will be on alert for flooding for the next week, Gov. Ron DeSantis says

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because Tropical Storm Debby is moving toward Georgia, that doesn’t mean the state won’t continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.

“It is a very saturating, wet storm,” DeSantis said during a briefing at the state’s emergency operations center. “When they crest and the water that’s going to come down from Georgia, it’s just something that we’re going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.”

Record-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, according to the National Hurricane Center. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over Florida’s gulf coast. The storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast and was expected to slow down as it turns to the east.

No deaths or injuries in Florida county where Debby made landfall, sheriff says

The sheriff of Florida’s Taylor County, where Debby came ashore as a hurricane Monday, says there are no deaths or injuries in the sparsely populated area located in the state’s northern Big Bend region.

But Sheriff Wayne Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying and coastal areas to wait before returning because the tide will be coming in and it’s unknown how deep the water might get. Several roads are closed due to flooding as well as trees and power lines downed by the storm, Padgett said.

Debby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of less than 1,000 residents.

Mayor warns tourists, residents on South Carolina’s Hilton Head Island: Don’t let your guard down

No evacuations were planned Monday on South Carolina’s Hilton Head Island, one of the state’s most popular beach destinations. But Mayor Alan Perry warned tourists and residents not to let their guard down with forecasts predicting up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain this week from Debby.

“We don’t know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,” Perry said. “If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.”

In a video posted on Facebook, Perry asked island residents and visitors to check on each other before the heavy rain starts — and maybe help the city out by checking storm drains. “If you are able to go out and pull some debris from those drains so they can drain, that’s is really key to preventing additional flooding,” he said.

Hilton Head Island has about 38,000 residents. Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days.

In saturated Savannah, residents prepare for potentially historic rains

As Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rains across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city’s suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area already is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service.

Jim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won’t be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors.

“A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,” Froncak said. “So whatever’s coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.”

City crews spent days ahead of Debby’s arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago.

Packages containing cocaine wash up on beach in Florida Keys during storm, Border Patrol says

In the Florida Keys, Debby blew packages containing 70 pounds (32 kilograms) of cocaine onto a beach, the U.S. Border Patrol’s Miami sector reported Monday.

A “good Samaritan” found the drugs and contacted authorities, the agency said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $1 million, the agency said on social media. It’s didn’t say exactly where the cocaine was found.

Vice President Harris postpones trip to Georgia

Vice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby.

Harris’ campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.

Harris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting on Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been canceled for now.

Debby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to Georgia and South Carolina as it heads east.

Debby forces flight cancellations at Florida airports

More than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there.

Nearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers.

Biden briefed on Debby’s progress

President Joe Biden was briefed on Debby’s progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday.

The White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida’s request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said.

A 13-year-old boy dies when tree falls on mobile home in Florida, and officials report other deaths in storm

A 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff’s Office.

Officials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.

A truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.

East of Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida near where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.

Debby weakens to a tropical storm but flooding threat continues

Debby has weakened into a tropical storm with top winds hovering around 70 mph (110 kph). The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast, and was expected to decrease in speed as it turns to the east. Debby made landfall as a hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida, one of the state’s least populated areas.

Forecasters are still warning that heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia.

Big worry is storm surge from Debby

Forecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend.

“That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,” John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.

In Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week.

Hundreds of thousands without power

More than 350,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday, according to PowerOutage.com.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.

“When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that’s hazardous,” DeSantis said. “Don’t try to drive through this. We don’t want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don’t tempt fate, don’t try to go through these flooded streets.”

Residents, businesses prepare for flooding

Residents in Steinhatchee, Florida, which flooded during Hurricane Idalia, spent Sunday moving items to higher ground to prepare for Debby.

“I’ve been here 29 years. This isn’t the first time I’ve done it. Do you get used to it? No,” Mark Reblin said as he moved items out of the liquor store he owns.

Employees of Savannah Canoe and Kayak in Georgia said they were busy tying down their watercrafts, laying sandbags and raising equipment off the ground. Mayme Bouy, the store manager, said she wasn’t too concerned about the forecast calling for a potential historic rain event.

“But we do have some high tides this week so if the rain is happening around then, that could be bad,” Bouy added. “I’d rather play it safe than sorry.”

Governors declared emergencies ahead of landfall

DeSantis declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida’s 67 counties, with the National Guard activating 3,000 guard members. Utility crews from in and out of state were ready to restore power after the storm, he said in a post on X.

In Tampa alone, officials gave out more than 30,000 sandbags to barricade against flooding.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster made their own emergency declarations.

Northeast coast also preparing for storm conditions

Emergency managers in New England and New York were monitoring the path of the storm for the possibility of remnants striking their states. Northeast states including New York and Vermont have been hit by heavy rain and thunderstorms in recent weeks and were still coping with flooding and saturated ground.

13-year-old boy killed when a tree falls on home during Hurricane Debby.,https://www.cleveland19.com/2024/08/05/its-devastating-all-us-non-verbal-girl-7-found-dead-pond-near-family-home/?outputType,"ST. JOHNS COUNTY, Fla. (WFOX) – An entire Florida neighborhood came together to search for 7-year-old Adalyn Laymon when the girl, who is non-verbal, went missing.

However, an hour after the St. Johns County Sheriff’s Office put out an alert about Adalyn, her body was found in the retention pond behind her house.

Adalyn’s body was found by a firefighter and deputy underneath the water not far from the shore.

The two immediately began CPR on the girl and rushed her to the hospital. Sadly, she later passed away.

Ed Nolan, a neighbor of the family, said the news was horrible.

“It’s devastating to all of us in the community to hear this very, very sad news. Our hearts go out to the family and our condolences to all of them,” he said.

St. Johns County Fire Rescue has responded to six drowning calls this year, with Adalyn’s being the first that was fatal.

The Florida Department of Children and Families said 75 drownings have happened in the state so far this year.

Stacey Hoaglund is the president of the autism society of Florida.

According to her data, she said there have been 12 more drownings this year so far compared to last year.

“We are sadly in a really bad place at this point of this year,” she said.

She said children with autism are typically drawn to the water.

“There’s nothing like water. It’s very sensory,” she said. “Unfortunately, they’re drawn to water, and if they’re not prepared for entering the water, you know, something devastating could happen.”

Hoagland is encouraging parents to teach their kids how to swim in all bodies of water, learn CPR and also set up barriers.

“You have to have alarms on your doors. You have to have locks on your doors. You have to have fencing around your pools, or, you know, your backyard,” she said.

Original report: The storm is expected to bring surges and flooding as it moves north-northwest at 10 mph. There was also a tornado watch in portions of Florida and Georgia.

Once it brings wind and rain in Florida it is expected to stall over Georgia and South Carolina coastal regions, The Associated Press reported. It may bring rainfall as much as 30 inches with flooding potentially lasting through Friday.

“There’s some really amazing rainfall totals being forecast and amazing in a bad way,” Michael Brennan, director of the National Hurricane Center, said. “That would be record-breaking rainfall associated with a tropical cyclone for both the states of Georgia and South Carolina if we got up to the 30-inch level.”

“Right now, we are to trying secure everything from floating away,” Sheryl Horne said. Horne’s family owns Shell Island Fish Camp in St. Marks, Florida. “I am used to storms and I’m used to cleaning up after storms.”

In a joint social media post, Freddie and Chelsea Freeman said Maximus returned home after an eight-day stay in a pediatric intensive care unit.

“Max still has a long road ahead of him to regain his strength and relearn how to walk. But we are so thankful to have our family back together,” the post said.

In a previous social media post, the couple said Maximus “went into full-body paralysis” and was rushed to the hospital to “reinforce his lungs.” Maximus’ health later improved. His breathing tube was removed, and he was taken off a ventilator on Wednesday.

According to the Mayo Clinic, Guillain-Barre syndrome is a condition in which the body’s immune system attacks the nerves. While there is no cure, most people fully recover.

Freeman was scratched from Los Angeles’ lineup on July 25 and then placed on the family emergency list a day later. He has not played since.

An eight-time All-Star, Freeman is hitting .288 with 16 home runs and 67 RBIs.

Supreme Court rejects Missouri's long-shot bid to block Trump's gag order.,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-rejects-missouris-long-shot-bid-block-trumps-gag-order-h-rcna163629,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday declined to intervene in a long-shot lawsuit brought by Missouri attempting to block legal proceedings in former President Donald Trump's hush money case in New York.

The court rejected Missouri's bid to sue the state of New York, meaning the justices will not lift the gag order or delay sentencing in the unusual claim brought by Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Republican who is running for a full term this fall.

Many commentators said the filing was more of a political stunt aimed at gaining publicity than a serious legal claim. It echoed to some extent an attempt by Texas in 2020 to challenge election results in states that Trump lost to President Joe Biden in the presidential election, which the Supreme Court also swiftly rejected.

""New York is working to hijack our national election and jail President Trump. Missourians absolutely have an interest in ensuring that does not happen,"" Bailey said Monday in a post on X.

A spokesman for New York Attorney General Letitia James declined to comment.

The brief order noted that two conservative justices, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, would have allowed the state to at least file its lawsuit directly at the Supreme Court although they would not grant the emergency relief that Bailey wanted. That tracks their approach in similar cases involving one state suing another, including the 2020 election case.

Trump was convicted of 34 counts for falsifying business records related to payments made to attorney Michael Cohen as reimbursement for hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the closing days of the 2016 campaign. Daniels testified she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006, which he has denied.

New York Judge Juan Merchan issued an initial gag order in March ahead of Trump’s trial. After the trial, Merchan lifted some of the restrictions, allowing him to speak about the witnesses who testified and the jury.

Trump remains restricted from commenting on court staff, individual prosecutors and family members of those involved in the case.

It remains unclear if Trump will even be sentenced before November's election. Sentencing was initially scheduled for July but has already been delayed to September at the earliest.

Bailey took the rare step of trying to sue the state of New York before the Supreme Court, which has jurisdiction over disputes between states.

Usually, such disputes involve issues like water rights over rivers that cross state lines.

It would have been highly unusual for the Supreme Court to allow a state to interfere with judicial proceedings in another state.

Bailey claimed in his filing that the gag order and a potential sentence prevented Missouri voters from hearing relevant information from a presidential candidate in the midst of the campaign.

""Missouri has a strong, judicially enforceable interest in its citizens and electors being able to hear Trump’s campaigning free from any gag order or other interference imposed by the State of New York,"" he wrote in the court filing.

In responding to the claims, James said in a court filing there was no basis for the Supreme Court to get involved, saying that the complaint ""consists of generalized and speculative grievances.""

Trump, she added, ""already can speak about all of the topics"" the state says voters might want to hear about.

Bailey, James said, ""is clearly and impermissibly seeking to further the individual interests of former President Trump.""

Before the trial, Trump was fined for violating the original gag order, especially as it related to Cohen, one of the key witnesses.

Bailey was appointed attorney general by Missouri Gov. Mike Parson when the incumbent, Eric Schmitt, was elected to the Senate in 2022. Bailey is now running for a full term."

Supreme Court rejects Missouri’s request to block Trump’s New York gag order, sentencing

By Amy Howe

at 5:03 pm

The Supreme Court on Monday turned down a plea from Missouri to block New York from imposing a gag order and sentencing former President Donald Trump in his criminal proceedings there until after the 2024 elections.

After a six-week trial, Trump was convicted in May in a New York state court on 34 counts of falsifying business records. Prosecutors contended that Trump sought to hide a $130,000 payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election, made in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump in 2006. (Trump has denied any sexual relationship with Daniels.)

Trump’s sentencing was originally scheduled for July 11, but it has been postponed at least until September in the wake of the Supreme Court’s July 1 decision holding that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution for their official acts.

In a brief unsigned order without any explanation, the justices rejected a long-shot bid by Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey to file a lawsuit against New York directly in the Supreme Court. Bailey told the justices that he wanted to ensure that voters in Missouri and elsewhere could hear from Trump and that Trump could “freely travel and campaign” without the gag order.

Bailey criticized Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for having brought “transparently weak charges for the transparent purpose of trying to impose political damage against Trump and trying to restrain his ability to campaign in advance of an election forecasted by the polls to be very close.”

New York Attorney General Letitia James countered that Missouri has not outlined the kind of tangible harm to its state interests that it needs to bring this lawsuit. Instead, James contended, “Missouri is clearly and impermissibly seeking to further the individual interests of former President Trump.”

Missouri has also not shown, James continued, that New York is causing it any harm. Missouri’s complaint seeks to block orders obtained by Bragg, the Manhattan DA, in a state trial court. “Allowing Missouri to file this suit for such relief against New York would permit an extraordinary and dangerous end-run around former President Trump’s ongoing state court proceedings and the statutory limitations on this Court’s jurisdiction to review state court decisions.”

Moreover, James added, after the May verdict against Trump, Judge Juan Merchan lifted most of the order limiting Trump’s out-of-court statements, including the bar on attacking witnesses and jurors.

Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito indicated that they would have allowed Missouri to file its complaint against New York.

The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected the state of Missouri’s long-shot bid at halting former President Donald Trump’s sentencing and gag order in his New York hush money case. Missouri had argued that the rights of Missouri voters to hear from presidential candidates were being violated by the New York criminal proceeding.

In an unsigned two-sentence order, the court denied Missouri's motion for leave to file a bill of complaint, and dismissed as moot the state's motion for preliminary relief or a stay.

Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito would have grant the motion for leave to file the bill of complaint, the order said, but not grant other relief.

In May, a New York jury convicted former Trump on 34 counts of falsifying business records. The charges stemmed from payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels to prevent her from publicizing an alleged affair in the leadup to the 2016 election. Trump denied the affair and said that he intends to appeal the conviction.

In the meantime, Missouri’s Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey took the extremely unusual step of seeking permission from the high court to file a so-called original appeal, which normally involves disputes between states over such matters as water rights and boundary disputes. In this case, however, Bailey sought to file a complaint aimed at delaying Trump’s sentencing and removing restrictions on the former president’s speech — a move so unconventional that Georgetown law professor Stephen Vladeck called it “frankly, ridiculous.”

New York, in response, accused Missouri of “bad faith” assertions that if allowed to proceed would set a harmful precedent for future unsubstantiated lawsuits. New York also emphasized that the case would “not present an actual controversy” because “former President Trump has already raised, and the New York state courts are already adjudicating, the same issues Missouri seeks to raise.”

The Supreme Court’s decision to reject Missouri’s request aligns with the court’s historical reluctance to interfere in state court criminal proceedings, particularly in cases lacking a genuine interstate dispute. Critics of Missouri’s suit had also argued that the state’s claims were speculative and lacked legal standing, as the alleged harms to Missouri voters were not directly attributable to the actions of New York state courts.

The ruling ensures that, barring any postponement, Trump’s sentencing will proceed as scheduled on Sept. 18, and the limited gag order will remain in place, barring him from publicly speaking about prosecutors, court staff and their families."

The high court denied Missouri’s motion Monday without explanation, though Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito noted in the order that they would have let the state file its complaint. While the two justices have recently sided with Trump, they have also previously signaled their disagreement with colleagues over the broader procedural issue of hearing lawsuits between states, indicating that they think the court must take such cases. This sort of case is different from the typical appeal at the Supreme Court, instead falling under the court’s “original” jurisdiction for suits between states.

“New York’s prosecution of the presumptive Republican nominee is a transparent attempt to prevent the candidate disfavored by New York from freely campaigning,” Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Republican, wrote to the justices last month, adding that it “threatens both the sovereign rights of Missouri and the constitutional rights of millions of its citizens.”

This sort of case is different ... falling under the court’s ‘original’ jurisdiction for suits between states.

New York Attorney General Letitia James opposed Missouri’s action, writing to the justices that “Missouri’s suit is based entirely on an ongoing criminal case between the Manhattan DA and former President Trump and does not present an actual controversy between sovereign States.”

Trump is due to be sentenced in New York next month, but not before Judge Juan Merchan decides how, if at all, the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling affects Trump’s state guilty verdicts. Merchan is expected to rule on the immunity issue Sept. 6 and sentence Trump on Sept. 18 if he rejects Trump’s immunity motion. The GOP presidential nominee also recently lost a New York state court appeal challenging his gag order ahead of sentencing.

The judgement is unlikely to be paid out since the owners have been in financial trouble for years, making it largely symbolic. The owners of Return to Nature Funeral Home, Jon and Carie Hallford, did not acknowledge the civil case or show up to hearings, said the attorney representing families, Andrew Swan.

The Hallfords, who own Return to Nature Funeral Home in Colorado Springs, about an hour south of Denver, face criminal charges in separate cases.

Supreme Court rejects Missouri's long-shot bid to block Trump's gag order.,https://emeatribune.com/oil-prices-rise-over-1-on-mounting-concerns-over-middle-east-supply/,"By Yuka Obayashi

TOKYO (Reuters) – Oil prices rose in early Asian trade on Tuesday, reversing the previous session’s loss as concerns that an escalating Middle East conflict could hit supplies outweighed fears of a possible U.S. recession that could hurt demand in the world’s top oil consumer.

Several U.S. personnel were injured in an attack against a military base in Iraq on Monday, three U.S. officials told Reuters, as concerns in the region mounted following last week’s killing of senior members of militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures climbed $1.18, or 1.6%, to $74.12 per barrel by 1022 GMT, or in early trade in Asia.

On Monday, both WTI and Brent benchmarks fell by 0.7-0.8% as a selloff continued on global stock markets. Oil’s slide was limited by worries Iran would retaliate for the assassination of a Hamas leader in Tehran may lead to a wider war in the Middle East.

On Monday, a senior ally of President Vladimir Putin arrived in Tehran for talks with Iranian leaders including the president and top security officials as the Islamic Republic weighs its response to the killing of a Hamas leader.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces anger in Israel and abroad over his handling of Gaza ceasefire talks which have faltered, three Israeli officials said, as fears mounted that the crisis could spiral into war with Iran.

"Virginia man, Frank Carillo, threatened to kill Kamala Harris, authorities say.",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/us/politics/virginia-man-charged-harris-threat.html,"A Virginia man has been charged with posting repeated death threats against Vice President Kamala Harris on social media in the days after she became the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, the authorities said on Monday.

The man, Frank Lucio Carillo, of Winchester, Va., was arrested on Friday and appeared in U.S. District Court in Roanoke, Va., on Monday to face a charge of making threats against the vice president of the United States. The felony charge carries a maximum sentence of up to five years in prison.

The arrest came after the F.B.I. discovered nearly 20 threats against Ms. Harris from an account linked to Mr. Carillo on the social media site GETTR, according to filings in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia.

The threats included promises to kill Ms. Harris and her family, to pluck out her eyes with pliers and to burn her alive. “Kamala Harris needs to be put on fire alive I will do it personally if no one else does it I want her to suffer a slow agonizing death,” Mr. Carillo said in one post on July 27."
"Virginia man, Frank Carillo, threatened to kill Kamala Harris, authorities say.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/virginia-man-charged-threatening-kill-kamala-harris-rcna165280,"A Virginia man has been charged with making numerous death threats against Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.

Frank Lucio Carillo, of Winchester, Virginia, posted a series of violent threats about Harris last month using an alias on the conservative social media site GETTR, according to a criminal complaint unsealed in the Western District of Virginia on Friday. Investigators alleged that Carillo had posted 19 times about Harris, including threats to shoot, stab and burn her alive.

Carillo, 66, made his first appearance in federal court Monday. He is being temporarily detained pending a court hearing scheduled for Thursday.

In one of his July 27 social media posts, after Harris launched her presidential campaign and two weeks after an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, Carillo said that if she’s elected, “I will shoot and kill everyone” who tried to obstruct his efforts, the criminal complaint said. Investigators said a search of Carillo's home turned up two guns — a handgun that he purchased last year and an RF-15 rifle that he bought this year. He also allegedly had thousands of rounds of ammunition.

A county recorder's office in Arizona had first notified authorities about threats to Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer coming from the user “joemadarats1,"" which the FBI identified as an account tied to Carillo through subscriber and device information and an analysis of Google location history records, according to the complaint.

In sum, Carillo allegedly made 4,359 posts or replies targeting public officials, authorities said. Other federal officials who were targeted included President Joe Biden and FBI Director Christopher Wray, the complaint alleged.

The Justice Department said that in a February post, ""joemadarats1"" said he had his “AR-15 LOCKED AND LOADED.”

Investigators said that following his arrest, Carillo allegedly told officers, “This is all over a comment, huh?”

Carillo also made threatening comments about shooting Muslims and said illegal immigrants ""should be shot in the head quickly"" if they show up to vote, adding, ""if I see any of them I'll kill them,” the complaint said.

A public defender listed for Carillo did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday evening.

U.S. Attorney Christopher R. Kavanaugh for the Western District of Virginia indicated in a statement Monday that Carillo's actions went beyond political discourse.

“Open political discourse is a cornerstone of our American experience,” Kavanaugh said. “We can disagree. We can argue and we can debate. However, when those disagreements cross the line to threats of violence, law enforcement must step in.”

Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, have also been the subject of social media threats. Last month, a Florida man was charged with written threats to kill Trump and Vance."

Frank Lucio Carillo was charged in federal court in Virginia on Friday with “threats against the Vice President of the United States” after posting a series of lurid messages targeting Harris − and other elected officials including President Joe Biden and FBI Director Christopher Wray − on the conservative social media site GETTR, according to court records.

“Kamala Harris needs to be put on fire alive I will do it personally if no one else does (I) want her to suffer a slow agonizing death,"" one of the posts cited in an FBI affidavit filed in support of the charges said. The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia.

“Harris is going to regret ever trying to become president because if that ever happened I will personally pluck out her eyes with a pair of pliers but first I will shoot and kill everyone that gets in my way,” Carillo also allegedly posted on GETTR under the user name “joemadarats1.”

Carillo posted approximately 4,359 posts on GETTR reviewed by the FBI, and also threatened Biden, Wray, Maricopa County, Arizona Recorder Stephen Richer “and many other public officials,” the affidavit states.

Carillo, 66, made his initial court appearance Monday morning in U.S. District Court in Roanoke, Virginia after being arrested last week at his home in Winchester, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia.

The initial court documents did not provide the name of a lawyer for Carillo. Yvonne Nedley, listed in the charging documents as an associate of Carillo's who has ""lived together at multiple residences"" with him including currently in Winchester, had no comment when contacted by USA TODAY.

“Open political discourse is a cornerstone of our American experience. We can disagree. We can argue and we can debate. However, when those disagreements cross the line to threats of violence, law enforcement must step in,” U.S. Attorney Christopher Kavanaugh of the Western District of Virginia said in a statement.

The messages threatening Harris were posted July 27, court records said. That's less than a week after Biden announced he would not seek reelection, and after it became likely that Harris had the political support to take his place atop the Democratic ticket. The alleged threats from Carillo also came two weeks after a sniper shot and injured Trump during an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.

FBI agents seized a rifle and a handgun from Carillo’s Winchester, Virginia, residence, the court records said. During the search of his home, Carillo said that if his arrest was “about the online stuff. I posted it,” the affidavit said.

The investigation began when the FBI’s Phoenix office was informed of potential threats against Richer, who has angered political conservatives by defending the integrity of Arizona elections and pushing back on false claims of voter fraud. He lost his re-election bid last week in the Republican primary for Maricopa County recorder to a right-wing challenger who was endorsed by Republicans who refused to concede Trump's loss in the 2020 election in the state.

The alleged threats against Richer led to a review of a GETTR account that authorities say belonged to Carillo, of Winchester, Va., and messages in which he allegedly threatened political violence dating back many months. In one from Feb. 22, “joemadarats1” posted, “I HAVE MY AR-15 LOCKED AND LOADED.”

Carillo also threatened others, including Muslims and, in another July 27 post, undocumented immigrants.

“I believe when he (sic) illegals show up to vote they should be shot in the head quickly they are not allowed to vote so then they must die cuz if I see any of them I'll kill them,” Carillo wrote, according to the affidavit.

FBI and Justice Department officials, including Wray and Attorney General Merrick Garland, say they are concerned by what they describe as a sharp increase in threats of political violence against U.S. public officials with the Nov. 5 election less than 100 days away."

Frank Lucio Carillo, 66, appeared in U.S. District Court in Roanoke, Virginia, Monday morning following his arrest at his Winchester home last week. Carillo faces a federal criminal complaint accusing him of threatening Vice President Harris.

Stanley M. Meador, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Richmond Division, emphasized the gravity of the threats. ""The FBI’s mission is to protect the American people. We take all threats of violence seriously and will investigate them fully to hold those responsible accountable,"" Meador said.

The investigation began on July 27, when the Maricopa County, Arizona, Recorder’s Office alerted the FBI’s Phoenix Office to threats posted on the social media platform GETTR.

A Virginia man has been charged with making death threats against Vice President Kamala Harris and appeared in federal court on Monday.

According to court records, Frank Lucio Carillo made several threats against Harris, President Joe Biden, FBI Director Christopher Wray, several Arizona officials, and others on the right-wing social media platform Gettr.

In response to a subpoena, the FBI found 4,359 posts from Carillo “targeting various public officials,” including Harris.

In several posts, Carillo allegedly threatened to cut out Harris’ eyes and described various ways he wanted to kill the vice president, court records say.

“I will cut your eyes out,” Carillo allegedly wrote in one expletive-laden rant where he called Harris a “b*tch” and said he hoped she would “suffer a slow agonizing death.”

A number of similar posts are cited in court records, with graphic and detailed threats against the vice president as well as others, including one Islamophobic post in 2023 when he wrote that people should “go out with your guns and kill all Muslims.”

When FBI agents first arrived at Carillo’s house over the social media posts, Carillo asked if they were there “about the online stuff,” and said, “I posted it.” Carrillo, appearing to talk to himself, also said, “I guess I’m gonna need a lawyer,” according to court documents.

Federal agents retrieved two firearms from his home, including a pistol he bought in 2023 and a rifle purchased this year.

A hearing to determine whether Carillo will remain behind bars while awaiting a resolution in his case has been set for Thursday.

WASHINGTON — The FBI arrested a Virginia man Friday for allegedly threatening to kill Vice President Kamala Harris and other public officials.

Frank Lucio Carillo made his initial appearance Monday morning in federal court in Roanoke, Virginia, on a charge of threatening the vice president of the United States. The charge is a felony that carries a maximum sentence of up to five years in prison.

According to an affidavit, investigators were first made aware of alleged threats made by Carillo by the office of Maricopa County (Arizona) Recorder Stephen Richer. Richer, a Republican who oversees elections in Arizona’s largest county, has been the target of years of harassment and threats since former President Donald Trump lost the state, and his bid for re-election, in 2020.

The alleged threats were made on the conservative social media site GETTR, which was founded by former Trump aide Stephen Miller. According to the affidavit, the FBI received records from GETTR documenting more than 4,300 posts made by the account “joemadarats1” targeting public officials, including Harris, Richer, President Joe Biden, FBI Director Christopher Wray and others.

Investigators identified multiple posts targeted at Harris on July 27 alone, including several that threatened her directly with harm. In one post, Carillo allegedly wrote, “I will cut your eyes out of your F****ING head while you’re alive b****.”

In another post, Carillo allegedly wrote, “Harris is going to regret ever trying to become president because if that ever happened I will personally pluck out her eyes with a pair of pliers but first I will shoot and kill everyone that gets in my way that is a f****** promise.”

The FBI identified Carillo by tracing the email connected to his alleged GETTR account to a cell phone and, ultimately, to an address in Winchester, Virginia. According to the affidavit, when FBI agents arrived at his door, Carillo asked for a lawyer and then said, “This is all over a comment, huh?” FBI agents recovered an RF-15 rifle and a 9mm handgun inside the residence.

In addition to threats to elected officials, investigators said Carillo also posted numerous times between November 2023 and July 2024 about his desire to shoot people. In one post, Carillo allegedly wrote, “Don’t wait for your gov. Go out with your guns and kill all Muslims.”

In another, investigators said, he wrote, “I believe when [the] illegals show up to vote they should be shot in the head quickly they are not allowed to vote so then they must die cuz if I see any of them I’ll kill them.”"

In an affidavit supporting Carillo’s arrest, the FBI cited “4,359 posts/replies made by ‘joemadarats1’ targeting various public officials” over the past year, including Harris, President Joe Biden, FBI Director Christopher Wray and Stephen Richer, the recorder of Maricopa County in Arizona who became known for rejecting claims that the 2020 presidential election had been stolen from former President Donald Trump.

Threats Happened Days After Harris Replaced Biden

The threats against the vice president were made days after Harris replaced Biden to become the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, according to court records.

In a statement on Monday, Christopher R. Kavanaugh, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Virginia, said: “Open political discourse is a cornerstone of our American experience. We can disagree. We can argue, and we can debate. However, when those disagreements cross the line to threats of violence, law enforcement must step in.”

The FBI began its investigation of Carillo after it was notified by its Phoenix office of a GETTR user that had threatened Richer, according to the affidavit.

The FBI found that Carillo had also written “numerous other posts about firearms and shooting people” and had made violent threats against, among others, Muslims, “illegals” and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada.

In February, Carillo said in a post that he had an AR-15 assault rifle, “LOCKED AND LOADED.” As the FBI searched Carillo’s home last week, federal agents recovered a pistol and an AR-15, which the affidavit said he had purchased in February. They also recovered thousands of rounds of ammunition.

After he was arrested, Carillo was quoted in the FBI agent’s affidavit as requesting an attorney, and then saying, “This is all over a comment, huh?”

Carillo’s lawyer’s name was not immediately available.

Records show that Carillo described himself as unemployed and disabled when he filed for bankruptcy in Virginia in 2018. He previously resided at addresses in Pennsylvania and New York.

The number of threats against public officials has been on the rise in recent years and Carillo’s arrest comes weeks after a Pennsylvania man attempted to assassinate Trump at a July 13 campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.

The defendant, identified as Frank Lucio Carillo, allegedly used his GETTR account to make “threatening statements” about Harris and others, including President Joe Biden, FBI Director Christopher Wray, and Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, a recently primaried Arizona Republican official who rejected claims that the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump as baseless “lies and conspiracy theories” and who filed a defamation lawsuit Kari Lake for insisting that the 2022 gubernatorial election was marred by fraud.

Carillo is charged under 18 U.S. Code § 871 with “knowingly and willfully mak[ing] a threat to take the life of and to inflict bodily harm upon the Vice President of the United States,” the presumptive Democratic nominee for president.

Documents said the offense occurred “on or about July 27,” six days after Biden said he would not run for reelection and announced support for Harris.

Investigators said that Carillo in one post said Harris doesn’t “have a snowballs chance in hell which is exactly where you’re going and soon,” adding “I will cut your eyes out of your F—ING head” and “will make sure you suffer a slow agonizing death[.]”

In another post, he allegedly said he would “personally” set Harris on fire “if no one else does[.]” In a third post, Carillo allegedly said Harris is “going to regret ever trying to become president because if that ever happened I will personally pluck out her eyes with a pair of pliers but first I will shoot and kill everyone that gets in my way that is a f****** promise.”

The last July 27 post mentioned in the complaint allegedly said “Crapler Harris is laying [sic] thieving piece of garbage like the rest of this administration they all need to die and they will soon.”

When the feds showed up at his home on Aug. 2, the complaint said, Carillo allegedly said he owned a pistol and an AR-15 and made remarks of surprise about the reason for the law enforcement visit.

“[F]or a comment. This is ridiculous, for a comment,” he allegedly said. “I guess I’m gonna need a lawyer.”

After making the lawyer statement, the feds alleged, Carillo said: “This is all over a comment, huh?”

The charged offense is punishable by up to five years behind bars upon conviction.

Louisiana governor tells parents against the Ten Commandments in classrooms: 'Tell your child not to do so.'',https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/louisiana-governor-tells-parents-ten-commandments-classrooms-tell-chil-rcna165147,"Create your free profile or log in to save this article

Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry has a suggestion for parents who don't believe the Ten Commandments should be displayed in public school classrooms throughout the state.

""Tell your child not to look at them,"" he told reporters Monday.

The Republican governor defended the controversial legislation during a news conference announcing how Louisiana intends to fend off a lawsuit that argues that it is unconstitutional to hang the Ten Commandments in state-funded school and college classrooms.

Landry first signed the GOP-backed legislation in June, making Louisiana the first state in the nation to require schools to exhibit posters of the religious text, which was revealed to Moses in the Bible and remains revered by followers of the Christian faith.

But the move prompted a coalition of parents — Jewish, Christian, Unitarian Universalist and nonreligious — to sue the state days later in federal court. They argue that the legislation ""substantially interferes with and burdens"" their First Amendment right to raise their children with whatever religious doctrine they want.

Landry said the backlash against the law is unwarranted. House Bill 71 passed overwhelmingly and included bipartisan support from some Democrats, he added.

Given that Republicans hold a supermajority in both chambers of the state Legislature, which has allowed Landry to push forward a conservative, tough-on-crime agenda, the governor upheld the Ten Commandments law as an example of how ""the majority gets to rule.""

""I don't see what the whole big fuss is about,"" he said Monday.

The law requires all public K-12 schools and colleges to display the Ten Commandments by January.

Louisiana public school students are returning to classrooms for the new school year over the coming days but, as of Monday, Attorney General Liz Murrill told reporters that she was unaware of any schools that have started hanging posters of the Ten Commandments.

Murill held up an example of a poster that can be displayed, saying it was ""not very big."" She added that no public funds will be required to be spent on printing the posters and they can be supplied through private donations.

As the families' lawsuit plays out, Louisiana also agreed last month not to promote or create rules surrounding the law until at least Nov. 15, as the case and various motions are decided in federal court.

Murrill said that the state on Monday planned to file its motion to seek the suit's dismissal, with officials calling the families' complaint ""premature."" She added that the state will argue how there are ""numerous ways"" the law can be applied constitutionally, and said having a display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms allows for ""powerful teaching moments.""

That state’s motion to dismiss was filed later Monday in federal court.

One of the arguments involves a claim that parents whose children attend charter schools in Orleans Parish School lacked standing to sue Orleans Parish School Board, because it claimed charter schools are independent from the board.

During the news conference earlier Monday, Murrill offered examples of posters that could be created for classroom displays showing the Ten Commandments while also putting the words into context. One poster riffed off the song ""Ten Duel Commandments"" from the musical ""Hamilton,"" while another poster compared Moses and Martin Luther King Jr.

NEW ORLEANS — Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry is telling parents who don’t want the Ten Commandments hanging in classrooms to tell their children “not to look at them.”

Monday, the governor and Attorney General Liz Murrill held a news conference to discuss how the state plans to fight a legal challenge to the controversial law.

“I did not know that the Ten Commandments was such a bad way for someone to live their life,” Landry said. “Really and truly, I don’t see what the whole big fuss is about.”

State attorneys filed a brief opposing a lawsuit filed by the ACLU and other civil rights groups. Murrill said the lawsuit is premature because the plaintiffs in the case, parents of public school children can’t prove any harm.

“That’s because they don’t allege that they have seen any displays yet and they certainly can’t allege that they have seen any display of the Ten Commandments that violates their constitutional rights,” Murrill said.

Murrill displayed a series of posters showing how the Ten Commandments could be displayed and incorporated into teachable moments that can pass constitutional muster. One included a quote from the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

Another displayed Dr. Martin Luther King’s Ten Commandments for Non-Violence next to the ones handed down by Moses.

“Our arguments haven’t changed since the filing of our original lawsuit back on July 8,” said ACLU Louisiana Executive Director Alanah Odoms.

The ACLU argues the law violates the freedom of religion constitutionally guaranteed in the First Amendment.

“The government can’t prioritize or cannot give preference to one religion over another, and the government can’t show favor to one religion over another and that is exactly what we see here,” Odoms said.

Gov. Landry had this suggestion for parents who don’t want The Ten Commandments in their child’s classroom.

“What I would say to those parents if those posters are in the school and they find them so vulgar, tell the child not to look at them.”

The law requires all public schools and colleges to display the Ten Commandments beginning in January."

Louisiana governor tells parents against the Ten Commandments in classrooms: 'Tell your child not to do so.'',https://ca.news.yahoo.com/ten-commandments-wont-louisiana-classrooms-184458612.html,"Ten Commandments won't go in some Louisiana classrooms until at least November as lawsuit plays out

BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Louisiana won't take official steps to implement a law requiring the Ten Commandments be placed in all of the state's public school classrooms until at least November as a lawsuit makes its way through the courts, according to an agreement approved by a federal judge Friday.

The suit was filed in June by parents of Louisiana public school children with various religious backgrounds, who said the law violates First Amendment language forbidding government establishment of religion and guaranteeing religious liberty. Backers of the law argue that the Ten Commandments belong in classrooms because the commandments are historical and are part of the foundation of U.S. law.

The Louisiana law requires the commandments be posted no later than Jan. 1, a deadline unaffected by Friday’s agreement. The deal assures that the defendants in the lawsuit — state education officials and several local school boards — will not post the commandments in classrooms before Nov. 15, and won't make rules governing the law’s implementation before then.

Lester Duhe, a spokesman for Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, said the defendants “agreed to not take public-facing compliance measures until November 15” to provide time for briefs, arguments and a ruling.

In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can “make no law respecting an establishment of religion.” The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.

In 2005, the Supreme Court held that such displays in a pair of Kentucky courthouses violated the Constitution. At the same time, the court upheld a Ten Commandments marker on the grounds of the Texas state Capitol in Austin.

Louisiana's new law does not require school systems to spend public money on Ten Commandments posters. It allows the systems to accept donated posters or money to pay for the displays.

The law also specifically authorizes but does not require other postings in public schools, including: The Mayflower Compact, which was signed by religious pilgrims aboard the Mayflower in 1620 and is often referred to as America’s “First Constitution”; the Declaration of Independence; and the Northwest Ordinance, which established a government in the Northwest Territory — in the present day Midwest — and created a pathway for admitting new states to the Union.

The legal challenge to the law came soon after it was signed by Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican who succeeded two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in January. Landry's inauguration marked a full takeover of state government by the GOP in a Bible Belt state where the party already held other every statewide elected position and a supermajority in the Legislature.

Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry held a news conference on Monday to defend a law requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in classrooms.

Landry defended the law requiring schools to display the Ten Commandments in classrooms, noting that he plans to fight lawsuits against it.

During the conference hosted by state Attorney General Liz Murrill, Landry told several reporters, “If those posters are in school and they find them so vulgar, just tell the child not to look at it,” in response to the parents who disagree with the law.

Landry and Murrill responded to a lawsuit during the press conference, stating that a brief would be filed. Murrill noted that the lawsuit is premature since the schools have not physically displayed the posters yet and that the compliance date is January 2025.

Landry signed the law into effect in June, which sparked the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and several parents to sue Louisiana over it. The ACLU stated that the display “unconstitutionally pressures students into religious observance, veneration, and adoption.”

The law requires all Louisiana schools from Kindergarten to college to display the Ten Commandments in classrooms along with a statement explaining how the Ten Commandments contributed to America’s education. Donations pay for the posters in classrooms, and no public funding is used.

“I did not know the Ten Commandments was such a bad way for someone to live their life,” Landry stated in the press conference.

Other states, like Oklahoma, have mandated that the Bible, including the Ten Commandments, be taught in classrooms for grades five through 12 for the 2024-2025 school year. In a June memo, state Education Superintendent Ryan Walters stated that the Bible will be referenced as an “appropriate study of history, civilization, ethics, comparative religion, or the like, as well as for their substantial influence on our nation’s founders and the foundational principles of our Constitution.”

“I don’t see what the whole big fuss is about,” Landry stated during the news conference.

Louisiana governor tells parents against the Ten Commandments in classrooms: 'Tell your child not to do so.'',https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/louisiana-ag-asks-court-dismiss-lawsuit-new-ten-112589299,"Louisiana’s attorney general has announced that she is asking a federal court to dismiss a lawsuit that seeks to overturn the state’s new law requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in every public school classroom by Jan. 1

BATON ROUGE, La. -- Louisiana's attorney general announced Monday that she is asking a federal court to dismiss a lawsuit that seeks to overturn the state’s new law requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in every public school classroom by Jan. 1.

The suit was filed in June by parents of Louisiana public school children with various religious backgrounds who contend the law violates First Amendment language forbidding government establishment of religion and guaranteeing religious liberty. Proponents of the law argue that it is not solely religious but that the Ten Commandments have historical significance to the foundation of U.S. law.

As kids in Louisiana prepare to return to school this month, state officials presented large examples of posters featuring the Ten Commandments that Attorney General Liz Murrill argues “constitutionally comply with the law.” The Republican said she is not aware of any school districts that have begun to implement the mandate, as the posters “haven't been produced yet.”

Murrill said the court brief being filed, which was not immediately available, argues that “the lawsuit is premature and the plaintiffs cannot prove that they have any actual injury.”

“That’s because they don’t allege to have seen any displays yet and they certainly can’t allege that they have seen any display of the Ten Commandments that violates their constitutional rights,"" she added.

Murrill pointed to more than a dozen posters on display during Monday's press conference to support her argument that the displays can be done constitutionally, saying that they also show the Ten Commandments' historical and cultural significance. Some of the posters featured quotes from famous figures — late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Martin Luther King Jr., Moses and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson — referencing the Ten Commandments.

Other posters took a more modern approach, even using memes. One example was a poster that included a photo from the 2004 film “Mean Girls,” where a main character played by Rachel McAdams says, “Why are you so obsessed with me?” The meme was surrounded by news headlines about the lawsuit filed against the new mandate. Another display featured the Ten Commandments next to the lyrics from the “Ten Duel Commandments,” a song from Lin-Manuel Miranda's Tony-award winning musical “Hamilton.”

“Each one of these posters illustrates something that we believe represents a constitutional application of the law,” Murrill said.

Based on the law’s language, “each public school governing authority” will decide exactly what their posters will look like. The Ten Commandments must be displayed on a poster or framed document at least 11 inches by 14 inches (28 by 36 centimeters) where the commandments are the central focus and “printed in a large, easily readable font.” In addition, each poster must be paired with the four-paragraph context statement.

Lawmakers also specified which version of Ten Commandments be used — a condensed version of the Scripture passage in Exodus. It has ties to “The Ten Commandments” movie from 1956, and it’s a variation of a version commonly associated with Protestants.

Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the legislation in June — making Louisiana the only state to require that the Ten Commandments be displayed in the classrooms of all public schools and state-funded universities. The measure was part of a slew of conservative priorities that became law this year in Louisiana.

When asked what he would say to parents who are upset about the Ten Commandments being displayed in their child's classroom, the governor replied: “If those posters are in school and they (parents) find them so vulgar, just tell the child not to look at it.”

In an agreement reached by the court and state last month, the five schools specifically listed in the lawsuit will not post the commandments in classrooms before Nov. 15 and won’t make rules governing the law’s implementation before then. The deadline to comply, Jan. 1, 2025, remains in place for schools across the state.

Louisiana’s new law does not require school systems to spend public money on Ten Commandments posters. It allows the systems to accept donated posters or money to pay for the displays. Questions still linger about how the requirement will be enforced and what happens if there are not enough donations to fund the mandate."

The lawsuit, brought by a group of nine multi-faith Louisiana families, was “prematurely” filed, according to Attorney General Liz Murrill, because the Ten Commandments haven’t been posted yet.

“No defendant has actually posted the Ten Commandments on the classroom wall,” Murrill said. “Because this lawsuit is all based on hypothetical facts, the court can’t decide this case yet.”

The AG’s push to throw out the case is the latest procedural step in a legal battle over the implementation of Louisiana’s new law, which Gov. Jeff Landry signed in June. It requires public schools display the Ten Commandments, a religious text used in multiple sects of Christianity and Judaism, in every classroom as “a poster or framed document that is at least eleven inches by fourteen inches.”

The Commandments must be the “central focus” of the display and “printed in a large, easily readable font,”, according to the law, which takes effect on Jan. 1 of next year.

Plaintiffs sued Landry’s administration in June in an attempt to block enforcement, alleging that the new law violates their rights to freedom of religion under the First Amendment. The families are represented by a coalition of legal groups, including the Americans United for the Separation of Church and State and the ACLU of Louisiana.

Attorneys for the plaintiffs did not respond to a request for comment on the AG’s request for dismissal by publication. The group has said in past statements that parents don’t want the state involved in their children's’ religious education.

Other states have tried to pass similar laws throughout U.S. history. In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can “make no law respecting an establishment of religion.”

Louisiana is the only state with a mandate in place, though others, including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah, have attempted to pass similar requirements.

Murrill’s office previously agreed not to take steps to implement the law until the group’s lawsuit worked its way through the courts. But Monday’s brief filed in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana attempts to throw the challenge out altogether on the basis that it can’t apply to every type of Ten Commandments display, Murrill said.

“There are countless ways to constitutionally comply with the law,” Murrill said at a press conference alongside Landry and flanked by posters featuring the Commandments.

“The plaintiffs have to show that every application of this law is unconstitutional,” Murrill said. “They cannot meet that burden.”

Landry and Murrill have been ardent supporters of the law since its passage, defending its rollout on conservative media and in public press conferences. On Monday, they remained adamant that schools still need to be in compliance by Jan. 2025.

No public funds will be spent on creating Ten Commandments displays, Murrill said. Instead, the state will rely on outside donations. She did not specify where from.

Landry also spoke Monday, repeating his argument that many government buildings already display the Ten Commandments.

“So really truly, I don't see what the whole big fuss is about,” he said. “If those posters are in school and parents find them too forward, tell the child not to look at it.”

Murrill’s request for dismissal must now go in front of a judge who will decide whether to throw out the case or let it keep moving through the courts.

Louisiana officials unveiled several posters of the Ten Commandments on Monday that could soon be placed in state classrooms and which feature House Speaker Mike Johnson, the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda.

The posters shown at Monday’s news conference are not the final options but instead represent potential ways for schools to follow the new law requiring all public school classrooms to put up a poster of the Ten Commandments, according to Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill.

One of the posters, titled “The House of Representatives and the Lawgivers,” features the text of the Ten Commandments in between an image of a stone carving of “Moses the Lawgiver” and a photo of House Speaker Mike Johnson, who represents Louisiana.

Another poster features a photo of Ginsburg, the liberal Supreme Court justice who died in 2020, as well as her quote praising the world’s “four great documents,” including the Ten Commandments, the Magna Carta, the English Bill of Rights and the Declaration of Independence. The quote comes from an editorial she wrote for her school paper when she was 13 years old lauding the United Nations Charter.

A third poster is titled “Ten (Duel) Commandments” and features an image of Moses next to Lin-Manuel Miranda, the “Hamilton” playwright and actor, dressed in the role of founding father Alexander Hamilton. “Ten Duel Commandments” is a song in the 2015 award-winning musical with advice on how to kill a rival in a duel, a riff on the Notorious B.I.G. rap song “Ten Crack Commandments” about dealing drugs.

Other potential posters include quotes from former Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall and Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.

“All of these posters illustrate that there are constitutional ways to apply this law,” she said.

The news conference comes two months after Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry signed into law a requirement for every public school classroom in the state to display a poster with the text of the Ten Commandments. A group of Louisiana parents and civil rights organizations have sued to stop the law, arguing a state requiring a religious text in all classrooms violates the establishment clause of the US Constitution, which says Congress can “make no law respecting an establishment of religion.”

Murrill said the state will file a brief Monday, moving to dismiss the case on the grounds no one has been harmed because the law is not yet in effect.

The federal court ordered that the state cannot issue advice, rules or regulations about the requirement until at least November 15, according to the court docket.

The Supreme Court has previously taken up several cases about the constitutionality of the Ten Commandments in public spaces.

Most notably, in the 1980 case Stone v. Graham, the court struck down a Kentucky law requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms. Then in 2005, the justices ruled in mirror 5–4 decisions to allow an exhibit on the Ten Commandments at the Texas Capitol but to bar others at two Kentucky courthouses.

Speaking at the news conference Monday, Gov. Landry, a Republican, defended the Louisiana statute by saying “majority rules” and arguing it did not favor any one religion.

“The Ten Commandments is not symbolic of any one particular religion,” he said. “Many religions share and recognize the Ten Commandments as a whole. So really and truly, I don’t see what the big fuss is about.”

To any nonreligious parents who disapproved, he offered this advice: “Tell the child not to look at it.”"

Special prosecutors plan to file criminal charges against the police chief who led the Marion raid.,https://kansasreflector.com/2024/08/05/special-prosecutors-plan-to-file-criminal-charge-against-police-chief-who-led-marion-raid/,"TOPEKA — Special prosecutors plan to charge former Marion Police Chief Gideon Cody with a low-level felony for his actions following the raid he led last year on the Marion County Record and the homes of the newspaper publisher and a councilwoman.

But the special prosecutors also concluded that police — despite their misunderstanding of evidence, a rushed investigation, and faulty and unlawful search warrants — didn’t commit any crimes by investigating a baseless suspicion of identity theft or carrying out the raid.

Riley County Attorney Barry Wilkerson and Sedgwick County District Attorney Marc Bennett released their conclusions in a 124-page report on Monday.

“There is no evidence that Marion law enforcement agents recognized the inadequacy of the investigation or intentionally or knowingly misled either other law enforcement agents or the court,” the prosecutors said. “The evidence strongly suggests they genuinely believed they were investigating criminal acts.”

The report also clears Marion County Record reporter Phyllis Zorn and editor Eric Meyer of wrongdoing.

“Their report makes it clear that they arrived at this conclusion mere days after the raid,” Meyer said. “Yet they left us swinging in the wind. That’s disappointing, to say the least. We are pleased that they believe, as we long have, that Gideon Cody violated state law. Unfortunately, others involved in case — those who didn’t flee the state — seem to have escaped similar scrutiny.”

When Cody led the raid on Aug. 11, 2023, he violated constitutional protections, upended lives, spawned five federal lawsuits, and cast a shadow over the east-central town of about 2,000.

The prosecutors’ report, which based on findings from the Kansas Bureau of Investigation and Colorado Bureau of Investigation, details the small-town drama that precipitated Cody’s investigation, as well as his attempt to leverage the KBI for support before and after the raids.

KBI special agent in charge Bethanie Popejoy told investigators that Cody called her two days after the raid while she was in church service. She stepped outside to take the call.

She said Cody told her: “This is a mess. I really wish you guys would take this over.”

“And I said, ‘Well, it’s a little f***in’ late for that now,” Popejoy said.

Although KBI agents had agreed to join Cody in the investigation before the raid, they had not yet reviewed evidence at the time of the raid. Popejoy said when she first read the search warrants several days after the raid, she was “shocked, angry, disappointed, (in) disbelief.”

Cody, faced with intense national scrutiny, asked the KBI to issue a public statement defending his character. Popejoy declined.

“He was just a rabid squirrel in a cage and just off doing his own thing, and then, ‘Well, I really feel like you guys are abandoning me,’ ” she said.

The report closely analyzes restaurateur Kari Newell’s drunk driving record, which became a catalyst for the raid. Newell’s estranged husband, who told investigators he was tired of paying for tags and insurance on her car while going through divorce proceedings, sent a copy of Newell’s driving record to friend Pam Maag, who in turn sent the record to reporter Phyllis Zorn and Councilwoman Ruth Herbel. Maag believed Newell’s DUI and suspended license would be relevant to Newell’s request for a liquor license.

Zorn called the Kansas Department of Revenue to verify the driving record and was given instructions on how to use the agency’s online database to look up the record, which she did. Meyer then notified police they had received and verified the driving record.

Cody, a former Kansas City, Missouri, detective who was not yet certified as a law enforcement officer in Kansas, asked Officer Zach Hudlin to help him investigate because Cody “didn’t 100% know Kansas law,” Hudlin told the CBI.

The report includes a transcript of a conversation between Hudlin and a KDOR representative about the agency’s online database. Based on that call, Hudlin erroneously assumed Zorn had violated numerous crimes by looking up the public record.

“It is difficult to ascertain whether Officer Hudlin’s conclusions were the product of confirmation bias, a hurried investigation or simply a misunderstanding of what the KDOR representative was trying to explain,” the special prosecutors wrote.

Cody emailed search warrant applications to County Attorney Joel Ensey and pressured the prosecutor to act quickly, Ensey told investigators. Ensey said he was too busy preparing for other cases to read the warrants and asked an office manager to take them to the judge.

Ensey recalled telling his assistant: “I don’t know why the f*** we’re in such a f****** hurry for this thing.”

When questioned by investigators, Cody couldn’t remember if he signed the search warrants in front of Magistrate Judge Laura Viar, but he recalled answering a few questions for her.

Viar said Cody had given her the impression that the KBI supported the search warrants. After the raid, Cody texted Ensey to say the KBI was “100% behind me and we did things exactly as it should have been done.”

Popejoy said Cody “had to live in fantasy land to get that picture.”

“I probably called him and said, ‘What’s going on?’ But at no point did I say, ‘Everything you did is OK.’ ” she said.

Cody resigned in October after KSHB-TV reported he had instructed Newell to delete text messages between them. Hudlin is now the acting police chief.

Special prosecutors said Cody’s actions regarding text messages will provide the basis for a criminal charge of obstructing the judicial process, a low-level felony.

“With so many law enforcement officers aligned against me, there were times I worried, but I have hope that justice would be done,” Zorn said in a phone interview after the report was released.

Emily Bradbury, executive director of the Kansas Press Association, said she welcomed the conclusion that Marion County Record journalists acted lawfully and that Cody will face criminal charges.

“This development is a crucial step towards accountability and justice,” Bradbury said. “The misuse of power to intimidate or silence journalists is a grave threat to our democracy, and those responsible must be held to account.”

The special prosecutors rejected the theory that Cody and others carried out the raid in retaliation against the newspaper and political adversary, even though there was no reason to believe anybody had committed a crime, and no basis for searching the homes of Meyer and Herbel.

“The most plausible explanation, as evidenced by Chief Cody’s repeated statements in contemporaneous emails, reports and statements to others, is that he and the officers working with them genuinely reached the conclusion that they had uncovered a crime,” the prosecutors wrote."
Special prosecutors plan to file criminal charges against the police chief who led the Marion raid.,https://www.voanews.com/a/police-chief-who-led-raid-on-kansas-newspaper-to-be-charged-prosecutors-say/7731035.html,"Criminal charges will be filed against the local Kansas police chief who last year led a much-condemned raid on the Marion County Record newspaper, special prosecutors in the case announced Monday.

The final report on the raid from special prosecutors Marc Bennett and Barry Wilkerson said that they plan to charge former Marion Police Chief Gideon Cody with obstruction of the judicial process. If convicted, Cody faces between seven and 23 months in prison.

Last August, Cody ordered Marion officers to raid the local newsroom, an act widely condemned by press freedom groups and government officials as a clear violation of the First Amendment.

Officers also raided the home of Marion County Record publisher Eric Meyer and his mother, Joan, and the home of then-City Council member Ruth Herbel, who had been critical of the mayor.

Joan Meyer, 98, died one day after the raid. Her son Eric blamed her death on the stress caused by the raid.

The investigation, which was released Monday, was initially launched by the Kansas Bureau of Investigation before being turned over to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation in November 2023. Bennett and Wilkerson agreed to serve as special prosecutors at the request of the elected Marion County attorney Joel Ensey.

The newspaper’s lawyer, Bernie Rhodes, said the final report released on Monday confirmed what the Record had always known.

“We believed all along that fair-minded law enforcement officers would conclude that no one at the Marion County Record committed a crime, and they have done that,” Rhodes told VOA. “Beyond that, that fair-minded law enforcement officers would also determine that Gideon Cody did likely commit a crime. So, it’s exactly what we’ve been saying from day one.”

The newspaper’s own lawsuit over the raid is ongoing, Rhodes added.

Eric Meyer, the newspaper’s owner and publisher, also welcomed the news that the newspaper has “finally, officially been vindicated.” Meyer added he was glad that Cody would be held accountable, but said he hopes more will be done to remedy the entire situation.

“It’s a good first step, but it’s hardly closure,” Meyer told VOA.

At the time of the incident, Cody said the raid was over an identity theft complaint that a local restaurant owner had filed. But during the raid itself, Cody rifled through records about himself, body camera footage showed.

Katherine Jacobsen, the U.S. and Canada program coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists, welcomed the news that Cody is expected to be charged.

“It’s heartening to see that officials are taking this seriously. And I think part of taking it seriously is making sure that people are held responsible,” Jacobsen said. “It sends a message that this kind of behavior from law enforcement will not be tolerated and is unacceptable.”

The Marion Police Department declined to comment for this story.

VOA did not immediately receive a reply to a voicemail left at a possible cellphone number for Cody. VOA also did not immediately receive a reply to an email sent to a possible email address for Cody. It was not immediately clear who might be representing him in the potential criminal case.

The raid on the Record took place almost one year ago, on Aug. 11, 2023. At the time, VOA reported extensively on the trauma the raid wrought on the newspaper’s staff.

The recently released report suggested that Marion police, led by then-Chief Cody, conducted a poor investigation that led them to “reach erroneous conclusions” that Meyer and reporter Phyllis Zorn had committed identity theft or other computer crimes.

Cody resigned in October 2023, about one week after the city council announced during a meeting that he had been suspended and weeks after officers were forced to return materials seized in the raid.

Some local residents also said they were happy about the news that Cody would be charged for his role in the raid.

“Joan Meyer deserves this day,” town resident Darvin Markley told VOA. “It’s a good day in Kansas. Maybe democracy is going to prevail.”

TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Two special prosecutors said Monday that they plan to charge a former central Kansas police chief with obstruction of justice over his conduct following a police raid last year on the local weekly newspaper.

Prosecutors Marc Bennett and Barry Wilkerson concluded in their 124-page report that the staff at the Marion County Record committed no crimes before former Marion Police Chief Gideon Cody led a raid on its offices and the home of its publisher. They said police warrants signed by a judge to allow the searches contained inaccurate information from an “inadequate investigation"" and that the searches were not legally justified.

Police body camera footage of the 2023 raid on Publisher Eric Meyer's home shows his 98-year-old mother, Joan Meyer, visibly upset and telling officers, “Get out of my house!"" She co-owned the paper, lived with her son and died of a heart attack the next afternoon.

Prosecutors found no evidence officers ""believed they were posing a risk to Mrs. Meyer's life,” but they allege Cody obstructed an official judicial process in the weeks after the raid. He resigned as chief last October. It wasn't clear whether officials planned to charge him with a felony or a misdemeanor, and either is possible. The criminal complaint had not been filed as of Monday.

“Small town familiarity explains but does not excuse the inadequate investigation that gave rise to the search warrant applications in this matter,” prosecutors said in their report.

Bennett is the district attorney in Sedgwick County, home to the state’s largest city of Wichita; and Wilkerson is the chief prosecutor in Riley County in northeastern Kansas. The state’s attorney general appointed them after the Marion County prosecutor — who faced questions himself about the search warrants — said he had conflict.

The raid sparked a national debate about press freedom focused on Marion, a town of about of about 1,900 people set among rolling prairie hills about 150 miles (241 kilometers) southwest of Kansas City, Missouri.

Seth Stern, director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, said in a statement that Cody should face other charges in addition to obstruction of justice.

“The raid itself was criminal,” he said. “And Cody is far from the only one at fault here.”

Meyer said in an interview that he's grateful prosecutors found that the newspaper's staff committed no crimes, though he questioned why it took them a full year. He also expressed frustration that Cody is the only official expected to face criminal prosecution.

“What I feel is going on here is that he’s been set up as the fall guy,” Meyer said.

The newspaper’s parent company, Meyer and three current or former staffers have filed federal lawsuits against the city of Marion and current and former local officials, including Cody.

A voicemail seeking comment was left at a cellphone number believed to belong to Cody. It wasn’t clear who might represent him in the potential criminal case, and his attorneys in multiple federal lawsuits over the raid did not return a telephone message.

The search warrants authorizing the police raid accused Meyer and reporter Phyllis Zorn of identity theft and other computer crimes over their accessing the driving record of a local business owner who was seeking a liquor license. Zorn verified the record through a state database available online. The prosecutors said Cody appeared to think — incorrectly — that Zorn had to impersonate the business owner to get access.

The business owner gave police a written statement two days before the raid, but prosecutors said two pages of it were absent from material turned over to their investigators in September 2023.

The prosecutors' report also referenced text messages between Cody and the business owner after the raid. The business owner has said that Cody asked her to delete text messages between them, fearing people could get wrong idea about their relationship, which she said was professional and platonic.

The report said information about the texts would be included in the criminal complaint.

TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Two special prosecutors said Monday that they plan to file a criminal obstruction of justice charge against a former central Kansas police chief over his conduct following a raid last year on his town’s newspaper, and that the newspaper’s staff committed no crimes.

It wasn’t clear from the prosecutors’ lengthy report whether they planned to charge former Marion Police Chief Gideon Cody with a felony or a misdemeanor, and either is possible. They also hadn’t filed their criminal case as of Monday, and that could take days because they were working with the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, which stepped in at the request of its Kansas counterpart.

The prosecutors detailed events before, during and after the Aug. 11, 2023, raid on the Marion County Record and the home of its publisher, Eric Meyer. The report suggested that Marion police, led by then-Chief Cody, conducted a poor investigation that led them to “reach erroneous conclusions” that Meyer and reporter Phyllis Zorn had committed identity theft or other computer crimes.

But the prosecutors concluded that they have probable cause to believe that that Cody obstructed an official judicial process by withholding two pages of a written statement from a local business owner from investigators in September 2023, about six weeks after the raid. Cody had accused Meyer and reporter Phyllis Zorn of identity theft and other computer crimes related to the business owner’s driving record to get warrants for the raid.

Cody resigned as chief in early October, weeks after officers were forced to return materials seized in the raid.

Meyer’s 98-year-old mother, Joan Meyer, the paper’s co-owner lived with him and died the day after the raid from a heart attack, something Meyer has attributed to the stress of the raid.

A felony obstruction charge could be punished by up to nine months in prison for a first-time offender, though the typical sentence would be 18 months or less on probation. A misdemeanor charge could result in up to a year in jail."

IMPLICATIONS MAKES MORE HEADLINES IN KANSAS. YEAH, I’M OUT OF HERE. WE’VE SHOWN YOU THE VIDEOS OF THE RAIDS SURROUNDING THE MARION COUNTY RECORD. THE LOCAL PAPER IN MARION, KANSAS, OUTSIDE WICHITA. WELL, IN AN UNPRECEDENTED MOVE, POLICE OFFICERS AND SHERIFF’S DEPUTIES TOOK PHONES, COMPUTERS AND DOCUMENTS OF THE PAPER’S STAFF, ALL BECAUSE A REPORTER ACCESSED PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DRIVING RECORDS ON A STATE WEBSITE. THOSE SEIZED MATERIALS WERE ORDERED RETURNED AND THE BRUNT OF THE BACKLASH RESTED ON THE SHOULDERS OF POLICE CHIEF GIDEON CODY, WHO RESIGNED. STATE AGENCIES AND LOCAL LEADERS DISTANCED THEMSELVES FROM THE CHIEF AND WHAT HAPPENED. BUT NEW REPORTING BY THE KANSAS REFLECTOR SHOWS MANY OF THESE SAME GROUPS OF PEOPLE KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING DAYS BEFORE THE RAIDS THROUGH POLICE REPORTS, INTERNAL AGENCY EMAILS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS THAT REFLECTOR FOUND. THE KANSAS BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION HAD ADVANCED COPIES OF THE SEARCH WARRANT AND THAT IT HAD BEEN SENT TO THE COUNTY ATTORNEY FOR PRE-APPROVAL SAME PROSECUTOR WHO CLAIMED HE HADN’T SEEN THE AFFIDAVITS IN DETAIL UNTIL AFTER THE RAID. THE PAPERS ALSO REPORTING KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE EMPLOYEES TREATED THE JOURNALISTS PUBLIC ACCESS OF THESE DRIVING RECORDS AS CRIMINAL. THERE’S A LOT TO UNPACK HERE, SO LET’S GET RIGHT TO IT, PLEASE. WELCOME BACK SHERMAN SMITH, EDITOR IN CHIEF OF THE KANSAS REFLECTOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING BACK ON WHEN LAST WE SPOKE A FEW MONTHS AGO, YOU HAD BROKEN THIS STORY. A LOT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THEN. YEAH, WE KEEP GETTING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING THROUGH MORE AND MORE DOCUMENTS OF WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THOSE TWO WEEKS LEADING UP TO THE RAID. AND SO WE’RE ABLE TO KIND OF COMPARE NOW MORE ACCURATELY WHAT WHAT THESE OFFICIALS KNEW BEFORE THE RAID AND WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT WHAT THEY KNEW AFTER THE RAID. AND THERE APPEAR TO BE SOME DISCREPANCIES THERE. AND THAT’S AN UNDERSTATEMENT, I THINK, FROM LOOKING AT YOUR REPORTING. WHAT SURPRISED YOU THE MOST ABOUT WHAT YOU FOUND? WELL, I THINK THERE’S A LOT OF THINGS THAT SURPRISE ME HERE. YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE OFFICIALS WHO HAVE COPIES OF THE THE SEARCH WARRANTS AND ARE ACTUALLY PARTICIPATE IN THE INVESTIGATION LEADING UP TO THE RAID. AND WE HAVE A DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE STAFF WHO TREATED THIS AS A CRIME BEFORE THE RAID THAT THE REPORTER HAD ACCESSED THEIR ONLINE DATABASE TO GET A PUBLIC RECORD. BUT THEN AFTER THE RAID, VERY CLEARLY SAID THIS IS A PUBLIC RECORD. AND THEN A FIRE MARSHAL INVESTIGATOR WHO WAS CALLED IN TO TO HELP WITH THE MANPOWER SITUATION, THERE, WHO ATTACHES TO HIS REPORT THAT DAY, A THREE PAGE LEGAL MEMO ABOUT FEDERAL PROTECTIONS FOR JOURNALISTS, BASICALLY SAYING, HERE’S WHY WE SHOULD NEVER DO THE KIND OF RAID I JUST PARTICIPATED IN ARE THE COUNTY ATTORNEY OR SHERIFF’S DEPUTIES OR KBI SAYING ANYTHING? BECAUSE WHAT YOU FOUND CERTAINLY PAINTS THIS STORY IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT FROM WHAT THEY HAD PRESENTED A FEW MONTHS AGO, ALMOST EVERYBODY JUST DIDN’T RESPOND TO THE QUESTIONS THAT I’VE HAD. THE ISSUED A STATEMENT TO ME THAT SAID THEY’RE PREPARING TO CONCLUDE THEIR INVESTIGATION AND THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO ANSWER MORE QUESTIONS. AT THAT TIME. THE THE EXPECTATION HERE IS THAT WHEN THEY WRAP THEIR INVESTIGATION, THEY SAY WILL HAPPEN VERY SOON. THEY WILL TURN THAT OVER TO A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE ARE ANY CHARGES TO BE FILED. NOW, WHAT’S STRIKING TO ME IS A QUOTE FROM ONE OF YOUR LATEST STORIES. WE’LL PUT IT UP HERE ON THE SCREEN THAT THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT ANYBODY ANYWHERE SUGGESTED THAT THE RAID WOULD BE A BAD IDEA. NOW, FROM THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN, THERE WERE SO MANY OBVIOUS FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUES HERE. WHAT STRUCK YOU ABOUT THIS? YEAH, YOU KNOW, IN ADDITION TO THE AGENCIES THAT I TALKED ABOUT A SECOND AGO, YOU KNOW, THE COUNTY ATTORNEY AND THE SHERIFF’S OFFICE WERE ALSO PART OF THIS INVESTIGATION AND HAD KNOWLEDGE THAT THIS RAID WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. AND SO IT’S IT’S JUST REALLY SURPRISING, I THINK, THAT NOBODY ANYWHERE SAID, YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE SHOULDN’T DO THIS. NOBODY POINTED OUT THE FEDERAL PROTECTIONS. NOBODY QUESTIONED WHAT WHAT APPEARS TO BE THIS FLIMSY PRETEXT OF A CRIME, WHICH JUST ON ITS SURFACE SOUNDS RIDICULOUS, THAT THIS AMOUNTS TO IDENTITY THEFT. THAT WAS THE SUPPOSED CRIME. AND THEN WHEN NOBODY SAID OR EVEN ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IF WE DO GO THROUGH WITH THIS, IT’S GOING TO GET A LOT OF ATTENTION AND WE’RE ALL GOING TO BE UNDER FIRE FOR IT. YOU KNOW, THERE JUST SEEM TO BE OBLIVIOUS TO THE IDEA THAT THAT THIS WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT. SHERMAN WHAT’S NEXT IN THIS STORY? WE KNOW THERE’S A FEDERAL LAWSUIT AT PLAY HERE RIGHT? THAT’S RIGHT. WE HAVE ONE OF THE REPORTERS WHO HAS NOW LEFT. THE PAPER HAS FILED A FEDERAL LAWSUIT. SHE WASN’T IDENTIFIED IN THE SEARCH WARRANTS, IS EVEN BEING ONE OF THE PEOPLE THEY WERE LOOKING AT FOR THE SUPPOSED CRIME. BUT THEY STILL TOOK HER PERSONAL CELL PHONE AND THEY LOOKED THROUGH SOME OF HER REPORTING MATERIALS WHICH REVEALED A CONFIDENTIAL SOURCE. I KNOW THAT THE THE CITY COUNCILWOMAN, RUTH HERBEL, HAS SAID THAT SHE INTENDS TO FILE A FEDERAL LAWSUIT. THE NEWSPAPER, OF COURSE, HAS SAID THAT IT PLANS TO FILE A LAWSUIT. BUT I THINK THEY’RE STILL TRYING TO TO GATHER INFORMATION ON THAT. AND THERE COULD BE 1 OR 2 OTHERS TO. ALL RIGHT. WE KNOW YOU’LL BE WATCHING CLOSELY. SHERMAN SMITH WITH THE KANSAS REFLECTOR.

Special prosecutors plan to file criminal charges against the police chief who led the Marion raid.,https://www.aol.com/police-chief-led-raid-marion-151208238.html,"The former Kansas police chief who led the raid on a newspaper last summer will be charged with interfering with the judicial process, special prosecutors announced Monday.

The charge against Gideon Cody will be filed in Marion County District Court, according to a report by Sedgwick County District Attorney Marc Bennett and Riley County Attorney Barry Wilkerson.

The two were appointed to review the Aug. 11, 2023 raid at the Marion County Record. The investigation generated nearly 10,000 pages of documents.

The 124-page report analyzes the execution of the search warrants at the newspaper and the fallout after the raid, which drew international condemnation. The anticipated charge appears centered on text messages exchanged between Cody and Kari Newell, a local business owner, following the raid.

Searches were also conducted at the home of former Vice Mayor Ruth Herbel and the home of the newspaper’s publishers, Joan Meyer and her son Eric Meyer. Joan Meyer, 98, died the next day.

The report acknowledged that Joan Meyer was extremely upset by the searches and may not have died Aug. 12 if the raids had not been carried out. But the prosecutors concluded that the officers were not criminally responsible for her death.

The warrants were withdrawn the next week by the local prosecutor who found there was “insufficient evidence.”

Reached by phone on Monday morning, Eric Meyer said it was too early for him to react because he was still reading the report.

Cody did not return a voicemail seeking comment. Cody, a former Kansas City police officer, resigned from the Marion Police Department in the weeks after the raid.

Several lawsuits were filed in the wake of the raid. The newspaper alleges the raid resulted in First and Fourth Amendment violations and is seeking more than $10 million in damages.

Herbel — who filed a lawsuit against several local officials, including Cody, for the raid on her house — said she was glad to be cleared of any wrongdoing in the report, but disappointed that Cody is the only person facing a criminal charge.

“I’m sad that more people — more players — have not been charged because it went past Cody,” Herbel said in a phone interview. “There were a lot more people involved in this whole process, and it’s caused a lot of damage to Marion and to the people who were involved.”

Report findings

The raids were carried out under the pretense that a Marion County Record reporter, Phyllis Zorn, had illegally obtained information about Newell’s DUI conviction on the Kansas Department of Revenue’s website.

According to the report, Marion police officer Zach Hudlin called the state agency to ask about their system on Aug. 7. 2023. The representative said the agency was “trying to fix” an issue because “anybody can pull it up.”

Hudlin, the report said, “reached the erroneous conclusion” that Zorn had falsified her identity to access Newell’s driving record. It was difficult to tell if his conclusion was a result of confirmation bias, a hurried investigation or a misunderstanding with what the KDOR representative was explaining, the report said.

Hudlin was named interim police chief after Cody resigned.

The report noted that authorities did not interview Zorn prior to carrying out the searches.

It clears Zorn and everyone else who obtained Newell’s information, including Herbel and Eric Meyer, as the information can be accessed on a public-facing website.

The newspaper alleged that the raid was conducted to retaliate against its investigation into Cody’s history. He left the Kansas City Police Department while under internal review for allegedly making sexist comments to a female officer.

During the search, Cody looked through a reporter’s desk and says, “What’s in this? Hmm, a file on me? Keep a personal file on me, I don’t care.”

The file was not removed from the newsroom during the raid.

“If Chief Cody harbored ill-motives toward the Marion County Record, he managed to keep them hidden in personal communications with other officers both verbal and electronic,” the prosecutors’ report concluded. It goes on to say that “it is not a crime under Kansas law for a law enforcement officer to conduct a poor investigation.”

Fallout from the raid

As negative attention exploded in the days after the raid, Cody tried to defend his actions. He told Marion County Attorney Joel Ensey that the Kansas Bureau of Investigation was “100% behind me.”

A KBI investigator said “he had to live in fantasy land to get that picture.” She went on to describe Cody as “a rabid squirrel in a cage.”

Marion County Sheriff Jeff Soyez reportedly told Ensey, “You’re getting ready to get a big, old, nasty, hairy case dropped in your lap. I would suggest you hire a special prosecutor and just stay away from this entire case.”

Ensey consulted with other prosecutors, including Bennett and Wilkerson, to review the search warrants that had been executed. The special prosecutors said they had no involvement in the case again until they were asked by the Colorado Bureau of Investigation to review the case.

Even as Cody expressed worry, he doubled down, preparing charging affidavits on Eric Meyer, Zorn and Herbel on Aug. 16, 2023. The affidavits included allegations of violations of federal law, even though state prosecutors would not have a role in such cases. Charges were not filed.

On Sept. 29, Marion City Administrator Brogan Jones found out that Cody had instructed Newell to delete text messages. Cody was put on administrative leave and he resigned on Oct. 2.

The Colorado Bureau of Investigation took over the case in mid-November and handed over its investigation to the special prosecutors.

The prosecutors’ report concluded that “there is no evidence that Marion law enforcement agents recognized the inadequacy of the investigation or intentionally or knowingly misled either other law enforcement agents of the court.”

It also said that the warrant for the newspaper was “insufficient to overcome additional protections afforded to the press by virtue of the Kansas Shield Law,” which grants protections to journalists and that search warrants of newsrooms “should be sought only in extraordinary circumstances and with extreme caution.”"

Ismail Haniyeh, a top leader of Hamas, was assassinated on Wednesday by an explosive device covertly smuggled into the Tehran guesthouse where he was staying, according to seven Middle Eastern officials, including two Iranians, and an American official.

The bomb had been hidden approximately two months ago in the guesthouse, according to five of the Middle Eastern officials. The guesthouse is run and protected by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and is part of a large compound, known as Neshat, in an upscale neighborhood of northern Tehran.

Mr. Haniyeh was in Iran’s capital for the presidential inauguration. The bomb was detonated remotely, the five officials said, once it was confirmed that he was inside his room at the guesthouse. The blast also killed a bodyguard.

The explosion shook the building, shattered some windows and caused the partial collapse of an exterior wall, according to the two Iranian officials, members of the Revolutionary Guards briefed on the incident. Such damage was also evident in a photograph of the building shared with The New York Times."

Iran is purposefully delaying its retaliation against Israel to sow fear and give itself more time to coordinate, our Middle East correspondent Alistair Bunkall says.



Israel has been blamed by Iran for killing Hamas's political leader in Tehran last week, with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowing revenge and saying it was Iran's ""duty"" to avenge the assassination.

It is expected to retaliate with a multiday attack on Israel. This will come from multiple fronts, including from Hezbollah in Lebanon to the north, the Houthis in Yemen to the south and proxies loyal to Iran in Syria and Iraq to the east.

Organising such an attack undoubtedly takes time and strict coordination, which is one reason why a large attack has not yet come.

Another reason is that Iran is able to sow fear into Israelis and the Lebanese, who are anxiously speculating over what might be on the horizon.

""The wait for Iran's response is in part deliberate, I think,"" says Bunkall.



""The Iranians know that it sort of plays into the psychology of Israelis as they speculate what might be coming.

""It's also because I think the Iranians are trying to decide exactly what their response is going to be, how to coordinate it with Hezbollah and other proxies.

""The delay does give particularly the Americans time to get more military assets into the region, to provide a defensive layer for Israel too.""

Nasser Kanaani, a spokesman for the Iranian foreign minister, said today that Tehran was not seeking a wider conflict in the region, but added that ""punishing Israel is necessary"".



Despite Iran's attempt to downplay the idea it would spark an all-out regional war, Bunkall says that decision might now be out of politicians' hands.

""It would not take a very big Iranian retaliation, or from Hezbollah, to force the region into an uncontrollable war,"" he added.

""And even though that's not what everybody wants, sometimes these events have a habit of running out of the control of the politicians and the commanders who try to orchestrate them."""

By Doina Chiacu

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. is deploying additional military might in the Middle East as a defensive measure with a goal of de-escalating tensions in the region, a White House official said on Sunday.

Regional tensions have increased following the assassination on Wednesday of Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, in Tehran a day after an Israeli strike in Beirut killed Fuad Shukr, a senior military commander from the Lebanese group Hezbollah. Both groups are backed by Iran.

There are mounting fears that Israel’s war against Palestinian militants in Gaza, which began last October after attacks on the Jewish state, could escalate into a wider Middle East conflict. Iran and Hamas have blamed Israel for Haniyeh’s killing in the Iranian capital, and they, together with Hezbollah, have vowed revenge. Israel has not claimed or denied responsibility.

U.S. President Joe Biden will convene his national security team in the situation room on Monday to discuss developments in the Middle East, the White House said, adding that he would speak with Jordan’s King Abdullah as well.

U.S. news service Axios reported that U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told his counterpart from G7 countries that Iran and Hezbollah could start attacking Israel as early as Monday, citing three sources briefed on the call. But Blinken, according to Axios, said it was unclear how Iran and Hezbollah would attack and did not know the exact timing.

When asked about the report, the State Department referred to a readout of the call, where it said the ministers discussed “the urgent need for de-escalation in the Middle East.”

The Pentagon said on Friday it would deploy additional fighter jets and Navy warships to the region.

“The overall goal is to turn the temperature down in the region, deter and defend against those attacks, and avoid regional conflict,” Jonathan Finer, the White House’s deputy national security adviser, said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” program.

The U.S. and Israel are preparing for every possibility, Finer added.

There was a “very close call” of regional conflagration in April, Finer said, when Iran launched an attack on Israeli territory with drones and missiles after what it called an Israeli strike on its consulate in Damascus on April 1 that killed seven officers of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in the Syrian capital.

The U.S. wants to be prepared should that situation rise again, Finer added.

In a call with his Israeli counterpart, the Pentagon said U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin reiterated the United States’ support for Israel’s security and “right to self-defense against threats from Iran, Lebanese Hizballah (Hezbollah), Houthis, and other Iranian-backed terrorist groups.”

Blinken spoke with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani on Sunday and emphasized “the importance of all parties taking steps to calm regional tensions, avoid further escalation, and advance stability,” the State Department said.

‘PRUDENT PLANNING’

Biden on Saturday expressed hope that Iran would stand down despite its threat to avenge Haniyeh’s killing.

The U.S. on Wednesday urged its citizens who wish to leave Lebanon to start making plans immediately.

“This is no prediction about future events. It is prudent planning for them and for our government,” Finer said on CBS.

The British government advised its nationals to leave Lebanon. Canada told its citizens to avoid all travel to Israel, saying the regional conflict endangers security.

Haniyeh’s death was one in a series of killings of senior Hamas figures in the Gaza war – with nearly 40,000 Palestinians killed, according to Gaza’s health ministry – and it fueled concern of a wider Middle East conflict.

Hamas said it has begun a “broad consultation process” to choose a new leader to replace Haniyeh, who was the face of the group’s international diplomacy.

The U.S. and international partners including France, Britain, Italy and Egypt continued diplomatic contacts seeking to prevent further regional escalation.

Jordan’s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, will travel to Iran on Sunday in a rare visit to discuss regional developments with his Iranian counterpart, Iranian state media reported.

Violence continued on Sunday in the Palestinian territories.

At least 25 Palestinians were killed and several others injured on Sunday in an Israeli strike targeting two schools that were sheltering displaced people near Gaza City, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA said.

Another strike hit a tent inside a hospital compound in central Gaza, killing at least five people, Gaza health officials said, after another round of talks ended without result.
