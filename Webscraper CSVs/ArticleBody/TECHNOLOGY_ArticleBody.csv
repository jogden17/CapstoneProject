Pixel Watch August 2024 update rolling out 9to5Google.,https://9to5google.com/2024/08/05/pixel-watch-august-2024-update/,"Google is rolling out the latest Pixel Watch and Pixel Watch 2 update with the August 2024 security patch today. Like last month, it arrives in the afternoon before the phone and Tablet updates.

The Pixel Watch is now on the “August 5, 2024” security patch level. Based on Wear OS 4, TWD9.240805.001.A2 is the build number for all four models.

The rollout will continue over the next week in phases depending on carrier and device. Users will receive a notification on their watch once the SW OTA update becomes available for their device.

The Pixel Watch August 2024 update changelog just includes the monthly security patch.

Tapping the “Your watch is up to date” screen (Settings > System > System updates) multiple times initiates the download this afternoon. To speed up the process, open Connectivity preferences and disable Bluetooth to force Wi-Fi. The OTA images can be found here.

Pixel Watch August 2024 update rolling out 9to5Google.,https://9to5google.com/2024/08/05/quick-share-update-galaxy/,"A new update to Quick Share looks to have appeared on some Galaxy devices. The update brings a higher daily file size cap, upping it from 5GB.

Quick Share began rolling out at the beginning of 2024, and it has taken on some favorable improvements since its launch. Though it still isn’t perfect, Quick Share is one of the best tools for sending files to other devices belonging to yourself, friends, family, or colleagues in a matter of seconds.

A new Quick Share update seems to be in the works to further its development. Spotted by CID on Twitter/X, it appears Quick Share on Galaxy devices will adopt a new file size cap of 10GB instead of the original 5GB. This will double the amount of data a user can send in a day, which will be helpful for those of us who send a lot of data to and from devices.

The changelog does specify that this file limit is in place “when sharing a QR code, copying a URL, and sharing to contacts.” In other words, the cap is in effect when something is shared using the link-sharing method or the in-house QR code generator. This is an option on Samsung’s devices, and it looks as though the spotted update is through the Galaxy Store.

New Quick Share 😳

The Quick Share update changelog also notes that the update will change how devices are identified on your phone. Instead of a singular line that can be cut off, a second line is available to fully identify the user’s phone. This will hep to prevent misplaced identity and sending files to the wrong person. Even if they have receiving turned off for every device, Quick Share would send an unwanted prompt. This change will likely help in that situation.

As mentioned, it looks like the above Quick Share update is through the Galaxy Store, and it specifically mentions sending via QR codes, which has long been a Sasmung Galaxy feature and not a Google Pixel tool – yet. The changelog does not include a version number, nor do when know when this update will roll out. On all of our devices, we’re still seeing a 5GB limit in place.

Pixel Watch August 2024 update rolling out 9to5Google.,https://9to5google.com/2024/08/04/chromecast-google-tv-update-june-2024/,"Ahead of the radical departure that is the Google TV Streamer, the next Chromecast with Google TV update (June 2024) is rolling out.

The STTL.240508.005 (from STTE.240315.002) update for the Chromecast with Google TV brings the Android security patch level to June 2024 (from Apr 2024). It is not yet reflected in the changelog.

Today’s 71.94 MB update is on the smaller end, with “Other bug fixes and performance improvements” mentioned.

This marks the fifth Chromecast with Google TV update in eight months — February, March, April, May, and August with Google already outpacing the 2023 cadence: January, April, May, July, October, and December.

The first update of the year brought Fast Pair and the Audio output switcher in Quick Settings. The big update we’re waiting for will add a “Home runtime.”, thus allowing the Chromecast with Google TV to act as a hub for Matter devices. It’s officially coming later this year.

On your Chromecast with Google TV, go to Settings > System > About > System update.

Pixel Watch August 2024 update rolling out 9to5Google.,https://9to5google.com/2024/08/05/galaxy-watch-7-ultra-first-update/?extended-comments,"The Galaxy Watch 7 and Watch Ultra are both getting their first update since public release last week. The new updates bring simple bug fixes and stability enhancements.

Update 8/5: One UI 6 for the Galaxy Watch Ultra and Galaxy Watch 7 is now available in the US (via Droid Life). Rollout is starting to happen for users with either device. This update is intended to improve device stability. It looks to carry more emphasis on stability in the changelog, along with a slightly different file size in the US.

Samsung is currently on Wear OS 5 in One UI 6 with the Watch 7 and Watch Ultra. Versions prior to those models are able to download and install the One UI 6 beta, though the release of the newest devices likely means the stable version will trickle down to the Galaxy Watch 4, 5, and 6 sometime soon.

The Galaxy Watch 7 and Watch Ultra have started receiving an update days after release. The new version comes with the moniker L310XXU1AXG2 for the Watch 7, while the Galaxy Watch Ultra is seeing L705FXXU1AXFB (via SamMobile). There may be a chance that your device has automatically updated if the setting is turned on.

Users can check for themselves by heading into the Galaxy Wearables app and scrolling to the bottom of the Watch settings page. Hitting Watch software update will allow the watch to search for the latest version. The current version will also be available in this section.

The changelog leaves quite a bit to the imagination in classic security update style. Performance enhancement and bug fixes are mentioned in little detail, likely meaning there are small changes that have been made to make the experience a little bit better for a brand-new device.

After all, the Galaxy Watch Ultra retails for $649, and the Watch 7 at $299, so a competent software version is necessary. This isn’t indicative of a broken OS out of the box, but rather, a refinement for users.

The new version does bring a few changes to how Samsung’s wearables handle workouts and health-tracking statistics. The new update should be rolling out to users now.

Pixel Watch August 2024 update rolling out 9to5Google.,https://9to5google.com/2024/08/04/google-pixel-9-price-more-expensive-discussion/,"Thanks to a treasure trove’s worth of leaks, we know pretty much everything there is to know about the Pixel 9 series, including that it will see some price hikes, making the main three phones more expensive. Why is that?

This issue of 9to5Google Weekender is a part of 9to5Google’s rebooted newsletter that highlights the biggest Google stories with added commentary and other tidbits. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox early!

One of the core pillars of Google’s first Tensor-powered Pixels was value. By delivering much of the same hardware features at a lesser cost, the deficiencies of Google’s chip could be overlooked relatively easily. Over time, though, prices inevitably went up, peaking with last year’s Pixel 8 at $699 and Pixel 8 Pro at $999.

This year, those prices are expected to go up by around $100 across the board, with a $1,000 Pixel 9 Pro offering a smaller but equally capable alternative to the (likely) $1,100 Pixel 9 Pro XL.

Despite the many Pixel leaks this week, though, we still don’t have confirmation of US pricing for the entire lineup – just the Pixel Watch 3 and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.

But why are they going up? In terms of hardware design, the Pixel 9 series is certainly an upgrade in some ways, but new devices generally don’t bring an upcharge for design alone unless there are material changes, and none of that is expected. The displays are getting better across the board, but that’s also not something that usually comes with a price bump. Starting storage totals are supposedly unchanged, and Google is still set for 7 years of updates, which was arguably the biggest reason last year’s price bump didn’t sting all that much.

There are some more meaningful upgrades at play. The cameras on the Pro series are better, with a much higher-resolution selfie camera and a better sensor for the ultrawide on the back too. The existence of the smaller Pixel 9 Pro on its own is also a welcome addition to the lineup for many who were starved for a capable but smaller device for years. Tensor G4 in itself isn’t a big upgrade, but rumors of free-for-a-while satellite connectivity and the better modem should be meaningful additions as well.

But I do think there’s one very tangible upgrade that a lot of people are overlooking, and that’s memory.

According to leaks, Google is equipping the entire Pixel 9 series with more RAM this year. The base Pixel 9 will allegedly ship with 12GB of RAM, while the Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL (and Fold) will get 16GB of RAM by default. 16GB of RAM is a total that was unheard of just a few years ago, and is still exceedingly uncommon for most smartphones, especially in base configurations. For comparison, Samsung’s $1,300 Galaxy S24 Ultra doesn’t have a 16GB variant, and certainly doesn’t offer that in its base model. Looking at the Galaxy S24 series as a means of comparison, 12GB and 16GB really does eclipse Google’s primary competition, as the base Galaxy S24 only have 8GB of RAM.

The reason for this is most likely for the sake of AI, as on-device AI tends to rely heavily on plenty of memory. But, even if AI isn’t something you’ll use frequently, that additional memory should provide a boost to overall performance in day-to-day tasks, and that excess memory will be very useful in the years to come as AI constantly changes the focus of our phones. It should also prove helpful through the near-decade of software support these phones are getting.

I do think Google should have gone ahead and also upped the base storage to 256GB alongside that change, but effectively upping the RAM by 25% or more is quite an impactful change, and one that I think does ease the sting of higher pricing, at least in my book. It does sound like pre-orders will come with boosted storage, though.

What do you think?

Now, the other question that begs to be asked here is that if the Pixel 9 Pro Fold isn’t getting a price increase despite it’s much longer list of additional upgrades, why are the other models? And I think the reasoning here is obvious. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold, like the Pixel Fold before it, is expensive, and at such a high price, it’s really hard to justify an increase. Google’s Pixel Fold should have been cheaper, but based on everything we’ve heard about the new one, the sequel actually seems somewhat worthy of its price – maybe, we’ll see.

Pixel Watch August 2024 update rolling out 9to5Google.,https://9to5google.com/2024/08/05/doj-rules-against-google-search-suit/?extended-comments,"The DOJ has ruled against Google in a lawsuit regarding payments to ensure search engine prominence on certain devices. The decision reaches a head after the case nears 4 years in progress.

An antitrust lawsuit was brought against Google in 2020 that alleged Google embraced a monopolistic attitude in promoting Google Search. The lawsuit indicates the DOJ sued Google over several actions, which include paying browsers, carriers, and mobile phone manufacturers to stay the most visible search engine on the web.

It was reported that Google paid Apple $26 billion so it could remain the default search engine in the company’s web browser and devices. Because of this, the DOJ ruled that Google broke the law. The ruling was finalized on August 5, 2024 after the Department of Justice first brought the case up in 2020 (via Bloomberg).

The case as a whole specifically targeted Google’s tendency to attempt to maintain the default position in mobile phone browsers. The payments made to these companies to ensure that remained the case is what the DOJ regards as an illegal act.

The court’s official ruling goes against Google in the antitrust suit, calling Google a monopolist in action and attitude. The court document concludes District Judge Amit Mehta’s notes on the lawsuit ruling regarding Google’s search engine reach.

The court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly. Distrcit Judge Amit Mehta

Google has since posted a statement on Twitter/X, noting that the court often referred to Google Search as a superior product.

Here’s our statement on today’s decision in the DOJ case:



“This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn’t be allowed to make it easily available. We appreciate the Court’s finding that Google is ‘the industry’s highest quality… — Google Communications (@Google_Comms) August 5, 2024

Google’s next steps could involve appealing to the U.S. District Court of Appeal. The court may also require Google to make significant changes in its search engine strategy after the lawsuit. The court ruling was finalized just today, so there are no further actions on the list. That likely won’t be the case for long. If Google were to lose the default position for Apple’s Safari browser, millions in revenue would be lost.

It’ll be interesting to see what Google is required to do following the antitrust suit and, in absence, what company may try to take its place.

OpenAI has built a text watermarking method to detect ChatGPT-written text.,https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/openai-has-built-a-text-watermarking-method-to-detect-chatgpt-written-content-company-has-mulled-its-release-over-the-past-year,"OpenAI has already built and tested a tool to detect whether any written content has been created using ChatGPT. However, the Wall Street Journal reports that the company is holding back the tool from public release because of several concerns.

The tool adds a pattern to how the large language model (LLM) writes its output, allowing OpenAI to detect if ChatGPT created it. However, the pattern remains unnoticeable to humans, thereby not impacting the LLM’s quality. Internal documentation says that the tool is 99.9% effective in detecting ChatGPT’s output, but OpenAI has yet to release it.

While text watermarking is highly effective for detecting content written by ChatGPT, it cannot work with output from other LLMs like Gemini AI or Llama 3. Furthermore, this technique can be easily circumvented. For example, you can insert ChatGPT’s output in Google Translate, convert it to another language, and then back to English, effectively removing the watermarking.

It could even be as simple as asking the AI to insert a unique character, emoji, or even a short phrase between words and then deleting them later (via Microsoft Word’s Find and Replace function, for example) or asking another LLM to rephrase the entire output entirely is enough to break the detection tool.

Another point of contention OpenAI has on releasing the tool is that it says it could be biased against non-native English writers. The company previously released a generative AI text detection tool last year. Still, it only took seven months before OpenAI pulled the plug on it because of its low detection rate and propensity to deliver false positives. It even has led to the point that a professor once failed an entire class because all the submitted papers were inaccurately marked as AI-generated.

Furthermore, OpenAI also considers its customer base, with customer surveys showing that 69% of ChatGPT users believe that the tool would result in false accusations of AI cheating. 30% even said they would likely switch to a rival LLM if OpenAI deployed the tool. The company is facing another issue with the broad deployment of the ChatGPT detector, as other users could reverse engineer OpenAI’s watermarking technique and release a plug-in or app to neutralize it.

Nevertheless, OpenAI understands the risk that AI-generated content poses to society and has been looking at alternatives to the text watermarking technique. There’s also a demand for an AI detector, with internal data showing that 80% of people asked globally support its existence.

It’s still a question of whether OpenAI will release its text watermarking tool and detector. However, it also understands that as one of the leading organizations in the development of AI, it must also take steps to ensure the responsible use of its tools. Sources say that OpenAI has, until this fall, to sway public opinion around AI transparency. We don’t know what this means, but there’s one thing we’re sure of: we must be critical of what we read and ensure we’re getting the truth."
OpenAI has built a text watermarking method to detect ChatGPT-written text.,https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/04/openai-says-its-taking-a-deliberate-approach-to-releasing-tools-that-can-detect-writing-from-chatgpt/,"OpenAI has built a tool that could potentially catch students who cheat by asking ChatGPT to write their assignments — but according to The Wall Street Journal, the company is debating whether to actually release it.

In a statement provided to TechCrunch, an OpenAI spokesperson confirmed that the company is researching the text watermarking method described in the Journal’s story, but said it’s taking a “deliberate approach” due to “the complexities involved and its likely impact on the broader ecosystem beyond OpenAI.”

“The text watermarking method we’re developing is technically promising, but has important risks we’re weighing while we research alternatives, including susceptibility to circumvention by bad actors and the potential to disproportionately impact groups like non-English speakers,” the spokesperson said.

This would be a different approach from most previous efforts to detect AI-generated text, which have been largely ineffective. Even OpenAI itself shut down its previous AI text detector last year due to its “low rate of accuracy.”

With text watermarking, OpenAI would focus solely on detecting writing from ChatGPT, not from other companies’ models. It would do so by making small changes to how ChatGPT selects words, essentially creating an invisible watermark in the writing that could later be detected by a separate tool.

Following the publication of the Journal’s story, OpenAI also updated a May blog post about its research around detecting AI-generated content. The update says text watermarking has proven “highly accurate and even effective against localized tampering, such as paraphrasing,” but has proven “less robust against globalized tampering; like using translation systems, rewording with another generative model, or asking the model to insert a special character in between every word and then deleting that character.”

As a result, OpenAI writes that this method is “trivial to circumvention by bad actors.” OpenAI’s update also echoes the spokesperson’s point about non-English speakers, writing that text watermarking could “stigmatize use of AI as a useful writing tool for non-native English speakers.”"
OpenAI has built a text watermarking method to detect ChatGPT-written text.,https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/4/24213268/openai-chatgpt-text-watermark-cheat-detection-tool,"OpenAI has had a system for watermarking ChatGPT-created text and a tool to detect the watermark ready for about a year, reports The Wall Street Journal. But the company is divided internally over whether to release it. On one hand, it seems like the responsible thing to do; on the other, it could hurt its bottom line.

OpenAI’s watermarking is described as adjusting how the model predicts the most likely words and phrases that will follow previous ones, creating a detectable pattern. (That’s a simplification, but you can check out Google’s more in-depth explanation for Gemini’s text watermarking for more).

Offering any way to detect AI-written material is a potential boon for teachers trying to deter students from turning over writing assignments to AI. The Journal reports that the company found watermarking didn’t affect the quality of its chatbot’s text output. In a survey the company commissioned, “people worldwide supported the idea of an AI detection tool by a margin of four to one,” the Journal writes.

After the Journal published its story, OpenAI confirmed it’s worked on watermarking text in a blog post update today that was spotted by TechCrunch. In it, the company says its method is very accurate (“99.9% effective,” according to documents the Journal saw) and resistant to “tampering, such as paraphrasing.” But it says techniques like rewording with another model make it “trivial to circumvention by bad actors.” The company also says it’s concerned about the stigmatization AI tools’ usefulness for non-native speakers.

But it seems OpenAI is also worried that using watermarking could turn off surveyed ChatGPT users, almost 30 percent of whom evidently told the company that they’d use the software less if watermarking was implemented.

Despite that, some employees still reportedly feel that watermarking is effective. In light of nagging user sentiments, though, the Journal says some suggested trying methods that are “potentially less controversial among users but unproven.” In its blog post update today, the company said it’s “in the early stages” of exploring embedding metadata. It says it’s still “too early” to know how well it will work, but that because it’s cryptographically signed, there would be no false positives."

In a survey commissioned by OpenAI, it was found that people globally supported the idea of an AI detection tool by a margin of four to one, the report shared.

However, almost 30% of the respondents also said that they would use the tool less often if OpenAI watermarked the text.

Since the news, OpenAI has confirmed, in a blog, that they were working on the tool . The company has called the AI detection methods 99.9% effective and resistant to tampering methods like paraphrasing. But if the text was then reworded with another model, it would make it “trivial to circumvention by bad actors.”

OpenAI also noted in the blog that they didn’t want to stigmatise the use of AI tools by non-native English speakers.

The tool would reportedly just focus on detecting writing from ChatGPT and not by AI models from other companies. It would make tiny changes to how ChatGPT was predicting words and create an invisible watermark in the writing that could then be easily detected by another tool later."

OpenAI has built a text watermarking method to detect ChatGPT-written text.,https://bgr.com/tech/openai-has-a-tool-that-can-tell-if-you-use-chatgpt-to-cheat-but-it-wont-release-it/,"OpenAI released the first public version of ChatGPT in November 2022. Soon after that, schools started banning it out of fear that students would use the AI to cheat. The main problem is ChatGPT’s ability to generate text on any topic within seconds, which opened an avenue for cheating. Students could create papers on anything and turn them in without really worrying about being caught. There was no tool from OpenAI that could identify AI-generated text.

OpenAI has developed a ChatGPT “text watermarking” tool in the two years since then. A report says the tool has been ready for at least a year and can detect ChatGPT text with 99.9% accuracy. However, OpenAI is afraid to release it after a survey revealed that about a third of ChatGPT users would stop using the chatbot if the anti-cheating measures were implemented.

The report comes from The Wall Street Journal, which saw documents describing the tool. One of these people told the paper that using it is just a matter of “pressing a button.”

The tool is very effective. It’s capable of detecting 99.9% of ChatGPT-generated text. The tool would watermark the text in a way that humans would not be able to discern:

Tech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.

ChatGPT is powered by an AI system that predicts what word or word fragment, known as a token, should come next in a sentence. The anti-cheating tool under discussion at OpenAI would slightly change how the tokens are selected. Those changes would leave a pattern called a watermark.

The report explains that OpenAI commissioned a study in April 2023 that showed worldwide support for a tool that would detect ChatGPT text. Four people in the survey wanted such a tool for each person who didn’t.

However, a different OpenAI study from the same month showed that 69% of ChatGPT users found that cheating detection tech would lead to false accusations. More importantly, 30% of the respondents said they would use ChatGPT less if it deployed a watermark system that rival AI chatbots didn’t have.

Since then, OpenAI staff have debated the merits of making an anti-cheat tool available to the public. It’s not just about growing the ChatGPT user base.

Separately, OpenAI found that the anti-cheat tool would not impact the quality of ChatGPT text generation. That could have been a reason to avoid releasing the tool to the public.

One challenge is determining who has access to the tool, per the WSJ. If too many people have it, bad actors would figure out the watermarking technique. Then, it would be largely useless. One proposal is to make the tool available to educators or companies that can help schools identify AI-written content.

OpenAI told The Journal that its ChatGPT anti-cheat tool would affect some groups of people, like non-native English speakers. That’s a point OpenAI makes in an update to a May blog post about watermarking images generated with its AI models. The update came after the WSJ report.

OpenAI explains that its watermarking tool can be easily defended against, offering examples of how you could disable it:

While it has been highly accurate and even effective against localized tampering, such as paraphrasing, it is less robust against globalized tampering; like using translation systems, rewording with another generative model, or asking the model to insert a special character in between every word and then deleting that character – making it trivial to circumvention by bad actors.

The company says it’s working on developing a text metadata watermarking tool for ChatGPT-generated text:

For example, unlike watermarking, metadata is cryptographically signed, which means that there are no false positives. We expect this will be increasingly important as the volume of generated text increases. While text watermarking has a low false positive rate, applying it to large volumes of text would lead to a large number of total false positives.

Still, there’s no telling when OpenAI will release such a tool. Meanwhile, Google has a watermarking tool that can detect text written with Gemini AI. It’s called SynthID, but it’s not widely available. After all, Google just told children it’s okay to use Gemini AI to craft that perfect letter with the Olympics ad everybody hates. Google pulled that commercial following all the backlash.

These companies are also working on labeling visual AI-generated content. The updated OpenAI blog post above focuses on watermarking images. That’s understandable, as AI-generated photos can be used for misleading purposes. But, hopefully, all genAI chatbots out there will soon make such watermarking techniques standard for text too."

ChatGPT creators OpenAI has developed a system that can identify text made by the AI system – but is worried about using it.

Making it easy to spot AI-generated words could lead to a stigma against using it, the company warned. Among other things, that might make ChatGPT and other similar tools less popular.

Since ChatGPT was first released, at the end of 2022, it has become one of the most popular websites in the world. That has included a growing use in situations such as education, with teachers increasingly reporting that students are able to generate essay answers and other work using the AI system.

In response to those worries and others, AI companies including OpenAI have been working on building tools that would be able to identify text when it is generated by an artificial intelligence system such as ChatGPT.

Now the company has developed a system that can spot AI-generated text in almost all cases, according to reports. But it is worried that being able to identify the text with such certainty could cause problems of its own.

The tool, which has been reportedly in the works for more than a year, leaves the text equivalent of a watermark in the words that are generated. That pattern would not be recognisable to any person who generated or read the text – but can be easily spotted by a companion AI system that could be used by teachers to see if their students are cheating, for instance.

But the company is worried that doing so would lead fewer people to use it, a new report says. An internal report is said to have shown that nearly 30 per cent of ChatGPT users said they would use it less if such a watermarking system were in place.

The creation of the tool and the fear that it could limit the use of ChatGPT were first reported by the Wall Street Journal. After the paper published its report, OpenAI updated a blog post from May in which it had discussed the possibility of watermarking text.

In that blog post, it said that its teams “have developed a text watermarking method that we continue to consider as we research alternatives”. The method is “highly accurate and even effective” against “localised” tampering, such as paraphrasing the text from ChatGPT, but it said it could be fooled by other, more “globalised” techniques, such as translating it into a different language or using another AI model to reword it.

But it also noted that the “text watermarking method has the potential to disproportionately impact some groups”. It could “stigmatise use of AI as a useful writing tool for non-native English speakers”, the company warned."
OpenAI has built a text watermarking method to detect ChatGPT-written text.,https://www.techspot.com/news/104120-openai-confirms-has-reliable-tool-detecting-chatgpt-generated.html,"Why it matters: OpenAI has a tool that could catch those people who use ChatGPT to write content while claiming it as their own. The text watermarking feature could be a revelation for teachers and companies who suspect people are cheating by using the chatbot but claim otherwise. However, OpenAI says it is only considering releasing it, possibly because doing so could impact its sales.

News that OpenAI has a system that can watermark ChatGPT-created text and detect it was revealed by The Wall Street Journal. The tool has been ready for about a year, but there is debate within the AI firm over whether it should ever be released.

In simple terms, the system works by making slight adjustments to the way ChatGPT selects words and phrases that follow each other, creating a pattern that can be detected by another tool – an invisible watermark, essentially.

OpenAI updated a May blog post following the publication of the WSJ report, confirming that ""Our teams have developed a text watermarking method that we continue to consider as we research alternatives.""

The post states that while the watermarking has proved highly accurate and effective against localized tampering, such as paraphrasing, it struggles when faced with globalized tampering, including using translation systems and rewording text using another generative model. Users could even circumvent the system by asking the model to insert a special character in between every word and then deleting that character.

OpenAI also claims that text watermarking has the potential to disproportionately impact some groups. It gives the example of stigmatizing the use of AI as a writing tool for non-native English speakers.

Text watermarking is one of several solutions OpenAI has been investigating. It has looked into classifiers and metadata as part of ""extensive research on the area of text provenance.""

In a statement to TechCrunch, an OpenAI spokesperson confirmed the WSJ's report but said it was taking a ""deliberate approach"" due to ""the complexities involved and its likely impact on the broader ecosystem beyond OpenAI.""

For all OpenAI's claims of why it is still considering releasing the watermarking method, the main reason is likely the fact that 30% of surveyed ChatGPT users said that they'd use the chatbot less often if watermarking was implemented.

In March 2023, a study by five computer scientists from the University of Maryland concluded that text generated by LLMs cannot be reliably detected in practical scenarios, both from a theoretical and practical standpoint. OpenAI seemed to agree, shutting down its AI classifier tool, which was supposed to determine the likelihood that a piece of text was written by an AI, in July last year due to its low rate of accuracy."

OpenAI is developing technology that can detect text written by ChatGPT with 99.9% accuracy. Is this a countermeasure against students using AI to complete their homework?





With the advent of generative AI, which can output highly accurate answers to various questions, the possibility of students using AI to complete assignments has come into question. To address this issue, OpenAI, which develops the chat AI ChatGPT, has developed a tool that can detect text written using ChatGPT with 99.9% accuracy, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.

With the advent of generative AI that can output highly accurate sentences such as ChatGPT, more and more people are leaving sentence creation to AI . It has also been revealed that as of January 2023, approximately 17% of students at Stanford University in the United States ' use ChatGPT for assignments or exams. ' To address this issue, a tool is being developed to detect sentences created by AI .



OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, also announced the 'AI Text Classifier', a tool for detecting AI-generated text, in January 2023.

However, it has been pointed out that AI-generated text detection tools can mistakenly identify text written by non-native English speakers as 'created by AI'.

There have also been reported cases where tools meant to detect AI-generated content have mistakenly identified content by people who are not using AI as AI-generated, resulting in people being falsely accused of fraud.

Therefore, OpenAI is developing a technology that is fundamentally different from conventional AI-generated text detection technology, 'detecting sentences created by ChatGPT by adding watermarks to the text,' according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. This can be achieved by making small changes to the way ChatGPT selects words. Basically, it adds an invisible watermark to the output of ChatGPT, which can be detected later by a dedicated tool, and the detection accuracy is said to be very high at 99.9%.



Following the Wall Street Journal report, OpenAI updated a blog post announcing its 'research into technology to detect AI-generated content' and described the text watermarking technology it is developing.

https://openai.com/index/understanding-the-source-of-what-we-see-and-hear-online/







According to OpenAI, text watermarking has been proven to be effective against 'local tampering such as paraphrasing,' which has been employed to detect AI-generated text in the past. However, it is not as robust against tampering that involves using a translation system, paraphrasing with a separate generative model, or asking the model to insert a special character between each word and then remove it.



Therefore, according to OpenAI, it seems that the text watermark can be 'easily circumvented by malicious actors.' In addition, since there are many cases where people who are not native English speakers use ChatGPT for writing work, there is a possibility that such users may misunderstand that the documents they create are 'created by AI from scratch.'



An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that they are developing a text watermarking technology that can detect text created using AI, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, with 99.9% accuracy. However, they made it clear that they are cautious about releasing the tool, saying, 'The text watermarking method we are developing is technically promising, but there is a possibility that it could be circumvented by malicious actors or that it could disadvantage groups such as non-English speakers.'

Launch day leaked for Apple's iPhone 16 series — and it could be sooner than last.,https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/iphones/launch-day-leaked-for-apples-iphone-16-series-and-it-could-be-sooner-than-last-years-announcement,"While September is traditionally when Apple releases its new iPhone models, the exact date remains up in the air. Now the latest rumor is that Apple could launch the iPhone 16 lineup on September 10.

That's according to a weekend report from CNMO Technology News, as spotted by Phone Arena. Adding credence to that is the fact that September 10 is a Tuesday, which is typically the day of the week that Apple holds its iPhone announcement events. Though the iPhone 14 did buck that trend back in 2022, with Apple holding its big event on Wednesday instead. All four models, including the iPhone 16 Ultra, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max, are expected to go on sale starting September 20.

That being said, CNMO doesn't have a proven track record with these kinds of rumors, so we suggest you take that date with a grain of salt for now. But we do have some clues as to what to expect from Apple's new phones thanks to plenty of rumors on everything from the iPhone 16's battery capacities to design upgrades.

The vanilla iPhone 16 is rumored to come in seven color options — black, blue, pink, yellow, green, white, and purple — while the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max should come in rose/desert yellow, gray, space black, and white. Based on previous reports, the iPhone 16 Pro will be getting a much larger screen measuring 6.3 inches while the iPhone 16 Pro Max clocks in at 6.9 inches. Meanwhile, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are said to be sticking with the current 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch sizes. They could also keep the iPhone 15's aging 60Hz refresh rate as well, unfortunately. But all models are rumored to get thinner bezels around the display.

As for what's under the hood, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus should inherit the A17 Pro chip currently used by the iPhone 15 Pro models and run on 3-nanometer A18 chips. Meanwhile, the Pro models seem set to get more powerful versions of the A18 chip. Both the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max could also get an improved telephoto camera, with the iPhone 16 Pro tipped to adopt the tetraprism telephoto lens complete with 5x zoom capabilities.

If you’re looking to shop ahead, however, one recent rumor suggests the next batch of iPhones will be released earlier in the month than usual.

As reported by CNMO , the next best iPhone is set to release on September 10, just over one month away from time of writing. Generally, we hear news of the iPhone event around this time in September each year, with the iPhone itself launching a week or two later. If this rumor turns out to be true, we can expect to see the iPhone 16 in shops by Friday, September 19, going off previous iPhone launch dates."

The next iPhone lineup, the Apple iPhone 16 series, is all set to debut next month. Traditionally, September has been the month of Apple, when the company launched its iPhone lineup. While this year is going to be the same, a fresh tip suggests that the launch could happen a few days earlier than last year.

According to a Chinese outlet, CNMO Technology News, Apple could launch the iPhone 16 series, which includes the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and the iPhone 16 Pro Max, on September 10.

Notably, September 10 is Tuesday, which is Apple's favorite day for launching its iPhones. For instance, last year, Apple launched the iPhone 15 series on September 12, which was a Tuesday. However, the iPhone 14 series did ditch the trend in 2022 and instead was announced on Wednesday.

That being said, CNMO doesn't have a proven track record about launch date predictions, and there is also no information from where the outlet got this scoop from. It could be a wild guess, so we would advise you to take this piece of information with a pinch of salt.

The iPhone 16 series has been leaked numerous times, giving us almost everything we want. Dummy units have been leaked multiple times suggesting that this year, the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus could feature a vertical camera module. This change is allegedly introduced to allow the standard iPhone models to record spatial videos for Apple Vision Pro.

Recently, all colors of the iPhone 16 Pro were leaked, showing off a darker black than the iPhone 15 Pro. Before this, dummy units of the iPhone 16 also revealed its potential color options. This year's iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max are expected to pack bigger camera sensors.

Moreover, the iPhone 16 lineup is expected to get brighter displays, thanks to the Samsung M14 OLED display panel. Additionally, the bezels on this year's iPhone lineup are touted to be the thinnest of any smartphone."

From the iPhone 16 family's battery capacities to designs , everything seems to have been finalized as we head into August. September is when Apple traditionally releases new iPhone models, so the company has probably already decided on an unveiling date. And apparently, a Chinese outlet knows just when that will be.According to CNMO Technology News , theseries will be announced on September 10. That seems plausible as Apple likes to hold its iPhone announcement events on Tuesdays. Last year, for instance, the event was held on September 12, which was a Tuesday.Theis shaping up to be one of Apple's most exciting releases in years. That's because of the series' emphasis on AI features, which is all everyone seems to care about these days. That said, not all features might be available at launch.On the hardware front, we can expect bigger 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch Pro models, slightly redesigned standard models, a new capture button for photography controls, and faster 3nm chips for the entire lineup.The Action Button that was exclusive to the Pro models last year will be standard across the lineup. The iPhone 16 Pro will get the iPhone 15 Pro Max's Tetraprism 5x optical zoom lens . The Pro models are also likely to flaunt a new 48MP ultrawide camera.Apart from thePlus, all models will allegedly see a bump in battery capacity, and the lineup is also rumored to support faster wired and wireless charging speeds And while iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are technically eligible for Apple Intelligence - which is what Apple has decided to call its AI features - only thewill reportedly get on-device AI capabilities, which could help them stand out and outshine the current top phones of 2024"
Launch day leaked for Apple's iPhone 16 series — and it could be sooner than last.,https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/iphones/iphone-17-slim-leaker-says-it-will-be-the-first-ever-iphone-air,"An iPhone 17 Slim model could be coming next year according to multiple respected leakers, featuring a large display and a 5mm thickness but also a high price and a single rear camera. This mix of features will require some careful branding by Apple, but it probably has the best possible name for such an iPhone within its toolbox already.

This struck me as I watched a new video from Jon Prosser of Front Page Tech, in which Prosser suggests Apple should call this new model the iPhone 17 Air. Feeling confident in his argument, Prosser also makes a trademark dramatic bet in the video that he'll shave his head if Apple decides to sell this phone as the iPhone 17 Slim.

While not providing any new evidence, Prosser is certainly placing a lot of faith in Apple using an existing title for its alleged all-new iPhone design. And if Apple is smart, it'll use the Air suffix for its new skinnier iPhone, and save Prosser from the clippers in the process.

Like the MacBook Air or iPad Air, this rumored iPhone 17 Slim seems to prioritize lightness and approachability over power. The higher price this iPhone could command doesn't quite fit with this pattern, as Air models are usually priced cheaper than Pro ones, but Air remains the most relevant branding Apple currently has for such an iPhone.

Using Slim as the official name would mean a brand new suffix for an Apple product. It's something Apple does manage from time to time, with the Max label first appearing on the iPhone XS Max in 2018, or Ultra with the first-gen Apple Watch Ultra in 2022. But these two labels have much more versatile meanings, suggesting both power and price in a way that Slim does not.

While Slim would be more specific about one particular defining feature of the new iPhone, using this name would require a full process of teaching its buyers what exactly it means in the Apple-verse. And why do that instead of relying on a title that Apple customers have been familiar with for over 15 years?

We've still got over a year to wait, and the iPhone 16 series to meet, before the iPhone 17 debuts. That gives Apple plenty of time to change or even abandon its apparent iPhone 17 Slim plans, rendering this whole discussion a little premature. But hopefully Apple's taken notice of how much excitement its 2025 iPhone is already generating, and is therefore encouraged to continue development.

The exact name of the iPhone 17 Slim won't govern how good a phone it is to use. A rose by any other name would smell as sweet, after all. But it could still impact the way potential buyers see the phone, and the way it may or may not fit into their existing tech loadout. And with mini iPhones and Plus-sized iPhones having proved to be mediocre successes at best, Apple would be wise to give its third attempt at expanding the iPhone line all the chances it can to do well.

So fingers crossed that Apple sticks with a tried-and-true name to dub its all-new iPhone design within a year or so's time. Although if Slim doesn't work out, I'm not sure where Apple would go next. After trying big, small and thin, the logical next step would be an iPhone Thicc, but I don't think that would prove particularly popular."

Apple typically unveils its new iPhone models in September; the exact date often remains uncertain, but the month's end is when the lineup traditionally goes on sale. The latest speculation, however, suggests that the iPhone 16 lineup might be launched on September 10.

This rumour is highlighted by Tom's Guide, which cites a weekend report by CNMO Technology News. Supporting this date is the fact that September 10 falls on a Tuesday, the day Apple usually chooses for its iPhone announcements. However, it’s worth noting that in 2022, Apple deviated from this pattern by holding the iPhone 14 event on a Wednesday. All four models, including the iPhone 16 Ultra, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max, are expected to be available for purchase starting September 20.

Nonetheless, various rumors provide insights into what to expect from the new iPhones, including details about battery capacities and design upgrades.

Ample iPhone 16 rumors have dropped, and those are taking a lot of the focus. However, Apple hasn't forgotten about its beloved Mac hardware, as the latest rumors suggest that several models will get the M4 chip treatment.

In the paid version of Mark Gurman's latest PowerOn newsletter, he talks about the latest round of Apple computers getting the M4 processor. According to the report, Apple wants to upgrade every Mac to the new Apple silicon processor generation. That means the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac Pro, Mac Studio and Mac mini could get the latest M-series chip.

The most important takeaway from the report, outside of the laptops and desktops getting M4, is that there's ""at least one Mac model that will get more dramatic changes."" Unfortunately, Gurman didn't specify which model that would be, so we can only speculate.

Gurman previously suggested that Apple is working on a thinner and lighter MacBook Pro to fit with its latest design philosophy. That could be the ""dramatic changes"" he's referring to. It could also be the Mac Pro, which hasn't received any major design changes since 2019, so it would make sense for the company to change that.

It's been even longer since the Mac mini was given an overhaul, with the device looking almost the same since 2010. It's received minor tweaks, but a major overhaul could give Apple's smallest and most affordable desktop some new life — along with the improved performance offered by the M4 chip.

Unfortunately, we don't have the answers yet, so we'll have to wait until the next batch of Apple events before we discover which Mac computers are getting M4 chips and which are getting a major overhaul. The company announced many exciting devices at its Scary Fast event last fall, and we expect a similar level of quality at its next Mac event.

The iPhone 17 might still be a year off given that we haven’t even had the iPhone 16 yet, but there are still rumors abound that give us a fleeting glimpse of what 2025 might have in store for us. One of the most prolific rumors has been that the iPhone 17 is going to have a ‘slim’ version, and now we have a better idea of what it’s going to be called — the iPhone 17 Air.

Traditionally, the ‘Air naming convention denotes the slimmest and lightest of the Apple product at hand — while that’s shifted slightly after the unreasonably thin iPad Pro M4 (that’s thinner than the new iPad Air M2), it looks to mean the same for the iPhone 17.

So when will the iPhone Flip, or the foldable iPad, actually arrive? According to one new report we could be getting two foldable devices by 2026 — a foldable iPhone and some kind of iPad/Mac hybrid.

That’s according to analyst Jeff Pu (via 9to5Mac), who claims both of these devices are on track to launch some time in 2026. Apparently, the iPad/Mac hybrid could debut first, and is predicted to arrive in the second quarter of the year. That’s April to June and tracks some recent iPad release schedules, including the launch of the 2024 models.

Meanwhile the foldable iPhone will arrive later in the year, but the report doesn’t specify when. If I were to guess, I'd say that device is likely to arrive in September, alongside the iPhone 18 and other late-in-the-year products like the Apple Watch.

Pu doesn’t mention any other details about what these two devices will involve, but we have been hearing rumors about possible Apple foldables over the past several months. We’ve heard reports that Apple has partnered with Samsung display to build the foldable displays, while there’s also been speculation that a 20-plus-inch folding Macbook is in the works .

It was never clear whether that larger foldable would be released alongside or in place of a folding iPhone Flip. However judging from Pu’s latest report it sounds like we will get both within a pretty short space of time.

Unfortunately it’s unclear how much these devices might cost, or how easy they will be to acquire. iPhones and Macs are already quite expensive, and if existing foldable prices are anything to go by, the amount you’ll be expected to pay will only get higher. As slow adoption of the Apple Vision Pro has shown, charging a premium isn’t exactly the best way to get people to buy your products.

While that should be common sense, let’s hope Apple learned a lesson and reigns in the price tag a little bit. Like VR, the best foldable phones haven’t had a lot of love from mainstream consumers, no doubt due to their high price tags. And the more prohibitive the cost the less inclined people are to pick one up.

Instead, they'll be included in iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1 and macOS Sequoia 15.1.""

""After testing the first beta version of Apple Intelligence myself, I can tell you that the new features don't yet live up to the excitement."" Mark Gurman, Bloomberg

This means that they would still lack Apple Intelligence when the iPhone 16 series and Apple's newest software versions debuted in September. Apple's AI features ""will probably begin launching publicly in October,"" roughly a month after its new iPhone series launches.

Although this is disappointing news, it might be for the best. Gurman says, ""After testing the first beta version of Apple Intelligence myself, I can tell you that the new features don't yet live up to the excitement.""

There are still roughly three months between the potential release of Apple Intelligence in iOS 18.1, but will that be enough time for Apple to turn things around? We'll see."

Adata has introduced a new external SSD which supports USB 3.2 Gen2 (USB 10Gbps) and is backward compatible with USB 2.0. The SC750 offers read/write speeds of up to 1,050/1,000 MB/s and features a built-in Type-C connector, allowing for direct connection to mobile phones and tablets without the need for a cable.

The SC750's design focuses on portability and performance, making it a practical companion for those who frequently work on the go. It inherits the same design as Adata's popular SE880 model but in a smaller package: 53.0 x 27.5 x 11.89mm (2.09 x 1.08 x 0.47 inches)."

Apple is gearing up for the launch of its highly anticipated iPhone 16 series, with industry experts offering insights into the potential unveiling, pre-order dates, and sale schedule. The latest speculation suggests that Apple's focus on Apple Intelligence as a key feature may impact the traditional September release timeline.

While Apple has typically favored September for iPhone launches, the delay in the readiness of Apple Intelligence could pose a challenge this year. However, reports indicate that Apple is taking a different approach and will not hold back the new hardware until the services are fully operational."
Launch day leaked for Apple's iPhone 16 series — and it could be sooner than last.,https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/iphones/apple-intelligence-setback-wont-delay-iphone-16-series-launch-heres-what-we-know,"While it looks like Apple Intelligence might be delayed for some time, Apple apparently has no plans to delay the release of what could be some of the best iPhones, the iPhone 16 series.

In his Power-On newsletter, Mark Gurman explains that while Apple typically releases its devices in September, the delay of Apple Intelligence meant there was some concern that the iPhone 16 could also be delayed. However, Mark explains that Apple still intends to keep to a date similar to last year, with September 10 being the likely date, followed by an eventual update to iOS 18.1 in October to bring Apple Intelligence to the masses.

Apple Intelligence has had a rocky period since its announcement during Apple’s WWDC 2024 presentation. Firstly it was revealed that most Apple iPhones would not be able to use the features, with only the iPhone 15 Pro series and iPhone 16 having the necessary RAM. Then it was later revealed that Apple’s AI would be delayed due to quality issues.

It is good to know that Apple likely won’t delay the next generation of iPhones, but it does raise the question of why anyone should buy them on release day.

Gurman’s newsletter also debates the quality of Apple Intelligence, stating that the AI's features currently do not live up to the hype. When Apple Intelligence was announced, Apple promised we'd see features like image generation, Chat GPT integration, and a new and improved Siri.

The iOS 18 beta has seen many of the promised features appear on phones, but it still feels less impressive than both Samsung’s and Google’s efforts.

Apple is not having an easy time with this release, but it is still very early days for Apple Intelligence. So there's plenty of time for the company to improve the features. While it is good news that Apple plans to keep the iPhone 16 launch schedule, the question remains how the lack of Apple Intelligence will affect initial sales.

Launch day leaked for Apple's iPhone 16 series — and it could be sooner than last.,https://www.imore.com/iphone/iphone-16-and-iphone-16-pro-release-date-could-be-sooner-than-expected,"Since the iPhone 5 in 2012, and with very few exceptions, there’s been a new iPhone every September. The launch tends to land in the middle of the month, presented during a typically slick iPhone presentation event. If you’re looking to shop ahead, however, one recent rumor suggests the next batch of iPhones will be released earlier in the month than usual.

As reported by CNMO , the next best iPhone is set to release on September 10, just over one month away from time of writing. Generally, we hear news of the iPhone event around this time in September each year, with the iPhone itself launching a week or two later. If this rumor turns out to be true, we can expect to see the iPhone 16 in shops by Friday, September 19, going off previous iPhone launch dates.

Here is when previous iPhones launched:

iPhone 15 — September 22, 2023 (announced on September 12)

iPhone 14 — September 16, 2022 (announced on September 7)

iPhone 13 — September 24, 2021 (announced on September 14)

iPhone 12 — October 23, 2020 (announced on October 13)

iPhone 11 — September 20, 2019 (announced on September 10)

How reputable is this report?

CNMO doesn’t have a huge track record of accurate reports and leaks so far and the report itself doesn’t cite a source or really explain where the current news comes from. For this reason, we recommend a huge pinch of salt when looking at rumors like this.

However, the date given is a Tuesday, which is the date we tend to expect the iPhone release every year.

The iPhone 16 is currently said to have fairly minor physical upgrades, with the iPhone 16 Pro model getting a new dedicated camera button. However, the new chip range should prepare the device for Apple Intelligence , which should launch later this year.

Launch day leaked for Apple's iPhone 16 series — and it could be sooner than last.,https://mashable.com/article/iphone-15-vs-iphone-15-pro,"The world is full of rivalries, each side convinced that theirs is the best. In this semi-regular series, we pit two competitors against each other to see how they stack up.

This iPhone 15 vs. iPhone 15 Pro comparison will clarify the exact differences between the two popular iPhones. On top of price, design, display, battery life, and more, we'll explore how the cameras differ, too — a popular request among prospective iPhone 15 buyers.

The iPhone 15 costs $799, but the iPhone 15 Pro is more expensive at $999. That being said, I know what you're thinking. Is the iPhone 15 Pro actually worth an extra $200?

Don't expect me to stand on a soapbox and tell you which iPhone to get. Instead, I'm going to tell you all the differences between the two. Then, I'll let you decide which is the best phone for you. Let's dive into this iPhone 15 vs. iPhone 15 Pro face-off, shall we?

Note: While we're focusing on the iPhone 15 vs. iPhone 15 Pro in this comparative analysis, keep in mind that the next-gen iPhone is right around a corner. Check out our iPhone 16 series rumor hub for credible leaks about the iPhone 15 series' successor.

iPhone 15 vs. iPhone 15 Pro: price

The iPhone 15 has a starting price of $800 via Apple's official website — and it comes with the following specs:

128GB of storage

6GB of RAM

A16 Bionic chipset

6.1-inch display

Keep in mind that you can get more storage, but it'll cost you. If you want 256GB of storage, the iPhone 15 will set you back $900. Speaking from experience, I'd recommend getting the 256GB variant, particularly if you love hoarding photos and videos. Otherwise, the 128GB model will haunt you with a ""storage full"" error, forcing you to delete your treasured media content within a year (or less) of use.

If you're a big spender, you can get the iPhone 15 with 512GB of storage, which costs $1,100. But if you have enough money to spend on that, you'd be better off upgrading to the iPhone 15 Pro with 256GB of storage, which is exactly the same price.

Speaking of the iPhone 15 Pro, it has a starting price of $999 via Apple's official website and comes with the following specs:

128GB of storage

8GB of RAM

A17 Pro

6.1-inch display

The most expensive iPhone 15 Pro, packed with 1TB of storage, will set you back $1,500. But again, if you have that kind of money to blow, you might as well upgrade to the iPhone 15 Pro Max with 512GB of storage, which costs $100 less at $1,400.

Again, I'd recommend upgrading to at least 256GB of storage if you have a treasure trove of media you'd like to store. However, if you don't mind deleting a few stuff along the way, or you have cloud storage, the 128GB variant should be fine.

Featured Video For You A brief history of the iPhone

iPhone 15 vs. iPhone 15 Pro: design

Cue Sia singing ""Titanium"" at the top of her lungs! The iPhone 15 Pro's biggest selling point is that it consists of a titanium frame, making it lighter and more durable than its predecessor's stainless-steel chassis.

The iPhone 15, wrapped in an aluminum enclosure, doesn't have a hint of titanium. Womp, womp! It is, however, a little lighter than its Pro sibling (6.03 ounces vs. 6.6 ounces).

As far as colors are concerned, I'd argue that the iPhone 15's colors are more fun and lively.

The iPhone 15 comes in five fun colors. Credit: Apple

It comes in five colors:

Pink

Yellow

Green

Blue

Black

The iPhone 15 Pro is a little bit more low-key — more mature and sophisticated.

The iPhone 15 Pro's colors are a lot more neutral. Credit: Apple

Its colors are more urbane, subtle, and minimalist:

Natural Titanium

Blue Titanium

White Titanium

Black Titanium

One subtle difference between the two phones is the iPhone 15 Pro's Action Button feature located on the left side of the chassis. The iPhone 15, on the other hand, still has a very boring mute switch instead. What's so great about the Action Button? You can customize it to launch any app or task you want.

For example, with my iPhone 15 Pro Max, I've set the Action Button to launch the Notes app since I use it so frequently, but the possibilities are endless. You can set up the Action Button to launch whatever app you want.

iPhone 15 vs. iPhone 15 Pro: display

The iPhone 15 and the iPhone 15 Pro actually share the same display size: 6.1 inches. If you want something bigger (e.g., 6.7 inches), consider getting the iPhone 15 Plus or the iPhone 15 Pro Max.

Dynamic Island is here to stay. Credit: Stan Schroeder / Mashable

They also have the same resolution: 2,256 x 1,179 pixels

Although the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Max share the same screen size, they do not have the same display tech. For example, the iPhone 15 does not have ProMotion technology nor does it have an Always-On display — but the Pro model has both of these perks.

What's ProMotion? It's just a fancy term for, ""This phone has a variable refresh rate of up to 120Hz."" In other words, the iPhone 15 Pro has a zippier display that adapts to your workflow. If you're simply scrolling through an article, the refresh rate will slowdown. However, if you fire up a fast-paced mobile game, the refresh rate will pick up.

Conversely, the iPhone 15 has a refresh rate of 60Hz, which will feel slower only if you've ever owned a phone with a refresh rate of 90Hz or higher. And for the uninitiated, an Aways-On display lets you get information like time, widgets, and more at a glance because — well — the screen is always on. I can't say the same for the iPhone 15.

Both have the snazzy Dynamic Island featured at the top of the display, and plus, the duo can climb to a peak brightness of 2,000, according to Apple.

iPhone 15 vs. iPhone 15 Pro: cameras

Cameras are one of the biggest selling points smartphones, and as you might have guessed, the iPhone 15 Pro has an edge over the iPhone 15. Here's a break down of the camera specs:

iPhone 15

Wide camera - 48MP

Ultrawide camera - 12MP

Selfie camera - 12MP

No telephoto

iPhone 15 Pro

Wide camera - 48MP

Ultrawide camera - 12MP

Selfie camera - 12MP

Telephoto - 3X optical zoom

Unlike the iPhone 15 Pro, the iPhone 15 does not have a telephoto lens, which means that zoomed-in shots will have a dip in quality. It's also worth nothing that the iPhone 15 Pro's ultrawide lens has a slightly wider aperture, which means low-light shots in dim environments should have a better outcome.

If you're a telephoto lens stan, you're going to want to go Pro. Credit: Stan Schroeder / Mashable

The iPhone 15, unlike the iPhone 15 Pro, does not support macro photography, Apple ProRAW, nor Night Mode portraits. (This isn't to be confused with Night Mode, which the iPhone 15 does have. It's just not available for portrait mode.)

iPhone 15 vs. iPhone 15 Pro: performance

The iPhone 15 Pro, without a doubt, is zippier and beastlier than the iPhone 15, thanks to its new A17 Pro Bionic chip. Meanwhile, the iPhone 15 sports the chipset featured inside the iPhone 14 Pro models: the A16 Bionic.

The iPhone 15 Pro is more of a powerhouse. Credit: Stan Schroeder / Mashable

Truth be told, the A16 Bionic is still a stellar, breakneck chip that is actually overpowered for what's needed for mobile tasks, so imagine the herculean power behind the A17 Pro.

Without getting into the weeds of things, just know that the A17 Pro is capable of cutting-edge AI computations and graphics. So much so that high-fidelity games like Resident Evil Village and Death Stranding are available on the iPhone 15 Pro. Assassin's Creed Mirage will also be available on the iPhone 15 Pro, but the release is June 6.

It's also worth noting that the iPhone 15 has 6GB of RAM while the iPhone 15 Pro has 8GB of RAM. This means that latter will do a better job at juggling multiple tasks simultaneously (e.g., switching between a bunch of apps should be faster).

iPhone 15 vs. iPhone 15 Pro: battery life

Apple ran a video playback test on the iPhone 15 and it lasted 20 hours on a single charge.

Compare that to the iPhone 15 Pro, which lasted 23 hours on the same test.

iPhone 15 vs. iPhone 15 Pro: Apple Intelligence

At WWDC 2024, Apple announced that it is jumping into AI head first with a suite of perks called ""Apple Intelligence."" These features will rollout alongside the launch of iOS 18, but keep in mind that not every iPhone will get Apple Intelligence.

The iPhone 15 will not support Apple Intelligence, but the iPhone 15 Pro models (e.g., iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max) will.

Some Apple Intelligence features that iPhone 15 Pro users will enjoy include Genmoji (generate your own emoji), ChatGPT integration, a new-and-improved Siri, new AI-powered summarization features, and more.

iPhone 15 vs. iPhone 15 Pro: Which should you buy?

To sum it all up, the iPhone 15 Pro has an Action Button that I believe is totally underrated — the iPhone 15 doesn't have one. Plus, the iPhone 15 Pro has a better camera system. If taking better zoomed-in shots are important to you, it'd be worth it to shell out an extra $200.

If you enjoy mobile gaming, with the iPhone 15 Pro getting a GPU boost from its A17 Pro chipset, the upper-tier model is a better choice for you.

Finally, if the aforementioned AI-powered features tickle your fancy, you'll have to get the iPhone 15 Pro. The iPhone 15 does not support Apple Intelligence.

However, if neither of those bells and whistles tickle your fancy, you'll be fine with the entry-level iPhone 15."
Launch day leaked for Apple's iPhone 16 series — and it could be sooner than last.,https://www.yahoo.com/tech/apple-watch-series-10-rumors-130034439.html,"For the past several years, Apple has dominated the smartwatch and wearable market with the Apple Watch. Whenever you’re out and see someone wearing a smartwatch, it’s most likely an Apple Watch.

As we are fast approaching the 10-year mark for the Apple Watch, which debuted in 2015, we could be in for some changes with the Apple Watch Series 10. The rumor mill has been constantly churning, so here’s what we know so far about the Apple Watch Series 10 (or possibly Apple Watch X).

Apple Watch Series 10: possible release date

(Left to right) Apple Watch SE 2, Apple Watch Series 8, and Apple Watch Ultra Andy Boxall / Digital Trends

Historically, Apple has released new Apple Watches alongside the next generation of iPhones. With that in mind, we should expect the Apple Watch Series 10 to be announced at the same time as the iPhone 16 this fall.

Though we know that Apple traditionally holds its iPhone event around this time, typically in September, we don’t have solid confirmation of Apple’s fall event just yet. We know it’s coming very soon, but nothing is certain until Apple announces it.

Apple could shake things up this time around since this would be a significant milestone for the Apple Watch. The first Apple Watch was originally announced in 2014 but released in 2015. If the Apple Watch Series 10 is going to be a special version of the Apple Watch, like the iPhone X marking the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, then it really could be up in the air whether it is announced in the fall or if there will be a new version next year instead.

Apple Watch Series 10: possible price

Andy Boxall / Digital Trends

Apple has kept the Apple Watch Series line around the same price for the past several years. That means we should expect a similar price for the Apple Watch Series 10 once it’s announced.

The Apple Watch Series 9 currently starts at $399 for the GPS-only model and $499 for the GPS+Cellular version. Apple is likely to keep this price range for the Apple Watch Series 10, with the Apple Watch Ultra line retaining a higher price of $799.

We don’t really have any big leaks or rumors about what the Apple Watch Series 10 will cost, but we shouldn’t expect anything too far off from the norm. Of course, if there are any significant changes to the design or other upgrades, Apple could possibly bump the price up if it wanted to. For now, we just have to wait and see what happens.

Apple Watch Series 10: design and display

The Apple Watch Series 9 (left) and Apple Watch Series 8 Andy Boxall / Digital Trends

There have been whispers about a possible change to the design of the Apple Watch Series 10. From what we’ve heard so far, this could likely be the biggest upgrade for the wearable since the Apple Watch Series 7.

According to some reports from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the Apple Watch Series 10 will be thinner than its predecessors. As a result of a thinner body, it could also have a slight increase in display size, with rumors of a 2-inch display, which would be larger than the current 1.7-inch of the Series 9.

Additionally, the Apple Watch Series 10 could come in new sizes to accompany a thinner body. Currently, the Apple Watch Series 9 comes in 41mm and 45mm models. With the Apple Watch Series 10, we could see the 45mm being the “small” version, along with a new 49mm size. For reference, the current Apple Watch Ultra series is 49mm.

Andy Boxall / Digital Trends

There have also been reports that Apple may use microLED displays rather than the OLED panels it has been using for the Apple Watch Series 10. However, we aren’t too sure about this rumor, as there is another contradicting report that Apple has canceled this plan.

Of course, since this is all speculation, we can’t be certain which one is correct. If there’s no microLED, then Apple will stick with OLED and possibly have a more power-efficient version.

Another big change that may be in store for the Apple Watch Series 10 is a new band system. According to Mark Gurman at Bloomberg, he believes that Apple is switching over to a new magnetic attachment system, which would free up space that is currently taken up for the cutouts on the current Apple Watch models. Doing this would add more space for internal components, allowing the overall design to be thinner. However, this would also make all previous Apple Watch bands from the past decade incompatible with the new watch.

Apple Watch Series 10: specs and health tracking

The Apple Watch Series 8 (left) and Apple Watch Series 9 Andy Boxall / Digital Trends

With the Apple Watch Series 9, Apple introduced a new S9 chip that is faster and more powerful than the previous S8 and earlier versions. This new chip allows users to get faster on-device Siri with access to health data and the new Double Tap gesture.

It’s pretty much expected that the next generation of Apple hardware will have a more powerful chip, and that applies to the Apple Watch Series 10.

Unfortunately, it seems unlikely that the Apple Watch Series 10 will have any new health-tracking features. While it was reported that Apple was trying to bring sleep apnea and hypertension detection to the Apple Watch, it hasn’t gone very smoothly.

Gurman reported that “Apple ran into some serious snags” in that department, such as unreliable hypertension detection. And for the sleep apnea detection, well, that feature seems to be fine, but it relies on blood oxygen saturation levels, which can’t be measured at the moment in the U.S. due to Apple’s ongoing legal issues with Masimo. If that can be resolved by September, then we may see sleep apnea come to the Apple Watch Series 10, but that’s a big if.

With these kinds of issues, it appears that these highly anticipated features will be delayed for at least another year until everything is resolved.

Apple Watch Series 10: battery life

Andy Boxall / Digital Trends

There haven’t been many reports of the Apple Watch Series 10’s battery life so far. Even so, we can make some educated guesses here.

Apple hasn’t made any big improvements in the battery life for the mainline Apple Watch Series lately. When it did improve the battery, it was with the Apple Watch Ultra, which can get up to 36 hours of use on a single charge or up to 72 hours in Low Power mode.

But the main Apple Watch Series 9 and even the Apple Watch SE have continued to have around 18 hours of battery life. If you put the Apple Watch Series 9 in Low Power mode, then it extends the battery life to 36 hours. The Series 9 does have fast charging, which helps when you want to top it off.

If the Apple Watch Series 10 does get a size increase, that may result in a slightly larger battery inside, though the thinner aspect ratio may also affect that. Hopefully, the new chip will also be more power efficient, helping extend the battery life to a little beyond the 18 hours that Apple usually claims.

Again, with no solid reports about the battery, we can only speculate based on what else we know right now. We will update this accordingly when we learn more.

Apple Watch Series 10: software and updates

Andy Boxall / Digital Trends

If the Apple Watch Series 10 launches this fall alongside the iPhone 16 line, then it should come with watchOS 11 out of the box.

Apple is also pretty good about longevity when it comes to its hardware, though it hasn’t given exact numbers like Samsung and Google. With watchOS 10 in 2023, Apple still supported up to the Apple Watch Series 4 (2018), but watchOS 11 dropped the Apple Watch Series 5 and earlier.

On average, an Apple Watch seems to last around five years, so we should expect something similar for the Apple Watch Series 10."
Launch day leaked for Apple's iPhone 16 series — and it could be sooner than last.,https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/made-by-google-hardware-event-pixel-9-pixel-9-pro-fold-pixel-watch-3-and-all-the-latest-rumors,"Google took us by surprise earlier this summer, when it announced its annual hardware event — normally a fixture in October — would instead take place several months earlier. This year, Google plans to roll out its hardware on August 13, and we already have a very good idea of what to expect.

Google has already put out teaser videos for the Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro Fold — the latter is a successor to the Pixel Fold foldable phone — with both touting an August 13 date. It's a safe bet they'll be a part of the Made by Google hardware event on that date alongside the rest of the Pixel 9 lineup.

While we're certain to see new phone hardware, other devices could join the Pixels, such as the Pixel Watch 3. And though the focus may be on hardware, we expect to hear plenty about the AI features on board the latest Google devices, plus any news about the imminent release of Android 15.

With the date now set for the next Made by Google unveiling, here's what we know so far about the event.

Made by Google 2024 cheat sheet: Biggest expected announcements

The event takes place on Tuesday, August 13 at 10 a.m. PT / 1 p.m. ET / 6 p.m. BST

We expect four Pixel 9 models, with two different-sized Pixel 9 Pro phones joining the standard Pixel, plus a Pixel 9 Pro Fold.

The Pixel 9 series may come with a new 45W charging brick for even faster charging

The phones are likely to run on Android 15, so we'd expect a launch date for the updated phone software.

Other possible hardware updates include the latest Pixel Watch 3 and Pixel Buds Pro releases.

Made by Google 2024: When and where to watch

Google has already set a date of August 13 for the Made by Google event, with the product launch happening at the company's Mountain View, Calif., headquarters.

The event gets underway at 10 a.m. PT / 1 p.m. ET/ 6 p.m. BST, with the invitation promising to ""showcase the best of Google AI, Android software and the Pixel portfolio of devices.""

Google will almost certainly stream the event, most likely on its YouTube channel. There's no placeholder video yet, but one will certainly emerge as we get closer to the August 13 date.

Made by Google 2024: What to expect

Pixel 9

(Image credit: Google)

There have been so many Pixel 9 leaks — with more than a few from Google itself — that it may feel like Google's flagship phone is already out. An official launch will have to wait until August 13, but we've already got a lot of the details about the latest handsets.

There should be four models, with a standard Pixel 9 joined by two version of the Pixel 9 Pro. One of those Pro models is expected to offer a 6.1-inch screen while the other, the Pixel 9 Pro XL — should have a 6.7-inch panel. The fourth phone will be the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold — that's its official name — as the Pixel lineup absorbs the foldable phone Google introduced last year.

From the images posted by Google, the Pixel 9 family looks like it's getting a slight tweak to its design, with the camera bar no longer extending across the length of the phone. Instead, it's expected to have rounded corners. We've also seen leaked images of a 45W charger that's just as curvy, with a half-oval shape and a USB-C charging port at the bottom.

As before, the Pixel 9 should have a main camera and an ultrawide lens, with the Pro models adding a telephoto lens. Leaked camera details suggest that all phones will get an upgraded ultrawide sensor, while the front camera on the Pixel 9 will add the autofocus features already available on the Pro models.

It's a pretty safe bet that the latest Pixel phones will feature a new chipset, the Tensor G4. That means new AI-powered features, with a leak revealing some AI possibilities for the Pixel 9. Rumored additions include tweaks to the Magic Editor tool, such as a Reimagine With command that allows you to add effects and edits and an Add Me tool for inserting the photographer into group shots. Additionally, a code line found in an APK breakdown indicates that Pixel 9 Pro buyers could receive free access to Gemini Advanced for a year.

As for the Pixel 9 Fold, both its cover display and main screen should be larger than what we saw on the Pixel Fold, according to leaked Fold specs. The displays could be brighter, too, and Google is expected to pack in more RAM to help the Tensor G4 silicon powering the device. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 should watch out too, because Google's next-gen foldable might be even skinnier — but also heavier.

Android 15

(Image credit: Googlw)

It is common practice for Android to launch its latest OS on Google phones first, so look for the Google Pixel 9 to launch with Android 15. One sketchy rumor claims otherwise, though we're not so sure about that. Especially since the Google event would be the perfect time to fully announce the release of the software.

Currently, the Android 15 beta is available on the Google Pixel 6 and beyond. As such, the Google Pixel 6a, Pixel 7 series and Google Pixel 8 series will be in line for an Android 15 upgrade as well. All those phones can install the Android 15 beta right now.

So far we know of several features coming for Android 15 thanks to the betas. Android 15 is seeing some major changes to your phone's display with new features to get the most out of brightness and app customization. The update also includes several new accessibility options including keyboard vibration, adaptive vibration and improved security. You can see a full breakdown of all the confirmed changes.

Google Pixel Watch 3

(Image credit: Android Authority)

In addition to all those Pixel 9 models,. we expect two Google Pixel Watch 3 models to be announced at the Made by Google event. Multiple reports call for the watch to come in 41mm and 45mm sizes. The standard Pixel Watch 3 would feature a 1.2-inch screen, while a Pixel Watch 3 XL would offer a 1.4-inch display.

In addition to improved battery performance, Wear OS 5 boasts additional fitness stats for runners, like, ground contact time, stride length, vertical oscillation and vertical ratio. Google is clearly aiming to improve the running experience to combat the Apple Watch's improved ring system.

Recently leaked renders have shown that the Pixel Watch 3 will look remarkably similar to its predecessor. Early reports of Google removing buttons from the next-gen Pixel Watch may not pan out.

A leak has spotted a Pixel Buds Pro 2 charging case listed on certification sites for Denmark and South Korea. Usually, when products appear on such lists, they're getting closer to hitting the market.

The biggest detail found in the listings involves the battery. Specifically, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 may feature a 650mAh cell instead of the 620mAh battery found on the original earbuds.

A surprise leak on Reddit (spotted by 9to5Google) revealed a case from accessory manufacturer Spigen on Amazon. As of this writing, the listed images are no longer visible on Amazon. There appear to be several changes to the design, as well as four color options available."
Launch day leaked for Apple's iPhone 16 series — and it could be sooner than last.,https://www.inkl.com/news/new-leak-may-have-revealed-iphone-16-pro-and-pro-max-battery-capacities,"We should see the iPhone 16 break cover in around a month or so, and the leaks are starting to pile up for Apple's 2024 flagship phone – including new information on the battery capacities of the Pro and Pro Max models.

According to well-known tipster Instant Digital (via MacRumors), the iPhone 16 Pro is going to come with a 3,577mAh capacity battery fitted, while the battery inside the larger iPhone 16 Pro Max will have a capacity of 4,676mAh.

To put those numbers into context for you, the iPhone 15 Pro has a battery capacity of 3,274mAh, while the iPhone 15 Pro Max has a capacity of 4,422mAh. Both models would seem to be getting bigger batteries this year, but the jump is bigger on the Pro model.

We have heard that same 4,676mAh capacity for the iPhone 16 Pro Max in a previous leak, though an earlier rumor had put the capacity of iPhone 16 Pro at 3,355mAh – so this latest source suggests that the increase in size is going to be bigger.

Better battery life?

Of course, it's quite possible that battery capacities have changed as Apple has been developing the phones and refining their designs, which might explain why some of the rumors we've been seeing so far are listing different numbers.

It's also difficult to say how these increased battery capacities are going to affect battery life. Both the iPhone 16 Pro and the iPhone 16 Pro Max are said to be getting larger screens this year, up to 6.3 inches and 6.9 inches respectively, which might affect the calculations.

As our iPhone 15 Pro review and iPhone 15 Pro Max review will tell you, the current models are able to go for about a day (or a little over) with general use. It looks as though the new editions will still need charging overnight most of the time.

Apple hasn't announced a launch event for September yet, but that's the month when it usually unveils its new iPhones. At the same event we should also be getting reveals for the Apple Watch 10 and the Apple Watch Ultra 3."
Launch day leaked for Apple's iPhone 16 series — and it could be sooner than last.,https://www.gadgets360.com/mobiles/news/iphone-16-pro-max-bigger-battery-size-apple-6268444,"Apple is expected to launch its iPhone 16 series later this year comprising four models. While the standard iPhone 16 variants are speculated to get a revamped design, the high-end Pro models are also expected to pack several upgrades in key areas such as performance and charging speeds. A recently surfaced claim on social media from China suggests that Apple may bump up the battery capacities of the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max.

iPhone 16 Pro Models Battery Capacity

According to a post on the Chinese social media platform Weibo by user Instant Digital (translated from Chinese), both iPhone 16 Pro models are expected to get upgrades when it comes to battery life. While the iPhone 16 Pro is tipped to feature a 3,577mAh battery, the top-end iPhone 16 Pro Max may be backed by a 4,676mAh ​​​battery.

Although Apple does not officially reveal the battery capacities of its iPhone models, it is widely known that the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max have 3,274mAh and 4,441mAh-rated batteries, respectively.

If the claim turns out to be true, it would translate into a 9 percent bigger battery for the Pro model while the bigger iPhone 16 Pro Max's battery would have 5 percent more capacity. However, it is unknown if these numbers would lead to better battery life during real-world usage.

iPhone 16 Faster Charging Speeds

iPhone 16 Pro models are also speculated to pack faster charging speeds, according to a report. At present, Apple has capped the charging speed across its entire iPhone 15 lineup at 20W. Using a compatible Apple-certified 20W or higher power adapter, all variants in the iPhone 15 lineup are claimed to charge up to 50 percent within 30 minutes.

However, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max may support up to 40W of wired fast charging. Additionally, MagSafe charging is also reported to be upgraded from 15W to 20W.

However, according to a recent report by Mark Gurman, a highly credible source on Apple leaks, these concerns won't affect the schedule. Gurman confirmed that despite the delays in Apple Intelligence, the iPhone 16 series is still set to launch in September. This aligns with Apple's usual timeline, reassuring fans and industry watchers that the next generation of iPhones will be released on time. Gurman's confirmation brings clarity amid earlier speculations of a postponed launch.

Previously, Apple announced that Apple Intelligence, initially planned for the iOS 18 release in September, has been pushed to iOS 18.1. This delay means that the new software feature will not be available at the time of the iPhone 16's launch. Apple Intelligence is expected to be a significant selling point for the iPhone 16, especially since only the top-tier iPhone 15 Pro models currently support similar features.

Gurman reports that the iPhone 16 launch will likely occur around the same time as last year, with September 10 being a probable date. Users will need to update their new devices to iOS 18.1 in October to access the full suite of Apple Intelligence features.

Apple has postponed iPhone releases when key software features weren't ready. For instance, the iPhone 4S was delayed until October because Siri and iCloud were not ready for the June release. Despite this precedent, Apple has decided not to delay the iPhone 16 launch this year.

The Apple Intelligence beta, launched last week, includes initial features like Writing Tools and Memory Generation in Photos. However, many significant updates, such as the new Siri interface and ChatGPT integration, are still missing. Major features like Genmoji and Image Playground are also not yet available in the current beta.

Notably. Apple has released public betas for iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and watchOS 11. These updates allow developers to preview the latest Apple software before the official launch. To access the public beta versions, simply add your Apple ID to the Apple Software Program. This lets you join the pre-release excitement and explore the new features ahead of everyone else. However, even if you download the beta version, you will not get all the features that will come out with the official version. But the beta versions include some useful features.

Apple is gearing up to unveil its latest iPhone 16 series, which includes the standard iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus , iPhone 16 Pro , and iPhone 16 Pro Max , with a launch expected in September 2024. Here we are going to focus on the non-Pro models – the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus. Let’s see what we know so far about these devices.

iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Design

The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus will retain their current sizes, with no changes to their dimensions compared to their predecessors. The major design tweak is a vertical camera layout, moving away from the previous diagonal setup, and the inclusion of an Action Button and a Capture Button. This new arrangement is designed to improve photo and video quality, including the capability to capture Spatial Video for use with Apple’s Vision Pro headset. The camera bump will be pill-shaped and more streamlined compared to earlier models.

iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Colours

The iPhone 16 will come in five colours: black, green, pink, blue, and white. These are expected to be similar to the colour options of the iPhone 15, featuring a frosted glass back that contrasts with the main frame. Leaks suggest that the colours will include a light pink, a vibrant blue, and a dark green.

iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Camera

Both models will feature an updated camera system. The iPhone 16 will have a new vertical camera layout, which is said to enhance photo and video quality. The iPhone 16 Plus will follow suit, with both models benefiting from improved optics and new features like a ""Capture Button"" for easier photo and video shooting.

Performance and Features

The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus will be powered by Apple’s next-generation A18 chip. This chip promises improved performance and efficiency. Both models are expected to include 8GB of RAM, up from the 6GB found in the iPhone 15. In terms of battery, the iPhone 16 could get a 3,561mAh battery, up from iPhone 15’s 3,349mAh unit. iPhone 16 Plus, on the other hand, could pack a slightly smaller 4,006mAh battery than its predecessor’s 4,383mAh unit.

iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Price , Launch Date

While exact pricing hasn’t been confirmed, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are expected to start at a price point similar to their predecessors. To recall, the iPhone 15 launched at Rs 79,900 while the iPhone 15 Plus started at Rs 89,900 for the base variants.

Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 16 series on September 10, with shipments starting from September 20.

Stay tuned for more updates as we approach the official launch event in September!"
Launch day leaked for Apple's iPhone 16 series — and it could be sooner than last.,https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/science-technology/1931477/iphone-16-design-uncovered-may,"If the last few years are anything to go by, Apple is due to announce the iPhone 16 series in the first couple of weeks of September - the tech giant has launched its flagship iPhones each September for more than a decade, save for the iPhone 12 event that was in October 2020, presumably delayed due to the pandemic.

Although Apple is better than rivals such as Google at keeping its new smartphones under wraps, as we near the rumoured announcement we are beginning to see a few leaks that point to what to expect from the new devices.

The iPhone 15 last year introduced a matt glass finish, more rounded edges and the Dynamic Island to the base model iPhone, while the the iPhone 15 Pro uses titanium for the first time for a lighter build and also become more rounded and comfortable to hold, moving on from the sharper flat edges seen since the iPhone 12.

Now, tech reviewer and historically reliable Apple leaker Sonny Dickson has posted two images on X that claim to show off the designs of the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro. If accurate, there are big changes coming for the regular iPhone this year.

As you can see in the below image, there are five alleged iPhone 16 models in different colours. While they don’t sport Apple logos, these sorts of leaks are usually of either prototype devices or dummy models that represent the eventual dimensions and design of the iPhone."

While the company has yet to make an official announcement, rumours and leaks suggest that the event will prominently feature the iPhone 16 series. This new series is expected to debut with iOS 18, bringing with it a host of new features. However, the much-anticipated Apple Intelligence may not be included in the initial release of iOS 18. Reports indicate that Apple might delay the launch of Apple Intelligence to iOS 18.1, which is expected to arrive in October. Additionally, some Apple Intelligence features may not roll out until 2025, including a Siri overhaul and OpenAI integration. Let's dive into what we know so far about the iPhone 16 series.



iPhone 16: Design and Colours

Recent leaks have shed light on the design and colour options for the iPhone 16. The design is expected to feature notable tweaks, with the standard iPhone 16 sporting two vertically aligned cameras, reminiscent of the iPhone X and iPhone 11. However, these cameras will be housed in a capsule-shaped camera island, offering a fresh look. Reliable tipsters have leaked images hinting at significant design changes, although we'll have to wait for the official launch to confirm these details.

Dummy units of the iPhone 16 have surfaced on social media platform X, showcasing five colour options: White, Black, Blue, Green, and Pink. The Green colour appears to be a richer shade than previous models, while the Blue option resembles the iPhone 5c. These units likely represent the standard iPhone 16 model, with the same colour palette expected for the larger ""Plus"" variant.



iPhone 16 Series: Leaked Chipset

The iPhone 16 series is rumoured to be powered by Apple's latest A18 Pro chip, fabricated using TSMC's enhanced 3nm process technology (N3E). This advanced chip will enable the integration of new Apple Intelligence features in iOS 18, allowing for more sophisticated on-device machine learning and artificial intelligence functions, thereby enhancing the overall user experience.

The upcoming iPhone 16 series is also expected to see a boost in storage and memory capabilities. Specifically, the Pro and Pro Max models may offer up to 2TB of storage, double the maximum capacity of their predecessors. The standard iPhone 16 and 16 Plus models are anticipated to feature 8GB of RAM, a notable upgrade from the 6GB found in the iPhone 15 series, ensuring smoother performance and improved multitasking.



iPhone 16 Series: Battery Life (Expected)

The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro Max are rumoured to feature larger batteries, with a 6% and 5% increase in capacity, respectively. However, the iPhone 16 Plus may see a 9% reduction in battery capacity. To address the increased power demands, Apple is likely to use stacked battery technology to enhance energy density and lifespan. Charging capabilities are also expected to improve, with the iPhone 16 series potentially supporting 40W wired fast charging and 20W MagSafe charging.

iPhone 16: Expected Camera Upgrades

Apple is anticipated to upgrade the camera system on the standard iPhone 16 models, adopting a vertical camera layout with a pill-shaped protrusion, a change from the diagonal design of the iPhone 15. This new configuration will feature distinct rings for the Wide and Ultra Wide lenses, enabling Spatial Video recording capabilities that were previously limited to the high-end Pro models. This move aims to bridge the gap between the standard and Pro iPhone cameras.

The iPhone 16 Pro models are expected to receive significant camera enhancements. The Ultra Wide lens may be upgraded to 48 megapixels, resulting in improved low-light performance and the ability to capture high-resolution images. Additionally, the iPhone 16 Pro Max is likely to feature a state-of-the-art periscope telephoto camera, dramatically increasing optical zoom capabilities to 5x and setting a new standard for zoom range and image quality in smartphones.



iPhone 16: Apple Intelligence

As mentioned earlier, the initial version of iOS 18 may not feature Apple Intelligence. However, iOS 18 will still bring several new and improved features. The upcoming OS introduces a host of customization options, including a fresh approach to arranging apps and widgets on the Home Screen, Lock Screen, and Control Center. Users will now be able to freely place icons and widgets in any open space, even above the dock, and apply visual effects like dark or tinted themes to personalize the appearance.

The Photos app has been significantly redesigned to unify photo libraries into a single view, featuring new collections and a carousel view that highlights daily favourites. The revamped Control Center offers quicker access to frequently used controls and allows third-party app integration.



Satellite messaging in the Messages app ensures connectivity without cellular or Wi-Fi, and iMessage enhancements include new text effects, formatting options, and message scheduling. A standout feature is Apple Intelligence, which integrates generative models with personal context to improve tasks like language understanding and image creation, providing a highly relevant and useful user experience.



With the iPhone 16 series set to launch next month, anticipation is high for Apple's latest innovations. The new designs, colour options, advanced chipset, enhanced battery life, and significant camera upgrades promise to make the iPhone 16 a standout release. While Apple Intelligence may not debut with the initial release of iOS 18, the upcoming features and improvements still offer plenty to look forward to. As always, the official launch will reveal the full extent of Apple's latest technological advancements, confirming the rumours and setting the stage for another exciting year in the world of smartphones."

The rumours and leaks around the upcoming Apple foldables are overflowing. According to a recent report, published in GSMArena, claimed that the company is working on a flip-style foldable iPhone. But this is not it. It also stated that Apple is also looking forward to an iPad/MacBook hybrid with an 18.8-inch internal display.

An Apple analyst, Jeff Pu indicated that the hybrid model will be the first to come out, before the foldable iPhone. The launch will likely to take place in the second quarter of 2026. The foldable iPhone is due at the end of 2026. If Apple continues to follow the trend of hardware launches, the iPad/MacBook hybrid model might feature alongside the iPhone 18 series. But the speculations are such that its market availability will be delayed until the end of 2026.

While the report did not give out much information, the analyst was quite confident about the timing of the release. He says Apple is still on schedule, especially after recently securing a supply contract for the foldable iPhone panels. But 2026 is still a long time from today. Hence, everything is open to change.

Apple iPhone foldables

We have earlier reported that Apple has also reportedly engaged with suppliers in Asia to produce components for the device, and it has even assigned an internal code name, V68, to the project. The report suggests Apple's foldable iPhone is expected to integrate advanced artificial intelligence features, enhancing user experience and functionality.

However, it is important to note that while the reports around the iPhone Flip generate excitement, there is no guarantee that Apple will ultimately release the foldable iPhone. The company has not made any official announcements, and nothing can be confirmed until Apple gives the green light.

iPhone 16 and iOS 18

While Apple foldables are quite far from release (only if the reports are true), the primary focus for now is the iPhone 16 series. Apple is gearing up to release the iPhone 16 series this September. During WWDC 2024, the company showed off its Apple Intelligence features. The event gave a hint that these upgrades will come tuned in with the upcoming iPhone series. But, recent reports say otherwise. It was found that Apple might have delayed the launch of Apple Intelligence.

Apple might release a handful of Apple Intelligence features after the launch of iOS 18. It is speculated that Apple Intelligence will feature in October with iOS 18.1. And other features might stretch to 2025. For instance, the much awaited Siri overhaul and OpenAI integration will feature much later in the timeline."
Launch day leaked for Apple's iPhone 16 series — and it could be sooner than last.,https://emeatribune.com/we-just-had-to-wait-several-flights-diverted-to-boston-due-to-weather-leaving-passengers-stranded/,"It was no way to end a European trip. Several United Airlines flights diverted to Boston Saturday evening — because of bad weather over United’s international hubs at Newark and Washington Dulles.

Iza Perales was one of those caught up in the mid-summer meltdown. She was supposed to land in Newark from Lisbon, Portugal.

“My final destination is Houston,” said Iza Perales. “We circled New York for at least two and a half hours. The pilot comes on and says, we’re running out of fuel and that all flights out of New York LaGuardia and JFK had been canceled.

So the plane diverted to Boston. And that’s when the travel nightmare began.

“We’re on the tarmac for five hours before we’re deplaned,” she said. “No luggage, no information until midnight when they said we don’t have customs agents and we don’t have baggage people from United to take your luggage off of the airplane.”

Perales wound up booking a hotel room but was back in Logan early Sunday morning to try to get on a flight to Newark.

She was hardly alone. A long line of diverted passengers moved through a line that crawled to an uncertain — and sometimes disappointing finish line.

“They said we had a flight to Newark at 11 a.m.,” said Pedro Alfaro, who came in on a United flight from Stockholm with a final destination of El Salvador. “But apparently when we go and talk with the agent, we don’t have a flight at all.”

United Airlines tells Boston 25 News that passengers affected by the weather diversions received meal and hotel vouchers. But several passengers said they received no such vouchers. Another said he received no vouchers, but that may have been because he refused to stand in an hours-long line to get them.

Alfaro did get a meal and hotel vouchers from United, he said. That may be because another reason for his flight diverting to Boston was, he said, that one of the pilots got sick. United Airlines has not confirmed that.

Four passengers told Boston 25 News that they endured four to five hours on the tarmac before disembarking at Logan.

“For five hours, no information, no one came to explain anything to us,” said Yacine Manet, who was trying to get to Montreal. “We just had to wait there. Barely had some food. Barely had some drinks. It was really crazy.”

Those tarmac wait times would appear to violate federal rules that limit the detaining of passengers to three hours, though there can be exceptions.

By mid-day Sunday, United Airlines had not responded to our questions on the legality of that reported tarmac time.

This is a developing story. Check back for updates as more information becomes available.

Launch day leaked for Apple's iPhone 16 series — and it could be sooner than last.,https://phandroid.com/2024/08/05/potential-iphone-16-launch-date-leaked/,"It is a given that Apple will release the iPhone 16 this year, but when? Thanks to a report from CNMO, the potential launch date of the iPhone 16 has been revealed to be on the 10th of September, 2024.

This is actually a couple of days earlier compared to the iPhone 15 series which launched on the 12th of September. The 10th of September is a Tuesday, similar to the iPhone 15 which launched on a Tuesday. Apple typically schedules its releases for Tuesdays. However, the iPhone 14 did break tradition with a Wednesday launch.

The iPhone 16 series is expected to see pretty substantial upgrades. The new iPhone 16s will be powered by the A18 chipset. This is a 3nm chipset, similar to the A17, but it is expected to be built on TSMC’s newer 3nm process. The iPhone 16 Pro Max is also rumored to get a screen upgrade. It will go from 6.7-inches to 6.9-inches. There are rumors that the thinner bezels should keep the dimensions roughly similar to its predecessor.

Unfortunately, it is expected that Apple Intelligence will not launch with the new models. Apple is rumored to release it later on in the iOS 18.1 update. In any case, take this report with a grain of salt. But with September creeping up, we should have the official iPhone 16 launch date soon enough!"

While an official announcement is still pending, reports suggest an earlier launch date than last year’s iPhone 15 series, potentially falling on September 10th. This would align with Apple’s traditional Tuesday launch schedule, although the company has deviated from this pattern in the past.

Beyond the launch date, numerous leaks and speculations point to several potential features and upgrades that could set the iPhone 16 series apart. A significant change could be a redesigned rear camera panel on the regular iPhone 16 models, possibly drawing inspiration from the iPhone 12’s aesthetics. In addition, Apple may introduce fresh color options, adding a touch of personalization to the lineup.

For those seeking larger screens and a more immersive visual experience, the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max models are rumored to boast larger displays with slimmer bezels. Functionality could also get a boost with the inclusion of a multi-purpose Action button across all models, potentially offering quick access to various functions or customizable shortcuts.

Photography enthusiasts might be particularly interested in the rumored Capture button, which could enable DSLR-like focus and gesture control for enhanced image capture. Moreover, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus may incorporate spatial video support, providing users with an immersive 3D video experience. The Pro models could receive an upgraded ultrawide camera and anti-reflective technology, addressing issues like lens flare and improving image quality.

While these features and upgrades sound promising, it’s important to remember that they are based on unofficial sources and speculation. Apple has not confirmed any of these details, and the final product could differ from these expectations. Therefore, it’s best to approach this information with a healthy dose of skepticism and await official announcements for concrete details.

The iPhone 16 series holds the promise of exciting advancements in design, functionality, and user experience. However, the true extent of these improvements remains to be seen. As the rumored launch date approaches, the anticipation continues to grow, and tech enthusiasts eagerly await Apple’s unveiling of its latest flagship smartphones."

Game-changing H3 Chip – Leading in audio processing and in-class low-latency performance. Innovative Features– Improved ANC and conversational awareness Speculated Launch– Launch with iPhone 16 in September

Allure is impossible to deny when it comes to Apple AirPods. For many, these wireless earbuds evoke convenience, style, and playback quality that’s hard to come by. Each generation has managed to further improve on the experience of ‘true wireless’ earbuds.

Now, with rumors swirling around the upcoming Apple AirPods 4, exciting new features and possible design refinements have many tech lovers on edge. In this detailed article, we are going to analyze all the latest leaks, possible features, and, of course, the highly anticipated release schedule.

AirPods 4: A Closer Look at the Next Generation

The AirPods from Apple have continued to advance, giving users enhanced sound, seamless connectivity, and a somewhat premium feel. The current AirPods 3 did impress a great deal but still left so much to be desired.

Many were yearning for increased noise cancellation, long-life batteries, or probably just a slight design revamp. It seems like Apple has been listening; the AirPods 4 are going to be here to take care of these and so much more.

Anticipated Features of AirPods 4

Next-Generation Processor

The bulk of the performance boost to be expected in the AirPods 4 will be achieved with the help of a supposed H3 chip. Faster pairing, better audio processing, and probably better low-latency performance when gaming or watching videos are all made possible through this powerful processor. The H3 chip is such a gigantic upgrade that it will ensure the AirPods 4 have no problems at all with their more complex audio tasks.

Audio Excellence

Knowing Apple’s capability in audio engineering, one can almost expect the same delivery in the AirPods 4. The expectation on the grounds of rumors points toward richer bass, clearer midranges, and overall improved sound quality. This would give the aural experience an injection by enhancing the experience of hearing music, podcasts, or even calls.

Long-Lasting Battery Life

One of the most popular complaints about wireless earbuds is their battery life. AirPods 4 are going to improve this much, extending the time of listening between charges. Now you can play your favorite music or podcasts or make long calls without having to run to the charging case. This additional battery life will be especially a boon to those who use their AirPods throughout the day.

Refined Design

The design of the iconic AirPods has surely been one that has inspired a horde of imitations, but improvements are still in order. The AirPods 4 could feature idiosyncratic design alterations in the form of a slightly reworked stem or a fit that is more solid and secure. To add on to what is being postulated has to do with this cutout area, redesigned to further separate AirPods 4 from AirPods 3. Such a design alteration could make AirPods 4 rather more comfortable to wear for longer periods while improving the looks.

Conversational Awareness

It is said that one genuinely innovative feature of the AirPods 4 is conversational awareness. The kind of technology that could very easily be designed to detect when you’re speaking, be intelligently interactive, and allow seamless interactions without removing your earbuds. This feature would represent an improvement of a high order in ease of conversation while still enjoying your audio content.

The AirPods 4 Lite: A Budget-Friendly Variant?

While this may all seem a bit surprising, Apple is reportedly working on a lower model version of AirPods with the name AirPods 4 Lite. The information isn’t entirely clear, but we might probably get to see less rich features than those found in regular AirPods 4.

It might have a lower-power processor and maybe a little lesser battery life with a new charging case. Anyway, the AirPods 4 Lite will ensure a robust audio experience and seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem. This will be to bring more people to the AirPods and acquire more budget-oriented customers.

When Will the AirPods 4 Be Released?

Generally, Apple announces new hardware products in the fall season, and it’s the time when the world expects to see the AirPods 4. While there isn’t a fixed release date, it’s pretty sure that they will make their debut with the iPhone 16 series, probably in September.

This would be very much in line with past AirPods launch patterns and create the most noise around the new devices. As Apple fall events are one of the expected ones, so shall be the launch of AirPods 4.

Expected Price of the AirPods 4

It’s likely to price the AirPods 4 similarly to the current AirPods 3. This would let Apple maintain consistency in its product line and push major upgrades. If there were to be AirPods 4 Lite, it would naturally have pocket-friendly prices for the device to be more affordable for people with tighter budgets. In this regard, Apple would capture high-end and budget markets, thus expanding its user base.

Conclusion

Anticipation for the AirPods 4 remains high, especially with better audio quality and extended battery life, not to mention most likely groundbreaking features like conversational awareness. Even though we are all expecting an official announcement from Apple, these leaks and rumors do make for a compelling narrative of what’s in store. AirPods 4 might be the biggest update yet in sealing Apple’s dominance within the wireless earbuds market."
Launch day leaked for Apple's iPhone 16 series — and it could be sooner than last.,https://list23.com/3831883-a-leak-disclosed-a-possible-date-for-the-release-of-iphone-16-is-currently-under-review/,"While we can all speculate that Apple will release the iPhone 16 later this year, CNMO has a report that they will do so on September 10th, 2024. When can we expect this to happen?

Unlike the iPhone 15 series, which was released on September 12th, this announcement is made a few days earlier. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 are both released on September 10th, but they were released on November 24th. Apple usually releases their products on Tuesdays, but the iPhone 14 went ahead with this plan.

The iPhone 16 series is expected to undergo significant enhancements. The A18 chipset will power the new iPhone 16s, which will use TSMC's new 3nm process. The iPhone 16 Pro Max will also undergo significant improvements, including a screen upgrade from 6.7 inches to 6.9 inches.

Unfortunately, we are not expecting Apple Intelligence to release with the new models. According to Spectra, we can expect Apple to release Intelligence at some point in the iOS 18.1 update, but judging by the current report, it's safe to say that if Apple ever wants to do this, we can bet we can on the official iPhone 16 launch date, September 30th."
Apple removes the Carousel in Photos as part of changes based on iOS 18 beta feedback.,https://9to5mac.com/2024/08/05/ios-18-photos-app-changes/,"Alongside a new Distraction Control feature for Safari, today’s release of iOS 18 beta 5 also brings some notable changes to the Photos app. In response to user feedback, Apple has made changes to the Photos interface, such as removing the new Carousel view, tweaking the location of albums, and more.

Apple has touted the all-new Photos app as one of the tentpole features of iOS 18, describing it as the “biggest-ever redesign to help users easily find and relive special moments.” The design has proven to be polarizing, and Apple is now taking some of the feedback

One of the big changes to the Photos app in iOS 18 was the addition of a new Carousel view. This view allowed users to swipe left and right to view highlights that updated each day and featured favorite people, pets, places, and more. However, with iOS 18 beta 5, this feature has been removed entirely from the Photos app.

Apple says iOS 18 beta 5 also tweaks the “All Photos” view to display more of the photos grid, without the user having to swipe down. The new “Recent Days” feature also now includes “Recently Saved” content, both of which previously existed separately.

Finally, Apple says that iOS 18 beta 5 adjusts where albums are located for people with multiple albums. The Photos app continues to be fully customizable, and users can rearrange sections and categories as they see fit.

Apple also changed the Photos app in earlier iOS 18 betas, including making it easier to select photos and reverting the pinch-to-zoom gesture changes.

We’ll have more details on what’s new with the Photos app in iOS 18 beta 5 once we install the updates and spend more time with them. iOS 18 beta 5 is rolling out to registered developer beta testers today, likely followed by a public beta later this month and a general release next month.

The update is headlined by a new Safari feature and updates to the Photos app. There are also a few smaller changes throughout, which you can read more about below.

iOS 18 beta 5 is currently available for developer beta testers and is expected to roll out to public beta users sometime within the next week. Early beta versions can be unpredictable, meaning that features working in iOS 18 beta 5 may not function in iOS 18 beta 3. As always, proceed with caution.

iOS 18 beta 5 features and changes

There are new dark mode icons for Find My and Maps.

Multiple Control Center icons have been redesigned, including Screen Mirroring and Cellular Data.

In the Settings app, Stolen Device Protection can now be managed via the Privacy & Security menu. It’s also still available via the Face ID & Passcode screen.

When you long-press on your iPhone’s Home Screen and tap “Edit,” there’s a new “Edit Pages” button. This takes you straight to the multi-page view where you can select and hide select Home Screen pages.

The company made some changes — removing some features and tweaking others — on Monday to address user feedback. The pared-down version can be found in the software’s fifth developer beta, which app makers can install today.

The biggest change is that Apple removed the Carousel from the Photos app altogether. The iOS 18 feature used “on-device intelligence” (which, confusingly, isn’t the same as Apple Intelligence) to aggregate what it thought was your best content, placing them in a swipeable row. Previously found to the right of the photo grid, it’s now gone altogether, helping Apple clean up one of the features that earned a healthy dose of complaints from beta testers.

In addition, Apple tweaked the All Photos view in today’s update to show more of the photos grid. The company also added Recently Saved content to the Recent Days collection. Finally, Apple made albums easier to find for users with more than one. (The difficulty of locating that section was a frequently echoed complaint among testers.)

Apple

Apple pitched the changes to the Photos app as one of the pillars of its 2024 software update. Although the app is streamlined into a single view and designed to be more customizable, it too often ends up as a mishmash of extra features most people won’t need, sometimes getting in the way of finding what you’re looking for.

A Reddit thread from July with over 1,000 upvotes gave voice to some of the most frequent complaints. “Once again taking a rapid-use app and making it into an experience for no reason,” u/thiskillstheredditor commented. “I just want a camera roll and maybe the ability to sort photos by location. It was perfectly fine, if maybe a bit bloated, before. But this is an unmitigated mess.”

Time will tell if today’s updates are enough to clean up the app’s user experience ahead of iOS 18’s fall launch to the public. The changes aren’t yet in the public beta but will likely appear there in the next version or soon after."

Carousel's gone in Photos in iOS 18

Apple's fifth developer beta of iOS 18 has made some changes to the Photos app, including one that removes the Carousel view from the app.

The revamp of the Photos app was a key feature of iOS 18, all to make image searches easier. However, in the latest iOS 18 developer beta, Apple's made some changes to what was a previously solid set of changes.

In the fifth developer beta, Apple has eliminated the Carousel view from the interface. Carousel allowed users to swipe from the main grid to see content selected by onboard algorithms, but that isn't available for the moment.

It is unknown whether the Carousel will return in time for the eventual public release, if at all.

The All Photos view has also been given an update, so that more of the photos grid can be displayed to the user. If users have a lot of albums, they are also elevated higher in the interface to make it easier to find.

The Recent Days row, which contains photos and videos from the previous few days, is now showing recently saved content as well.

The changes arrive following a considerable amount of feedback from users of the beta operating systems. Various complaints have been levied about the changes, including how streamlining the app to a single viewpoint made it harder for users to quickly access the elements they frequently use."
Apple removes the Carousel in Photos as part of changes based on iOS 18 beta feedback.,https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/ios-18-beta-5-photos-app/,"With iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, Apple is introducing a new design for the Photos app, which is designed to better surface high-quality images so that users are able to better relive their memories when browsing through the app. The ‌Photos‌ app changes have been in testing in the developer and public betas, and based on user feedback, Apple has decided to make some design updates.



To make for a simplified viewing experience, Apple removed the carousel. In earlier betas, there was an option to swipe left or right from the ‌Photos‌ view to see Collections, such as Featured images, videos, Favorites, and more, but these Collection elements are also available by scrolling down, so the carousel was a bit repetitive and could be confusing if you accidentally swiped and weren't sure how to get back to your main Library view.

All ‌Photos‌ has been revamped and it now displays more of the photos grid, and users who have multiple albums will see their albums higher up in the ‌Photos‌ app, eliminating the need to scroll almost to the bottom of the interface to get to the albums option.

Recently Saved content was tucked away in the Utilities album, but it is now integrated into the Recent Days collection.

Apple is keeping the unified ‌Photos‌ app redesign, but the updates should make it less confusing to navigate. The app will open to your grid view, where you can select to delete, edit, or share multiple images. There is a clear search interface for quickly finding photos, and you can view your Collections simply by scrolling down.

Apple creates default Collections such as Recent Days, People and Pets, Trips, Memories, Albums, Featured ‌Photos‌, and Wallpaper suggestions, among others, but customizable collections are available. You can create a Collection from any of your albums, trips, or memories, or select a specific media type like videos or a specific person or pet.

There are also options to remove Collections and organize Collections in your preferred arrangement so what you want to see first is up at the top of the app.

The refreshed ‌Photos‌ app is available in the fifth developer betas of ‌iOS 18‌, ‌iPadOS 18‌, and ‌macOS Sequoia‌, and the new look will also come to the next public betas."
Android 15 could minimize heads-up notifications when you're watching videos.,https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-compact-heads-up-notifications-3468061/,"Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority

TL;DR Google is working on a new layout for heads-up notifications in Android 15 that makes them much more compact.

Heads-up notifications are a type of notification that briefly appear in a floating window.

Many people find them annoying and even go as far as to disable them entirely, but this new compact layout could fix that.

In the iOS versus Android debate, one area where Android generally comes out on top is notifications. However, Android still has some issues to deal with in that regard. For example, heads-up notifications are way too distracting when you’re watching a video or playing a game. Fortunately, Google has a fix in the works for this particular issue, and we could see it go live in an upcoming Android 15 release.

The heads-up notification was introduced nearly a decade ago with the release of Android 5.0 Lollipop. It’s a type of notification that appears in a floating window on the top of the screen that you can immediately see and interact with, no matter what app you’re using. It’s intended only to be used for important notifications that you need to know about immediately, such as messages from a close friend or family member. Notifications of this type can appear when they’re part of a channel with a high importance level or when an app is in fullscreen mode. When a heads-up notification appears over a fullscreen app, it can be quite distracting, which is why many people complain about the feature online and also try to find ways to disable it.

Android already lets you opt out of heads-up notifications on a per-channel basis, but it can be a hassle to do this every time it happens. You can also use ADB to disable heads-up notifications entirely on many Android versions, though you may not want to do this if you’re only bothered by them when they appear over fullscreen apps. Thankfully, Google is working on a new layout for heads-up notifications that makes them less distracting.

While I was digging through the latest Android 15 Beta 4 release, I found references in the SystemUI app to a new “compact” layout for heads-up notifications. With a bit of tinkering, I managed to fully enable the feature. As shown below, heads-up notifications that use the new compact layout take up dramatically less space. Most of the text in the notification is truncated, and any embedded images are hidden by default until you tap the dropdown arrow to expand it. The notification icon, notification title, and reply button are still shown for messaging apps like Telegram.

As I just mentioned, this new compact layout for heads-up notifications is not live yet in Android 15 Beta 4. Given that Beta 4 is the final beta release, it’s unlikely that this change will go live in the initial release of Android 15. It’s possible it’ll go live in one of the upcoming quarterly platform releases (QPRs) of Android 15, or it might even be reserved for next year’s Android 16 update. One thing we’re waiting on is a toggle in the Settings app to control this feature; currently, heads-up notifications are either compact or they’re not, with no way to choose which layout to use by default. Once that’s added in, we see no reason why this can’t be rolled out in one of the three upcoming Android 15 QPRs.

Android 15 could minimize heads-up notifications when you're watching videos.,https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/08/android-15-could-offer-a-minimized-layout-for-heads-up-notifications.html,"Google is expected to release the final stable build of Android 15 at some point later this year. The latest iteration of the popular mobile OS will be bringing a smorgasbord of new features to improve the overall user experience. Google has already revealed most of the upcoming features of the new Android version.

However, some of the interesting features are still hiding under the curtain. One of these features is the support for minimized heads-up notifications. It looks like watching videos on Android 15 could improve with less distracting minimized heads-up notifications.

Android 15 could have a more compact layout for heads-up notifications

According to Android Authority’s Mishaal Rahman, Android 15 could offer a more compact layout for heads-up notifications. The minimized window for heads-up notifications will be less obtrusive. They will be less distracting, especially when you are watching a video or playing games.

Rahman found references in the System UI app for a new minimized layout for heads-up notifications in Android 15 Beta 4. After tinkering with the code, he managed to enable the compact layout for the heads-up notifications. He also posted a few photos comparing the difference in the size of the heads-up notification window while playing videos.

As you can see in photo galleries, the compact layout is less distracting than the current large window. It takes up much less space on the screen with only minimal information from the notification. The current layout’s window is quite large with a lot of details.

The new layout may be reserved for quarterly Android 15 updates or even for Android 16

The new layout for the heads-up notifications is not live in the Android 15 beta 4 update. It has only been found after going through the code. There’s a possibility that Google may not include it in the final stable build that’s coming later this year. Google could also have it reserved for one of the upcoming quarterly Android 15 updates. It can even totally skip Android 15 to land with the next year’s Android 16 update, only time will tell."
Our first taste of ‘Apple Intelligence’ is here.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/08/05/openai-elon-musk-new-lawsuit/,"SAN FRANCISCO — Elon Musk filed a new lawsuit against ChatGPT maker OpenAI on Monday, accusing the company’s executives of tricking him and other investors into supporting a company aimed at bettering humanity but then pivoting to become a for-profit enterprise. The lawsuit comes nearly two months after Musk dropped a previous lawsuit making the same accusations a day before a judge was set to rule on its merits. OpenAI executives responded to that initial lawsuit by accusing Musk, who helped found OpenAI in 2015 but parted ways with the project a few years later after disagreements about strategy, of being upset at missing out on the company’s recent success. OpenAI posted emails it said Musk sent in 2018 suggesting that OpenAI should become part of Tesla to give it a way to compete with bigger companies.

The new suit was filed in federal court in the Northern District of California and names OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman and OpenAI President Greg Brockman as defendants in addition to the company itself.

“As we said about Elon’s initial legal filing, which was subsequently withdrawn, Elon’s prior emails continue to speak for themselves,” said Kayla Wood, a spokesperson for OpenAI.

The suit adds to OpenAI’s growing legal headaches. The company faces numerous lawsuits from authors and newspapers who allege it took their content to train artificial intelligence systems without permission or offering appropriate compensation. Government agencies in the United States, U.K. and Europe are running probes into whether the company violated competition, securities and consumer protection laws. The company has hired lawyers and lobbyists at a rapid clip.

When Musk and others created OpenAI in 2015, it was a nonprofit positioned as a counterweight to Google, Microsoft and Facebook’s dominance of cutting-edge AI research. Musk officially stepped down in 2018, citing conflicts with AI projects at the automaker Tesla where he is CEO, and has invested in his own AI initiatives. Last year he launched a venture called X.AI that he said would compete with OpenAI and its blockbuster chatbot ChatGPT.

In 2019, OpenAI started a for-profit subsidiary that took investment from Microsoft and others. Altman has said the start-up had to take outside funding to keep up with big tech’s huge investment in AI. The strategy has largely paid off, with OpenAI using the investment to train massive new AI models, which led to ChatGPT, kicking off an AI arms race in the tech industry. OpenAI was seen as pioneering the next phase of the AI industry."
Our first taste of ‘Apple Intelligence’ is here.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/08/05/musk-moves-x-out-of-san-francisco/,"SAN FRANCISCO — After 18 years, Elon Musk will move X, formerly known as Twitter, out of San Francisco, according to Mayor London Breed’s office. The social media company has a long history with the city, but the billionaire entrepreneur, who acquired the platform in 2022, has often used it to bash the city’s progressive politics and homelessness crisis.

The social network’s departure will mark the end of an era for San Francisco’s downtown Mid-Market neighborhood, where city officials once courted tech companies with incentives dubbed the “Twitter tax break.” Musk made deep cuts to Twitter’s workforce when he acquired the company in October 2022, and X only has about 120 employees left in San Francisco, said a person familiar with the company’s plans, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss company plans they were not authorized to disclose. The employees will be moved to office space in San Jose and Palo Alto, where Musk’s AI start-up, xAI, operates out of, the person said, and the company will conduct a survey to figure out where individual employees want to work.

Ted Egan, San Francisco’s chief economist, said that while Twitter and its workforce were once an important driver of foot traffic in the Mid-Market neighborhood, X never served the same role. He attributes that to the work-from-home policies of the pandemic and Musk’s mass layoffs. “You never like to see a company move out of town, but it’s a much smaller company now, its future is uncertain and sometimes you have to look forward,” he said.

“We may have gotten the most out of it that we were ever going to get,” Egan added.

Musk said in a post on X on Monday that he had “no choice” but to leave San Francisco, appearing to blame the city’s business taxes. But earlier this month, he said he would move the company’s headquarters to Austin, citing a new Golden State law meant to protect LGBTQ+ children as the “final straw.” The New York Times first reported that X would be leaving San Francisco. Musk and X did not respond to a request for comment.

The billionaire has had a fraught relationship with San Francisco since he took over the social media platform, and he had already offloaded much of his office space in the city. X has been sued for failing to pay millions in rent and investigated for illegally converting offices into bunk rooms after Musk said he was sleeping on a couch on the seventh floor. Last summer, construction crews had to dismantle a giant, illuminated “X” sign above the building after several residents of neighboring buildings complained of the blinding, flashing strobe light.

While Musk said last year that he was committed to staying in the city — despite claiming that many were offering “rich incentives for X to move its HQ out of San Francisco” — he has also decried the city in viral posts on X, calling it a “derelict zombie apocalypse.” Last month, Musk said he has had “enough of dodging gangs of violent drug addicts just to get in and out of the building.”

Breed’s office said in a statement that its focus “remains on working with and supporting the many businesses that call S.F. home.”

Twitter’s San Francisco office, inside an art deco building that was formerly a furniture showroom, has long been a symbol of the city’s relationship with the tech industry. The social network moved in after city officials in 2011 offered to waive the city’s 1.5 percent payroll tax for businesses that moved to the Mid-Market neighborhood, which was then struggling with high vacancies and visible homelessness.

Advertisement

The Twitter tax break was designed to bring new jobs and retail to the area as well as reduce crime, and the popular social media company was seen as an anchor tenant. When the tax break sunset after eight years in 2019, however, the results were mixed.

X is the latest major tech company to offload its office space in San Francisco, which has been struggling to lure office workers back downtown since the pandemic normalized working from home. While the office vacancy rate remains high, the mayor’s office sees the AI industry as a possible bright spot, with major companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Scale AI committing to the city.

But when it comes to X, Egan, the city’s chief economist, doesn’t see the exit as much of a loss for San Francisco."

Instead, the AI suite is set to reach Apple’s devices (well, at least the newer ones) sometime in October via its upcoming software such as iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and MacOS Sequoia 15.1.

You can try out Apple Intelligence with Apple’s latest public beta software

But suppose you want to get a taste of Apple’s AI features. In that case, it is now available on Apple’s latest public developer beta software, including iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and MacOS Sequoia 15.1. And of course, you will have to own Apple devices that support the beta software listed above to try them out. Note that the features are still in their beta form and are just small glimpses of what Apple has in store in years to come.

Speaking of which, even when Apple Intelligence is rolled out, don’t expect all of its features presented during the recently held Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) to be made available immediately. The company has put out a road map showing that the Apple Intelligence features will slowly be made available bit by bit and should be completed by mid 2025.

What can Apple Intelligence do?

As of now, features included with Apple Intelligence via the brand’s latest public beta software are such as the ability to record a phone call and automatically transcribe and summarise the conversation and summarise articles and web pages into a single paragraph via Reader Mode in Safari.

Additionally, Apple Intelligence can create movies using photos and videos within the Photos app via a text prompt. There is also a set of writing tools where you can highlight a group of text and turn paragraphs into lists and tables, summarise texts, proofread passages, and even help rewrite content in different tones (Grammarly anybody?). Also, not to be missed is a new Siri interface which comes with the “Type to Siri” feature.

There are also other Apple Intelligence features that are not yet present in Apple’s latest public beta software. This includes the Genmoji tool which can use AI to help you create your own emoji, an Image Playground app that can generate AI photos, as well as a feature that can help automatically prioritise missed notifications.

Apple is considered late in the AI game. Google’s Gemini AI not only can allow users to remove people or objects from an image’s background, but also change the background altogether. Samsung via its Galaxy AI suite along with Google also features Circle to Search, where you can simply circle anything on your screen you want information on, no matter if it is an object within an image or video, text, or whatnot, without needing to type anything.

What to expect with the iPhone 16 series?

Now, onto the upcoming iPhone 16 family. As usual, Apple is staying “secretive” about its upcoming smartphones, although rumours and leaks still can’t be stopped from showing us how the next-gen iPhones might look like.

For starters, the iPhone 16 series is said to get larger screens, at least with certain models. Korean publication TheElec has revealed that the next-gen iPhones will come with a more efficient display technology known as the M14.

Developed specifically for Apple by Samsung Electronics, the M14 replaces blue fluorescent technology with blue phosphorescence. This contributes to an even more power-efficient screen than the LTPO panels featured on the current iPhone Pro models.

Thanks to the new screen tech, the iPhone 16’s screen bezels should theoretically be shrunken, thus contributing to larger screen sizes. This change could be implemented on the higher-end Pro and Pro Max models first before it reaches the next-gen “regular” non-pro models the year after.

Since the release of the iPhone 12 in 2020, iPhone models (excluding the SE) have been offered with two screen sizes, namely 6.1″ and 6.7″. However, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are rumoured to come with larger 6.3″ and 6.9″ panels respectively.

As you would expect, the iPhone 16 series will be coming with new chipsets as well. According to a report by MacRumors citing Jeff Pu, an executive analyst for Haitong International Securities, the “regular” iPhone 16 and 16 Plus will get A18 processors, while the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max will feature A18 Bionic Pro chips instead. Pu also added that the A18 chips will be manufactured by TSMC’s latest 3nm process. Just in case you couldn’t remember, the current iPhone 15 and 15 Plus run on the brand’s A16 Bionic chip, while the 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max feature A17 Pro processors.

The upcoming iPhone 16 Pro series is also rumoured to be able to zoom further with its cameras, according to Apple analyst Ming Chi Kuo. This is thanks to a 5x tetra prism lens, which will be made available with both the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max. The current iPhone 15 Pro rocks a 12MP 3x optical zoom camera, while the 15 Pro Max comes with a 12MP 5x optical zoom shooter.

A subtle but interesting feature that is said to be coming with the iPhone 16 Pro series is a dedicated camera shutter button (finally), much like with the Sony Xperia flagships which has been rocking this feature since 2013 with the Xperia Z1. This button is said to be located on the right of the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max below the power button. It is also rumoured to be a two-stage button, allowing users to half-press to focus and fully press to snap a photo. The action button which made its debut on the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max should continue to exist above the power button on the left side of the phone.

Will there be a foldable iPhone 16?

Well, most probably not. Although nearly all of its competitors including Samsung, Google, Oppo, OnePlus, and Xiaomi, all have their foldable phones now.

Apple has yet to give any info on when its first foldable will be released or what it will look like, but rumours suggest that Apple is working on a clamshell foldable iPhone which is said to come as early as 2026, according to The Information."
Our first taste of ‘Apple Intelligence’ is here.,https://jablickar.cz/en/udela-apple-s-iphonem-16-to-co-udelal-s-iphonem-4s/,"We may not have realized it, but there was a real risk that Apple iPhone 16 release due to unfinished options Apple Intelligence postpones. After all, this has happened before.

We know that iOS 18 does not include any features Apple Intelligence. However, we definitely expected the iPhone 16 to be their main attraction right after entering the market. Then there is the already ongoing iOS 18.1 beta, which will add Apple's first AI capabilities to iPhones. So he could Apple wait with the sale of the iPhone 16 series and could give them just iOS 18.1?

iPhones will, AI won't

Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has good news for all those who are thinking of buying any model of the iPhone 16 series. Although Apple Intelligence will not be part of iOS 18, Apple will not delay the release of new models so that they can have the expected AI capabilities right out of the box. But he did so before because he also didn't have time to debug the hardware software.

This happened in 2011, when the iPhone 4S was pushed back from its original June release to October, in order to meet the availability of its two main features. Back then it was about Siri and iCloud. It will be now Apple to copy his strategy from 2016, when he released the iPhone 7. It was the iPhone 7 Plus model that was supposed to be the first to be able to use the Portrait mode, which he also appropriately called for, but he only got this key function through a software update in October. From October this year, we also expect that Apple in it will release the iOS 18.1 system, which already the first options Apple Intelligence will contain

On the one hand, it can Apple to go through, but on the other hand it can actually be a good strategic move. The first is that customers may not be completely interested in the iPhone 16 because they won't have the desired features, or they may be disappointed that they don't have them. On the other hand, they won't be getting any attention regarding the new hardware and the later release of iOS 18.1 s Apple Intelligence can cause the ideal timing of the ""second wave of interest"" in the product itself and thus evenly distributed sales.

Apple in addition, it has the dosage of AI functions planned gradually, actually until the middle of 2025, so that it can still feed that important interest in the product without having to release new color variants. The presentation of the iPhone 16 will most likely be on September 10."

Google pulls its pro-AI “Dear Sydney” ad after backlash.,https://www.redsharknews.com/another-tech-giant-has-to-pull-a-pro-ai-ad-after-public-backlash,"Google’s Dear Sydney ad has been all over the US Olympic coverage. Or at least it was, as the company has now pulled it after a very public backlash.

Another tech giant has to pull a pro-AI ad after public backlash 3 : 04

If you haven’t seen the Dear Sydney ad, you can watch it below. If you already have — and possibly countless, countless times given the amount of airtime Google booked for it — you are more than welcome to skip the pain of ever watching it again.

Happily, no one will see it any more because Google has pulled it.

“While the ad tested well before airing, given the feedback, we have decided to phase the ad out of our Olympics rotation,” a Google spokesperson told The Hollywood Reporter. For which a grateful nation just says “Thank you.”

So, just to recap, the reason that the ad is titled Dear Sydney is because it’s about a young girl’s quest to write a letter to American track and field star Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone. It’s narrated by her father who states, “I’m pretty good with words, but this has to be just right,” before then prompting Google Gemini to help her write the letter.

Yes, that’s right. Asking an AI to write a child’s fan letter to her heroine. The comments section of the internet has been less than impressed at this mechanisation, automation, and essentially dehumanisation of what is one of the defining moments of childhood for many. Yes, as adults we know that famous people tend to have teams that look after these things when they wrote a response. But the fact that teams of children could be asking AIs to craft the perfect mix of starstruck awe and childish enthusiasm in the first place has been a step too far.

“This ad makes me want to throw a sledgehammer into the television every time I see it,” wrote The Washington Post’s Alexandra Petri, consciously or subconsciously referencing Apple's famous 1984 ad where the individual sought to triumph over the soulless machine, not the other way round.

Google Wins the Gold Medal for Worst Olympic Ad, ran the headline in The Atlantic. “The whole thing is bleak,"" it wrote. ""The company may make bold claims about AI’s capabilities to radically advance civilization. But it can’t escape the reality that it’s co-opting the hopeful aesthetics of the Olympics, which are meant to celebrate human accomplishments, in order to promote a digital technology that can be used to undermine human labor.”

Again, a Big Tech company has misread the room. Apple had to pull its woeful Crush ad in May after the public decided that its underlying message was one of the destruction of human creativity rather than the enabling of it, and now Google has made a similar mistake. Investors and Wall St might love AI (and Tim Cook spent a lot of last week’s most recent Apple earnings call earnestly enthusing about it), but there’s a definite disconnect between the view of Artificial Intelligence at boardroom level and that out and about in the real world. And it’s not a perception gap that looks to be shrinking any time soon.

tl;dr"
Google pulls its pro-AI “Dear Sydney” ad after backlash.,https://www.prdaily.com/google-pulls-ai-ad-after-backlash-from-olympics-audiences/,"Another tech company has pulled an ad after public backlash.

Just months after Apple apologized for an ad that saw artistic and musical implements destroyed by a compressor to fit into an iPad, Google has now ended the run of an Olympics-themed ad meant to tout its Gemini AI model.

The ad starts out as fairly typical Olympic fare: a dad talking about his little girl who wants to be just like Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, an American two-time gold medalist in the hurdles.

But then it takes an odd twist when, instead of helping the girl write her own letter to her idol, the father instead asks Gemini to write it for him.

The backlash was swift, both in the social media sphere and from conventional media. Washington Post Alexandra Petri cut right to the heart of the matter in an opinion piece:

What will these buffoons come up with next? “Gemini, propose for me”? “Gemini, tell my parents I love them”? Lying on your death bed, “Gemini, write a letter to my children saying all the things I wish I’d been able to tell them”? “What was my favorite thing about being alive?”

You’re missing it! You’re missing all of it!

Google announced Friday that it would stop running the ad.

“While the ad tested well before airing, given the feedback, we have decided to phase the ad out of our Olympics rotation,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement, according to CNN.

Why it matters: Ads aren’t PR. But there are times when an ad is so bad (or so good!) that it can break through and create waves of its own. This is one of those times.

Combined with the Apple ad, which saw the tools of human creativity literally destroyed in the pursuit of a slimmer, more powerful iPad, tech companies are at a perilous juncture.

Technology is growing more powerful. It’s evolving in ways that seem unpredictable and even frightening to many regular Joes.

And yet the companies keep touting their tools as ways to outsource the best parts of life – art, the hero worship of a child – instead of the worst.

“I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so that I can do art and writing, not for AI to do my art and writing so that I can do my laundry and dishes,” author Joanna Maciejewska wrote on X in March, neatly capturing the dichotomy between what tech companies seem to be pushing and what people (especially creatives) really want.

Google says the ad tested well, but who did they test it with? With what questions? Communicators of all kinds must step outside their bubble and look at the broader landscape in which their work exists. They need to look at where the real desire is for their products, not merely a use-case that seems flashy or makes a good ad.

Markets around the world were thrown into turmoil Monday. Japan led the way, posting its largest single-day decline ever as it tumbled 12.4%, the New York Times reported. The panic spread to Europe before coming to roost in the United States, where the Dow Jones was down 2.8%, the S&P 500 3.3% and the Nasdaq 3.8% as of 10 a.m. The genesis of the steep decline is Friday’s lousy American jobs report which saw the unemployment rate notch its worst month in nearly three years. This, in turn, sparked fears that the Federal Reserve had waited too long to cut interest rates and stabilize the economy. While it’s widely anticipated that the Fed will cut rates in September, that feels a lifetime away for a rollercoasting global economy. Communicators need to stay on top of this news. Building business literacy and understanding how the broader global economy impacts your organization can help you stay nimble and be ready with smart ideas to manage messaging, even amid chaos.

CrowdStrike and Delta are engaging in a back-and-forth over who should have to pay for the airline’s multi-day meltdown that left thousands of travelers stranded and is estimated to have cost $500 million. Delta said last week it was planning to pursue legal claims for its losses against both CrowdStrike and Microsoft. But CrowdStrike responded with a letter from their legal team on Sunday Aug. 4. “Should Delta pursue this path, Delta will have to explain to the public, its shareholders, and ultimately a jury why CrowdStrike took responsibility for its actions—swiftly, transparently, and constructively—while Delta did not,” Michael Carlinsky, an attorney, wrote in a letter from CrowdStrike obtained by the Wall Street Journal. The letter also states that CrowdStrike offered on-site assistance to Delta, which was declined. This legal letteriessentially threatens Delta with bad PR should it pursue its legal claims; and indeed, discovery is often a damaging part of the legal process, and one reason why some cases don’t go to trial. A well-written legal letter can serve as a strong tool for communicating with the public as well as opposing counsel – and in this case, it’s a warning to Delta that even worse is yet to come.

The most unlikely brand ambassador of the Paris Olympics is an aging rapper with no history of athletic achievement, but a boatload of charm and enthusiasm. Snoop Dogg, known for his rap hits and love of marijuana, is now an Olympics icon, is acting as a commentator and influencer on NBC and Peacock, dancing with the U.S. women’s gymnastics team, running with the torch and kitted out in equestrian gear with his BFF Martha Stewart. His moments have been hits for NBC and the event as a whole, with clips of his antics going viral across social media. “My preparation for prime time is being me,” he said in a press call. Sometimes a surprising choice for a spokesperson or influencer partnership can breathe new life into a brand and make people view the event in a whole new way. It seems to be working for the Olympics, with the highest viewership in 12 years.

Google pulls its pro-AI “Dear Sydney” ad after backlash.,https://www.yahoo.com/tech/google-pulls-gemini-dear-sydney-184134327.html,"Google has pulled a recent 2024 Olympics ad after being accused of promoting the use of AI technology in place of creativity.

In an ad titled “Dear Sydney,” a father narrates his journey to using the platform to help his daughter write a letter to U.S. hurdler and sprinter Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, who just so happens to be her favorite athlete and inspiration, CNBC reports.

While Google maintains that its AI chatbot Gemini is used solely to enhance or even jumpstart its users’ creativity, many social media users dragged the company following the ad’s airing, citing that it promotes too heavy a reliance on technology.

“We believe that AI can be a great tool for enhancing human creativity, but can never replace it,” said a spokesperson for Google in an official statement following the incident, per CNBC. “Our goal was to create an authentic story celebrating Team USA.”

Shelly Palmer, a professor of advanced media at Syracuse University’s Newhouse School of Public Communications, wrote a blog post in response to the ad, saying that the advertised technology presents “a monocultural future where we see fewer and fewer examples of original human thoughts.”

“I flatly reject the future that Google is advertising,” wrote Palmer in the blog post. “I want to live in a culturally diverse world where billions of individuals use AI to amplify their human skills, not in a world where we are used by AI pretending to be human.“

The reviews on the use of AI technology in creative spaces have been mixed. Some people lean toward Google’s sentiment that it enhances creativity. Others believe that the evolution of AI technology can threaten human jobs.

As AFROTECH™ previously reported, actor Samuel L. Jackson has been vocal about his disdain for the use of AI technology, even marking out any clauses in his contract that suggest his name, image, or likeness can be used without his consent in the future.

On July 31, 2024, U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-Delaware), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tennessee), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota), and Thom Tillis (R-North Carolina) introduced the Nurture Originals, Foster Art, and Keep Entertainment Safe Act of 2024, or the NO FAKES Act. The legislation would “protect the voice and visual likenesses of creators and individuals from the proliferation of digital replicas created without their consent.”

At this time, Google has pulled its “Dear Sydney” ad from television. However, it can still be viewed via YouTube."

Its title is “Dear Sydney,” which shows a young girl’s dad prompting Google’s Gemini AI chatbot to write a letter to her favorite athlete.

In response, many criticized the advertisement for promoting reliance on artificial intelligence tools, instead of human creativity.

That is why the company “decided to phase the ad out of our Olympics rotation.”

How did people respond to the Olympics AI ad?

The controversial video involved a girl using an AI chatbot to write to American track-and-field star Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone.

“She wants to show Sydney some love and I’m pretty good with words, but this has to be just right,” the girl’s father says in a voiceover.

The idea that a parent would recommend AI to a child, instead of doing the task themselves or helping out rattled many viewers.

Washington Post staffer Alexandra Petri wrote in her op-ed that the commercial “makes me want to throw a sledgehammer into the television.”

All of the buffoons excited by the prospect of AI taking over all our writing — report summaries, data surveys, children’s letters, all tossed into the same pile indiscriminately — are missing the point in a spectacular manner,” she pointed out.

“To take away the ability to write for yourself is to take away the ability to think for yourself.”

Shelly Palmer, professor of advanced media at Syracuse University’s S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, wrote a blog post sharing a similar sentiment.

“I flatly reject the future that Google is advertising… If this approach to communication becomes widespread, it will lead to a monocultural future where we see fewer and fewer examples of original human thoughts.”

In response, Google clarified the aim of the Olympics Ai ad. “We believe that Ai can be a great tool for enhancing human creativity, but never replace it.”

The commercial, which aired repeatedly during the first week of the Olympic Games , sparked controversy as viewers questioned why a child’s creative expression was being outsourced to AI.

The ad shows the father prompting the chatbot, saying, “Gemini, help my daughter write a letter telling Sydney how inspiring she is.” The commercial then briefly shows Gemini generating a draft, and then concludes with the daughter running on a track, accompanied by the text overlay, “A little help from Gemini.”

Google pulls the controversial ad



Although the ad remains accessible on YouTube, it has been removed from television broadcasts. In a response to CNBC, Google said, “While the ad tested well before airing, given the feedback, we have decided to phase the ad out of our Olympics rotation.”

Google initially defended the commercial, emphasising that Gemini was intended to provide a ‘starting point’ for writing ideas rather than replacing genuine creativity. “We believe that AI can be a great tool for enhancing human creativity, but can never replace it,” the company noted. “Our goal was to create an authentic story celebrating Team USA.”

However, the backlash escalated, with critics accusing Google of promoting automation over authenticity, especially concerning children's creative processes.

AI ads spark creative industry debate

Google is not alone in facing criticism for advertisements that appear to endorse AI’s encroachment into creative domains. Earlier this year, Apple faced a similar backlash after releasing an ad where a hydraulic press crushed musical instruments and paint cans to unveil the new iPad Pro. The tech giant eventually apologised and pulled the ad from television.

The debate over AI’s role in creative industries is intensifying, especially as AI models like Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT continue to be trained on vast amounts of original creative work. OpenAI’s technology chief, Mira Murati, recently acknowledged that AI could displace some creative jobs but argued that some of those roles “should not have existed in the first place.” This sentiment has sparked further controversy, particularly in Hollywood, where actors and unions have pushed back, notably after Scarlett Johansson accused OpenAI of misusing her voice for its new ChatGPT AI voice named ‘Sky’."

It featured a father's monologue about his daughter's admiration for the US track athlete Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone. Several users questioned the authenticity of a letter not personally written by the fan.

It is Olympic season and a lot is happening during that time, in addition to the matches of course. Now, Google has found itself in the middle of a controversy. Why, you ask? It is because of a recent advertisement that rolled out for Gemini which was aired in the US for the Paris Olympics 2024. The advertisement has now been removed but it received a lot of criticism online. Google accepted the criticism and acknowledged it publicly.

The video featured a father’s monologue about his daughter’s admiration for the US track athlete Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone. The girl in the ad wants to break the athlete’s record and wants to write her a letter expressing her inspiration. This monologue is a prompt for Gemini AI, which then generates the fan letter.

As soon as they went on air on July 26, it quickly faced criticism on social media. Several users questioned the authenticity of a letter not personally written by the fan. A lot of people say that it undermines genuine human connections. Others felt that this ad just blatantly devalues the emotional aspect of personal communication.

Google was quick to accept the mistake, in a statement sent to Variety, the company said, “While the ad tested well before airing, given the feedback, we have decided to phase the ad out of our Olympics rotation.” Despite this, Google defended the ad’s creative intention, stating, “We believe that AI can be a great tool for enhancing human creativity, but can never replace it. Our goal was to create an authentic story celebrating Team USA.”

Google is the official “Search AI Partner” of Team USA during the Paris Olympics 2024. So this backlash might hamper that equation."

In a surprising move during the ongoing Olympics, Google has decided to pull its advertisement for the Gemini AI chatbot from the airwaves following a wave of criticism that highlighted deeper societal concerns about artificial intelligence's role in creative tasks. The ad, displaying a father assisting his daughter in writing a heartfelt fan letter to Olympic star Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, sparked backlash as viewers questioned why the child needed a chatbot to express her feelings.

The advertisement, titled ""Dear Sydney,"" depicted a scenario familiar to many parents: a dad wanting to help his daughter communicate her admiration to an idol. Yet, instead of crafting a personalized message, he resorts to Google's AI assistant for help, prompting it with phrases like, ""Gemini, help my daughter write a letter telling Sydney how inspiring she is"". This approach quickly drew ire, as many felt it undermined the authenticity and emotional connection that should arise from such personal communications.

Critics on social media were vocal, arguing that the ad sends a problematic message to children about the value of originality. Shelly Palmer, a professor of advanced media at Syracuse University's S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, said there was an underlying implication in the ad that it’s acceptable to outsource meaningful expression to machines. He remarked, ""I flatly reject the future that Google is advertising,"" voicing concerns that such narratives threaten to cultivate a culture where genuine human creativity could be sidelined as AI takes the lead.

Google’s defense before the ad was withdrawn suggested that the narrative was meant to illustrate how Gemini could serve as a writing aid—not a replacement for the human touch. ""We believe that AI can be a great tool for enhancing human creativity, but can never replace it,"" the company stated. Despite initial confidence in the ad, the persistent backlash evidently forced a reevaluation, leading to the decision to remove it from Olympic airtime, although it still remains viewable on platforms like YouTube.

The core issue resonates beyond just one advertisement; it highlights a broader fear concerning the intersection of artificial intelligence and creativity. Users and critics alike, including writers and artists, are increasingly wary of AI's growing presence in domains traditionally reserved for human expression. Commentators have explained that AI's encroachment upon creative spaces—especially in a sentimental context where heartfelt communication is essential—could have chilling effects on what people create.

Google is not the only major company to face scrutiny over its AI-centric messaging. Apple also encountered backlash with its own advertising that featured destructive imagery, like a hydraulic press crushing musical instruments to demonstrate the new iPad Pro. Many viewed it as a dismissive take on creativity and were unsettled by the disturbing visual of valuing machines over human labor.

While technology continues to advance, the struggle to establish a balance between leveraging AI for efficiency and maintaining human authenticity is becoming paramount. The widespread concerns shared by professionals across various fields reflect an ongoing debate about the future of creativity in an age where AI can mimic, generate, and even adapt human-made content. As consumers continue to engage with products that increasingly rely on AI, they are also grappling with a fear of losing personal touch in their interactions and expressions.

Ultimately, the conversation surrounding Google's ad raises important questions regarding the representations of AI in cultural narratives. Critics suggest that instead of promoting a future where technology enhances our human experiences, ads like these risk presenting a homogenized future where creativity is tethered to algorithms, losing the beauty and messiness that mark true human expression. Moving forward, both consumers and the tech industry must navigate this delicate landscape responsibly to preserve the unique elements that define creativity and personal communication."
Google pulls its pro-AI “Dear Sydney” ad after backlash.,https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/wells-fargo-fires-mouse-jigglers-170651161.html,"Wells Fargo has fired several members of staff after claims that they were faking keyboard activity to make it appear as if they were working when they were not.

It remains unclear how the issue was revealed at the US bank, and if it was related to remote workers.

The bank said that its staff had either been fired or resigned “after review of allegations involving simulation of keyboard activity creating impression of active work,” according to the BBC.

New rules instituted in the US means that financial brokers working remotely have to be inspected every three years.

“Wells Fargo holds employees to the highest standards and does not tolerate unethical behavior,” a spokesperson told The Independent.

Wells Fargo said two years ago that it had taken on a hybrid schedule meaning that staff could partially work from home.

A number of large firms have been using tools to monitor employees after the expansion of remote work during the pandemic. These tools can monitor keystrokes and eye movements, take screenshots and record what websites are used.

Technology has also been developed to evade such surveillance tools, including so-called “mouse jigglers” which are used to make computers appear to be active when workers are actually doing something else. Amazon, which sells them for under $10, has said that thousands have been sold in the last month.

Bloomberg initially reported the firings following a filing by the bank to the US Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The outlet said more than a dozen people had been affected.

The BBC found six instances of staff being fired following a review and another individual who voluntarily resigned after being confronted with allegations. Several had worked for Wells Fargo for less than five years.

Financial firms are at the forefront of the push to make workers return to the office. While remote work remains popular, it has seen a downturn.

In May, 27 per cent of paid days in the US were remote – during the pandemic’s peak in 2020, that figure was more than 60 per cent. This is according to research from the Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México (ITAM) Business School, Stanford, and the University of Chicago.

This spring about 13 per cent of full-time workers in the US were fully remote while an additional 26 per cent have a mixed schedule, the researchers found."

The 60-second commercial, titled “Dear Sydney,” is still available on YouTube but has been removed from airwaves where it aired during the first week of the Games. The ad features a father using Gemini to help his young daughter compose a fan letter to Olympic track star Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone.

In the advertisement, the father says, “She wants to show Sydney some love and I am pretty good with words, but this has to be just right. So Gemini, help my daughter write a letter telling Sydney how inspiring she is.” The commercial briefly shows the draft Gemini produces and ends with footage of the little girl running on a track, accompanied by the tagline: “A little help from Gemini.”

Google Responds to Criticism

A Google spokesperson informed CNBC that despite the advertisement testing well before its release, the company decided to phase it out due to the feedback received. The spokesperson explained that the ad aimed to narrate an authentic story celebrating Team USA. “We believe that AI can be a great tool for enhancing human creativity but can never replace it,” they added. Google emphasized that the Gemini app is intended to provide a “starting point” for writing ideas.

The controversy surrounding the ad reflects broader debates about the role of AI in creative processes and its potential impact on the quality of human expression. As AI technologies continue to advance, companies face increasing scrutiny not only over how they portray and promote these tools but also about using the work of creative professionals without permission to train AI models.

Google is not alone in facing criticism for ads promoting AI in creative tasks. Recently, Apple withdrew an ad showing a hydraulic press crushing music instruments and paint cans to reveal its new iPad Pro following similar backlash. The controversy extended to Hollywood, where actors and unions reacted strongly after Scarlett Johansson accused OpenAI of using her voice without permission for the ChatGPT AI voice named “Sky.”

Despite these criticisms, OpenAI’s technology chief Mira Murati recently acknowledged that while AI might eliminate some creative jobs, she believes some of those jobs should not have existed in the first place.

The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is full of references to other Zelda games.,https://www.polygon.com/zelda/24213626/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-references-other-zelda-games,"When Nintendo debuted its latest The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom trailer on Monday, it became ever more clear how much the new game references the rest of the iconic franchise. Echoes of Wisdom will be released on Sept. 26 on Nintendo Switch, but ahead of that date, there’s plenty to analyze.

From the two different Zora together, something that hasn’t been seen since The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages, and the Bind ability, which is basically Ultrahand, Echoes of Wisdom looks to pull from the franchise’s wealth of history to create a game that’s pushing the series forward.

It’s common for The Legend of Zelda games to use similar formats and reference each other, but here’s what we noticed that stands out in Echoes of Wisdom.

The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening

The most obvious comparison to Echoes of Wisdom is 2019’s The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening — it’s got the same top-down, 3D look that renders Hyrule and its people in an adorable, playful art style. But Link’s Awakening is a remake of the original 1993 game for Nintendo’s Game Boy system, and Echoes of Wisdom is an entirely new game, with new ideas.

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom

As two of the most recent Zelda games, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom are still fresh in our minds — and likely in the minds of Echoes of Wisdom’s developers, too. You can see influences from the two open-world games within the new game’s user interface and menus: They’re not the exact same, but the core of the design is there. Beyond that, you can see the essence of these games — specifically Tears of the Kingdom — in Echoes of Wisdom’s gameplay. One of the core pieces of Tears of the Kingdom is that your journey is unlike another player’s; there are so many different ways to solve puzzles or travel through Hyrule.

This seems to be the case with Echoes of Wisdom, too. Zelda’s Tri Rod lets her use an ability called Echoes, which adds copies of objects or enemies to the world. You use these, instead of a sword, to fight and solve puzzles. Paired up with the Bind ability, which is essentially Ultrahand from Tears of the Kingdom, the sorts of solutions to come up with seem to be endless.

Link is also seen in the original Echoes of Wisdom trailer wearing a cape and using a bow and sword with designs that, well, echo the Zonai elements from Tears of the Kingdom. The Zonai ended up playing a huge role in Tears of the Kingdom after being set up in Breath of the Wild.

Lastly, Echoes of Wisdom uses Breath of the Wild’s and Tears of the Kingdom’s naming conventions for several of its locations, like using Eldin Volcano over Death Mountain from previous games.

The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages

There are two different types of Zora that appear in The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages, the 2001 game for Game Boy Color: one type of Zora that live in the river, and another that lives in the sea. These two Zoras are in conflict with each other in Oracle of Ages — and that conflict appears to continue in Echoes of Wisdom.

The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past

The Ganon that appears in Echoes of Wisdom looks a lot like Ganon from the 1991 Super Nintendo Entertainment System game The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, which is a similar Ganon as in Oracle of Ages. It’s a pig-faced, blue Ganon with Horned armor and a red cape. However, the weapon that Ganon uses in Echoes of Wisdom is a double-headed trident, not a single-headed one as depicted in A Link to the Past. Notable, there is a double-bladed trident in Link’s Awakening, when Link is fighting the Shadow Nightmare."
The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is full of references to other Zelda games.,https://gizmodo.com/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-new-gameplay-trailer-details-2000483201,"Nintendo released a new trailer for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Widom this morning—its first Zelda game in generations to feature the titular Princess as the primary playable protagonist. It confirms two pretty wonderful things: first, that the publisher is trying to marry the franchise’s oldest sensibilities with its newest influences. Secondly? Zelda’s a horse girlie.

The new five-minute gameplay overview gives us a brief look at what to expect when Zelda finds herself off on an adventure to save Hyrule, after Link is consumed by a mysterious dark void emerging over the Kingdom in his own attempts to rescue the Princess from nefarious clutches.

Despite Echoes‘ traditional aesthetic trappings, borrowing its perspective from the earliest games in the Zelda franchise and its chibi-leanings from 2019 remake of Link’s Awakening, there’s a lot here that feels much more reminiscent of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom‘s mechanical ideas than traditional Zelda games. There’s crafting elements like the smoothie shops (seemingly replacing Link’s cooking as a way to get various buffs), various outfits for fashion and functionality, and Zelda’s ability to summon a horse to get around (or even find and unlock fast travel points). But the biggest is another new ability Zelda will have to solve puzzles and engage with the world around her.

Gifted to her by her new ally, the fairy Tri, Bind is akin to the magnesis and ultrahand abilities from Breath and Tears. In one form, Zelda can manipulate objects regardless of size to move with her, and in its reverse-bond form, she can connect herself to an object and move along with it. Combined with the new echo power Zelda has, these abilities let players approach combat, puzzle-solving, and traversal in ways that feel much more like Breath and Tears‘ experimental leanings, rather than Zelda‘s traditional style of finding very specific ways to solve specific things.

Cliff too high to scale? Summon an echo of a spider and reverse-bond it to yourself to follow it as it climbs up. Need a quick defense in combat? Echo up a sea urchin, bind it to yourself, and simply dash into enemies. The variety of applications in this format of Zelda games is unlike anything we’ve really seen in the post-Breath of the Wild world, and it’ll be very interesting to see just how much Echoes manages to bring that kind of open-ended gameplay to something playing more directly with classic Zelda‘s gameplay legacy.

We’ll find out more when Echoes of Wisdom hits Nintendo Switch next month, on September 26."
The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is full of references to other Zelda games.,https://wccftech.com/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-receives-new-trailer/,"The new and upcoming Zelda game, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom has received a brand-new trailer that was released today. Titled ""The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom - Traversing Hyrule,"" it showcases some of the environments that players can expect to explore as Zelda makes their way through Hyrule.

First, the trailer showcases the Gerudo Desert, home to the Voe, women who are exclusively allowed into Gerudo Town. Gerudo Desert is prone to sandstorms, which can obscure visibility for explorers as you traverse through the game. As you explore Gerudo Desert, you'll get to explore vast ruins that have plenty of unique creatures hiding around every corner. In addition, players will also get to explore an oasis hidden away within Gerudo Desert, where there will be a place to relax, as well as speak to some of the nearby NPCs.

Jabul Waters is the next area to be shown off. Compared to the chaos of the ancient ruins in Gerudo Desert, Jabul Waters is ""home to some of the most tranquil waterways in Hyrule."" In this zone, Zelda can encounter the two different types of Zora: The Sea Zora and the River Zora, both who are starkly different to each other in appearance. From the footage showcased in the trailer, it looks as if the Zora don't often see eye to eye, and Zelda will have to mediate.

The next area showcased is Eldin Volcano, which is home to the famous Kakariko Village, tucked away at the base of the volcano. By traversing the volcano, which is home to many risks and threats for Zelda to conquer, she will eventually make her way to Goron City, where she can meet the Gorons.

Zelda will also get to explore the Faron Wetlands, a lush and humid rain forest, where she'll get to learn more about the Deku Scrubs living in the Wetlands.

Of course, while the main quest is to save Link, there will also be a variety of quests given to Zelda in each area that she explores, which will give you rewards and fun story lines to explore by completing them.

One of the new main features that is coming to The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is the use of Travel Waypoints. This isn't too dissimilar to those that are present in Breath of the Wild or Tears of the Kingdom. Once you've unlocked the Travel Waypoint, you can warp to them from your map.

In addition to the Travel Waypoints, you'll also gain access to a horse, which you can use to trample small enemies as well as jump over small obstacles, which can help you traverse Hyrule. The horse can be summoned easily by crafting a Carrot Echo, which can then allow players to summon their steed from anywhere in the world.

Another new feature is the addition of Business Scrubs, where you can make Smoothies using the ingredients that you've collected on your travels. Each smoothie has a different effect, and can help Zelda on her journey through Hyrule.

Zelda is given a new ability in this game called Bind. When creating Echoes isn't enough to help her bypass obstacles, Tri can bind her to an object, which moves in tandem with Zelda. It can be used for a multitude of things, such as unearthing buried treasure or throwing enemies off of a cliff.

The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is to be released on September 26, 2024."

Available September 26, 2024 on Nintendo Switch, with a special edition of Switch Lite. Watch the trailer!

Nintendo has unveiled a new trailer for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, a promising new chapter in the famous series. Developed by Nintendo's talented team, this adventure game places players in the role of the noble Princess Zelda. Scheduled for release on September 26, 2024 on Nintendo Switch, this title will also introduce a special version of the Switch Lite inspired by the universe of The Legend of Zelda. In addition to the game, a golden Nintendo Switch Lite Hyrule edition will be available, featuring the emblem of Hyrule's royal family and inspired by the series.

The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom trailer :

In The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Hyrule is once again in peril. Strange rifts have appeared throughout the kingdom, causing the disappearance of its inhabitants as well as a legendary swordsman. To restore order, Zelda must join forces with Tri, a mysterious fairy, and use the power of Tri's scepter to create reproductions, or echoes, of various objects. These echoes are essential for solving puzzles and fighting enemies. For example, players can use echoes of water cubes to reach new heights, build bridges out of old beds, or hurl boulders at opponents. They can even create monster echoes to fight alongside them.

This new title is aimed at all fans of the franchise, and promises to attract new players too, thanks to its innovative gameplay mechanics and captivating storyline. Fans of games such as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild or The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess will find in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom an adventure that lives up to their expectations. The integration of new gameplay elements, such as the creation of echoes, sets this game apart from other titles in the series, offering a unique and rewarding experience.

It's also important to note that The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom marks a rare occasion when Zelda is the main playable character. In the history of the franchise, there have only been a handful of games where players have had the chance to play as Zelda, such as Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon on Philips CD-i and the Hyrule Warriors games. This new opus adds a unique and exciting dimension to the gaming experience.

The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom promises a fascinating adventure in which players' intelligence and creativity will be put to the test. The ability to create echoes adds a strategic and inventive dimension, enriching the series' traditional gameplay. Fans can look forward to a vast, immersive world, faithful to the universe of The Legend of Zelda, while discovering new ways of playing and interacting with the environment.

The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom promises an epic, innovative adventure. Expect to explore a Hyrule like never before and use Zelda's wisdom to save the kingdom. Available on September 26, 2024, this title is sure to be a must-have for all adventure game fans.

The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is full of references to other Zelda games.,https://wccftech.com/nintendo-q1-2025-report-reveals-sales-down-by-46-5/,"Nintendo's Q1 2025 financial report has been released, and the numbers regarding hardware sales aren't too surprising overall. Nintendo Switch sales have decreased significantly, with 2024 being their lowest year. This quarter of the fiscal year, they sold 2.1 million Nintendo Switches between April 1 and June 30, a significant decrease of 46%.

Their total net sales are down by 46.5%, to 246.6 billion Yen, compared to 461.3 billion Yen during the first quarter of 2024's fiscal year. Their operating profit decreased by a significant 70.6%, with ordinary profit dipping by 55.3%. However, this most likely doesn't come as a surprise to most people.

With the Nintendo Switch being seven years old, it is not surprising that sales are starting to drop significantly. Both their dedicated video game platforms, mobile games, and IP-related income experienced severe drops. Consolidated hardware sales dropped by 46.4%, with mobile and other IP-related incomes dropping by 53.8%.

Nintendo acknowledges the overall drop in mobile and IP-related sales, saying it's ""mainly due to the decrease in income from visual content related to The Super Mario Bros. Movie.""

That said, they made a 42.8% profit on other sales, such as merchandise from official Nintendo stores and playing cards, which brought their sales up from 1.9 billion Yen to 2.8 billion Yen.

All of the Nintendo Switch models suffered a significant blow to sales. The original Nintendo Switch suffered the least with a drop of 18.4%, with Nintendo Switch Lite sales dropping by 56.1% and Nintendo Switch OLED Model sales dropping by 46.3%

Looking at their software sales, two of their IPs were on top for selling over a million units. These two games were Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Luigi's Mansion 2 HD. One other title reached a million units, but it is not disclosed in the financial report as to which game that is.

Sales are drastically different from the previous fiscal year's first quarter. Last year saw the release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which also saw special edition Nintendo Switches released to celebrate the release. Alongside Zelda, The Super Mario Bros. Movie was released, which boosted sales massively.

Overall, the sell-through in this fiscal year is below the level of previous years. Despite that, sales for Princess Peach: Showtime! and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door remained stable. However, these two games combined don't match the amount of sell-through sales Nintendo made with The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Princess Peach: Showtime! and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door account for approximately half of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's sales.

Nintendo has a jam-packed year for game releases, so it's possible the next quarter of the fiscal year will be better for them, with games such as The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom and Super Mario Party Jamboree being released.

A new direction for the franchise? Or rather, a reunion with the roots of the saga that will obsess lovers of the classic installments.

Nintendo has offered a second trailer for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom very exceptional in which we will see how the entire kingdom of Hyrule has been recreated following the same diorama style of the delicious remake of Link’s Awakening, offering us sensations similar to the acclaimed NES, SNES and Game Boy games. Of course, not like the Hero of Valor, but as the princess of wisdom.

A tour that, in fact, takes us to emblematic places and, in the process, serves as a place for Zelda herself to show off her skills with magic, the always fun bartering and, as you will see, even her talent for horse riding. Because perhaps it is a The Legend of Zelda in Top Down, but horse riding remains one of the best additions to the series.

Points of interest on display range from Hyrule Castle and Citadel to the Desert and Gerudo Fortress, and the Jabul Marshes, where the Zoras of the sea and river meet for the second time in the series. Other familiar regions reimagined for fans of the series include Kakariko Village, Farone Swamp, and the home of the Gorons. Lots of terrain to tackle? As well as being able to travel the map on horseback, there are teleportation pillars conveniently scattered around.

In many aspects, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom aims to bring together the best of the most beloved installments. The look and playability of the classics, the adventurous essence and iconic map of Ocarina of Time and new creative elements from Breath of the Wild, including the possibility of dressing up as you like. What’s more, this trailer has been used to show off a new ability: the link.

Classic essence and princess-worthy skills





In The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Not only will we have outfits and upgrades through artifacts, like Link, but we will also be able to memorize and create simple and not very complex objects. We will be able to stack cubes to access new areas or make a carrot appear to make our steed appear. However, there are objects that are too large for this type of ability and that will block our way.

The solution? With the Link we can move them parallel to our princess. We are looking forward to seeing what kind of puzzles are solved with this trick, and it won’t take us too long to find out.





The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom will be available on September 26, 2024 exclusively for Nintendo Switch. And if you don’t have the console yet, the Big N will accompany the launch with a themed edition based on the entire saga. The last Zelda for the Nintendo console? Or rather, the next adventure for fans of the saga. New and old alike.

The first beta version of macOS Sequoia released in June already came with a new abstract wallpaper featuring Sequoia National Park. With today’s beta of macOS, Apple has added another wallpaper, but this time with a real photo of the park.

What’s more, as noted by Mr. Macintosh, there’s also a live aerial version of the “Sequoia Sunrise” wallpaper available. This means that the wallpaper also works as a screensaver for the Mac’s Lock Screen.

If you’re not planning to install macOS Sequoia beta on your Mac before the official release this fall, don’t worry. You can download the new wallpaper right here (courtesy of Mr. Macintosh).

Be sure to click the image and save the full-resolution macOS Sequoia wallpaper, and then set it as your background image through the Photos app or Settings app if you’re using an iOS device.

In addition to HomePod speakers, users can now enjoy Enhance Dialogue when listening through built-in TV or HDMI-connected speakers, AirPods, and other Bluetooth-connected devices, and when playing supported content on iPhone and iPad; Automatic subtitles: Subtitles now automatically appear at just the right moments with tvOS 18, including when the language in a show or film does not match the device language when users mute, or when they skip back while watching something.

For those who prefer connecting an Apple TV 4K to a projector, tvOS 18 beta 5 brings one of its best features yet: 21:9 support for playing movies and shows. tvOS 18 also adds:

Apple Fitness+: A redesigned interface helps users make the most of the library and explore the exercises they like the most;

A redesigned interface helps users make the most of the library and explore the exercises they like the most; FaceTime with Continuity Camera: Apple adds Live Captions for English in the US and Canada, so users can read what others are saying on a FaceTime call from the TV

tvOS 18 has even more features in store. Alongside its beta 5, Apple also seeded the fifth testing version of iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS Sequoia, watchOS 11, and visionOS 2."
MacOS Sequoia beta 5 adds a new wallpaper – and you can download it.,https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/apple-seeds-visionos-2-beta-5-to-developers/,"Apple today released the fifth beta of an upcoming visionOS 2 update to developers, with the beta coming two weeks after the fourth beta.



Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app on their device, going to the Software Update Section, tapping on the ""Beta Updates"" option, and toggling on the Developer Beta. Note that an Apple ID associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.

‌visionOS 2‌ is able to take the depth information from 2D photos and turn them into 3D photos using advanced machine learning. Apple says that the feature is meant to add depth to photos to make memories more immersive.

There are new hand gestures for activating the Home View and Control Center, and the Home View is also now customizable with apps able to be rearranged. Travel Mode now includes support for trains, and Guest User profiles are now saved for 30 days so guests don't have to do the setup process every time they try out the headset.

Later in the year, Mac Virtual Display will support higher resolution and larger sized virtual displays, which Apple says will be equivalent to two 4K monitors side by side. With an AirPlay update, the Vision Pro can serve as an ‌AirPlay‌ receiver, so content from the iPhone, iPad, or Mac can be shared to the headset.

The Mindfulness app can track and respond to breathing patterns using the camera for an improved meditation experience, and the Vision Pro supports Bluetooth mice with ‌visionOS 2‌."

At the moment, the main change with iPadOS 18 beta 5 concerns the Photos app. Apple is bringing back some of the old designs after user feedback. Besides that, iPadOS 18 beta brings several new features, including a brand-new Calculator app. It looks similar to what you’d expect from Apple’s Calculator app. However, it brings an all-new Math Notes feature, allowing users to type or write out mathematical expressions and see them instantly solved in their handwriting.

With Apple Pencil’s help, Smart Script makes handwritten notes fluid and easier to read. Smart Script allows users to write quickly without sacrificing legibility by smoothing and straightening handwritten text in real-time. It also makes editing handwritten text just as simple as editing typed text. With Apple Pencil, users can easily add space, scratch out a sentence, or even paste typed text in their own handwriting, and the paragraph will automatically reflow to fit the new content.

Besides these changes, iPadOS 18 beta also takes customization to a new level. Now, apps can be organized in any way, which means they can be placed anywhere. App icons and widgets can take on a new look with a dark or tinted effect, and users can make apps appear larger to create the perfect experience.

iOS 18

Apple has made available the new beta of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18. To download it, you must be registered in the beta program and then go to your iPhone settings to install iOS 18. Also make sure you have enabled developer mode in Settings > “Privacy and security”.

After getting a sneak peek at what’s new in iOS 18 at WWDC 24, Apple didn’t quite finish with the first beta. We haven’t gotten to test the Apple Intelligence part, the new Siri, the new Mail, and more. But the home screen customization is already here, as are a bunch of smaller changes.

Here are the changes in Beta 2:

iPadOS 18 includes alternative app stores and other European changes

An RCS option is available in the USA

The App Store icon finally supports dark mode

In the “Passwords” app, there is a “+” button in the main view to add a new item without having to tap the “All” icon.

The virtual “power off” button in Control Center has a more pronounced haptic feel when you press it, and it only triggers when you actually press it, rather than just brushing against it.

Many bugs have appeared: very weak speaker sound, choppy media playback, slowness, etc.

Here are the changes in Beta 3:

RCS is coming to iPhone in France, but apparently only at SFR. In Canada too.

Apple is applying a dark effect to all icons, not just its apps. Facebook, Slack, Signal, YouTube and others are seamlessly integrated. Others like iSoft, the white is slightly toned down.

Apple has added a “Select” button to choose multiple images in the main Photos interface, so you no longer have to swipe down to reach it.

With this change, the Search button is now just a magnifying glass, but it’s highlighted in blue to make it stand out more.

With this change, the Search button is now just a magnifying glass, but it’s highlighted in blue to make it stand out more. In Messages, emoji, Memoji, and stickers have been consolidated into a single interface, which can be navigated using the tiny icons at the bottom of the screen. You can create stickers and Memoji from this interface, and you can use stickers directly in your messages just like you can use emoji. Apple likely made these changes in preparation for the launch of Apple Intelligence, Genmoji, and Image Playground.

In Wallpapers, there is a dynamic version of the iOS 18 wallpaper that changes from one color to another depending on the time of day.

When you enable the flashlight, you have a larger, more intuitive interface to change the brightness and range of the LED flash used for the flashlight function.

The RCS interface in the Messages section of the Settings app has changed. Rather than appearing as a simple on/off button, it’s now a menu that provides additional context. Apple explains that sending and receiving messages with RCS uses wireless data, and cellular network identifiers may be shared with carriers and their partners.

Here’s what’s new in Beta 4:

The old widgets, called “Today”, are disabled by Apple. They were introduced with iOS 8, while modern widgets were added in iOS 14.

Apple has added light mode and dark mode wallpapers for CarPlay, mirroring those added on the iPhone.

Apple has added a new way to access iCloud settings in the Settings app. The iCloud option is now associated with App Store, Game Center, and Wallet.

In the Camera section of the Settings app, a new “Control menu” option is available under “Preserve settings.” The control menu preserves the previously used camera tool when expanding the control menu rather than showing the full list of camera control options when using the Camera app.

Apple has changed the design of the Hidden folder in the App Library with empty app squares.

Dark mode and light mode icons are now properly synced with general mode settings when using the “Automatic” setting in the Customize section.

Apple has changed the design of the Stocks app icon. The lines are more subtle and there is no longer a white veil on the bottom part of the icon.

There is a new Control Center button for Bluetooth, but it doesn’t work yet. Apple also added a Mute button and an Eye Mirroring Accessibility option. The “Open Music” Control Center option has been removed.

New types of Siri and Apple Watch Mirroring options are available for AssistiveTouch.

There are additional references to Apple Intelligence features, suggesting that Apple continues to prepare to implement AI very soon.

Here’s what’s new in Beta 5:

Apple has finally added the “distraction control” feature in Safari to hide certain elements of a website.

tvOS 18

On the Apple TV side, tvOS 18 is also available to all developers. If your box is set up to receive betas, go to Settings > System > Software Updates > Update Software.

As every year, the new features of tvOS 18 are meager, but with some interesting additions like automatic subtitles or the InSight function which gives information on a scene in progress.

Here are the changes in Beta 3:

The InSight feature is now available.

watchOS 11

Regarding watchOS 11, Apple Watches from Series 6 (or SE 2022) can install it by taking care to have downloaded iOS 18 on the paired iPhone. You also have to be a developer, obviously.

As seen in early June, watchOS 11 has a lot of new features, including training load, vital signs, new watch faces and more.

Here are the changes in Beta 2:

MacOS 15 Sequoia

Apple is also offering macOS 15 Sequoia on Mac. To install the macOS Sequoia beta, you need to have a developer account (free), then go to System Settings > General > Software Update. Then go to “Beta Update” to enable the beta.

For the Mac, the major update announced at WWDC offers a nice dose of new features, much of which is related to iOS 18 and Apple Intelligence. For example, we appreciate automatic windowing.

Here are the changes in Beta 2:

Wireless iPhone mirroring with full control from Mac

Collaborative screen sharing via SharePlay

Here are the changes in Beta 4:

When using iPhone Mirroring with macOS Sequoia beta 4, you can change the size of the iPhone window on your Mac’s screen.

visionOS 2

To install visionOS 2.0 in beta, you obviously need to have the headset, but also be an Apple developer. The new features are discreet but practical, such as the extension of the Mac desktop in higher resolutions, the recognition of the Mac keyboard in the virtual environment, an improved guest mode, a travel mode for the train or even new gestures to access system features such as the time.

Before updating, back up your Apple Vision Pro, then go to Settings > General > Software Update.

Here are the changes in Beta 2:"

Neurosurgeon Theodore Schwartz still remembers the first time he witnessed brain surgery in person. He was in medical school, and the surgeon sat in a special chair that was designed to hold the arms up while they worked under a microscope.

It reminded Schwartz of the way an astronaut looked in the cockpit of a spaceship — except, he says, ""[The surgeons] were traveling into the microcosm of the brain instead of traveling into the macrocosm of another planet.""

""When I first saw that, it was nothing but awe and excitement and the fact that they were doing it to help another human being and going into the brain and the mind,"" Schwartz says. ""Everything that we are as human beings is in our brain.""

Schwartz has since spent nearly 30 years treating people with neurological illnesses. When he was first getting started, he worried about keeping his hands and body steady during long surgical procedures that might stretch on for hours. But he says over time he's trained his body to enter what he describes as a surgical ""flow state.""

""It's sort of the ultimate in mindful meditation,"" he says. ""The external world does not exist for that period of time. And the same is true of your bladder. ... And then at the end of the operation, You kind of realize, 'Oh my goodness, I have to go to the bathroom. I'm tired, my neck hurts, my back hurts.'""

Schwartz writes about the past, present and future of neurosurgery in his book, Gray Matters: A Biography of Brain Surgery. He notes that while traditional brain surgery involves opening up the side of the skull, the practice of ""minimally invasive brain surgery"" — whereby the brain is accessed via the nose or by the eye socket — has become more mainstream over the course of his career.

""We can do surgeries now by making a small incision in the eyelid or the eyebrow and working our way around the orbit in order to get to the skull base,"" he says. ""And that allows us to get to these very delicate parts of the brain much more quickly, and without disrupting as much of the patient's anatomy so that they heal much faster.""

When it comes to brain health, Schwartz recommends the basics: exercise, a healthy diet and plenty of sleep. ""And besides that, I don't know that we really know what we can do to keep our brains healthy. So that's the recommendation I would give,"" he says.

Interview highlights

On the need for power tools for such delicate surgery

We think of brain surgery as something that's very fine and delicate ... but the brain is housed in the skull, and the skull is very, very strong. And that's what protects our brains from injury. And so part of what we have to do as brain surgeons is first get through the skull. And that work is often very physical and involves drills and saws in order to get through the bone. We obviously do it very carefully, because the trick is to get through the bone and not damage the underlying contents. But we have to use power tools, and that's how we start out every operation, with saws whirring and buzzing and making noise and sort of bone smoke going in the air before we transition to the careful, delicate microsurgery that we do after that.

On trying a new method of surgery when the stakes are so high

You realize the gravity and the importance and the significance of the fact that this other person's life is in your hands and you're trying something on them that you think will be better, for sure, but you're not sure yourself of your own ability because you haven't done it 100 times. And that's really terrifying. And it's something that we have to deal with as neurosurgeons. Not just when we try something new, but essentially every time we do an operation, we're taking on that enormous responsibility of another human being's life.

While the majority of our surgeries go extremely well, occasionally they don't. And when that happens, it weighs on you tremendously. And it affects how you think about all the subsequent cases that you're going to do that are similar, because you never forget those cases that didn't go quite the way you wanted them to go.

On relieving pressure in brain by cutting a hole in the skull

One of the most common surgeries that neurosurgeons do is head trauma. And head traumas are very common. But these are neurosurgical emergencies. Anyone who has hit their head severely enough, they will have swelling in their brain. And we can now save these people's lives just by opening up the skull. Because as the brain swells, if it has nowhere to go, that's when the pressure goes up. So neurosurgeons can go in very quickly and remove part of the skull, and let that pressure out and then put the skull back, maybe, two or three weeks later, or maybe even a few months later when the swelling has gone down and we can save lots and lots of lives that way.

On how the field of neurosurgery is changing

One of the things I love is that, some days or weeks I'll come in and I'll be training a fellow and we'll go through six, seven, eight operations and I'll tell them, all these operations that we just did together, I didn't learn how to do any of these in my training 25 years ago. They're all completely new operations. And that's a wonderful thing about a field like brain surgery, is that we are constantly applying new technology and the field is changing and you have to stay up to date, but it also keeps you active. It keeps you thinking. You're constantly working with engineers and people in other fields to figure out what's the latest technology going on in, you know, oncology and orthopedics and OB/GYN that we can apply to neurosurgery? To try to make what we do better.

On seeing his father’s stroke and aphasia when he was in residency

It was just this profound moment of seeing my father's brain appear before me and fearing I was going to see a problem. And sure enough, there was this sort of dark spot which I know to be a stroke, and he had had a horrible stroke that took away his ability to speak. As a result of the surgery he had, and unfortunately passed away a few weeks later. But it was just [a] devastating experience for me. And as much as I know about the brain, I knew too much about what was going on. I also knew that at that moment in time, there was nothing we could do for him.

On the union of the brain and the mind

I think everything that a human being experiences, in the external world and the internal world is all your brain. I think that's all that there is. I don't think there's some mystical second substance called ""mind."" ... We think the mind and the brain are different things because it's built into our language. It's how we talk about the mental world around us. We were raised speaking a language with words that refer to things that may not exist in the real world -- and one of those things is mind. … I do not think we have as much agency over what we do, if any. And I think the brain is processing information, below our radar, unconsciously, subconsciously, whatever you want to call it, and creating behaviors. And we are just along for the ride to some extent.
