Cancer Screening costs over $43 Billion a year in the U.S.,https://www.medpagetoday.com/hematologyoncology/othercancers/111379,"The cost of initial cancer screening in the U.S. was estimated to be over $43 billion in 2021, which was less than the reported annual cost of cancer treatment in the first year after diagnosis, according to a modeling study.

Using national healthcare survey and cost resources data, the total healthcare system costs for initial breast, cervical, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer screening were estimated at $43.2 billion in 2021, reported Michael T. Halpern, MD, PhD, of the National Cancer Institute, and colleagues.

Of note, colorectal cancer screening accounted for 63.6% of the total amount, at $27.5 billion, with screening colonoscopy representing about 55% of the total, they noted in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

Patients with private insurance accounted for more than 88% of all screening costs, while Medicare beneficiaries accounted for 8.5%, and Medicaid beneficiaries, those with coverage from another government program, and uninsured patients accounted for 3.2%.

""The annual cost of cancer screening represents a notable portion of overall U.S. healthcare system costs related to cancer,"" Halpern and colleagues wrote. ""Identification of these costs and the drivers for cancer screening costs are critical to help inform policy and develop programmatic priorities, particularly for enhancing access to recommended cancer screening services.""

While the costs of screening are substantial, the authors noted that ""it is important to consider the value resulting from cancer screening.""

They pointed out that previous research supports the cost-effectiveness of screening for breast, cervical, colorectal, and lung cancer, and clinical trials have shown that recommended cancer screening can reduce cancer-specific mortality.

However, in an editorial accompanying the study, H. Gilbert Welch, MD, MPH, of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, noted that whether the cost of screening is ""$43 billion or $100 billion, questions remain about the value of the expenditure.""

He argued that the effect of cancer screening ""is so small that randomized trials must enroll tens of thousands of participants to reliably detect a change in cancer-specific mortality -- not all-cause mortality,"" adding that ""exaggeration of benefits and minimization of harms cause real problems.""

""Resources devoted to cancer screening would be better directed toward ensuring widespread access to effective cancer treatment,"" Gilbert wrote. ""And addressing the social determinants of cancer risk -- smoking, obesity, poverty, and unhealthy living conditions -- would reduce death from multiple causes, not just cancer.""

For this study, Halpern and team estimated the number of people screened for breast, cervical, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer in the past year using data from the 2021 National Health Interview Survey. To estimate the total cost of cancer screening, they multiplied the number of people screened for those cancers and associated healthcare system costs by typical insurance cost per screen in 2021 dollars.

""For all screening tests, only medical care costs associated with the initial screening were included,"" they noted. ""Due to limitations of available data, costs of follow-up imaging and procedures after initial abnormal or positive screening results were not included, although these are critical components of the screening process.""

Halpern and colleagues determined that mammography (32.8 million) and cervical cancer screening (33.0 million) accounted for the largest total number of tests performed in 2021, while an estimated 22.3 million colorectal cancer screening tests were performed, mainly comprising fecal immunochemical testing (9.8 million) and colonoscopy (9.2 million). In addition, there were 8.3 million prostate-specific antigen tests performed, as well as 2.4 million lung screening tests.

Of the estimated cost of $43.2 billion:

Colonoscopy was the largest component, accounting for an estimated $23.7 billion

All other colorectal cancer screening tests combined accounted for an additional $3.8 billion

Breast cancer screening accounted for $8.8 billion, cervical cancer screening for $5.5 billion, and prostate and lung cancer screening each cost an estimated $700 million

The authors also observed that the cost of cancer screening is dependent on facility costs, particularly in the cases of colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, CT colonography, and CT lung cancer screening, for which the facility costs are much higher than the physician costs.

""Policies that affect facility costs or sites where screening tests are done (hospital outpatient facilities vs ambulatory surgery centers) may have substantial effects on the cost of cancer screening,"" Halpern and colleagues wrote. ""In addition, changes in rates of receipt of facility- versus home-based colorectal cancer screening tests could have substantial effects on cost estimates.""

Cancer Screening costs over $43 Billion a year in the U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/health/cancer-screening-tests-cost.html,"The United States spent $43 billion annually on screening to prevent five cancers, according to one of the most comprehensive estimates of medically recommended cancer testing ever produced.

The analysis, published on Monday in The Annals of Internal Medicine and based on data for the year 2021, shows that cancer screening makes up a substantial proportion of what is spent ever year on cancer in the United States, which most likely exceeds $250 billion. The researchers focused their estimate on breast, cervical, colorectal, lung and prostate cancers, and found that more than 88 percent of screening was paid for by private insurance and the rest mostly by government programs.

Dr. Michael Halpern, the lead author of the estimate and a medical officer in the federally funded National Cancer Institute’s health care delivery research program, said his team was surprised by the high cost, and noted that it was likely to be an underestimate because of the limits of the analysis.

For Karen E. Knudsen, the chief executive of the American Cancer Society, the value of screening for the cancers is clear. “We are talking about people’s lives,” she said. “Early detection allows a better chance of survival. Full stop. It’s the right thing to do for individuals.”"
Cancer Screening costs over $43 Billion a year in the U.S.,https://www.healthday.com/healthpro-news/cancer/estimated-us-annual-cost-of-initial-cancer-screening-43-billion-in-2021,"MONDAY, Aug. 5, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- In 2021, the estimated total health care costs for initial cancer screening were $43 billion in the United States, according to a study published online Aug. 6 in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

Michael T. Halpern, M.D., Ph.D., from the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, and colleagues estimated the annual cost of initial cancer screening in the United States in 2021 using national health care survey and cost resources data.

The researchers found that in 2021, total health care costs for initial cancer screenings were estimated at $43 billion in the United States. Of the costs, about 88.3, 8.5, and 3.2 percent were attributed to private insurance; Medicare; and Medicaid, other government programs, and uninsured persons, respectively. Colorectal cancer screening represented about 64 percent of the total cost; screening colonoscopy represented more than half of the total (55 percent). Major drivers of the total estimated costs of screening were facility costs (amounts paid to the facilities where testing occurred).

""This study provides previously unavailable estimates for the annual medical care cost of cancer screening in the United States,"" the authors write. ""Identification of these costs and the drivers for cancer screening costs are critical to help inform policy and develop programmatic priorities, particularly for enhancing access to recommended cancer screening services.""

Cancer Screening costs over $43 Billion a year in the U.S.,https://www.auntminnie.com/clinical-news/article/15680964/cancer-screening-in-the-us-costs-432b-annually,"Total U.S. healthcare system costs for initial cancer screenings in 2021 were $43.2 billion, according to a report published August 5 in Annals of Internal Medicine.

Researchers at the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) found that colorectal cancer represented approximately 64% of the total cost, with colonoscopies making up about 55% of the total. The total cost is less than the reported annual cost of cancer treatment in the first 12 months after diagnosis, the group noted.

“Identification of cancer screening costs and their drivers is critical to help inform policy and develop programmatic priorities, particularly for enhancing access to recommended cancer screening services,” wrote lead author Michael T. Halpern, MD, PhD, of the NCI’s Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences in Bethesda, MD.

More than two million new cancer cases and more than 611,000 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the U.S. in 2024, according to the authors. While cancer screening may decrease cancer mortality and treatment costs, the cost of screening in the U.S. is unknown, they added.

To address the knowledge gap, the group analyzed data made available in 2021 from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in its National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). NHIS data are collected through personal household interviews.

The study considered breast, cervical, colorectal, and lung cancer screening, as well as prostate cancer screening among men aged 55 to 69 years. For breast cancer, the study considered screening among women aged 40 to 49 years old only by mammography. Types of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening methods included colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, CT colonography, fecal immunochemical testing (FIT), and Cologuard.

According to the results, mammography (32.8 million) and cervical cancer screenings (33 million) accounted for the largest total number of tests. An estimated 22.3 million CRC screening tests were performed, mainly comprising FIT (9.8 million) and colonoscopy (9.2 million).

Of the estimated $43 billion total, the largest component was screening colonoscopy, which accounted for $23.7 billion, or approximately 55% of the total, the researchers reported. All other CRC screening tests combined accounted for an additional $3.8 billion.

Breast cancer screening accounted for 20.4% of the total ($8.8 billion), and cervical cancer screening accounted for 12.8% ($5.5 billion), while lung cancer screening accounted for approximately 1.5% ($656 million) and prostate cancer screening (PSA tests) accounted for 1.6% ($702 million).

In addition, people with private insurance accounted for more than 88% of all screening costs; Medicare beneficiaries accounted for 8.5%; and Medicaid beneficiaries, those with coverage from another government program, and uninsured persons accounted for 3.2%.

The authors noted limitations, namely that the estimates are only for the number and medical care cost of initial cancer screening tests and do not include costs for follow-up for abnormal initial screening results, although these are critical components of the screening process.

Ultimately, they wrote that screening for breast, cervical, colorectal, and lung cancer has generally been reported to be cost-effective in the U.S. and that colorectal cancer screening may be cost-saving in certain scenarios. The cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer screening is less clear, they noted.

“This study provides previously unavailable estimates for the annual medical care cost of cancer screening in the United States,” the group concluded.

Nearly half of dementia cases could be avoided or delayed by tackling 14 risk factors.,https://www.everydayhealth.com/dementia/vision-loss-high-cholesterol-join-list-of-preventable-dementia-risk-factors/,"By addressing 14 modifiable risk factors, which now include vision loss and high cholesterol, an estimated 45 percent of dementia cases could be delayed or prevented entirely — even in individuals with high genetic risk for dementia, according to a recent report.

[1] Written by 27 of the world’s leading dementia experts, the new 2024 Lancet Commission report urges health officials and the public to take action to reduce these specific preventable risks beginning in childhood and continuing throughout life.

[2] “Some people will still develop dementia, but if they address these risks they should have a longer, healthier life and will not have dementia for such a long time,” said lead author Gill Livingston, MD a professor specializing in the psychiatry of older people at University College London, in a press release.“It’s never too early or too late to take action, with opportunities to make an impact at any stage of life.”

Preventing Direct Physical Threats to Mental Sharpness

The Lancet report identifies these 14 modifiable risk factors for dementia:

High blood pressure

Diabetes

Obesity

Physical inactivity

Drinking too much alcohol

Smoking

Traumatic brain injury

Hearing Loss

Exposure to air pollution

Depression

Social isolation

Lower education

Vision loss

High LDL cholesterol

diabetes, [3] Physical risk factors like high blood pressure obesity , and physical inactivity may lead to narrowed or blocked arteries that decrease blood flow to the brain, and brain cells need a constant supply of blood and oxygen to work properly.

[4] [5] Drinking too much alcohol and smoking can also contribute to heart disease and be toxic to brain cells, causing them to die.

Another risk factor that directly impacts mental capabilities is traumatic brain injury, which disrupts how the brain functions.

High Cholesterol and Vision Loss Can Contribute to Dementia Risk

The new guidelines have now added high cholesterol in midlife (from around age 40) to the list of modifiable risk factors. The Lancet Commission estimates that 7 percent of dementia cases are attributable to this “bad” cholesterol, which leads to a build-up of cholesterol in the arteries.

[6] When the list was last updated four years ago, available evidence indicating LDL cholesterol as a possible risk factor was inconclusive, according to Dr. Livingston. Since that time, “new compelling evidence” has found that LDL cholesterol increases the chances of experiencing cognitive decline.

[7] While hearing problems were already on the dementia risk roster, loss of vision was just added in this recent update. A decline in these sensory functions are common as we age, and can lead to confusion and problems processing information and everyday perception.

The Lancet report found that 2 percent of dementia cases were attributable to untreated vision loss in later life.

Air Pollution, Depression, Loneliness, and Lack of Education Can Also Threaten Brain Health

Air pollution has been linked to heart disease, which in turn can raise the likelihood of cognitive impairment. Individuals may have little control over their exposure to air pollution, so it can be difficult to limit. The researchers, however, suggest that people can take some individual actions, such as not using wood burning stoves or coal burning fires and avoiding being outside at times when air quality is at its worst.

Depression and social isolation can contribute to dementia as well because they may lead to changes in health and behaviors that heighten dementia risk, such as physical inactivity, poor diet, higher alcohol consumption, less sleep, and a lack of mental stimulation and engagement.

Although the connection between dementia and education may not be as apparent compared with other risk determinants, the Lancet Commission notes that quality of education in early life is linked to brain resilience.

“People with more and better education have a stronger, more flexible set of neural connections to rely on if they ever do have brain disease that can cause dementia,” says Jessica Caldwell, PhD, director of the Women’s Alzheimer’s Movement Prevention Center at Cleveland Clinic’s Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health. “The other good news in this update is that education is being recognized as impactful beyond early life. This means that people in their thirties through their sixties may also see strong benefits from lifelong learning. Take a class, learn a language, take up a challenging hobby, or research history before you travel.”

How to Reduce Dementia Risks

While people can take effective steps to prevent mental decline at any age, Livingston notes that there is now stronger evidence showing that longer exposure to risk is more harmful. She emphasizes that developing healthy habits in childhood — such as getting regular exercise and following a healthy diet to avoid obesity — can form the basis for behaviors later in life that can curb dementia risks.

The new Lancet report outlines several suggestions to help governments and individuals keep the dangers of dementia at bay, including:

Provide all children with good quality education and be cognitively active in midlife.

Make hearing aids available for all those with hearing loss and reduce harmful noise exposure.

Detect and treat high LDL cholesterol in midlife, starting at around age 40.

Make screening and treatment for vision impairment accessible for all.

Treat depression effectively.

Wear helmets and head protection in contact sports and on bikes.

Prioritize supportive community environments and housing to increase social contact.

Reduce exposure to air pollution through strict clean air policies.

Expand measures to reduce smoking, such as price control, raising the minimum age of purchase, and smoking bans.

Reduce sugar and salt content in food sold in stores and restaurants.

Dr. Caldwell, who is not part of the Lancet Commission, stresses, “There are steps all of us can take when we are young and at midlife to increase our chances of aging well.”"

Nearly half of dementia cases could be avoided or delayed by tackling 14 risk factors.,https://scitechdaily.com/new-strategies-to-combat-dementia-14-risk-factors-you-can-control/,"The 2024 Lancet Commission report identifies vision loss and high cholesterol as new risk factors for dementia, adding to 12 others previously known.

It emphasizes the importance of early and lifelong management of these factors, including for those with a genetic predisposition to dementia. The report provides 13 recommendations targeting both individuals and governments to mitigate risk. These include managing hearing and vision loss, maintaining cognitive and social activity, using head protection in sports, managing vascular risks like cholesterol and diabetes, improving air quality, and fostering supportive communities. Research focusing on England indicates that implementing these measures could save about £4 billion by addressing risk factors such as excessive alcohol consumption, brain injuries, air pollution, smoking, obesity, and hypertension.

According to the third Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention, and care, addressing 14 modifiable risk factors from childhood and continuing throughout life could prevent or delay nearly half of dementia cases. This is crucial as global life expectancy increases and the number of dementia cases is projected to rise significantly in all countries. These findings were recently presented at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference (AAIC 2024).

Based on the latest available evidence, the new report adds two new risk factors that are associated with 9% of all dementia cases —with an estimated 7% of cases attributable to high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or “bad” cholesterol in midlife from around age 40 years, and 2% of cases attributable to untreated vision loss in later life.

These new risk factors are in addition to 12 risk factors previously identified by the Lancet Commission in 2020 (lower levels of education, hearing impairment, high blood pressure, smoking, obesity, depression, physical inactivity, diabetes, excessive alcohol consumption, traumatic brain injury [TBI], air pollution and social isolation), which are linked with 40% of all dementia cases.

The new report estimates that the risk factors associated with the greatest proportion of people developing dementia in the global population are hearing impairment and high LDL cholesterol (7% each), along with less education in early life and social isolation in later life (5% each).

The Commission, authored by 27 world-leading dementia experts, calls for governments and individuals to be ambitious about tackling risks across the life course of dementia, arguing that the earlier we can address and reduce risk factor levels, the better. The report outlines a new set of policy and lifestyle changes to help prevent and better manage dementia.

More action is needed worldwide to reduce dementia risks

Because of the rapidly aging population around the world, the number of people living with dementia is expected to almost triple by 2050, rising from 57 million in 2019 to 153 million. Increasing life expectancy is also driving a surge in people with dementia in low-income countries. Global health and social costs related to dementia are estimated at over $1 trillion every year.

However, in some high-income countries, including the USA and UK, the proportion of older people with dementia has fallen, particularly among those in socio-economically advantaged areas. The report’s authors say that this decline in people developing dementia is probably in part due to building cognitive and physical resilience over the life course and less vascular damage as a result of improvements in healthcare and lifestyle changes, demonstrating the importance of implementing prevention approaches as early as possible.

Nevertheless, most national dementia plans do not make specific recommendations about diversity, equity, or inclusion of people from underserved cultures and ethnicities who are disproportionately affected by dementia risks.

“Our new report reveals that there is much more that can and should be done to reduce the risk of dementia. It’s never too early or too late to take action, with opportunities to make an impact at any stage of life”, says lead author Professor Gill Livingston from University College London, UK. “We now have stronger evidence that longer exposure to risk has a greater effect and that risks act more strongly in people who are vulnerable. That’s why it is vital that we redouble preventive efforts towards those who need them most, including those in low- and middle-income countries and socio-economically disadvantaged groups. Governments must reduce risk inequalities by making healthy lifestyles as achievable as possible for everyone.”

To reduce dementia risk throughout life, the Commission outlines 13 recommendations to be adopted by governments and individuals, including (see key messages on page 2 of the report for the full list):

Provide all children with good quality education and be cognitively active in midlife.

Make hearing aids available for all those with hearing loss and reduce harmful noise exposure.

Detect and treat high LDL cholesterol in midlife from around age 40 years.

Make screening and treatment for vision impairment accessible to all.

Treat depression effectively.

Wear helmets and head protection in contact sports and on bikes.

Prioritize supportive community environments and housing to increase social contact.

Reduce exposure to air pollution through strict clean air policies.

Expand measures to reduce smoking, such as price control, raising the minimum age of purchase, and smoking bans.

Reduce sugar and salt content in food sold in stores and restaurants.

These actions are especially important given new evidence which shows that reducing the risks of dementia not only increases years of healthy life but also reduces the time people who develop dementia spend in ill health.

As Professor Livingston explains, “Healthy lifestyles that involve regular exercise, not smoking, cognitive activity in midlife (including outside formal education), and avoiding excess alcohol can not only lower dementia risk but may also push back dementia onset. So, if people do develop dementia, they are likely to live fewer years with it. This has huge quality of life implications for individuals as well as cost-saving benefits for societies.”

England could achieve cost savings of around £4 billion

In a separate study published in The Lancet Healthy Longevity journal alongside the Commission, Professor Livingston, lead author Naaheed Mukadam, and co-authors modeled the economic impact of implementing some of these recommendations, using England as an example. The study’s findings suggest that using population-level interventions of known effectiveness to tackle dementia risk factors of excess alcohol use (more than 21 units per week), brain injury, air pollution, smoking, obesity, and high blood pressure could achieve cost savings of more than £4 billion and over 70,000 quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gains (one QALY equates to a year of life in perfect health). The authors stress that potential benefits may be even greater in low- and middle-income countries and any country where population-level interventions such as public smoking bans and compulsory education are not already in place.

“Given the much higher burden of dementia risk factors in low- and middle-income countries with the expected rise in dementia over the next few decades from rapid population aging and increased rates of high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity, we need urgent policy-based preventative approaches that will have huge potential benefits far in excess of the costs,” says report co-author Dr. Cleusa Ferri from Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo and Hospital Alemão Oswaldo Cruz, Sao Paulo Brazil.

Commission co-author Dr. Naaheed Mukadam of University College London adds, “Prioritising population-level approaches that improve primary prevention (eg, reducing salt and sugar intake) and effective health care for conditions like obesity and high blood pressure, restricting smoking and air pollution, and enabling all children to gain a good education, could have a profound effect on dementia prevalence and inequalities, as well as significant cost savings.”

Prioritising advances in research and support for people living with dementia

The report also discusses the hopeful advances in blood biomarkers and the Anti-amyloid β antibodies for Alzheimer’s disease. The authors explain that blood biomarkers are a significant move forward for people with dementia, potentially increasing scalability and decreasing the intrusiveness and the cost of testing for accurate diagnosis. While there are promising clinical trials, the report authors caution that Anti-amyloid β antibody treatments are new, without long-term data available, and call for more research and expanded transparency about the short and long-term side effects.

Finally, the report calls for more support for people living with dementia and their families. The authors stress that in many countries, effective interventions known to benefit people with dementia are still not available or a priority, including activity interventions that provide enjoyment and reduce neuropsychiatric symptoms and cholinesterase inhibitors for slowing cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s. Similarly, many carers’ needs are unevaluated and unmet. They recommend providing multi-component coping interventions for family caregivers who are at risk of depression and anxiety, including providing emotional support, planning for the future, and information on medical and community-based resources.

The authors note that while nearly all the evidence for dementia still comes from high-income countries, there is now more evidence and interventions from LMICs, but interventions usually need to be modified to best support different cultures, beliefs, and environments. They also point out that the prevention estimates assume there is a causal relationship between risk factors and dementia, and while they were careful to only include risk factors with convincing evidence, they note that some associations may only be partly causal. For example, while unremitting depression in midlife may be causal, depression in late life may be caused by dementia. Finally, they note that this risk modification affects the population, and does not guarantee that any individual will avoid dementia.

Nearly half of dementia cases could be avoided or delayed by tackling 14 risk factors.,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/many-dementia-cases-could-prevented-021812192.html,"Many dementia cases could be prevented, but far from all: study

Decades of research have failed to produce a cure or truly effective drug for dementia (SEBASTIEN BOZON)

Millions of cases of dementia could be prevented or delayed by reducing a range of risk factors such as smoking or air pollution, according to a major new study, though outside experts warn that such measures can only go so far.

The debilitating condition, which progressively robs people of their memories, cognitive abilities, language and independence, currently affects more than 55 million people across the world.

Dementia is caused by a range of diseases, the most common of which is Alzheimer's.

A huge review of the available evidence published in The Lancet journal on Wednesday said that the ""potential for prevention is high"" in the fight against dementia.

The study follows a previous report in 2020 that also emphasised the importance of prevention.

At the time, the international team of researchers estimated that 40 percent of dementia cases were linked to 12 risk factors.

The factors included people having a lower level of education, hearing problems, high blood pressure, smoking, obesity, depression, physical inactivity, diabetes, excessive drinking, traumatic brain injury, air pollution and social isolation.

The latest update adds two more risk factors: vision loss and high cholesterol.

""Nearly half of dementias could theoretically be prevented by eliminating these 14 risk factors,"" the study said.

- EU turns down new drug -

Decades of research and billions of dollars have failed to produce a cure or truly effective drug for dementia.

But since the start of last year, two Alzheimer's treatments have been approved in the United States: Biogen's lecanemab and Eli Lilly's donanemab.

They work by targeting the build-up of two proteins -- tau and amyloid beta -- considered to be one of the main ways the disease progresses.

However, the benefits of the drugs remain modest, they have severe side effects, and they are often very expensive.

In contrast to the US, the European Union's medicine watchdog last week refused to approve lecanemab, and it is still considering donanemab.

Some researchers hope the fact that the new drugs work at all means they will pave the way for more effective treatments in the future.

Others prefer to focus on ways to prevent dementia in the first place.

Masud Husain, a neurologist at the UK's University of Oxford, said that focusing on risk factors ""would be far more cost effective than developing high-tech treatments which so far have been disappointing in their impacts on people with established dementia"".

- 'How much more could we do?' -

The Lancet study was welcomed by experts in the field, among whom the importance of prevention is hardly debatable.

However, some said the idea that nearly half of all dementia cases could be prevented should be put in perspective.

It has not been proven that the risk factors directly cause dementia, as the authors of the study acknowledged.

For example, could it be dementia that is causing depression, rather than the other way around?

It is also difficult to separate the risk factors from each other, though the researchers tried.

Some could be intrinsically linked, such as depression and isolation, or smoking and high blood pressure.

Above all, many of the risk factors are societal scourges that have long proven near impossible to fully address.

The study lays out different recommendations ranging from the personal -- such as wearing a helmet while cycling -- to governmental, such as improving access to education.

""It is not clear whether we could ever completely eliminate any of these risk factors,"" Charles Marshall, a neurologist at Queen Mary University of London, told AFP.

""We already have public health programmes to reduce smoking and hypertension (high blood pressure), so how much more could we do?""

Tara Spires-Jones, a neuroscientist at the University of Edinburgh, said it was important that ""we do not blame people living with dementia for their brain disease"".

That is because ""it is clear that a large portion of dementias could not be prevented due to genes and things beyond people's control, like opportunities for education as children"", she added.

Officials have been sent to the region – including Lebanon – to provide additional support to embassy staff as part of government’s preparatory planning for a range of possible conflict scenarios, and with regional tensions rising.

Consular experts will assist with strategic planning and responding to enquiries from British nationals to make sure they get the help and advice they need, and Border Force has deployed officers who stand ready to aid consular operations.

With the potential for exit routes out of Lebanon – including roads – being affected, limited, or closed, due to events escalating with little warning, teams will continue to urge British nationals to leave while commercial options remain available.

Military personnel are also in the process of deploying to the region to provide Embassies with operational support to help British nationals. This is alongside Landing ship RFA Cardigan Bay and HMS Duncan already being in the eastern Mediterranean to support allies with humanitarian requirements, with the Royal Air Force also putting transport helicopters on standby.

Foreign Secretary, David Lammy, said:

Tensions are high, and the situation could deteriorate rapidly. While we are working round the clock to strengthen our consular presence in Lebanon, my message to British nationals there is clear – leave now.

A widening of this conflict is in nobody’s interest – the consequences could be catastrophic. That’s why we continue to call for de-escalation and a diplomatic solution.

The deployment of additional staff to the region follows the Foreign Secretary and Defence Secretary visiting the Middle East, including Lebanon this week, where the pair stressed the need to de-escalate tensions and pushed calls for peace and stability.

Defence Secretary, John Healey, said:

Our Armed Forces will always step up to support British citizens around the world and reinforce regional stability with their professionalism and bravery.

As I told leaders in the Middle East this week, de-escalation must be the primary focus in the region, and we are urging all to dial down tensions. There must be an end to the fighting, an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages, and a diplomatic path to peace and security."

"Gen X and millennials have greater risk of developing more than a dozen cancers, study finds.",https://sg.news.yahoo.com/white-paper-womens-development-proposals-freeze-eggs-014654905.html,"White Paper on Women’s Development: 25 proposals, such as allowing more to freeze their eggs

SINGAPORE — The White Paper on Singapore's Women’s Development, which outlines the government's plans to improve the lives of women, was released on Monday (28 March) with proposals for 25 action plans in five key areas.

Among the plans is a proposal to allow women aged 21 to 35 to freeze their eggs regardless of marital status. Only legally-married couples will then be able to use the frozen eggs for procreation.

Currently, egg freezing in Singapore is permitted only for medical reasons, such as conditions where the treatment is known to affect fertility, or when they require the removal of ovaries and fallopian tubes.

“The Government supports and encourages Singaporeans to pursue their marriage and parenthood aspirations as early as possible,” said Sun Xueling, Minister of State for Social and Family Development.

“But we recognise through the conversations that there are women who worry that they are not able to find a suitable partner when they are young, but they wish to have the chance to conceive and to start a family when they marry later.”

Elective egg freezing will be implemented with the introduction of the Assisted Reproduction Services Regulations under the Healthcare Services Act in early 2023.

Fair employment practices, flexible work arrangements

Other key proposals in the White Paper include: enshrining the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices in law, introducing new set of Tripartite Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangements by 2024, and doubling the Home Caregiving Grant for beneficiaries from lower-income households.

The government noted in the White Paper that 13 per cent of Singapore companies were helmed by a female chief executive officer in 2021, and more women have taken on leadership roles.

However, women still face disadvantages, and Singapore should strengthen its laws to address unfair employment practices.

INFOGRAPHIC: REACH

The White Paper proposes that the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices be enshrined in law. It will protect the confidentiality of those who come forward and protect them from retaliation, and require workplaces to put in place grievance handling processes.

The government also aims to create a workplace norm where employees feel that it is acceptable to request flexible work arrangements, while maintaining the employers’ prerogative to accept or reject requests based on their business needs.

It aims to increase the adoption of the voluntary Tripartite Standard on Flexible Work Arrangements by employers to 40 per cent by the end of 2022, up from the current 27 per cent.

The White Paper also seeks to recognise the contributions of caregivers and supporting their efforts. It is proposing that the Home Caregiving Grant should be doubled from $200 to $400 for lower-income households.

Increasing penalties for 3 sexual offences

In revising the sentencing framework for sexual and hurt offences, Singapore has increased the penalties for three sexual offences in the Penal Code, including outrage of modesty and exploitation of minors.

The government will also enhance protection for survivors of family violence, and raise awareness and accessibility of resources for victims of online harms and workplace harassments. A new national framework to promote safe sport will be set up too.

The Women's Charter has been updated to better reflect women's equal status to men in marriage. Meanwhile, gender stereotypes about careers as well as equity of familial roles will be addressed through education.

INFOGRAPHIC: REACH

The White Paper also proposes a public garden, which will be dedicated to honouring and celebrating the pioneering spirit of Singapore women.

The government has proposed that the 25 action plans are to be implemented over 10 years, and a mid-point review to be conducted in 2027.

"Gen X and millennials have greater risk of developing more than a dozen cancers, study finds.",https://www.inventiva.co.in/trends/cancer-is-targeting-young-folks/,"A new study undertaken by researchers at the American Cancer Society discovered that Generation X (Gen X) and millennials are more likely than previous generations to get 17 types of cancers. Notably, those 17 include gastric cardia, small intestine, oestrogen receptor-positive breast, ovary, liver, and intrahepatic bile duct in women, non-HPV-associated oral and pharynx cancers in women, anus, colon and rectal, uterine corpus, gallbladder and other biliary, kidney and renal pelvis, pancreas, myeloma, non-cardia gastric, testis, leukaemia, and, in men, Kaposi sarcoma, which affects the lining of blood vessels and lymph vessels.

The researchers discovered that obesity is linked to 10 of the 17 that are becoming more common in younger birth cohorts. The researchers also discovered that death rates increased in increasingly younger generations, as did the incidence rates of liver cancer in women, uterine corpus, gallbladder, testicular, colon, and rectal cancer.

According to a Financial Times analysis of data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington School of Medicine, published last year, cancer rates in the G20 group of industrialised nations have risen faster for 25- to 29-year-olds than for any other age group over the last three decades, by 22% between 1990 and 2019. Rates for 20- to 34-year-olds in these nations have reached their highest level in 30 years. In contrast, incidences in older age groups (those over 75) have decreased since their peak in about 2005.

Talking about the Indian context, how are different parameters responsible for the rise of cancer among younger generations?

Food, Lifestyle and Obesity- The well-known silent killers.

Researchers offer a less definite explanation for why people in their prime appear to be significantly more susceptible to cancers than previous generations. Scientists looking for answers are increasingly convinced that changes in nutrition and lifestyle that began in the middle of the past century hold at least part of the solution.

Since 1990, the majority of the rise in early-onset cancers has been in breast, colon, esophageal, kidney, liver, and pancreatic cancer. Eight of the 14 cancers on the increase are digestive system-related. For example, between 1990 and 2019, colorectal cancer rates climbed by 70% among those aged 15 to 39 in G20 countries. Increasing research suggests that consuming ultra-processed meals, especially those rich in saturated fat and sugar, is one of the probable causes of compromised gut health.

The core issue is that the food we consume is frequently severely processed while remaining economical, simple, long-lasting, and pleasing to our taste senses. However, it is virtually probably hazardous for our health. And this is increasingly true for children. Highly processed foods such as processed breakfast cereals, processed shop bread, ready dinners, frozen pizzas, processed supermarket sandwiches, and processed cookies, doughnuts, and chocolates have become staples.

India’s ultra-processed food sector has seen explosive growth, One of the highest rates globally, from 2011 to 2021. In 2011, ultra-processed foods accounted for 43% of total processed food retail sales, rising to 36% by 2021. The expected percentage is 39% by 2032. Ultra-processed foods have varying sizes and growth rates across five major groups. Chocolate and sugar confectionery had the highest retail sales value between 2011 and 2021, followed by ready-made and convenience foods. In 2019, beverages ranked third, but by 2021, salty snacks had risen to third place.

In 2021, sweet biscuits dominated the chocolate and sugar confectionery sector, accounting for nearly 43% of retail sales value. Consumers may be unaware of the detrimental effects of sugary biscuits. They are inexpensive, easy to store, have a long shelf life, and are commonly consumed as an impulsive snack. Still, if you do not believe in statistics, go to any supermarket around you, and you will see how the sector dominates the ultra-processed food market.

One prime example is the case of Bournvita, which has a high amount of sugar and was marketed and sold earlier as a health drink. Another case could be Nestle, which was charged with adding extra sugar to baby foods in certain countries.

Now, because of the increase in Ultra-processed foods, obesity is also on the rise, which is said to be another cause of cancer. Obesity may raise a person’s chance of developing specific cancers. Obese children tend to carry their weight into adulthood. That means that young individuals today have a greater cumulative lifetime exposure to body fat than previous generations. Excess body weight during young adulthood may raise the chance of developing certain cancers later in life. Excess body weight is a proven carcinogen associated with over a dozen cancers. However, it is unknown how fat may raise the risk of cancer, which requires further studies.

The dangerous lure of tobacco.

Tobacco remains “the primary cause of lung cancer,” and the disease may be substantially avoided by strong tobacco control laws and regulations. According to India’s Global Youth Tobacco Survey 2019, the prevalence of tobacco use among school-age children aged 13 to 15 is 8.4%. Surprisingly, the study results suggest that 11.4% of youngsters start smoking cigarettes before their seventh birthday, 17.2% start smoking bidi, and 24% start using smokeless tobacco products such as gutkha, khaini, and zarda. Although tobacco is not the only cause of lung cancer, the alarming rise in the use of tobacco is dangerous for the nation.

In addition, pollution and other airborne environmental exposures are likely to raise the incidence of lung cancer in many regions of the world. Efforts to promote clean air or limit exposure to airborne pollutants are also very essential to consider. This pathetic and urgent need for clean air can be noticed by the fact that Delhi was the world’s most polluted capital city in 2023. This shows how young Indians who daily commute to offices are exposed to detrimental air pollutants, which, in turn, could be one of the probable causes of cancer.

The demographic cohort.

Women now have fewer children, and at a later age, thus they spend less time breastfeeding than prior generations. Having a bigger family, which often results in a lengthier duration of breastfeeding, and giving birth for the first time at a young age are both known to provide protection against breast cancer. These modifications offer numerous benefits for women but also put them at a higher risk of breast cancer.

So what can be the probable solutions to these problems?

The growth in early-onset cancer is more than just an issue for healthcare systems. It also causes economic problems. According to studies, those who survive the disease are more likely to have long-term diseases such as infertility, cardiovascular disease, and secondary cancers, potentially increasing future healthcare costs. If the cancer tendency continues to get younger under prey, the economic cost will be even larger since we are losing individuals of working age who can contribute to growth. Cancer survivors may not be able to regain their prior production levels. “As a result, it will lower both quantity and quality of labour.

India, being advantaged by the demographic dividend, needs to be cautious as the people who are supposed to contribute to the economy and growth of the nation are not supposed to come under the umbrella of cancer and other life-threatening diseases.

Economic Survey 2024 also highlighted the increase in screen time and sedentary habits. According to the survey, India’s working-age population requires skills and good health in order to be gainfully employed. However, social media, screen time, sedentary habits, and unhealthy food are a lethal combination that can undermine public health and productivity, as well as India’s economic potential.

This increase in cancer incidence among young people will continue unless strong efforts and leadership are taken to ensure that populations enjoy longer, healthier lives. This should include healthy food alternatives in the market and make people literate about the product and their ingredients. Mr Revant Himatsingha, popularly known as the ‘food Pharmer’, has taken the initiative of calling companies against their deceptive marketing practices and making India literate about reading food labels and choosing healthier alternatives.

Also, many times, doctors, while diagnosing patients in their 20s and 30s, do not consider advising them for a cancer test, thinking that this age is not the case for cancer patients. So, some healthcare professionals think that it is equally important to note that cancers frequently progress to a more advanced state in younger people before being discovered. They believe doctors should be on the lookout for cancer among people in their twenties or thirties, realising that this is no longer an unlikely scenario. On the other hand, citizens should be aware and teach themselves about the symptoms of an incoming cancer.

Social media is filled with pieces of advice on ‘how to spot red flags in relationships’; following the trend, medical professionals, through their social media accounts, can teach their audiences about the ‘red flags’ of cancers and other diseases. In the end, if we want to beat the cancer and want to save our generation from this monster ‘cancer’, then a collective approach by the medical professionals, politicians and we as citizens need to be adopted, or we will lose the game to cancer. Take the call before it’s too late!"
F.D.A. Approves Blood Test for Colon Cancer Detection.,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/new-colorectal-cancer-blood-test-approved-by-fda-what-to-know,"Share on Pinterest What does the newly approved blood test for colorectal cancer screening mean for people in the U.S.? Image credit: Anchiy/Getty Images. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently approved a blood test that can assist in the primary detection of colorectal cancer.

This test could assist with prompt detection and intervention for this prevalent cancer type. Doctors and specialists can offer appropriate guidance for people who would most benefit from it.

Currently, the test is not covered by Medicare, but this could change in the future, as well as potential coverage from private health insurance groups. Colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer in the world. It can sometimes be challenging to treat, making early detection and diagnosis critical. However, screening options like colonoscopies can be uncomfortable and difficult for people to do. Research is ongoing about different tests that can help detect colorectal cancer to ensure the best possible health outcomes. Recent steps suggest that options for colorectal cancer screening are continuing to expand.

Why did the FDA approve the new colon cancer blood test? On July 29, 2024, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a blood test that can help with primary colorectal cancer screening. The test is Guardant Health’s Shield blood test, and the approval is a critical step towards making it available to the general population. The approval came after a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in March 2024. The study noted that over a third of people who are eligible for colorectal cancer screening are not up to date with screening. It looked at data from almost 8,000 participants, and found that this blood test was just over 83% successful at detecting colorectal cancer. William M. Grady, MD, professor of translational science and therapeutics division at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center, and one of the authors of this study, explained a little more about the test to Medical News Today: “The Shield blood test is a screening test for colorectal cancer that is as accurate as the most commonly used stool-based test, FIT, for detecting colorectal cancer. It has a false negative rate of 13% and a false positive rate of roughly 10%. It detects 13% of advanced colon adenomas, which are the precursors to colorectal cancer.” “The Shield test is an option for colorectal cancer screening and is more convenient than doing the other recommended screening tests, FIT, Cologuard, and colonoscopy. However, it is not as accurate as colonoscopy or Cologuard for detecting advanced colon adenomas or CRC and is not as accurate as FIT for detecting advanced colon adenomas,” he added.

Who is this blood test for? Specific screening recommendations for colorectal cancer can vary. However, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that most adults begin colorectal cancer screening at age 45. Different testing options include different analyses of stool samples, flexible sigmoidoscopies, and colonoscopies. People can work with their doctors and other specialists to determine their risk for colorectal cancer and their screening needs. This newly approved primary screening blood test is for adults who are 45 years old or older, and have an average risk for colorectal cancer. Grady explained that “the Shield test is an appropriate screening test for those people who understand the lower accuracy of the test compared to the other available screening tests and who are at average risk of colorectal cancer.”

How does this blood test work? People who get this test just need to get a blood draw, which is typically straightforward and similar to other lab work that is already a part of clinical practice. As the previously referenced study noted, the test is a cell-free DNA blood-based test. This type of analysis looks at non-cellular DNA in the blood sample. People interested in this test can speak with their doctors to see if this testing option is a good choice for them. Uri Ladabaum, MD, MS, professor of medicine, and director of the GI Cancer Prevention Program at Stanford University School of Medicine, who was not involved in this study, offered some words of caution about colorectal cancer screening options, and where this test fits on the spectrum of options: “Colonoscopy and stool tests are better than Guardant Shield at detecting pre-cancerous polyps, and they are expected to be better than Guardant Shield at preventing people from getting or dying from colorectal cancer. Patients and doctors should weigh the expected benefits of the various options vs. the ease of use

when making individualized, informed decisions. Patients must understand that a ‘positive’ (abnormal) stool test or Shield test must be followed by a colonoscopy in order to maximize the chances of finding cancer at a curable stage, or of removing polyps before they become cancer.”

Blood test provides less invasive screening alternative This test gives clinicians one more option to present to people who are seeking out options to screen for colorectal cancer. This could help improve survival rates among people with colorectal cancer, as colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death. This recently approved blood test could help close current gaps in colorectal cancer screening, particularly because of high patient adherence levels. Since the test causes minimal discomfort, people might be more willing to get this test and thus be more on top of colorectal cancer screening. Anton Bilchik, MD, PhD, a surgical oncologist, chief of medicine, and director of the Gastrointestinal and Hepatobiliary Program at Providence Saint John’s Cancer Institute in Santa Monica, CA, who was not involved in the research on this test, noted that: “Colorectal cancer is one of the most rapidly growing cancers in young people today. In fact, it is the leading cause of cancer related deaths in males younger than 40. Many people, especially younger patients are reluctant to do screening colonoscopies or home-based stool tests. This offers a simple alternative to detecting colon cancer at a curable stage.”"
F.D.A. Approves Blood Test for Colon Cancer Detection.,https://fcfreepresspa.com/fda-approves-first-blood-test-for-colon-cancer-screening/,"U.S. health regulators have approved the first blood test for colon cancer, a significant step in cancer screening. The test, called Shield, is manufactured by Guardant and has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adults aged 45 and older with an average risk of colon cancer.

The Shield test offers a noninvasive alternative to colonoscopies, though it is not intended to replace them. It detects DNA fragments shed by tumor cells and precancerous growths. In a study published in March, the test identified 83% of cancers but detected very few precancerous growths compared to colonoscopy, which remains the gold standard for colon cancer screening. The Shield test missed 17% of cancers, performing similarly to stool-based tests.

Doctors can currently order the Shield test for patients at an out-of-pocket cost of $895. FDA approval is expected to lead to broader coverage by private and government insurance plans.

Colonoscopies are crucial as they not only detect tumors but also prevent the disease by removing precancerous polyps. However, many people avoid colonoscopies due to the inconvenience of taking time off work and the preparation required the day before the procedure, which involves drinking a strong laxative to empty the bowels.

In the U.S., it is recommended that healthy adults aged 45 to 75 with an average risk of colon cancer undergo regular screening."

The FDA has approved a new blood test that can be used to detect colon cancer. Doctors say this blood test can reduce the number of colonoscopies and increase screening rates.

The Shield test, the first of its kind for colon cancer, uses DNA in the blood to screen for the disease.

""Some of these fragments of DNA that are unique to colon cancer released in the blood can now be detected by a blood test,” said Dr. Harvey Tatum, a gastroenterologist at the Utica Park Clinic.

Tatum says the test can be administered during a routine health screening.

""We will do many unnecessary colonoscopies on people that don't have any risk or very small polyps that have low risk of progressing,” said Tatum. “If we can find the patients that have high-risk polyps or colon cancer markers, we can perform fewer colonoscopies but have more value because we do them on people who really need them.""

Studies show the test is about 83% accurate, meaning if you have colon cancer or an advanced polyp, there is an 83% chance the test will be positive and a 17% chance it will be negative.

""Any test we do for a screening has the chance to be falsely positive or falsely negative,” said Tatum. “The value of this test is it seems to have a high level of accuracy for detecting cancer, as opposed to just finding blood in the stool.""

Tatum says the only way to prevent colon cancer is still to remove polyps during a colonoscopy before they become cancerous. However, this test is a valuable tool in deciding whether to get a colonoscopy. ""Colon cancer is preventable,” said Tatum. “As part of your routine health screening, in addition to things like cholesterol and blood pressure, this should be part of the routine screening starting at age 45.”

Doctors recommend everyone aged 45 and older get screened for colon cancer. Tatum notes it’s still unclear when this test will be available to the public as it awaits insurance approval, but it’s a good conversation to have with your doctor."
F.D.A. Approves Blood Test for Colon Cancer Detection.,https://www.progress.org.uk/fda-approves-cell-free-dna-test-for-colon-cancer/,"A new blood test to detect colon cancer has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The new test, called Shield, has been approved for use in adults who are aged 45 or older and at an average risk of colon cancer. The test is not designed to replace colonoscopies, which are the most accurate way of detecting colon cancer, but it does offer a new way to help screen people for early signs of colon cancer.

'The persistent gap in colorectal cancer screening rates shows that the existing screening options do not appeal to millions of people,' said gastroenterologist Professor Daniel Chung, from Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. 'With increased screening rates and early cancer detection, many more lives can be saved.'

Cancer cells and healthy cells shed DNA into the blood, which is known as cell-free DNA (cfDNA). The Shield test is a type of 'liquid biopsy' that can detect cfDNA shed by colon cancer cells.

The approval of the test follows a recent clinical trial that assessed the accuracy of Shield in detecting colon cancer. Published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the results of the trial showed the Shield test detected 83 percent of patients with colon cancer, and about ten percent of people without cancer also received a positive result, which could be cleared up with a colonoscopy.

'People have to understand that a positive Shield test requires a colonoscopy to confirm that you have an advanced lesion or colorectal cancer, or that the results were false,' said Dr Robert Smith, senior vice president of early cancer detection science at the American Cancer Society told NBC News. 'A test like this is not complete if it’s positive and you have not had a colonoscopy.'

Colon cancer is the third most common cancer among adults in the United States, and there has been an increase in the number of people who are younger than 55 being diagnosed with colon cancer. It is thought that early detection could prevent over 90 percent of colon cancer-related deaths. Despite the importance of early diagnosis, only around 60 percent of eligible people attend their recommended colon cancer screening."

F.D.A. Approves Blood Test for Colon Cancer Detection.,https://www.progress.org.uk/natural-insemination-sperm-donor-named-parent-on-birth-certificate/,"A UK court decision to name a sperm donor a child's legal parent, rather than the mother's wife has been upheld, because the mother secretly had sexual intercourse with the donor.

The case concerned the legal parentage of 'X', a six-year-old girl, born as a result of an 'informal conception arrangement' between the two women 'P' and 'Q' and sperm donor 'F'. They agreed to use artificial insemination (AI) but after two failed attempts P and F had sexual intercourse involving natural insemination –unknown to Q – which coincided with a third AI attempt. This was not revealed until P and Q divorced and disagreed over the care of the child, when P secured a court declaration in April naming F as the child's legal parent.

In the original court ruling, Mrs Justice Gwynneth Knowles declared the case 'a cautionary tale about the consequences for a child and for a same-sex couple of both deceit as to how that child came to be conceived and the unreliability of informal arrangements for AI,' adding that 'the fallout from this couple's separation has been devastating for each of them and for their named sperm donor.'

Justice Knowles concluded that Q had not consented to sexual intercourse between P and F, and because the method of the child's conception was 'unclear', Q could not be considered a parent per the provisions of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (HFE) Act 2008 which grants parentage to the wives or civil partners of women who give birth following AI.

Q appealed against the decision to replace her with F on the child's birth certificate. However, a three judge panel in the Court of Appeal of England and Wales upheld the original ruling, on the basis that because F was the genetic father and because Q had not proved that the provisions of the HFE Act 2008 on AI applied the court had to declare paternity in F's favour.

'Notwithstanding Q's commitment to X, her understood status as a legal parent arose from informal arrangements, with all their inherent risks', said Lord Justice Peter Jackson in the judgment. 'X exists because P and Q wanted her, and F was at that time no more than a means to an end. It may therefore seem strange that her parentage should be determined by the way in which she was conceived but, in this area, a line must be drawn somewhere'.

The judgment noted that F, P and Q had all obtained parental responsibility after a separate welfare hearing took place."
F.D.A. Approves Blood Test for Colon Cancer Detection.,https://www.wglt.org/local-news/2024-08-05/bloomington-doctor-colon-cancer-blood-test-will-be-a-paradigm-shift,"A Bloomington doctor is optimistic a newly-approved blood test for colorectal cancer will encourage more people to get screened.

The federal Food and Drug Administration [FDA] has given the green light for the test, designed for individuals aged 45 and older who are at average risk of the disease.

Colorectal cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States.

In this edition of WGLT's Sound Health, Dr. Omar Khokar, a gastroenterologist at Illinois Gastro Health in Bloomington, thinks the test will enhance early detection efforts.

“The blood test that we now have performed equivalently to the stool-based test. What I mean is it was comparable in detecting what it should detect and not picking up what it shouldn't,” Khokar said.

He calls the new blood test a liquid biopsy, adding precancerous lesions in an individual's colon could potentially start to shed abnormal DNA fragments in the individual's blood — and that is what the blood test would look for.

courtesy Omar Kohkar

Khokar noted the blood test does not replace the more intensive colonoscopy procedure. He said the blood test is less accurate than the colonoscopy, which he said will remain the ""gold standard"" for testing.

He likened the new blood test to a PSA test for prostate cancer in terms of early screening reliability.

""They are good, they are not great. It's exciting. I think it's going to be a process. In the next 5 to 10 years, colon cancer screening will be a paradigm shift for an average risk person,"" he said. ""It's really up to the patient to decide how much risk they are willing to live with.""

The new blood tests are expected to be commercially available within a few weeks, providing a fresh tool for health care providers to recommend to patients.

The FDA recommends getting the blood test every three years starting at age 45.

“It is likely the FDA's approval will lead to Medicare coverage for the test, and then provide coverage for the test,” Khokar explained, anticipating broader access to the screening method.

Khokar hopes this approach will help bridge the gap for those hesitant to undergo traditional procedures like colonoscopies, noting many people seem to avoid getting a colonoscopy every 10 years.

""If we could capture people who are quote, unquote busy, who are quote, unquote invincible, people who live in the rural areas, people who logistically it's difficult — they don't have a driver — that's where these blood and stool tests are a very useful surrogate,"" he said.

Khokar said it's still unclear how frequent patients would need colonoscopies if they continue to to produce clean blood tests."

AzmanL/Getty Images People who use aspirin regularly have a lower risk of colorectal cancer compared to those who don’t use aspirin regularly, a new study shows.

The benefits were greatest for people with an unhealthy lifestyle, such as moderate or heavy smokers, and those with overweight or obesity.

People with the healthiest lifestyle — whether or not they used aspirin regularly — had a lower risk of colorectal cancer compared to people with the unhealthiest lifestyle who used aspirin. In the United States, an estimated 152,810 people will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 2024, with more than 53,000 deaths this year due to this cancer, according to the National Cancer Institute. While rates of colorectal cancer in the country declined by about 1% each year from 2011 to 2019, this has been mostly in older adults, the American Cancer Society (ACS) reports. In contrast, ACS said rates among people under 55 years old have increased by 1% to 2% since the mid-1990s. Genetics plays a role in the development of colorectal cancer. For example, people whose parent, sibling or child had colorectal cancer are at an increased risk. However, lifestyle factors can also increase a person’s risk of colorectal cancer, including having overweight or obesity, having type 2 diabetes, eating an unhealthy diet, smoking tobacco, and drinking alcohol. Now researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School have found that regular aspirin use may lower colorectal cancer risk in people with unhealthy lifestyles. The study was published Aug. 1 in JAMA Oncology .

Mixed evidence on the anticancer effects of aspirin Previous research showed that regular aspirin use can lower the risk of colorectal cancer. In 2016, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended low dose aspirin for colorectal cancer prevention in adults ages 50 to 59. However, in 2022, the USPSTF withdrew its recommendation , citing a lack of evidence showing that aspirin reduces a person’s chance of developing or dying from colorectal cancer. Long-term use of aspirin can also cause gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcers and other complications. Given that some earlier research showed that aspirin reduced the risk of colorectal cancer, the authors of the new study decided to look at whether this benefit was higher for people with certain lifestyle factors. For the study, they examined data from more than 107,000 people who participated in the Nurses’ Health Study or the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. The average age of participants was 49 years. They were all health professionals, and most were white. Additional research would be needed in more diverse populations to see if the results would be the same. Researchers followed participants for more than three decades. During this time, participants completed surveys about five lifestyle factors: body mass index (BMI), whether they smoked tobacco or used alcohol, and their physical activity and diet. Participants also reported on their use of aspirin or other medications and whether they developed any diseases during the study period, including colorectal cancer. Researchers defined regular aspirin use as two or more standard-dose tablets per week or six or more low-dose tablets per week.

Aspirin lowers colon cancer risk for adults with unhealthy lifestyles Overall, the risk of developing colorectal cancer over a 10-year period was 1.98% among participants who used aspirin regularly, compared with 2.95% for people who didn’t use aspirin regularly. When comparing these two groups, researchers found that regular users of aspirin had an 18% lower relative risk of being diagnosed with colorectal cancer, compared with people who didn’t use aspirin or used it less often. Participants with unhealthier lifestyles benefitted the most from regular aspirin use in terms of lowering their relative risk of colorectal cancer. The greatest benefits occurred for moderate or heavy smokers and people with a BMI of 25 or greater. BMI is a screening measure for having overweight or obesity. Generally, a healthy weight for adults 20 years and older is a BMI of 18.5 to less than 25. However, BMI is not always reliable during pregnancy or for athletes or older adults. The study also showed that people with healthier lifestyles benefitted from regular aspirin use, but less so. It also reinforces the overall benefits of a healthy lifestyle. People with the healthiest lifestyle — whether or not they used aspirin regularly — had a lower 10-year risk of colorectal cancer compared to regular aspirin users with the unhealthiest lifestyle. The study does not show how regular aspirin use might help. Still, the authors point to previous research suggesting that aspirin may inhibit pro-inflammatory signals contributing to cancer growth. Given the risks of long-term use of aspirin — such as gastrointestinal bleeding — the authors write that “these results support the use of lifestyle risk factors to identify individuals who may have a more favorable risk-benefit profile for cancer prevention with aspirin.”

A growing need for personalized medicine Wael Harb, MD, a hematologist and medical oncologist at MemorialCare Cancer Institute at Orange Coast and Saddleback Medical Centers in Orange County, CA, said the new study’s results might prompt the US Preventive Services Task Force to reconsider the regular use of aspirin for the prevention of colorectal cancer. Harb wasn’t involved in the study. However, Jason Zell, DO, MPH, a hematology-oncology specialist at the UCI Health Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center and associate professor at the UCI School of Medicine, questions whether the study is strong enough to change the USPSTF recommendations. Zell was likewise not involved in the study. This was not a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that compared people who took aspirin to those who didn’t. “As such, this level of evidence is insufficient to change USPSTF recommendations,” he said. In addition, “the USPSTF withdrew its recommendations for aspirin use — which was limited to a very small portion of the population anyway — in part due to complications such as bleeding,” Zell said. The new study did not provide data on how many people taking aspirin regularly had bleeding or other complications, he said. This information could influence the assessment of the risks and benefits of regular aspirin use in people with unhealthy lifestyles. Overall, “while this level of evidence is not enough to change physician recommendations about aspirin, it certainly could spawn more detailed future research,” Zell said, such as that “related to the benefits and risks of regular aspirin use in those with varying degrees of healthy or unhealthy lifestyles.” Harb thinks the study, which implies that aspirin’s preventive benefits may vary based on individual lifestyle factors, “could lead to more personalized recommendations from physicians.” Anton Bilchik, MD, PhD, surgical oncologist, chief of medicine and director of the Gastrointestinal and Hepatobiliary Program at Providence Saint John’s Cancer Institute in Santa Monica, CA, agreed. Bilchik wasn’t involved in the study. “This study shows that taking two regular aspirins a week reduces the risk of getting colon cancer,” he said. “It also identifies groups of patients — particularly those that are obese or smokers — who are more likely to benefit from aspirin.”

Ask you doctor about daily aspirin use Bilchik emphasizes that patients who are concerned about their risk of colorectal cancer should talk with their doctor before starting to take aspirin regularly. “Although aspirin is a very safe drug, there is group of patients that may be at higher risk of gastrointestinal bleeding,” he said. “It’s not a common side effect of aspirin, but no one should routinely take two large aspirins a week without consulting their doctor.” When they do, they should also ask about other ways to reduce their cancer risk. “This study adds to the growing body of evidence on the importance of diet and lifestyle modifications in preventing colorectal cancer,” Zell said. These kinds of lifestyle changes can reduce your risk of other types of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and other health problems, pointed out Harb, which is why doctors always recommend that patients reduce these risk factors. However, “in reality, even with our best efforts, some of these factors might not be modifiable, or people might not be able to change them,” he said. “So in the interim, while we’re trying to change this behavior, it’s reasonable to consider regular aspirin use as way to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, he said."

Approves Blood Test for Colon Cancer Detection.,https://www.foxnews.com/health/17-cancer-types-more-common-gen-x-millennials-study-finds-alarming-trend,"Certain types of cancers are more prevalent among Gen X and millennials, according to a new study led by the American Cancer Society (ACS).

The study, published in the journal The Lancet Public Health, analyzed data from over 23 million patients who were diagnosed with 34 different types of cancer over two decades.

The patients ranged in age from 25 to 84, representing multiple generations.

RISKS, SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENTS FOR LUNG CANCER, THE DEADLIEST CANCER IN THE WORLD

Researchers found that the prevalence of small intestine cancer, kidney cancer and pancreatic cancer was two to three times higher in those born in 1990 than those born in 1955 for both males and females, and for liver cancer in females, according to an ACS press release.

Rates were also higher among younger groups for breast cancer (estrogen-receptor positive), uterine cancer, colorectal cancer, non-cardia gastric cancer, gallbladder cancer, ovarian cancer, testicular cancer, anal cancer in males and Kaposi sarcoma in males, the study found.

Other cancers that were more prevalent in younger groups included myeloma, leukemia, cardia gastric cancer, and non-HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer (in women).

ASPIRIN MAY BE LINKED TO LOWER RISK OF COLORECTAL CANCER, NEW STUDY SUGGESTS

Death rates also rose among younger groups for liver cancer (females), gallbladder cancer, uterine cancer, testicular cancer and colorectal cancer .

""These findings add to growing evidence of increased cancer risk in post-baby boomer generations, expanding on previous findings of early-onset colorectal cancer and a few obesity-associated cancers to encompass a broader range of cancer types,"" said Dr. Hyuna Sung, lead author of the study and a senior principal scientist of surveillance and health equity science at the American Cancer Society, in the ACS release.

""Birth cohorts, groups of people classified by their birth year, share unique social, economic, political and climate environments, which affect their exposure to cancer risk factors during their crucial developmental years.""

While researchers have identified some cancer trends associated with certain age groups, they don’t yet have a clear explanation for why these rates are rising, Sung added.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE DETECTS CANCER WITH 25% GREATER ACCURACY THAN DOCTORS IN UCLA STUDY

Cancer has historically been associated with aging , yet doctors have seen an ""alarming trend"" of surging cases among those under 50 years of age, according to Edward S. Kim, M.D., the physician-in-chief of City of Hope Orange County and vice physician-in-chief of City of Hope National Medical Center in California.

""It is vital that we identify the reasons behind this trend.""

""This latest trend indicating increases in early onset cancer is a paradigm shift,"" Kim, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital via email.

""It is vital that we identify the reasons behind this trend, educate the public, advance prevention and early diagnosis, and develop more effective treatments.""

There is ""considerable evidence"" pointing to environmental causes of early-onset cancers, according to Kim.

""We cannot deny that an extensive range of environmental factors have rapidly transformed in developed countries since the mid-20th century,"" he said.

FDA APPROVES NEW BLOOD TEST FOR COLON CANCER SCREENING: ‘EARLY DETECTION IS CRITICAL’

While controlling these factors can be difficult, Kim said, modifications to diet and lifestyle could make a substantial impact — particularly when implemented in youth and early adulthood.

""Caring for our gut’s microbiome — the internal mechanism responsible for absorption of vitamins, regulation of the immune system, and assistance with food digestion – is essential,"" he said.

To ensure a healthy microbiome, the doctor recommends avoiding ultra-processed foods, exercising to prevent obesity, and avoiding smoking and alcohol consumption.

It is also important for health care providers to make cancer screening options more accessible for younger people, Kim said.

""All too often, primary care physicians may not recommend early screenings, because cancer has traditionally been associated with older ages and the screening guidelines have focused on age-based strategies,"" he said.

""Expanding cancer research efforts focused on younger individuals is another critical area for improvement,"" Kim added.

The ACS also calls for access to ""affordable, comprehensive health insurance "" for younger generations to increase screening rates.

The incidence of cancer among people under age 50 around the world is projected to increase by 31% by 2030, studies have shown.

""There is an epidemic of young people being diagnosed with cancer occurring right in front of us, and unless we implement some urgent interventions, I fear we will continue to observe more young people with cancer over the next decade,"" Kim said.

""We cannot wait that long.""

F.D.A. Approves Blood Test for Colon Cancer Detection.,https://www.enidlive.com/health/red-cross-declares-emergency-blood-shortage-after-national-inventory-falls-by-25-in-july,"(NEW YORK) — The American Red Cross said Monday that it is experiencing an emergency blood shortage, and extreme heat may be partly to blame.

In a press release, the organization said its national blood inventory fell by more than 25% since July 1.

Rolling heat waves and record temperatures have impacted more than 100 drives in the last month in every state where the Red Cross collects blood. This has led to drives ending early or being canceled and fewer people donating and has contributed to a shortfall of more than 19,000 donations in July, based on projected hospital need, according to the Red Cross.

This is in addition to other factors that typically limit blood donations during the summer, such as travel and seasonal activities, the group said.

The Red Cross also suspects that August also will threaten replenishment of the available blood supply due to the start of peak Atlantic hurricane season, which often leads to flooding and power outages that can cancel blood drives and otherwise lead to low donor turnout.

The Red Cross said it supplies about 40% of the nation’s blood donations.

“When we start to have a shortfall in donations that has a really significant impact,” Dr. Baia Lasky, division chief medical officer for the Red Cross, told ABC News. ” This time of year is challenging for us. The demand for blood is constant throughout the year whether its trauma patients, cancer patients.”

Donors with Type O blood are the most needed right now, according to the Red Cross, for two reasons. Type O is the most common blood type, meaning that most people in need of blood will need type O blood.

Secondly, those with an O negative blood type are so-called “universal donors,” meaning their donations can be used in transfusions for any patient with any blood type.

Because the supply of O blood is currently very low, the Red Cross said it had had to reduce distributions of that type to hospitals.

“We will welcome anyone of any blood type, but O negative is considered universal and O positive is nearly universal,” Lasky said. “It’s the most transfused blood type and for patients with unknown blood type for emergency transfusion.”

She also said that the Red Cross is looking for platelet donations, which have a shelf life of five days, and are often critical for trauma and cancer patients.

This is not the first time the American Red Cross has warned of the risk of a blood supply shortage. Earlier this year, the organization it was seeing the lowest number of people giving blood in 20 years, something it is still experiencing.

According to the Red Cross, only 3% of age-eligible people, or about 6.8 million Americans, donate blood every year.

In an attempt to increase donations, the Red Cross is offering anyone who donates blood by August 31 a $20 Amazon gift card by email.

“As you go about your summer plans, remember there are those who are in hospitals,” Lasky said. “Let’s save lives and we really need people to come out and donate.”

World Health Organization reveals 30 pathogens most likely to trigger next pandemic.,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-13710267/who-updates-pandemic-causing-viruses-bacteria-pathogens-list.html,"The World Health Organization has revealed its list of more than 30 pathogens that are most likely to cause the next pandemic.

Among the most dangerous viruses and bacteria is H5N1 bird flu, which is spreading in the US and which scientists fear could easily mutate to jump between humans.

There are also fears about the mosquito-borne Dengue fever, sometimes dubbed the 'bone-breaking disease' which is also spreading in the US at unprecedented levels.

And monkeypox, which caused a global epidemic in 2022, was also on the list, amid an outbreak of a deadlier and more infectious strain in Africa.

The above shows a selection of pathogens included in the list that researchers deemed had a 'high' likelihood of causing the next pandemic or major outbreak

More than half of the entries were new compared to the list from 2017, when the list was first published.

It also included Hantavirus, a virus that spreads among rodents, the mosquito-borne West Nile Virus, flu and Covid.

The scientists also added smallpox even though it is currently eradicated, fearing it could be accidentally released in a lab accident and then spread quickly because few people now have immunity against the virus.

And the rodent-borne Lassa fever, which can cause bleeding from the gums, eyes and nose and seizures in patients.

The list was compiled by 200 scientists from more than 50 countries after reviewing a shortlist of 1,600 bacterium and viruses.

Those marked as having 'pandemic potential' were highly transmissible and virulent — or able to cause serious disease in humans.

The diseases most dangerous were also those that had no vaccines or treatments available for patients.

Previously, the lists from 2017 and 2018 had only included about a dozen pathogens.

The list was updated because of climate change, deforestation and the growth in international travel, which may make other diseases more likely to cause a new outbreak (stock)

But researchers have now expanded the list amid more opportunities for diseases to spread from animals to humans and between areas of the world.

Urbanization and deforestation has boosted contact between wildlife and humans, the scientists said, while more international travel generates new opportunities for a disease to find its way to new areas of the world.

There are also concerns that climate change could fuel an outbreak by leading to diseases spreading into new areas.

Dr Ana Maria Henao Restrepo, who led the report, told Nature: 'The prioritization process helps identify critical knowledge gaps that need to be addressed urgently.'

Other illnesses also included in the report were five bacteria, including cholera — which can cause stomach upsets — and Yersinia pestis — the bacteria behind the plague.

Those remaining on the list also included the bat-borne Nipah virus, which can cause severe swelling in the brain.

For many of the diseases included in the list, only sporadic cases have been diagnosed so far.

But researchers warned that if they gained mutations making them better able to spread between people, they could spark an outbreak.

Most of the diseases are carried by ticks, bats, mosquitoes, rodents or by people — often spread via respiratory droplets.

To become a pandemic, a virus or bacteria will need to spread between humans, be detected worldwide and cause illness."

Jefferson County Public Schools students are preparing to return to the classrooms this week, but local health experts say they are not worried about the spread of COVID-19.Compared to COVID-19 surges happening across the country, cases in Louisville are low, but doctors warn the virus is not going away.“COVID is alive and well, unfortunately, and it is out there,” said Dr. Mark Burns, infectious disease specialist for UofL Health.The good news is that while local hospitals are seeing some patients, Jefferson County is low on the totem pole for community risk, cases, hospitalizations, and emergency room visits for COVID-19.However, amid the normal summer surge, doctors recommend steps to prevent an alarming rise in cases, particularly as students return to school. If kids and teachers are sick with a fever, cough, or any respiratory illness, they’re urged to stay home. Practice good hygiene by washing your hands and covering your coughs or sneezes. Make sure you're staying up to date on COVID-19 and flu vaccines.“COVID-19 vaccines are recommended for everyone six months and older,” said Dr. Kris Bryant, associate medical director at the Louisville Metro Department of Public Health and Wellness. ”We should also have brand new COVID vaccines available soon, hopefully as early as September.”Health experts say schools can also help mitigate the spread of the virus.“We are hoping that the institutions and schools will have better ventilation for people, along with continued disinfecting of areas,” Burns said.Four years after the gut-wrenching number of daily COVID-19 cases and deaths in the commonwealth, experts note the strides Louisville and Kentucky have made in preventing COVID-19, treating the virus and keeping numbers down.To stay the course, the community is asked to continue doing their part.“Now, especially thanks to vaccines and what we've learned about this virus, we're in a much different position,” Bryant said. “This is just one of many viruses that can infect children, so take all the precautions with this virus that we do with other viruses to prevent spread.”Health experts say we should expect another spike in cases as the holidays approach."
"PAHO urges countries to strengthen prevention, surveillance and diagnosis of the Oropouche.",https://thecitypaperbogota.com/colombia/oropouche-virus-emerges-as-threat-to-public-health-in-colombia/,"The Oropouche virus (OROV), a previously lesser-known mosquito-borne pathogen, is rapidly expanding its geographical reach across the Americas, prompting heightened concern among health authorities. Initially endemic to the Amazon region, the virus has now been detected in countries such as Bolivia, Cuba, and, most recently, Colombia, where cases had never been reported before. The situation over the last week has escalated, with Brazil recording two fatalities attributed to this obscure virus.

The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has issued an urgent epidemiological alert following the recent surge in OROV cases. As of July 30, 2024, a total of 8,078 confirmed cases have been reported across five countries in the Americas, including Bolivia (356 cases), Brazil (7,284 cases), Colombia (74 cases), Cuba (74 cases), and Peru (290 cases). Notably, Brazil, which has reported the highest number of cases, has also confirmed the first deaths linked to the virus. The fatalities involve two women under the age of 30, and have raised alarm as mortality had not previously been associated with severe OROV infections.

The Oropouche virus is transmitted primarily through the bites of infected mosquitoes and biting midges, particularly the species Culicoides paraensis, commonly known as maruim. The symptoms of OROV infection closely resemble those of dengue fever, another mosquito-borne illness, leading to potential misdiagnosis. Common symptoms include fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, and a rash. In severe cases, the virus can cause neurological disorders such as meningitis or encephalitis. Disorders also associated with Chikungunya and ZIKA.

The first identification of the Oropouche virus occurred in Trinidad and Tobago in 1955, and it has since been associated with sporadic outbreaks, mainly in tropical regions. The virus has shown a marked increase in activity in recent years, with new cases emerging in areas previously considered non-endemic. In Brazil, where the virus has predominantly circulated in the Amazon, the disease has now been documented in ten non-Amazonian states, suggesting a significant geographical expansion.

The current outbreak has led to heightened surveillance and diagnostic efforts across the region. PAHO has emphasized the need for countries to strengthen their prevention, detection, and response strategies to mitigate the spread of the virus. This includes enhanced vector control measures, public awareness campaigns, and increased laboratory capacity for accurate diagnosis.

One of the most concerning developments in the ongoing investigation is the potential for vertical transmission of the virus from pregnant women to their unborn children. This mode of transmission, reminiscent of the Zika virus outbreak, is under investigation by Brazilian health authorities in collaboration with PAHO. Although OROV is not known to be contagious between humans, the possibility of transmission during pregnancy raises significant public health concerns, particularly given the severe consequences observed with other arboviruses like Zika.

In response to the growing threat, countries across the Americas are urged to remain vigilant and to implement robust surveillance systems to track the spread of the virus. Public health officials are also advocating for increased research into the virus’s transmission dynamics, potential complications, and effective prevention strategies.

The emergence of the Oropouche virus as a public health threat follows the 2015 outbreak of the Chikungunya (CHKV) virus and the Zika epidemic across northern South America the following year. As the public health situation continues to evolve, Colombia’s Institute of Public Health (INS) remains on high alert to prevent further spread and to protect vulnerable populations in two departments – Meta and Amazonas – where cases have now been confirmed."
"PAHO urges countries to strengthen prevention, surveillance and diagnosis of the Oropouche.",https://demerarawaves.com/2024/08/05/guyana-can-detect-oropouche-virus/,"Last Updated on Monday, 5 August 2024, 21:15 by Writer

Guyana is prepared to test for the Oropouche virus (OROV) which the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) last weekend sounded an alert about, Health Minister Dr Frank Anthony said Monday.

He said the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) has the reagents to test for the virus which can be spread by gnats and mosquitoes. “If people present with signs and symptoms and the doctors want a confirmatory diagnosis, they can send that to the Reference Lab and they have the reagents and everything to that (test). The capacity is there so we could test,” he said.

PAHO advised people to take preventive measures, including the use of repellents, clothing that covers legs and arms, and fine mesh mosquito nets, and to take extra precautions during outbreaks, particularly for vulnerable groups such as pregnant women.

There are no vaccines or specific antiviral treatments for Oropouche fever, PAHO added. “Management of the disease is symptomatic, focused on pain relief and rehydration,” that organisation said. PAHO says it continues to monitor the situation and provide technical assistance to support the response of countries in the region.

Dr Anthony said there were three suspected OROV cases but tests proved that they were not. “It is in the region but we haven’t had a case as yet. I know that the lab had, for the year, three suspected cases but when they ran the laboratory tests, it wasn’t,” he said.

OROV symptoms include sudden onset of fever, severe headache, joint and muscle pain, and, in some cases, rash, photophobia, diplopia (double vision), nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Symptoms may last five to seven days. While most cases recover without sequelae, in a small number of instances, complete recovery may take several weeks. Rarely, severe cases with aseptic meningitis may occur.

Experts say the symptoms make it difficult to identify readily without testing as they are similar to dengue, zika and chikungunya which may be circulating at the same time. In that regard, the Guyana Health Minister, said the lab test could determine specifically which virus it is. “All those viruses are giving you similar symptoms but if you want a differentiation you can send it to the lab and they would be able to do that differentiation,” Dr Anthony said.

PAHO recommends that countries in the region strengthen epidemiological surveillance and laboratory diagnosis, particularly to identify fatal and severe cases and possible cases of vertical transmission. In addition, the Organization urges countries to expand prevention campaigns and strengthen entomological surveillance and vector control actions to reduce mosquito and gnat populations.

PAHO has issued an epidemiological alert calling on countries to strengthen surveillance and implementation of laboratory diagnosis of the Oropouche virus (OROV). The call follows a recent increase in cases, and spread of the disease to new areas, as well as reports of the first deaths associated with the infection and possible instances of vertical transmission.

As of the end of July, in 2024, 8,078 confirmed cases of Oropouche fever were reported in the region, including two deaths. Cases were reported in five countries: Bolivia (356), Brazil (7,284, including two deaths), Colombia (74s), Cuba (74) and Peru (290), the Western Hemispheric agency said.

Although the disease has historically been described as mild, PAHO said the geographic spread in transmission and the detection of more severe cases underscore the need for increased surveillance and characterization of possible more severe manifestations. In July, Brazil also reported the investigation of cases of OROV transmission from pregnant women to the fetus.

Historically, Oropouche fever was primarily transmitted through the bite of an insect known as midge (Culicoides) in the Amazon region. However, factors such as climate change, deforestation and unplanned urbanization have facilitated its spread to non-Amazonian states in Brazil and to countries where, until now, there have been no reported cases, including Bolivia and Cuba.

OROV can be confirmed by molecular diagnosis. PAHO has strengthened diagnostic capacity in 26 countries in the region. However, as the clinical presentation of OROV is similar to that of other arboviral infections, combined with a lack of systematic surveillance in many countries, there is a possibility that surveillance systems underestimate the frequency of the disease."
7-Day High-Fiber Mediterranean Diet Meal Plan for High Blood Pressure.,https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-high-fiber-mediterranean-diet-meal-plan-for-high-blood-pressure-8690534,"Reap the benefits of the popular Mediterranean diet while focusing on nutrients that support healthy blood pressure in this 7-day meal plan. The Mediterranean diet is endorsed by the American Heart Association as a nutritious eating routine due to its emphasis on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes and healthy fats from foods like fish, nuts and avocado. It’s a flexible way of eating that lends itself to a wide variety of cuisines and flavorful dishes. Because of its focus on nutrient-rich foods, the Mediterranean diet tends to be high in fiber and has many health benefits, including improving blood pressure. Let’s dig in!

How We Create Meal Plans Registered dietitians thoughtfully create EatingWell’s meal plans to be easy-to-follow and delicious. Each meal plan meets specific parameters depending on the health condition and/or lifestyle goal it is targeting and is analyzed for accuracy using the nutrition database, ESHA Food Processor. As nutritional needs differ from person to person, we encourage you to use these plans as inspiration and adjust as you see fit.

Why This Meal Plan Is Great for You

In this 7-day meal plan, you’ll find an abundance of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and protein from legumes, fish, chicken and nuts. Each day provides an average of 38 grams of fiber per day. A high fiber intake is linked to many health benefits, such as improved gut health, reduced cholesterol, a lower risk of developing diabetes and even improved blood pressure. In fact, a systematic review found that increased dietary fiber intake was associated with reduced blood pressure. This finding remained consistent across the globe and among a wide variety of populations and health conditions. Because of its focus on fruits, legumes, vegetables and whole grains, the Mediterranean diet tends to be a high-fiber way of eating.

To further promote healthy blood pressure, we capped the sodium at 1,500 milligrams per day, which the American Heart Association recommends as the ideal limit for people with high blood pressure. While we limit sodium, we included plenty of potassium-rich foods. Named our #1 nutrient to lower blood pressure, potassium helps lower blood pressure, in part, by relaxing blood vessels. You’ll find potassium in a variety of foods, such as avocado, banana, spinach, broccoli, beans, lentils, nuts and yogurt.

This 1,800-calorie meal plan has modifications for 1,500 and 2,000 calories to support those with different calorie needs. While we previously included meal plans and modifications for 1,200 calories, we no longer do. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting your calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.

Frequently Asked Questions ​​Is it OK to mix and match meals if there is one I do not like? If there’s a meal you don’t like, feel free to repeat a different meal or choose from our wide variety of healthy high-blood pressure recipes. For daily totals, we aimed for about 1,800 calories, at least 70 grams of protein, a minimum of 34 grams of fiber per day and a maximum of 1,500 milligrams of sodium per day.

Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day? Definitely! If it’s easier for your routine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day, go for it. Each breakfast is between approximately 400 to 500 calories while lunch spans about 450 to 550 calories. These ranges are fairly similar, so a swap shouldn’t be a problem for most people. If you’re closely monitoring calories or other nutrients, you can adjust a snack or two if needed.

Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories? We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.

What are the benefits of eating more fiber? Fiber is an important nutrient that most of us are missing out on, with just 7% of adults in the United States hitting their fiber goal. Fiber is linked to weight loss, improved blood sugar, regular bowel movements, a more diverse gut bacteria and improved heart health.

Does the Mediterranean Diet Help High Blood Pressure?

Research indicates that the Mediterranean diet can help lower blood pressure. One small study of Australian adults over 64 years of age found that adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with lower blood pressure at three and six month follow-ups. With the Mediterranean diets focus on foods high in potassium and fiber, it makes sense that this healthy way of eating can improve blood pressure levels. It also emphasizes cooking more meals at home, which can be a handy strategy to reduce excess sodium intake. If you’re aiming to reduce your blood pressure, following the Mediterranean can be a helpful strategy.

7-Day High-Fiber Mediterranean Diet Meal Plan for High Blood Pressure.,https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-pistachios-regularly-8687923,"It’s not hard to understand why you might eat pistachios every day. Recognized for their distinctive shells and rich taste, these little nuts are beloved around the world. Ranging from soft green to pale ivory, pistachios provide a delightful crunch and slightly sweet, nutty flavor, making them a perfect companion in a variety of meals and snacks.

But what if you actually do eat pistachios every day? Thankfully, because of their plethora of nutrients, you may reap some pretty impressive benefits when you nosh on these nuts.

Pistachios Nutrition

The following is the nutrition information for 1 serving (1 ounce) of shelled unsalted pistachios:

Calories : 165

: 165 Protein : 6 g

: 6 g Total fat : 13 g

: 13 g Saturated fat : 2 g

: 2 g Carbohydrates : 8 g

: 8 g Dietary fiber : 3 g

: 3 g Total sugar : 2 g

: 2 g Added sugar : 0 g

: 0 g Cholesterol : 0 mg

: 0 mg Sodium : 1.7 mg

: 1.7 mg Magnesium: 30 mg

30 mg Folate: 14 mg

14 mg Potassium: 277 mg



This is quite the nutrition-packed nut. “Pistachios are a source of complete protein with all nine essential amino acids, they have healthy mono- and polyunsaturated fats, they are loaded with fiber and they contain antioxidants,” explains Taylor Berggren, M.S., RDN, a California-based registered dietitian.

Health Benefits of Pistachios

You May Have Better Blood Pressure

Pistachios contain nutrients that support healthy blood pressure, including calcium and magnesium. They are also a natural source of potassium, a mineral that helps to counteract the effects of sodium in the body, helping to promote better blood vessel function and normal blood pressure levels. In addition to those minerals, pistachios offer heart-healthy compounds like phytosterols and antioxidants, which may provide additional cardiovascular benefits. These nutrients may be responsible for the results of a meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials that found pistachio consumption is linked to a decrease in systolic blood pressure (the top number on a reading).

You May Have Better Eye Health

The gorgeous green and purple hues pistachios possess are partially due to the levels of two carotenoids they contain: lutein and zeaxanthin. These carotenoids not only help make pistachios look super-colorful, they also play a crucial role in protecting our eyes. Lutein and zeaxanthin are found in the retina and help filter out potentially damaging light, reducing the risk of eye diseases that lead to vision loss, such as age-related macular degeneration and cataracts.

You May Have a Healthy Weight

Some people still think that eating nuts will result in weight gain. However, data shows that pistachio consumption is not associated with weight gain or increased obesity risk., Pistachios play a valuable role in weight management due to their unique nutritional profile. The combination of protein and fiber in these nuts promotes feelings of fullness, which can help prevent overeating.

What’s more, people who eat pistachios tend to have a healthier diet. Eating 1.5 ounces of pistachios every day for four months is associated with increased fiber intake and decreased consumption of sweets. And other data showed that consuming tree nuts (like pistachios) as snacks is linked to a reduction in waist circumference among young adult females compared to eating high-carbohydrate snacks.

You May Have Better Blood Glucose Control

Eating pistachios may help you manage your blood sugar, making them an excellent choice if you have diabetes or prediabetes. Their combination of healthy fats, protein and fiber helps to stabilize blood glucose by slowing down the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream.

You May Have Improved Gut Health

Eating pistachios may give your gut health a boost. Along with their fiber, which can help you stay regular, the nuts may also promote gut health. “A 2023 review study reports that daily pistachio intake increased some bacteria in your microbiome known for their ability to produce butyrate, an essential type of fatty acid that acts as fuel for the cells in your large intestine,” says Berggren. Although more research—particularly on humans—is needed, taking care of your gut health is important for your digestion, weight, immune system and more. Pistachios can be part of a gut-healthy diet.

Are Pistachios Safe for Everyone to Eat?

If you have an allergy to pistachios, these nuts are not safe to eat. (If you are allergic to other tree nuts, you may or may not be able to tolerate pistachios; talk to your health care provider.) Otherwise, outside of an allergy, “there are very minimal risks to consuming pistachios,” explains Elizabeth Shaw, M.S., RDN, a registered dietitian nutritionist and cookbook author. However, she adds, the nuts can be a choking hazard for children under 4, so if you’re sharing the nuts with young eaters, they’re best eaten pureed as a dip.

Additionally, those who experience digestive issues may find that pistachios, when consumed in large amounts, can lead to discomfort due to their high fiber content. Lastly, people with kidney stones or high potassium levels should consult a health care provider before incorporating pistachios into their diet, as the nuts contain oxalates, which may promote stone formation.

Tips for Enjoying Pistachios

Pair with Flavors

Pistachios have a naturally rich and slightly sweet flavor that makes them a good choice for a variety of dishes. Here are a few ideas:

Eat a combo of sweet fruits like grapes or apples with pistachios.

Pair pistachios with savory cheeses, such as goat cheese or sharp Cheddar. (If you’re feeling fancy, go ahead and dribble some honey on top!)

Sprinkle over chocolate-drizzled fruit, like in our Chocolate-Pistachio Kiwi.

Use as a Topping

Add chopped pistachios to salads or yogurt to add a delightful crunch and a nutty flavor. Our Chai Chia Pudding is a delicious recipe that tops off chia pudding with pistachios for texture. Pro tip: Consider toasting pistachios lightly first to intensify their flavor.

Use Pistachios as a Protein Coating

To create a delicious pistachio crust for proteins such as chicken, fish or tofu, crush pistachios into fine crumbs and combine them with breadcrumbs or panko. Season with herbs and spices, and then coat the protein in the mixture before baking or pan-searing. A similar technique is used for our Pistachio-Crusted Halibut.

Add to Desserts

Chop pistachios and fold them into cake batters or cookie dough. They can also be used atop ice cream or sorbet, adding texture and a hint of nuttiness. Strawberry-Pistachio Greek Yogurt Bark is another delightful way to use pistachios at dessert time.



Frequently Asked Questions Are pistachios healthy for weight loss? Yes, pistachios can be beneficial for weight loss. They are nutrient-dense, providing healthy fats, protein and fiber, which can help promote satiety and reduce overall calorie intake when consumed in moderation.



Is it OK to eat pistachios every day? Go right ahead! “Pistachios can be eaten every day,” says Berggren. “In fact, a 2020 study showed that daily consumption of pistachios may help improve the overall diet quality of healthy women,” she explains.



What are the side effects of eating pistachios? While pistachios are generally safe, excessive consumption can lead to digestive issues due to their fiber content. They are also calorie-dense, another reason to consume them in moderation. Additionally, pistachios can cause allergic reactions for individuals with nut allergies.



Do pistachios burn belly fat? No specific food, including pistachios, can target fat loss in a specific area like the belly. However, incorporating them into a balanced diet can contribute to overall weight loss, which may help reduce belly fat over time.



Are pistachios a protein or carb? Pistachios are primarily a source of healthy fats, but they also contain protein and carbohydrates. They offer about 6 grams of protein per ounce, making them a good nut choice for additional protein intake.

The Bottom Line

Incorporating pistachios into your daily diet can be a positive and healthful choice. These nutrient-dense nuts are packed with protein, healthy fats and essential vitamins and minerals, making them an excellent snack option. Regular consumption of pistachios may support heart health, promote weight management and improve overall well-being.

7-Day High-Fiber Mediterranean Diet Meal Plan for High Blood Pressure.,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/gut-health-expert-says-ditch-085010079.html,"



A health expert has said getting rid of a popular drink from your breakfast could do wonders for your gut. Chris Dubberley, gut health expert at Incontinence Shop, has shed light on the detrimental effects of sugary breakfasts on gut health.

Chris said: “One of the most famous breakfast menu items - orange juice - actually wreaks havoc on our gut health and sets us up for a terrible morning. Orange juice has a surprisingly high sugar content, comparable to fizzy drinks.

""Breakfast bars are a convenient option in a pinch, but many are packed with added sugars and artificial ingredients. Look for bars with minimal additives or, even better, create your own using whole grains, nuts, and dried fruits for a fibre-rich and gut-friendly snack.

“Marketing campaigns mislead us into thinking that a sweet start to the day is ideal, but sugary cereals and pastries can do more harm than good for our gut. That isn’t to say that there aren’t healthy breakfast choices that can incorporate natural sugars to satisfy that morning sweet tooth. Full-fat plain Greek yoghurt with fresh fruit, nuts, and a drizzle of honey offers a balanced combination of probiotics, fibre, and healthy fats. It can contribute to a well-nourished gut.”

Best breakfast foods to choose for good gut health

Chris said: “High-protein choices like porridge and eggs are not only better for our gut health, but they keep us fuller for longer and keep those pre-lunch hunger pangs away. To meet your protein needs without relying solely on red meat, incorporate plant-based sources like lentils and beans into your morning meals.

""This can provide the protein boost your gut needs while minimising health risks associated with excessive red meat consumption. Whole grain toast with avocado and an egg is a fibre-rich choice that also provides healthy fats. Avocado contains beneficial nutrients for your gut, making it a great addition to any morning meal."""
7-Day High-Fiber Mediterranean Diet Meal Plan for High Blood Pressure.,https://www.freepressseries.co.uk/news/24496758.health-experts-issue-paracetamol-warning-brits/,"It was assumed that - until fairly recently - paracetamol was a completely safe drug to use in patients with high blood pressure.

However, it has now been revealed that some people who take paracetamol regularly could have a heightened risk of certain deadly diseases.

A 2022 study found the effect on blood pressure is similar to that of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen.

The Mediterranean diet lowers risk of heart disease, high cholesterol & high blood pressure. Build your meals around ample servings of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, and nuts. These provide essential vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidantshttps://t.co/y3yrCSuhrP — Organic Live Food (@OrganicLiveFood) February 17, 2024

NSAIDs are used to manage chronic pain but are also known to increase blood pressure and risk of heart disease, according to the ECHO.

Experts have said the increase in blood pressure might be expected to increase the risk of heart disease or stroke by around 20%. Researchers say patients who have a long-term prescription for the painkiller, usually used for the treatment of chronic pain, should be given the lowest effective dose for the shortest time possible.

Professor James Dear, personal chairman of clinical pharmacology at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""This study clearly shows that paracetamol, the world's most used drug, increases blood pressure, one of the most important risk factors for heart attacks and strokes.

Prof Dear said doctors and patients should ""together consider the risks versus the benefits"" especially where patients are at risk of cardiovascular disease. He continued: ""In summary, we've shown that two weeks of treatment with paracetamol increases blood pressure in patients who have hypertension (high blood pressure).""

Lead investigator Dr Iain MacIntyre, consultant in clinical pharmacology and nephrology at NHS Lothian said people who use paracetamol every once in a while shouldn't worry.

Dr MacIntyre said: ""This is not about short-term use of paracetamol for headaches or fever, which is, of course, fine - but it does indicate a newly discovered risk for people who take it regularly over the longer term, usually for chronic pain.""

The study found that after people stopped taking the drug, their blood pressure returned to what it was at the start of the study, suggesting the drug increased it.

""Doctors should always weigh up the benefits and risks""





Researchers said they did not have accurate numbers of the people in the UK who are on paracetamol long-term and have high blood pressure. However, it is estimated that one in three adults in the UK who have high blood pressure take paracetamol regularly.

According to the experts, the study was set up to see a very small effect on blood pressure, and they were surprised to see a much bigger impact.

Professor Sir Nilesh Samani, medical director at the British Heart Foundation, which funded the study, said the findings ""emphasise why doctors and patients should regularly review whether there is an ongoing need to take any medication"" and ""always weigh up the benefits and risks.""

Blood Pressure UK says around one in three adults in the UK has high blood pressure. In England, this is 31% of men and 26% of women."
Long-term benzodiazepine use linked to shrinkage in two brain regions.,https://www.psypost.org/long-term-benzodiazepine-use-linked-to-shrinkage-in-two-brain-regions/,"Although the overall use of benzodiazepines does not appear to increase the risk of dementia, long-term use is associated with a reduction in the volume of critical brain areas, such as the hippocampus and the amygdala, according to new research published in BMC Medicine. This finding supports current medical guidelines that caution against prolonged benzodiazepine use.

Benzodiazepines are a class of medications commonly prescribed to alleviate anxiety and insomnia. Common benzodiazepines include diazepam (Valium), alprazolam (Xanax), and lorazepam (Ativan). These drugs function by enhancing the effect of a neurotransmitter called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which promotes relaxation and reduces brain activity.

Due to their calming effects, benzodiazepines are among the most frequently prescribed psychotropic medications in developed countries. However, concerns have been raised about their long-term use, especially among older adults, due to risks of dependence, falls, and potential cognitive decline.

The impetus for this study stemmed from conflicting evidence about the long-term effects of benzodiazepines on cognitive health. While some animal studies suggested that benzodiazepines might protect the brain by reducing inflammation, others indicated they could harm the brain by promoting the buildup of harmful proteins associated with dementia.

Previous human studies also yielded mixed results, with some suggesting an increased dementia risk and others finding no such link. This study aimed to clarify these effects by investigating both the risk of dementia and changes in brain structure over time.

“Our interest in this topic was raised by the observation that benzodiazepines are the most commonly prescribed medications in developed countries, and 30-40% of older adults continues use beyond the recommended period of several weeks, while several recent studies indicated that benzodiazepines might have long-term adverse effects on cognition,” said study author Ilse vom Hofe of the Erasmus University Medical Center.

The researchers conducted their study using data from the Rotterdam Study, a large, ongoing research project initiated in 1990 to explore common diseases among older adults. The study included 5,443 participants aged 60 and above who were free from cognitive impairment at the start. These participants underwent follow-up assessments every four years, which included cognitive tests and brain imaging scans. Information on benzodiazepine use was obtained from pharmacy records, allowing researchers to track the duration and dosage of medication use.

To assess the impact of benzodiazepines on dementia risk, the researchers used statistical models to compare the incidence of dementia among benzodiazepine users and non-users. They accounted for various factors that could influence dementia risk, such as age, sex, education, and health conditions like diabetes and heart disease.

In addition to dementia assessments, the study also focused on brain imaging data from 4,836 participants who had undergone at least one MRI scan. These scans measured the volumes of different brain regions, including the hippocampus and amygdala, which are crucial for memory and emotion.

The study’s findings revealed no significant association between benzodiazepine use and an increased risk of developing dementia. This result contrasts with some earlier studies that suggested a higher risk.

But the researchers observed that benzodiazepine use was linked to a subtle reduction in the volume of the hippocampus and, to a lesser extent, the amygdala over time. These brain regions are known to shrink as part of the aging process, and accelerated shrinkage can be a marker of neurodegeneration.

“People should take away from our study that benzodiazepine use was not associated with increased dementia risk,” vom Hofe told PsyPost. “However, benzodiazepine use was associated with sub-clinical accelerated reduction in hippocampal and to a lesser extent amygdalar volume over time, underlining current guidelines cautioning against prolonged benzodiazepine use.”

One of the strengths of this study is its robust design and long follow-up period, which allowed for a thorough investigation of both dementia risk and brain changes. The researchers also took into account a wide range of factors that could confound the results, such as the presence of anxiety and sleep disorders, which are both common reasons for benzodiazepine prescriptions and potential risk factors for dementia.

However, the study has some limitations. While the exclusion of participants with cognitive impairment at baseline helped reduce the risk of reverse causation—where cognitive decline leads to benzodiazepine use rather than the other way around—it may also have led to an underestimation of the drug’s adverse effects. Additionally, the study population was predominantly white, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other ethnic groups.

“Our results are based on a cognitively healthy population, possible adverse effects of benzodiazepine use in people with cognitive impairment warrant further investigation,” vom Hofe noted.

Despite these limitations, the study’s findings have important implications for the use of benzodiazepines, particularly among older adults. The observed reduction in hippocampal volume associated with benzodiazepine use, even in the absence of increased dementia risk, underscores the importance of caution when prescribing these medications for extended periods. The hippocampus plays a crucial role in memory formation, and its shrinkage is often seen in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.

The study also suggests several directions for future research. Further investigations could explore whether different types of benzodiazepines have varying impacts on brain health. For instance, this study found that high cumulative doses of anxiolytics, which are benzodiazepines prescribed for anxiety, were associated with a higher risk of dementia compared to sedative-hypnotics, which are prescribed for sleep disorders. Understanding these differences could help guide safer prescribing practices.

“This research is part of a line of research investigating the effects of commonly used medications on dementia risk, with the ultimate goal to prevent or delay the onset of dementia,” vom Hofe said.

The study, “Benzodiazepine use in relation to long-term dementia risk and imaging markers of neurodegeneration: a population-based study,” was authored by Ilse vom Hofe, Bruno H. Stricker, Meike W. Vernooij, M. Kamran Ikram, M. Arfan Ikram, and Frank J. Wolters."
Long-term benzodiazepine use linked to shrinkage in two brain regions.,https://list23.com/3832174-the-use-of-benzodiazepine-over-an-extended-period-results-in-reduced-activity-in-two-areas-of-the-br/,"Recent studies published in BMC Medicine demonstrate that the use of benzodiazepines for an extended period of time does not raise the likelihood of dementia, but they do result in a decrease in the size of important brain areas, such as the hippocampus and the amygdala. This strengthens current medical guidelines that advise against using benzodiazepines for an extended duration.

The drugs known as benzodiazepines are commonly used to treat anxiety and insomnia, such as diazepam (Valium), alprazolam (Xanax), and lorazepam (Ativan). These drugs enhance the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which reduces brain activity and relaxes the nervous system.

Benzodiazepines are widely used as a sedative amongst well-developed countries, and are widely associated with the risk of dependence, falls and cognitive decline; however, long-term use has also been cautioned, particularly in older adults, against the risks of such a prescription.

This work was motivated by a variety of evidence concerning the long term effects that benzodiazepines may have on cognitive health: some studies conducted in animals suggested that the benzodiazepines could protect the brain from inflammation, while others found evidence that benzodiazepines may promote the secretion of harmful proteins, which are linked to dementia and may have specific effects on the patient's health.

Previous studies in humans had mixed outcomes, with some suggesting a higher likelihood of developing dementia and others showing no association. In order to clarify these outcomes, this study examined both the risk of dementia and changes in brain structure over time.

The fact that 30-40% of elderly adults continue to use benzodiazepines for longer than recommended time spans raised our concern.

The researchers used data from the Rotterdam Study, a large-scale research project started in 1990 to study common diseases among elderly adults; 5,443 were included—with no cognitive impairment at the start—and monitored for every four years thereafter, using cognitive tests as well as brain imaging scans.Value information on benzodiazepine use was retrieved from pharmacy records so researchers could monitor how long and how much the medication was used.

Using statistical models, the researchers looked at how benzodiazepine users and non-users differed in dementia incidence, including factors such as age, gender, education level, and the risks associated with health conditions such as diabetes and heart disease.

The study analyzed brain imaging data from 4,836 participants who had undergone MRI scans. These scans measured the volumes of different brain regions, such as the hippocampus and amygdala, which are essential for memory and emotion.

Although previous studies had suggested a higher likelihood of developing dementia, the study did not demonstrate a significant link between benzodiazepine use and the risk of the disease.

The researchers discovered a link between benzodiazepine use and a slight decrease in the volume of the hippocampus and, to a lesser degree, the amygdala over time. As a result, these brain regions often experience a gradual decline as people age, and accelerated shrinkage can be a sign of neurodegeneration.

The study's findings did not suggest an increased risk of dementia, as suggested by Vom Hofe. However, benzodiazepine use was associated with sub-clinical and slower alterations in hippocampal and amygdalar volume over time, underscoring current guidelines for caution.

This study has the potential to be beneficial due to its tough design and lengthy follow-up period, which allowed for a thorough analysis of both dementia risk and brain changes. Additionally, the researchers considered multiple variables that could potentially confuse the findings, such as anxiety and sleep disorders.

This study has some drawbacks: the risk of a reverse causation (that cognitive decline leads to use of benzodiazepine) was reduced by not including participants with cognitive impairment at baseline, but the study population was largely white, making the outcomes intelligible beyond another ethnic group.

Despite the availability of evidence supporting the findings, von Hofe emphasized that the potential harm caused by benzodiazepine use in individuals with cognitive impairment is a concern that warrants further investigation.

Despite the limitations of this study, it is important to note that the study results will suggest important lessons for use of benzodiazepines, especially in older adults, as the observed decrease in hippocampal volume associated with benzodiazepines, although not with higher risk of dementia, means that caution should be exercised when prescribing these drugs for extended periods: the hippocampus, in particular, is pivotal to memory forming; however, it also shrinks it frequently in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Alzheimer's, the hippocampus sacer

The study offers several recommendations for future research. Further investigations may aim to determine the impact of different benzodiazepines on brain function. This study uncovered that anxiolytics prescribed for anxiety were significantly more likely to cause dementia than sedative-hypnotics prescribed for sleep disorders. Acknowledging these distinctions could help prescribers make safer prescribing decisions.

As part of a long-term research program to explore how common medications affect the risk of dementia, this research will aim to slow or prevent the onset of the disease.

Key takeaways:

Researchers received nothing from three of six counterfeit semaglutide products ordered online.

Measured semaglutide exceeded the labeled amount by 29% to 39% in the three products received.

Quality testing of three counterfeit semaglutide products found low purity and more measured semaglutide than what was on the label, according to a research letter published in JAMA Network Open.

In a qualitative study, researchers purchased two 0.25 mg prefilled pens of semaglutide from six online vendors. In addition to finding irregularities in the three products delivered, the researchers reported not receiving anything from three of the vendors.

“Half of the products we purchased were simply nondelivery scams where they took our money and asked for more in order to ‘clear customs,’ even though this was confirmed as fraudulent,” Tim K. Mackey, MAS, PhD, professor in the global health program at University of California, San Diego, told Healio. “These scams can be extremely harmful to consumers, especially those without the means to afford these medicines through authorized channels.”

Mackey and colleagues conducted searches on Google and Bing for websites advertising the sale of semaglutide without a prescription. The search identified 317 online pharmacies of which 42.27% were considered illegal pharmacy operations. Semaglutide was purchased from six online vendors deemed not recommended or rogue by LegitScript or the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy. A checklist from the International Pharmaceutical Federation was used to quantify counterfeit or falsification risks of the products from illegal online retailers compared with authentic versions of 1 mg injectable semaglutide (Ozempic, Novo Nordisk).

Of the six online vendors, three offered prefilled 0.25 mg semaglutide pens and three sold vials of lyophilized semaglutide to be reconstituted to solution. Prices for the smallest dose and quantity ranged from $113 to $360.

All three vendors that sent no products requested extra payment to supposedly clear customs. These requests were confirmed as fraudulent by customs agencies.

Of the three products researchers received, all scored eight or nine points on the International Pharmaceutical Federation checklist compared with 22 points for authentic semaglutide. During quality testing, one product had an elevated level of endotoxins. All three products had semaglutide purity levels of 7% to 14% compared with advertised 99% purity. The semaglutide in each product exceeded the labeled amount by 29% to 39%.

Mackey said findings showed how important it is for providers to make sure patients are receiving semaglutide from a legitimate source.

“For buying online, patients can self-prescribe when not necessary or when possibly contraindicated, they can be exposed to low-quality product, they can self-administer a product with the wrong or no instructions, and this may happen completely outside a physician-patient relationship needed for effective use of GLP-1s.”

Mackey said the study was conducted in July 2023 and more studies should be performed to see whether any changes have taken place, particularly with the online pharmacies reviewed in the study.

“Equally, consumer perception and behaviors toward online sourcing of GLP-1s needs to be fully researched to understand the motivations of consumers when taking this risk,” Mackey said.

Prescription fills for semaglutide dramatically increase from 2021 to 2023.,https://www.healthday.com/healthpro-news/weight-loss/2021-to-2023-saw-considerable-increase-in-semaglutide-fills,"MONDAY, Aug. 5, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- From 2021 through 2023, there was a considerable increase in the number of semaglutide fills, according to a research letter published online Aug. 2 in JAMA Health Forum.

Christopher Scannell, M.D., Ph.D., from the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, and colleagues analyzed trends in prescriptions dispensed at retail pharmacies for semaglutide between January 2021 and December 2023. Monthly fills were calculated for semaglutide by drug brand (Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus) and payment method.

The researchers observed a 442 percent increase in the number of semaglutide fills between January 2021 and December 2023; Ozempic accounted for more than 70 percent of these fills. Increases were seen for all three drug brands, with variation in the extent and timing of these increases. Ozempic increased 392 percent between January 2021 and December 2023, peaking in August 2023 before reaching a plateau; notable increases in Wegovy fills started in January 2023, peaked in May 2023, then plateaued, with an increase of more than 1,361 percent seen between July 2021 and December 2023. For all three drug brands, increases in monthly semaglutide fills were seen across all payment methods between 2021 and 2023, with most fills accounted for by prescriptions paid through commercial insurance.

""The number of prescriptions filled for semaglutide has increased substantially, reaching 2.6 million prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies by December 2023,"" the authors write. ""Future research should examine how changes in Medicare Part D and Medicaid coverage restrictions influence disparities in access to these essential medications.""

GLP-1 jab hospitalises 62-year-old man after it sends his body to the hospital.,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-13709751/Weight-loss-jab-hospitalises-62-year-old-man-sends-metabolism-overdrive-UK-experts-warn-dangerous-Ozempic-fakes-continuing-obesity-drug-shortages.html,"An obese man was left in excruciating pain and forced to attend A&E after a slimming jab left him suffering an overactive thyroid.

The 62-year-old, who also had type 1 diabetes, lost more than 5.6 stone (36kg) in under six months on tirzepatide — sold under the brand name Mounjaro.

But after rushing to hospital with sudden palpitations, a fever and even hand tremors, scans showed he had developed an irregular heartbeat, atrial fibrillation, dubbed a 'silent killer'.

Medics also discovered he had thyrotoxicosis — a condition in which the thyroid gland, responsible for metabolism and heart rate — malfunctions, with potentially life-threatening consequences.

Sharing his case in a medical journal as a warning, doctors today called for slimmers using the jabs to be monitored more closely to prevent 'adverse events'.

The 62-year-old, who also had type 1 diabetes , lost more than 5.6 stone (36kg) in under six months on tirzepatide — sold under the brand name Mounjaro. But after rushing to hospital with sudden palpitations, a fever and even hand tremors, scans showed he had developed atrial fibrillation, dubbed a 'silent killer'

According to the latest data digestive problems were the most commonly reported side effects of tirzepatide, the active ingredient of Mounjaro. These included about one in five participants suffering from nausea and diarrhoea, and about one in 10 reporting vomiting or diarrhoea

Mounjaro has already been rubber-stamped by US health chiefs for weight loss, hailed as a gamechanger in the fight against obesity, which costs billions in healthcare costs.

In February it was also made available privately in Britain, with clinics charging around £40 for a week's supply.

Studies have found the drug, made by US pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, could help obese people lose more than 20 per cent of their body weight in under a year and a half.

But like all drugs, Mounjaro is not without side-effects.

The European Medicines Agency said this year that research on rodents has suggested the artificial hormones packaged in tirzepatide could raise the risk of medullary thyroid cancer.

HOW TO CALCULATE YOUR BODY MASS INDEX - AND WHAT IT MEANS Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on your weight in relation to your height. Standard Formula: BMI = (weight in pounds / (height in inches x height in inches)) x 703 Metric Formula: BMI = (weight in kilograms / (height in meters x height in meters)) Measurements: Under 18.5: Underweight

Underweight 18.5 - 24.9: Healthy

Healthy 25 - 29.9: Overweight

Overweight 30 - 39.9: Obese

Writing in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, researchers at the University of Colorado, said the unidentified male patient, who had a BMI of 31.2, presented to the emergency department with palpitations, excessive sweating, confusion, fever, and hand tremors.

He had been prescribed tirzepatide six months earlier, initially on a 2.5mg weekly dose and also took levothyroxine, to help control his diabetes.

'The physician suggested increasing the tirzepatide dose every four weeks as tolerated and following up in a month,' they noted.

The man, however, missed his follow-up appointment but despite this still upped his dose, eventually taking 10mg weekly.

Medics said atrial fibrillation was triggered by thyrotoxicosis following 'rapid weight loss from tirzepatide'.

They added: 'We recommend evaluating patients using tirzepatide closely (every four to six weeks initially) for assessment of therapy response, adverse events, and possible dose adjustment of other concomitant medications.

Tirzepatide is part of a class of drug known as a GLP-1 receptor agonist: these treatments trick the brain into thinking it's full, consequently slashing appetite.

Huge global demand and shortages, however, has also seen counterfeit versions flood the market.

Pharmacists yesterday warned of an 'explosion' in fake weight-loss jabs fuelled by a dearth of Ozempic, which contains semaglutide.

Wegovy and Ozempic work by triggering the body to produce a hormone called GLP-1 that is released naturally from the intestines after meals

Experts say the shortages are expected into next year, fuelling the illicit trade online.

Health officials have already seized more than 800 potentially fake weight loss pens across the UK since the start of 2023.

Counterfeit jabs have in the past been found to have insulin, a drug used by diabetics, in them.

Insulin works by rapidly lowering blood sugar, but if sugars are not raised to begin with, doing so can have severe and potentially fatal consequences.

Semaglutide has been available on the NHS since 2019, and in the US since 2017, for type 2 diabetics to manage blood sugar levels.

But its manufacturer Novo Nordisk is also probing whether semaglutide could raise the risk of medullary thyroid cancer and pancreatic cancer.

No evidence yet, however, proves they are definitely side effects — even in extremely rare cases.

All Brits are urged to report any medicines side effects they notice to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency's (MHRA) Yellow Card Scheme.

Ministers in Britain plan to dole these drugs to millions of overweight Brits to fight the obesity crisis. Children could eventually be given the jabs, too.

Latest NHS data shows 26 per cent of adults in England are obese and a further 38 per cent are overweight but not obese.

In the US an estimated 41.9 per cent of adult population are obese."
