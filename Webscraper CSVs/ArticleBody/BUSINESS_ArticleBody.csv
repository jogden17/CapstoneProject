Global stocks tumble on fears of U.S. recession and tech pullback.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/business/global-stocks.html,"Anxiety over a slowdown in the U.S. economy intensified on Monday, with a retreat in markets that began last week snowballing into a global rout.



The turmoil was the latest example of how distinct economic forces can ricochet across markets, forcing down company stock prices and erasing billions of dollars in value. In this case, a rapidly rising yen over the past week had disrupted the flow of global capital, prompting a pullback from some popular investments.



But the sell-off quickly expanded into a more widespread panic that the Federal Reserve may have waited too long to start cutting interest rates, threatening the strength of the U.S. economy.

Those fears were amplified by a U.S. employment report released on Friday that showed significantly slower hiring by employers, with the unemployment rate rising to its highest level in nearly three years. From the moment stock markets first opened for trading in Asia, and then through trading hours in Europe and the United States on Monday, prices plummeted.

On Wall Street, the S&P 500 fell 3 percent, its sharpest daily decline since September 2022.

While some investors saw the sell-off as a signal that the economy was at risk of recession, others maintained that the move was more the result of a pullback from overextended bets, especially on tech stocks and artificial intelligence. Despite its recent decline, the S&P 500 is still up nearly 9 percent for the year, a healthy return."

Apple had its worst day since September 2022, shedding 4.82%.

The S&P 500 Index closed 106 points, or 3%, lower on Monday after a hair-raising morning drop, while the technology heavy Nasdaq composite fell 3.43% and the Dow Jones plummeted more than 1,000 points, losing 2.6%, as global markets washed out over worries of a possible recession in the world's biggest economy.

The S&P 500 and the Dow saw their biggest drops since September 2022. The market carnage shaved $907 billion off Nasdaq's market value.

“So much for the summer lull,” said Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, in a commentary. “Stock markets are in turmoil and bond yields have plunged as fears about a U.S. recession have taken hold.”

Driving the rout: Sharp declines in high-flying tech stocks including Nvidia, Apple, and Amazon, and a disappointing jobs report. Apple had its worst day since September 2022, shedding 4.82%. As investors ran to buy U.S. Treasurys, mortgage rates declined, opening the door for some borrowers to refinance, experts said.

These are the day's top develoments.

Biden mum on stock market rout, while Trump attacks

President Joe Biden didn’t respond directly to Monday’s market panic, and instead released a statement touting his student loan forgiveness program and the expansion of college Pell grants.

The White House kept its head down as Donald Trump and his allies worked overtime to pin the stock market carnage on Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee.

As the tech-heavy Nasdaq index shed more than $900 billion in value and the Dow Jones average lost more than 1,000 points, Biden released a statement on X apparently aimed at younger voters.

“In three years, my Administration canceled student debt for nearly 5 million borrowers through various actions, made the largest increases to the Pell Grant in a decade, and fixed Income-Driven Repayment so borrowers get the relief they are entitled to,” the statement said. “I'm not done yet.”

Trump reveled in labeling the day’s losses the “Kamala Krash.” Earlier this year, the former president took credit for record stock market highs, calling them a signal that investors favored his campaign to retake the White House.

What does Chicago Fed President Goolsbee say about rate cuts?

The Federal Reserve has only two jobs by law: stabilize prices and maximize employment, Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee emphasized in an interview with USA TODAY.

“That's the dual mandate,” he said. “That's the thing that will determine what the Fed does on rates. There's nothing in the Fed's mandate that says stop market declines. Or, you know, keep traders whole on days when there's volatility, right?”

""If the economy starts to deteriorate, the Fed's job is to act − and we will act appropriately,” he said.

What does Goolsbee say about the jobs report?

Goolsbee admitted the jobs report was “negative” but also noted it was only one month of data. The payrolls increase of 114,000 may have missed economists’ average forecast of 175,000, but he said that’s within the margin of error, which is plus or minus 100,000.

“The job of the central bank is to be steady and take the totality of the evidence when making decisions,” he said. “So if you get down in the weeds of this jobs report, it was negative, but there were some things that were cross currents that make it … a little less directly clear. Like the unemployment rate went up more than people thought, but the labor participation rate and the employment to population ratio both rose, which is kind of unusual. Normally, the recessionary signs are when the unemployment rate is rising because layoffs are going up.”

Goolsbee added that “the Fed set the rate at the level it is now a year ago, and the conditions were very different a year ago than they are today” and it may be time to reconsider those rates. The Fed funds target rate is currently at a 23-year high, between 5.25%-5.5%.

“You only want to be that restrictive if you're afraid of (the economy) overheating,” he said. “And my thing is, this is not really what overheating looks like.”

How likely is a recession?

While some economists say current market conditions raise the risk of a recession within the next 12 months, others are downplaying concerns.

“The recession fears are overblown,” said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo. “It’s not time to panic here.”

The USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast. Download for award-winning coverage, crosswords, audio storytelling, the eNewspaper and more.

Wells Fargo economists said they expect an economic slowdown – not a recession − noting the labor market is in the early stages of weakening and “still some distance away from even the most moderate, modern recession,” which took place in 2001. The bank also noted consumer spending has potential to grow as household purchasing power strengthens.

Goldman Sachs Group on Sunday raised the probability of a recession within the next year from 15% to 25% but see the risk as “limited,” Bloomberg reported.

Recession worries stem, in part, from the July job report’s triggering of the Sahm rule, a measure that says if unemployment based on a three-month average rises by at least a half percentage point over the past 12 months, the nation is likely in a recession.

Claudia Sahm, a former Federal Reserve economist, cautioned against taking too much of a signal from her namesake rule in a post-COVID labor market. She told Bloomberg Television “it is very unlikely that we are in a recession,” but “we’re getting uncomfortably close to that situation.”

“A really important question is, where are we headed?” Sahm said. “And those changes in the employment rate that the Sahm rule picks up on do not look encouraging. They're headed in the wrong direction, and that momentum is what can get us in trouble.""

Why is Japan's yen gaining on the U.S. dollar?

The yen hit a 7-month high against the dollar Monday as investors weighed the prospects for more aggressive Federal Reserve rate cuts against higher rates in Japan.

If Japan is raising rates and the Fed is lowering them, traders likely will look to buy yen to catch the move up on rates and sell the dollar for better returns.

The yen had already been on the rise after the Bank of Japan unexpectedly hiked its short-term policy rate last Wednesday to 0.25% from 0.05% and signaled more increases ahead.

The Japanese currency got another leg up after the Labor Department reported weaker-than-expected jobs growth for July and a jump in the unemployment rate to 4.3%, triggering recession fears.

Rising Japanese rates also had other traders unwinding what’s called the carry trade, reports said. A carry trade is when investors borrow in yen at low interest rates and invest in higher-yielding assets elsewhere.

If Japanese rates rise, the carry trade becomes less profitable, leading investors to sell their higher-yielding investments and buy back yen, thus increasing its value.

Japan's Nikkei index fell to a seven year low on Monday.

Did the Fed wait too long to cut rates?

There are concerns the Fed waited too long to cut interest rates and will need to play catch-up with large cuts in borrowing costs to cushion the economy.

In June, U.S. central bankers anticipated only one cut this year, and saw the unemployment rate ending the year at 4%.

With the jobless rate now well above that, ""the soft landing in the U.S. labor market is in danger,"" wrote Nick Bunker, director of North American economic research at Indeed Hiring Lab, referring to a scenario where inflation is tamed without a painful recession or sharp rise in unemployment.

Goldman Sachs now sees a steady every-meeting series of Fed rate cuts and Citi called for half-percentage-point cuts in both September and December. JP Morgan said there was a strong case for a cut even before the Fed's next meeting.

“We'll see what happens over the next several weeks in terms of market environment, but if anything, I think this will encourage the Fed to take action, which is really what the market is looking for,” said Harvey Schwartz, CEO of private equity firm Carlyle.

−Bailey Schulz, with Reuters

What's a carry trade? And why is it linked to Monday's turmoil?

For months, market observers have been talking about a popular trade in which investors borrowed in Japanese yen at very low interest rates, and then invested the borrowed money in high-growth investments like the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks that include Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla and Meta.

Concerns about the carry trade had been rising for weeks, in part because of the enormous amount of money involved in it − an estimated $4 trillion. Those concerns soared on July 31, when the Bank of Japan raised interest rates from 0.1% to 0.25%.

That rate is still very low, of course, and in and of itself not a big deal for the carry trade. But it was the bank's largest rate hike since 2007, and currency traders took note of the implications.

With the yen stronger against the dollar, traders had to spend more to continue holding their ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks − and many chose to sell instead, helping to fuel a market panic.

Crypto hammered in mass sell-off

U.S.-listed shares of crypto-linked companies slumped as Bitcoin fell more than 15% on Monday amid a frenzied selling of risky assets.

The plunge marks a stunning reversal for the sector that until recently was riding a wave of optimism sparked by the approval of exchange-traded funds tied to the spot prices of Bitcoin and Ether, the two biggest cryptocurrencies.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's pro-crypto speech at a bitcoin conference last month also bolstered confidence, but data showing higher unemployment and weak manufacturing activity squeezed risky assets.

Outages at Vanguard, Schwab and others

As the stock market cratered this morning, thousands of customers reported outages at Vanguard, Schwab, TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, and Robinhood, according to downdetctor.com.

Schwab posted on X just after 9 a.m. ET “Due to a technical issue, some clients may have difficulty logging in to Schwab platforms” and “hold times may be longer than usual.”

Robinhood briefly halted trading on its 24-hour platform overnight, reports said. Fidelity also posted it was having issues Monday morning.

As trading moved into midday, downdetector.com data showed outages were easing.

Stay cool, experts tell investors

For regular Americans, there was little to do Monday but sit and watch the stock-ticker train wreck. While it's hard to stay calm as the stock market reels, amateur investors should at least try.

“My best advice is, don’t panic. Really, because you can’t,” said Catherine Valega, a certified financial planner in Boston.

If anything, financial advisers say, this summer stock swoon would be a great time to buy. “Stocks are on sale today, right?” Valega said. “If you have some cash, let’s go put some money in the market.”

What are circuit breakers?

In the event of a severe market price decline, U.S. exchanges have procedures, known as marketwide circuit breakers, that may halt trading temporarily or, under extreme circumstances, close the markets before the normal end of the trading session. The circuit breakers are calculated daily based on the prior day's value of the S&P 500 index.

By late Monday morning, the market wasn't approaching circuit-breaker territory. The S&P 500 was around 5200 − well above 4972.3, the tripwire for a Level 1 breaker.

The circuit breaker was last tripped 10 times in four days during a pandemic sell-off in 2020.

− Medora Lee

How much does the S&P 500 have to fall today to trigger circuit breakers?

Here are the three levels at which marketwide circuit breakers will be hit − and what happens if each one is breached:

◾ Level 1: 7% decline, or at 4,972.3 before 3:25 p.m.: Trading is halted for 15 minutes and then resumes unless level 3 is breached.

◾ Level 2: 13% decline, or at 4,651.5 before 3:25 p.m.: Trading is halted for 15 minutes and then resumes unless level 3 is breached.

◾ Level 3: 20% decline, or at 4,277.24 any time: Trading is halted for the remainder of the day.

Each circuit breaker can only be triggered once a day. For example, if a Level 1 market decline occurred and trading was halted and then reopened, the Exchange would not halt the market again unless a Level 2 decline occurred.

Where is this panic coming from?

The market panic has been building for days.

◾ Over the weekend, billionaire investment guru Warren Buffett ignited speculation he's soured on stocks as Berkshire Hathaway reported a $276.9 billion cash stake as of June 30, up from $189 billion, after selling another large portion of its stake in Apple.

◾ That reinforced investors' fears the economy may be slowing. The Labor Department reported Friday that the U.S. economy added only 114,000 jobs in July and the unemployment rate had jumped to 4.3%.

◾ Most worrying was the sharp rise in the jobless rate triggering what economists call the Sahm rule, which says that if unemployment rises by at least a half percentage point over the past 12 months, the nation is probably in a recession. The rule has correctly predicted all U.S. recessions since the 1970s.

Donald Trump and JD Vance hit Kamala Harris over market panic

Former President Donald Trump weighed in on the market carnage on Monday, pinning the blame not on overheated tech stocks, but on his November opponent: Vice President Kamala Harris.

""KAMALA CRASH!"" Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social website.

Mortgage rates:Daily mortgage rates for August 5, 2024: Rate movements mixed

Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance was more loquacious, using the stock market panic to assail Harris' leadership. ""This moment could set off a real economic calamity around the globe. It requires steady leadership--the kind President Trump delivered for four years,"" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. ""Kamala Harris is too afraid to answer media questions and cannot lead us in these troubled times.""

Neither post mentioned President Joe Biden.

The Democratic Party fired back with a post noting job losses during Trump's one-term presidency. ""Trump left office with fewer jobs than when he entered—one of the only presidents to do so. President @JoeBiden and Vice President @KamalaHarris have overseen nearly 16 million jobs created since they took office—one of the greatest economic comebacks of any administration.""

Did the stock market crash today? What's a 'market correction'?

It's turning into a wild day for investors, homeowners and people hoping to retire, with lots of market terminology flying across the internet. Here's a brief glossary of terms giving a name to the financial pain:

◾ Correction. A market drop of at least 10% from a recent high, which typically occurs about once a year

◾ Pullback. When a specific stock or the market retreats 5% to 9.99% from a peak. While corrections may prompt some investors to reach for the Xanax, pullbacks can also be unnerving after long stretches of market calm. That said, pullbacks – which normally occur three to four times a year – are viewed as healthy and as buying opportunities.

◾ Volatility. How much a stock or the market fluctuates in a period of time.

◾ Bear market. When a stock or market index falls 20% or more.

◾ Bull market. A sustained rise in stock prices without a bear market, or a 20% drop.

Who is Warren Buffett?

Buffett is a billionaire businessman and philanthropist whose influence on the U.S. stock market is significant. Dubbed the “Oracle of Omaha,” Buffett is considered one of the most successful investors of all time. He runs Berkshire Hathaway, a major conglomerate that owns GEICO, Duracell, Dairy Queen and other companies. And Berkshire's recent sale of a large portion of shares it owned in Apple sparked fears that Buffett might be souring on stocks amid a slowing economy.

Wall Street's 'fear gauge' spikes as stocks tumble

Wall Street's most watched gauge of investor anxiety logged its largest ever intraday jump on Monday, as U.S. stock futures tumbled on rising fears the country could be tipping into recession.

The CBOE Volatility Index jumped to a high of 65.73, up about 42 points from its close on Friday, as Wall Street looked set to continue the global stock rout that saw Japanese shares at one point exceed their 1987 ""Black Monday"" loss.

The VIX was last up 34 points at 57.15, its highest since March 2020.

""It seems like a liquidity crisis ... this is very, very unusual,"" said Joe Tigay, portfolio manager for Rational Equity Armor Fund.

Mortgage rates tumble

With the drop in Treasury yields, mortgage rates have followed.

That could open the door to refinancing, said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at comparison site Bankrate.

“After months of dawdling at or above the 7% mark, mortgage rates are reversing sharply,” he said. “If you took a mortgage at a rate above 7%, the refinancing door has swung open. If you have an adjustable-rate mortgage you’re looking to get out of, this is your chance. Mortgage rates are likely to fall further in the months ahead, but there are no guarantees and current rates are a bird in the hand for prospective borrowers.”

A 30-year fixed mortgage rate on Friday was 6.4%, according to Mortgage News Daily.

How are Treasurys reacting? And what are the odds of a Fed rate cut?

Treasurys are benefitting as safe-haven purchases amid the market turmoil, forcing yields to drop significantly. Yields and bond prices move in opposite directions.

Yields on 10-year Treasurys fell to the lowest in more than a year.

“The Federal Reserve left short-term rates unchanged, but expectations for future cuts increased,” Bas Kooijman, chief executive and asset manager of DHF Capital S.A, wrote in a note referring to the Fed's decision last week.

This morning, the CME FedWatch tool shows the odds for a Federal Reserve rate cut in September at 87.5%.

After Friday’s weak jobs report, many economists revised their rate cut forecasts. Instead of a quarter percentage point cut, they are now expecting a more aggressive half-point reduction.

Are we entering a recession? Fed's Goolsbee says no

Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Austan Goolsbee on Monday said while employment data on Friday was weaker than expected, it does not look like a recession. Fed officials must stay on top of changes in the environment to avoid being too restrictive with interest rates, he added, an apparent nod to recent calls for the Fed to cut rates.

""You only want to be that restrictive if you think there's fear of overheating,"" Goolsbee told CNBC. ""These data, to me, does not look like overheating.""

His comments came amid a global stock market selloff that accelerated on Monday in the aftermath of a disappointing U.S. employment report on Friday and the Fed's decision last week to leave interest rates unchanged. Fed officials, however, signaled they could cut rates at their next meeting in September.

Oil prices plummet over US recession and Mideast war fears

Oil prices dropped to a six-month low as investors worry about recession and war in the Middle East.

A recession would lessen demand for goods and services and therefore, oil for manufacturing and transporting.

Meanwhile, oil traders are worried about escalating tensions in the Middle East after Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday an Iranian attack on Israel could happen within 24 to 48 hours. Iran on Monday reportedly issued a notice to pilots and aviation authorities to avoid its airspace.

WTI was down 0.76% at $72.96 per barrel at 9:16 a.m.ET while Brent fell 0.66% to $76.30 per barrel.

Global stocks tumble on fears of U.S. recession and tech pullback.,https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/global-stock-markets-plunge/index.html,"There is always a lag between when rates go up and when the economy sees the full effects. That gap is generally between 9-15 months and is called the monetary lag.

By now, the Federal Reserve’s cumulative rate hikes are weighing down employment, which is always among the last bits of the economy to feel the effect. Why? Because companies are reluctant to lay off staff and take on new employees.

This is what we are seeing now. The Fed’s medicine has crushed inflation, but it’s also causing companies to lay off or not hire more staff.

So does the Fed need to start paring back its rate hike medicine before there’s any real damage to the economy? We don’t know and won’t know for many months ahead because the US economy is set for the time being.

Even if the Fed starts cutting rates next month, remember the monetary lag? One cut won’t make any difference. Two or three before the end of the year will have an effect ….by the spring of next year.

The biggest danger here is that everyone sees the market falling and gets panicked. Spending stops; worries grow; more jobs are lost; more spending stops; and a self-fulfilling downward spiral feeds on itself, making a bad situation worse. If the market continues to drop, the falling “wealth effect” we all feel will take its toll.

But there is one positive side: Back in 2022, when rates were at zero, the worry was the Fed had little room to maneuver to boost the economy. Today there are 500 basis points of interest rates that can be cut, cut and cut again. The Fed can certainly get the economy into a better place …but probably not before we’ve all suffered a bit more pain."

Global stock markets plummeted on Monday as worries mounted that the U.S. economy could be headed for a recession and investors dumped technology stocks and other risky assets.

The S&P 500 fell 3 per cent while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.4 per cent – the biggest one-day declines since September, 2022. Japan’s main stock index fell 12.4 per cent, the largest decline since Black Monday in 1987. Canadian markets were closed for the August long weekend.

The market rout, which saw the Dow Jones index tumble more than 1,000 points, or 2.6 per cent, reflects a sudden shift in narrative about the American economy. After weaker-than-expected U.S. employment data last week, investors have become concerned that the Federal Reserve has miscalculated and held interest rates too high for too long, jeopardizing a soft landing for the world’s largest economy.

These fears about the economy are blending with waning enthusiasm for large-cap technology stocks, which powered much of the growth in U.S. equity markets this year based on excitement about artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, in Japan, a sharp rise in the Yen in recent weeks has dampened the prospects for Japanese exporters and forced global traders to unwind positions that were based on a weak Japanese exchange rate.

The sell-off in stocks, which started with a bang on Monday morning then moderated somewhat throughout the day, was accompanied by wild swings in bond markets, as traders reassessed their outlook for U.S. monetary policy in real time. The yields on two-year Treasury bonds fell as much as 20 basis points before recovering that ground by the end of the day. (A basis-point is 1/100th of a percentage point).

A drop in stock prices does not, by itself, pose major risk to the real economy. However, extreme market volatility can tighten lending conditions and a fall in asset prices can weigh on consumer confidence.

“The key risk to our view is that the disorderly market reaction itself, if sustained, will feed through to a higher chance of recession,” Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients, which put the odds of a “hard landing” for the U.S. economy at 27 per cent.

“That could be because financial firms get into serious trouble due to the sharp market moves, or because firms respond to the tightening of financial conditions by cutting back on investment and headcount.”

The Bank of Canada is ahead of the Fed on monetary policy easing, having delivered two rate cuts so far this summer in response to falling inflation, tepid economic growth and rising unemployment. Governor Tiff Macklem said at the latest rate announcement that the central bank was putting more emphasis on downside risks to economic growth, instead of just focusing on the risk that inflation could rebound.

The sell-off began on Friday after the publication of the latest U.S. employment data, which showed fewer jobs were created in July than expected, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.3 per cent, the highest level in three years. This came only two days after the Federal Reserve opted to keep its benchmark interest rate steady at a two-decade high of 5.25 per cent to 5.5 per cent.

One bad jobs number doesn’t mean the U.S. is in a recession. Indeed, a range of other economic indicators suggest the American economy remains surprisingly robust despite highly restrictive interest rates. A gauge of the health of the U.S. service sector, published Monday, actually showed a rebound in July.

Still, the rise in unemployment breached something called the Sahm Rule, named after former Fed economist Claudia Sahm, which is seen by many as a reliable predictor of recessions. And it caused investors to second-guess their expectations of a soft landing, where inflation falls and interest rates decline in an orderly manner, without the economy cratering.

Investors now think the Fed will need to cut interest rates fast in the coming months to stimulate the economy and avoid a hard landing.

Financial markets are pricing in between 100 and 125 basis points of rate cuts before the end of the year. With only three Fed meetings left, that means markets expect policy makers to deliver oversized cuts. There were even suggestions from some analysts on Monday that the Fed should cut rates before the next meeting in September.

“The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an intermeeting cut seems flimsy,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3 per cent doesn’t really seem like an emergency.”

Central banks around the world are walking a tightrope. Inflation has come down considerably, and most economies have avoided the recessions that economists were predicting a year ago. The concern now is that many central bankers have been too slow to begin bringing interest rates back to a more normal level, making a downturn much more likely.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs raised their forecast for a U.S. recession over the next 12 months, putting the probability at around 25 per cent, up from 15 per cent.

The market slump on Friday and Monday still leaves U.S. stock indices up considerably this year. While the Nasdaq Composite is down 13 per cent and the S&P 500 is off 8.5 per cent since peaking in July, both are still up nearly 10 per cent since the start of the year.

Some of Wall Street’s recent declines may also simply be air coming out of a stock market that romped to dozens of historic highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology and hopes for coming cuts to interest rates. Critics have been saying for a while that the stock market looked expensive after prices rose faster than corporate profits.

“Markets tend to move higher like they’re climbing stairs, and they go down like they’re falling out a window,” according to JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America. He said much of the recent sell-off was due to subsiding euphoria around AI and “a market that was ahead of itself.”

The stock price for Nvidia Corp. NVDA-Q, the chipmaker most associated with the AI boom, fell as much as 12 per cent on Monday, and finished the day down 6.3 per cent. Alphabet Inc. GOOGL-Q stock was down 4.6 per cent while Apple Inc. AAPL-Q stock fell 4.8 per cent.

Apple may also have been hit by the disclosure over the weekend that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway had halved its ownership stake in the company.

The biggest fall in stock prices happened in Japan, where several macroeconomic and technical factors combined to create a massive pullback by investors.

The Bank of Japan raised interest rates last week, putting additional upward pressure on the Yen, which has already appreciated considerably over the past month.

The Yen’s appreciation has prompted a messy unwinding of a popular strategy called the “carry trade,” which involves borrowing money at low interest rates in Japan and investing in higher-yielding assets in other countries. It’s also hitting Japanese stock prices, as a rise in the Yen compared with other currencies tends to hurt the profits of Japanese exporters.

Other markets sold off as well on Monday. South Korea’s benchmark index declined 8.8 per cent, Britain’s FTSE 100 fell 2 per cent and the S&P Euro 350 was down 2.12 per cent.

Global stocks tumble on fears of U.S. recession and tech pullback.,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stock-market-today-dow-jones-s-p-500-down/,"Stocks in the U.S. plunged for a third consecutive trading day, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbling more than 1,000 points amid growing fears of an economic downturn sparked by a slowdown in hiring and consumer spending.

The S&P 500 slid 160 points, or 3%, to 5,186 on Monday, the index's biggest one-day drop in nearly two years, according to FactSet. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite sank 3.4% as investors fled some of the Big Tech players that until recently had powered the U.S. market higher — Apple shed 4.8%, while Meta and Nvidia, fell 2.5% and 6.4%, respectively.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 1,034 points, shedding 2.6% of its value. Earlier in the day, it had lost as more than 1,200 points, but the markets regained some of their early losses as Wall Street digested Monday data from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Services index, which showed that service employment picked up in July.

""The details of the ISM report were encouraging, with business activity, new orders and employment all rebounding markedly in July,"" Oxford Economics said in a Monday research note. The report ""aligns with our view of an economy in transition rather than one on the brink of collapse.""

Even with Monday's rout, U.S. stocks still remain in positive territory this year. The S&P 500 has gained 9.4% in 2024, even after including its recent slide, while the Dow remains up by 2.6%.

Stocks lost ground on Thursday after weak reports on manufacturing and construction, which stoked fears the U.S. economy may finally be buckling under the pressure of high interest rates.

Then on Friday, government data showed that hiring last month was far weaker than expected, adding to Wall Street's fears that a ""soft landing,"" in which the U.S. economy could avoid a recession despite the highest interest rates in 23 years, could instead become a hard landing.

""The main factor that has staying power is the economy's slowdown,"" wrote Wells Fargo head of global investment strategy Paul Christopher in a report. ""Investors have been watching household financial stress build for the past two years, but during that time, job growth remained above its December 2009-December 2019 average of 180,000 new jobs per month.""

But Friday's jobs report showed that employers added only 114,000 new jobs last month, far fewer than the 175,000 jobs expected by economists, he noted.

Tech stocks have been hit particularly hard in recent weeks as investors pull back from artificial intelligence companies amid questions about when the emerging sector will deliver profits.

""It has been a tough few weeks for the AI group as earnings were reported,"" analysts with Melius Research wrote. 'Microsoft, Meta, Google and Amazon were all asked about payoffs from AI investments. While pretty clear that they all need to keep spending, the market remains skeptical of the pace.""

The market rout extended to Asian and European markets, with Japan's benchmark stock index plunging 12.4% on Monday. The Nikkei had dropped 5.8% on Friday, making this its worst two-day decline ever.

Stocks in Korea and Taiwan also fell sharply, with all three Asian markets damaged as investors pull back from companies focused on artificial intelligence out of concern the sector has been overhyped.

When will the Fed cut rates?

With the disappointing economic data, Wall Street is worried the Federal Reserve may have kept its benchmark interest rate too high for too long, heightening the risk of a recession. The central bank kept the federal funds rate unchanged when it met on July 31 to discuss economic conditions and whether and when it should begin cutting rates.

A rate cut would make it less expensive for U.S. households and companies to borrow money, but it could take time for the effects to boost the economy. On Monday, some investors called for the Fed to start cutting rates sooner rather than later to stave off an economic downturn.

""The Federal Reserve needs to start easing monetary policy more aggressively than had been anticipated, in order to head off a looming recession in the world's largest economy,"" said Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, an independent financial advisory and asset management firm, in an email. ""The Fed was behind the curve at the beginning of the cycle, it cannot afford to be behind the curve this time too.""

Economists still don't expect a recession

Although worries over weakness in the U.S. economy and volatile markets have rippled around the world, domestic economic activity remains solid, with many analysts saying that a recession remains unlikely. Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist with Capital Economics, still expects a soft landing, while acknowledging that the risk of a sharper downturn is rising.

The economy has accelerated this year, with the nation's gross domestic product jumping to 2.8% in the second quarter, blowing past forecasts. A recession is typically marked by two consecutive quarters of negative GDP. And although July's jobs report was disappointing, analysts point out that it reflects just one month of data, while also noting that the depressed hiring figures in July could have also been impacted by Hurricane Beryl.

""It can be a mistake to read too much into a single data release,"" noted Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, told investors in a research note. ""The number of people who reported being unable to work [in July] due to the weather was 436,000; this compares to an average of 33,000 for July since 2000.""

Investors are also concerned that the Federal Reserve is behind in cutting interest rates to bolster an economic slowdown, with the central bank choosing instead to keep rates at the highest in two decades last week.

Japan's stock market posted its worst drop since Wall Street's Black Monday in 1987, contributing to fears of global turmoil in the markets.

The Dow dropped 1,033.99 points, or 2.6%, to end at 38,703.27. The Nasdaq Composite lost 3.43% and closed at 16,200.08, while the S&P 500 slid 3% to end at 5,186.33. The blue-chip Dow and S&P 500 registered their biggest daily losses since September 2022.

Stocks fell sharply on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting its worst day in nearly two years, as worries over the health of the U.S. economy sparked a global market sell-off.

Investors are continuing to sell off megacap tech stocks and the once-hot artificial intelligence trade. Tech shares were among the worst performers Monday:

In Asia overnight, Japan stocks confirmed a bear market as Asia-Pacific investors had their first chance to react to the sour jobs figures in the U.S. from Friday. The 12.4% loss on the Nikkei, which closed at 31,458.42, was the worst day for the index since the ""Black Monday"" of 1987 hit Wall Street. The loss of 4,451.28 points on the index was also the largest in terms of points in its entire history. The Dow lost more than 22% in a single day on Black Monday.

Other global markets were also severely affected:

U.S. Treasury yields tumbled on the recession fears and as investors flooded into bonds for a global safe haven. Bond prices move inversely to yields. The benchmark 10-year note on Monday last yielded 3.78%. The benchmark yield hit its lowest level since June 2023.

Bitcoin tumbled from nearly $62,000 on Friday to around $54,000 on Monday.

Europe's Stoxx 600 was off by 2.2%.

The Cboe Volatility Index

There is also chatter about the unwind of the yen ""carry trade"" adding fuel to the global market decline after the Bank of Japan raised interest rates last week, reducing the interest rate differential between Japan and the U.S. That has contributed to the yen rising in value versus the dollar, ending a practice of traders borrowing in the cheap currency to buy other global assets.

""The market was whistling past the graveyard. I think people were basically lulled into a sense of security, yet the market itself was very vulnerable to a correction — and the weaker than expected economic and employment data provided that catalyst for correction,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. The S&P 500 is currently around 8.5% off from its recent high.

Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, while avoiding commitment to a specific course of action, indicated on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Monday that interest rates at their current level may be too ""restrictive.""

If economic conditions meaningfully deteriorate, the central bank will ""fix it,"" Goolsbee added.

Just 22 stocks in the S&P 500 were higher in the brutal session for investors."

What had been growing scrutiny on the Federal Reserve morphed into broad-based criticism that the central bank has been too slow to cut interest rates.

While the most recent jobs report caused some market commentators to argue the Federal Reserve should have cut rates sooner — it held them steady again at 5.5% last week as it sought to further dampen inflation — other analysts pushed back on that idea. The latter group gained support when the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) published data today showing services businesses were still seeing healthy demand."

The S&P 500 and the Dow saw their biggest drops since September 2022. The market carnage shaved $907 billion off Nasdaq's market value.

“So much for the summer lull,” said Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, in a commentary. “Stock markets are in turmoil and bond yields have plunged as fears about a U.S. recession have taken hold.”

Driving the rout: Sharp declines in high-flying tech stocks including Nvidia, Apple, and Amazon, and a disappointing jobs report. Apple had its worst day since September 2022, shedding 4.82%. As investors ran to buy U.S. Treasurys, mortgage rates declined, opening the door for some borrowers to refinance, experts said.

These are the day's top develoments.

Biden mum on stock market rout, while Trump attacks

President Joe Biden didn’t respond directly to Monday’s market panic, and instead released a statement touting his student loan forgiveness program and the expansion of college Pell grants.

The White House kept its head down as Donald Trump and his allies worked overtime to pin the stock market carnage on Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee.

As the tech-heavy Nasdaq index shed more than $900 billion in value and the Dow Jones average lost more than 1,000 points, Biden released a statement on X apparently aimed at younger voters.

“In three years, my Administration canceled student debt for nearly 5 million borrowers through various actions, made the largest increases to the Pell Grant in a decade, and fixed Income-Driven Repayment so borrowers get the relief they are entitled to,” the statement said. “I'm not done yet.”

Trump reveled in labeling the day’s losses the “Kamala Krash.” Earlier this year, the former president took credit for record stock market highs, calling them a signal that investors favored his campaign to retake the White House.

What does Chicago Fed President Goolsbee say about rate cuts?

The Federal Reserve has only two jobs by law: stabilize prices and maximize employment, Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee emphasized in an interview with USA TODAY.

“That's the dual mandate,” he said. “That's the thing that will determine what the Fed does on rates. There's nothing in the Fed's mandate that says stop market declines. Or, you know, keep traders whole on days when there's volatility, right?”

""If the economy starts to deteriorate, the Fed's job is to act − and we will act appropriately,” he said.

What does Goolsbee say about the jobs report?

Goolsbee admitted the jobs report was “negative” but also noted it was only one month of data. The payrolls increase of 114,000 may have missed economists’ average forecast of 175,000, but he said that’s within the margin of error, which is plus or minus 100,000.

“The job of the central bank is to be steady and take the totality of the evidence when making decisions,” he said. “So if you get down in the weeds of this jobs report, it was negative, but there were some things that were cross currents that make it … a little less directly clear. Like the unemployment rate went up more than people thought, but the labor participation rate and the employment to population ratio both rose, which is kind of unusual. Normally, the recessionary signs are when the unemployment rate is rising because layoffs are going up.”

Goolsbee added that “the Fed set the rate at the level it is now a year ago, and the conditions were very different a year ago than they are today” and it may be time to reconsider those rates. The Fed funds target rate is currently at a 23-year high, between 5.25%-5.5%.

“You only want to be that restrictive if you're afraid of (the economy) overheating,” he said. “And my thing is, this is not really what overheating looks like.”

How likely is a recession?

While some economists say current market conditions raise the risk of a recession within the next 12 months, others are downplaying concerns.

“The recession fears are overblown,” said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo. “It’s not time to panic here.”

The USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast. Download for award-winning coverage, crosswords, audio storytelling, the eNewspaper and more.

Wells Fargo economists said they expect an economic slowdown – not a recession − noting the labor market is in the early stages of weakening and “still some distance away from even the most moderate, modern recession,” which took place in 2001. The bank also noted consumer spending has potential to grow as household purchasing power strengthens.

Goldman Sachs Group on Sunday raised the probability of a recession within the next year from 15% to 25% but see the risk as “limited,” Bloomberg reported.

Recession worries stem, in part, from the July job report’s triggering of the Sahm rule, a measure that says if unemployment based on a three-month average rises by at least a half percentage point over the past 12 months, the nation is likely in a recession.

Claudia Sahm, a former Federal Reserve economist, cautioned against taking too much of a signal from her namesake rule in a post-COVID labor market. She told Bloomberg Television “it is very unlikely that we are in a recession,” but “we’re getting uncomfortably close to that situation.”

“A really important question is, where are we headed?” Sahm said. “And those changes in the employment rate that the Sahm rule picks up on do not look encouraging. They're headed in the wrong direction, and that momentum is what can get us in trouble.""

Why is Japan's yen gaining on the U.S. dollar?

The yen hit a 7-month high against the dollar Monday as investors weighed the prospects for more aggressive Federal Reserve rate cuts against higher rates in Japan.

If Japan is raising rates and the Fed is lowering them, traders likely will look to buy yen to catch the move up on rates and sell the dollar for better returns.

The yen had already been on the rise after the Bank of Japan unexpectedly hiked its short-term policy rate last Wednesday to 0.25% from 0.05% and signaled more increases ahead.

The Japanese currency got another leg up after the Labor Department reported weaker-than-expected jobs growth for July and a jump in the unemployment rate to 4.3%, triggering recession fears.

Rising Japanese rates also had other traders unwinding what’s called the carry trade, reports said. A carry trade is when investors borrow in yen at low interest rates and invest in higher-yielding assets elsewhere.

If Japanese rates rise, the carry trade becomes less profitable, leading investors to sell their higher-yielding investments and buy back yen, thus increasing its value.

Japan's Nikkei index fell to a seven year low on Monday.

Did the Fed wait too long to cut rates?

There are concerns the Fed waited too long to cut interest rates and will need to play catch-up with large cuts in borrowing costs to cushion the economy.

In June, U.S. central bankers anticipated only one cut this year, and saw the unemployment rate ending the year at 4%.

With the jobless rate now well above that, ""the soft landing in the U.S. labor market is in danger,"" wrote Nick Bunker, director of North American economic research at Indeed Hiring Lab, referring to a scenario where inflation is tamed without a painful recession or sharp rise in unemployment.

Goldman Sachs now sees a steady every-meeting series of Fed rate cuts and Citi called for half-percentage-point cuts in both September and December. JP Morgan said there was a strong case for a cut even before the Fed's next meeting.

“We'll see what happens over the next several weeks in terms of market environment, but if anything, I think this will encourage the Fed to take action, which is really what the market is looking for,” said Harvey Schwartz, CEO of private equity firm Carlyle.

−Bailey Schulz, with Reuters

What's a carry trade? And why is it linked to Monday's turmoil?

For months, market observers have been talking about a popular trade in which investors borrowed in Japanese yen at very low interest rates, and then invested the borrowed money in high-growth investments like the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks that include Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla and Meta.

Concerns about the carry trade had been rising for weeks, in part because of the enormous amount of money involved in it − an estimated $4 trillion. Those concerns soared on July 31, when the Bank of Japan raised interest rates from 0.1% to 0.25%.

That rate is still very low, of course, and in and of itself not a big deal for the carry trade. But it was the bank's largest rate hike since 2007, and currency traders took note of the implications.

With the yen stronger against the dollar, traders had to spend more to continue holding their ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks − and many chose to sell instead, helping to fuel a market panic.

Crypto hammered in mass sell-off

U.S.-listed shares of crypto-linked companies slumped as Bitcoin fell more than 15% on Monday amid a frenzied selling of risky assets.

The plunge marks a stunning reversal for the sector that until recently was riding a wave of optimism sparked by the approval of exchange-traded funds tied to the spot prices of Bitcoin and Ether, the two biggest cryptocurrencies.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's pro-crypto speech at a bitcoin conference last month also bolstered confidence, but data showing higher unemployment and weak manufacturing activity squeezed risky assets.

What are circuit breakers?

In the event of a severe market price decline, U.S. exchanges have procedures, known as marketwide circuit breakers, that may halt trading temporarily or, under extreme circumstances, close the markets before the normal end of the trading session. The circuit breakers are calculated daily based on the prior day's value of the S&P 500 index.

By late Monday morning, the market wasn't approaching circuit-breaker territory. The S&P 500 was around 5200 − well above 4972.3, the tripwire for a Level 1 breaker.

The circuit breaker was last tripped 10 times in four days during a pandemic sell-off in 2020.

− Medora Lee

How much does the S&P 500 have to fall today to trigger circuit breakers?

Here are the three levels at which marketwide circuit breakers will be hit − and what happens if each one is breached:

◾ Level 1: 7% decline, or at 4,972.3 before 3:25 p.m.: Trading is halted for 15 minutes and then resumes unless level 3 is breached.

◾ Level 2: 13% decline, or at 4,651.5 before 3:25 p.m.: Trading is halted for 15 minutes and then resumes unless level 3 is breached.

◾ Level 3: 20% decline, or at 4,277.24 any time: Trading is halted for the remainder of the day.

Each circuit breaker can only be triggered once a day. For example, if a Level 1 market decline occurred and trading was halted and then reopened, the Exchange would not halt the market again unless a Level 2 decline occurred.

Where is this panic coming from?

The market panic has been building for days.

◾ Over the weekend, billionaire investment guru Warren Buffett ignited speculation he's soured on stocks as Berkshire Hathaway reported a $276.9 billion cash stake as of June 30, up from $189 billion, after selling another large portion of its stake in Apple.

◾ That reinforced investors' fears the economy may be slowing. The Labor Department reported Friday that the U.S. economy added only 114,000 jobs in July and the unemployment rate had jumped to 4.3%.

◾ Most worrying was the sharp rise in the jobless rate triggering what economists call the Sahm rule, which says that if unemployment rises by at least a half percentage point over the past 12 months, the nation is probably in a recession. The rule has correctly predicted all U.S. recessions since the 1970s.

Donald Trump and JD Vance hit Kamala Harris over market panic

Former President Donald Trump weighed in on the market carnage on Monday, pinning the blame not on overheated tech stocks, but on his November opponent: Vice President Kamala Harris.

""KAMALA CRASH!"" Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social website.

""Kamala Harris is too afraid to answer media questions and cannot lead us in these troubled times.""

Neither post mentioned President Joe Biden.

The Democratic Party fired back with a post noting job losses during Trump's one-term presidency. ""Trump left office with fewer jobs than when he entered—one of the only presidents to do so.

Did the stock market crash today? What's a 'market correction'?

It's turning into a wild day for investors, homeowners and people hoping to retire, with lots of market terminology flying across the internet. Here's a brief glossary of terms giving a name to the financial pain:

◾ Correction. A market drop of at least 10% from a recent high, which typically occurs about once a year

◾ Pullback. When a specific stock or the market retreats 5% to 9.99% from a peak. While corrections may prompt some investors to reach for the Xanax, pullbacks can also be unnerving after long stretches of market calm. That said, pullbacks – which normally occur three to four times a year – are viewed as healthy and as buying opportunities.

◾ Volatility. How much a stock or the market fluctuates in a period of time.

◾ Bear market. When a stock or market index falls 20% or more.

◾ Bull market. A sustained rise in stock prices without a bear market, or a 20% drop.

Who is Warren Buffett?

Buffett is a billionaire businessman and philanthropist whose influence on the U.S. stock market is significant. Dubbed the “Oracle of Omaha,” Buffett is considered one of the most successful investors of all time. He runs Berkshire Hathaway, a major conglomerate that owns GEICO, Duracell, Dairy Queen and other companies. And Berkshire's recent sale of a large portion of shares it owned in Apple sparked fears that Buffett might be souring on stocks amid a slowing economy.

Mortgage rates tumble

With the drop in Treasury yields, mortgage rates have followed.

That could open the door to refinancing, said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at comparison site Bankrate.

“After months of dawdling at or above the 7% mark, mortgage rates are reversing sharply,” he said. “If you took a mortgage at a rate above 7%, the refinancing door has swung open. If you have an adjustable-rate mortgage you’re looking to get out of, this is your chance. Mortgage rates are likely to fall further in the months ahead, but there are no guarantees and current rates are a bird in the hand for prospective borrowers.”

Are we entering a recession? Fed's Goolsbee says no

Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Austan Goolsbee on Monday said while employment data on Friday was weaker than expected, it does not look like a recession.

""You only want to be that restrictive if you think there's fear of overheating,"" Goolsbee told CNBC. ""These data, to me, does not look like overheating.""

His comments came amid a global stock market selloff that accelerated on Monday in the aftermath of a disappointing U.S. employment report on Friday and the Fed's decision last week to leave interest rates unchanged. Fed officials, however, signaled they could cut rates at their next meeting in September.

U.S. economy may be slowing down

Japan's benchmark stock index plunged 12.4% on Monday, compounding a global market rout set off by investor concerns that the the U.S. economy could be headed for a recession.

A report Friday showing hiring by U.S. employers slowed last month by much more than expected has convulsed financial markets, vanquishing the euphoria that had taken the Nikkei 225 to all-times highs of over 42,000 in recent weeks.

The shakeup began just a couple of days after U.S. stock indexes had jumped to their best day in months after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell set the stage for possible rate cuts to begin in September.

But after Friday's jobs report, worries are rising the Fed may have kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high for too long, raising risks of a recession in the world's largest economy. A rate cut would make it less expensive for U.S. households and companies to borrow money but it could take time for the effects to boost the economy.

""Specifically, the scenario of higher unemployment constraining spending and further restraining hiring and incomes and economic activity leading to a recession is the feared scenario here,"" Tan Boon Heng of Mizuho Bank in Singapore said in a report.

U.S. financial markets swooned Friday after the downbeat employment report. The S&P 500 sank 1.8% on the day, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 2.4% and fell into ""correction"" territory, or when stocks slide at least 10% from their previous high. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 1.5%.

The dour mood on Wall Street looked set to continue Monday, with Nasdaq futures down roughly 800 point, or 4.2%, as of 7:09 a.m. Eastern Time, while S&P 500 and Dow futures were off 2.8% and 1.9%, respectively.

""Investors are feeling massive pain globally as the Nikkei historic 12%+ overnight sell-off has triggered market carnage, with U.S. markets trading heavy in the red across the board,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a report.

Investors will be watching for data on the U.S. services sector from the U.S. Institute for Supply Management due later Monday that may help determine if the selloffs around the world are an overreaction, Yeap Jun Rong of IG said in a report.

Even though worries over weakness in the U.S. economy and volatile markets have rippled around the world, the U.S. economy is still growing and a recession is far from a certainty.

Until Friday, there had been relatively few huge market swings in the past year.

A bonanza around artificial intelligence technology helped drive Big Tech stocks higher, while other areas of the market held up amid rising hopes for coming cuts to interest rates. But professional investors have been warning that shakier times may be ahead given uncertainty about how quickly the Fed will cut rates and other big questions.

European markets also opened lower Monday, with Germany's DAX down 2.3% at 17,267.00. The CAC 40 in Paris lost 1.9% to 7,114.33 and the FTSE 100 in London was 2.1% lower at 8,004.19.

Share prices have fallen in Tokyo since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. The Nikkei is now down 3.8% from a year ago.

The Japanese yen also has fallen sharply, trading at 142.37 yen, down from 146.45 late Friday and sharply below its level of over 160 yen a few weeks ago.

The euro rose to $1.0952 from $1.0923.

""To put it mildly, the spike in volatility-of-volatility is a spectacle that underlines just how jittery markets have become,"" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. ""The real question now looms: Can the typical market reflex to sell volatility or buy the market dip prevail over the deep-seated anxiety brought on by this sudden and sharp recession scare?"""
Global stocks tumble on fears of U.S. recession and tech pullback.,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/05/business/stocks-market-crash-economy,"As turmoil swept through global financial markets on Monday, fueled by concerns that the economy is headed for a hard landing, investors began to speculate that the Federal Reserve could jump in to cushion the fallout with an emergency interest rate cut.

But a market sell-off is unlikely to prod the Fed to lower rates before its Sept. 18 meeting, especially at a time when economic data have yet to show conclusively that the economy is entering a recession.

The latest jobs report does leave officials with worrying evidence that the job market is slowing. But it was just one month of data, and it came at a time when consumer spending is holding up. Given that — and given how high the bar is for the Fed to cut rates outside of regularly scheduled meetings — Fed officials and careful Fed watchers suggested that the jump in unemployment and the sell-off in stocks were unlikely to be enough to spur an emergency inter-meeting move.

“We’ve got to be monitoring the real side of the economy: There’s nothing in the Fed’s mandate that’s about making sure the stock market is comfortable,” Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said in an interview on Monday afternoon.

The Fed calls unscheduled meetings to adjust interest its policy stance only in extreme situations. The most recent instance happened on March 15, 2020, when central bankers slashed borrowing costs to near zero as the onset of the coronavirus pandemic sent panic coursing across global markets and caused a widespread breakdown in how markets functioned.

Monday’s sell-off was far less drastic than that moment. Investors dumped stocks because they have become nervous that the economy might fall into a recession after a few weak economic data releases in the United States, including a jobs report last Friday that showed unemployment rising. But even as they sank, markets continued to trade in an orderly fashion.

Still, the sell-off was a symptom of a problem that Fed officials are watching cautiously. Joblessness rarely rises sharply outside of an economic downturn, making last week’s employment report concerning.

The data have fueled serious concerns that Fed officials have fallen behind on adjusting their policy stance. Central bankers have held interest rates at 5.3 percent for a full year, a relatively high setting that is making it expensive to borrow to buy a home or expand a business. The risk is that Fed policymakers might have choked off demand too much for too long, causing a slowdown in the labor market that will begin to snowball into wider economic pain.

“We’ve now confirmed that the labor market is slowing, and it’s extremely important that we not let it slow so much that it tips itself into a downturn,” Mary C. Daly, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said on Monday evening. She added that it was not yet clear just how serious the labor market slowdown would prove.

While a rate cut at the Fed’s September meeting was widely expected even before the employment report last week, traders now see a large reduction of half a percentage point or more — bigger than the quarter-point moves that the Fed tends to announce during normal times.

“People always ask how much — is it 25, is it 50, is it three meetings in a row, is it every other meeting?” Ms. Daly said. The Fed’s policy-setting committee is “prepared to do what the economy needs when we are clear what that is,” she said, “and there’s many more pieces of information that come out between now and when we next meet, and we’ll use all of that information.”

Her comment was important for two reasons: It made it clear that a larger-than-normal rate increase is possible next month. But it also threw cold water on the idea that the Fed might cut interest rates before its scheduled meeting, as some investors guessed on Monday that it might.

Several longtime Fed watchers pointed out that the central bank tends to make emergency moves between meetings only when there is a risk that markets are going to stop functioning properly, not just because stock prices are falling.

“I think what you generally find is that they tend to happen in periods of credit market disruption and financial system freezing up — right now, markets are having not a good day, but I think it’s orderly,” said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan.

Mr. Goolsbee, from the Chicago Fed, said the idea of an inter-meeting rate cut was “outside of” his “wheelhouse,” but also emphasized that the stock market was overreacting to “one data point.”

Mr. Goolsbee also noted that jobs numbers come with a margin of error — the numbers can jump around for quirky reasons, and they get revised — and suggested that it was too early to draw firm conclusions from July’s report.

But both he and a wide array of economists have been watching other data as they begin to show signs that the economy is beginning to weaken.

Jobless claims have moved higher. Manufacturing activity is showing evidence of a cool-down. And while growth and consumer spending have held up so far, those tend to be slow to adjust at the start of economic pullbacks.

Given the mounting evidence that the economy might be on the cusp of softening, there is a risk that it will look in hindsight like the Fed waited too long to begin reducing rates.

Although officials discussed cutting borrowing costs at their meeting last week, they held off, choosing to wait for some final confirming evidence that inflation is fully under control, hopeful that the economy was strong enough for them to take their time.

That timing proved to be unfortunate. In the two days immediately after policymakers made that decision, reports showed a pop in jobless claims and a jump in the unemployment rate. Officials would not have had the employment report in hand as they were making the decision.

“There are no mulligans in monetary policy, unfortunately, but we’ll probably look back and say, yes, they waited too long,” Mr. Feroli said. “In real time, it didn’t seem obvious.”"
Global stocks tumble on fears of U.S. recession and tech pullback.,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/05/wall-street-reacts-to-global-market-sell-off.html,"(This is CNBC Pro's live coverage of Monday's Wall Street chatter as global markets sell off.) Stock markets around the world are selling off to start the week, as investors fear the U.S. could be headed into a recession amid a spate of softening economic data. Japan's Nikkei 225 had its biggest one-day drop since 1987 overnight, losing 12.4% . The Korean Kospi index also shed 8.7%. In Europe , the Stoxx 600 index has shed more than 2%. U.S. stocks also fell sharply on Monday. Despite the sharp losses, several investors and strategists advised against panicking at this point. That said, JPMorgan's top charts analyst thinks this could be the "" start of something bigger ."" Follow along for the latest chatter and reaction to the sell-off. All times ET. 5:10 p.m.: Ed Yardeni: 'Market will stabilize' once unwind in the yen carry trade ends The market's recent sell-off will be quick to recover once the massive unwind in the Japanese yen ""carry trade"" ends, according to Yardeni Research president Ed Yardeni. ""The issue here, in my opinion, is the carry trade,"" Yardeni said on CNBC's ""Closing Bell."" ""A lot of what's going on now is, in fact, related to these carry trades and I think once they wash out — and I think it'll happen pretty quickly here — I think the market will stabilize and we'll be back looking at the fundamentals of the economy."" ""And notwithstanding Friday's numbers, I think the economy is fine, the labor market's fine,"" he continued, referring to July's disappointing payrolls data. Carry trades refer to the process of investors borrowing in a currency with low interest rates, like Japan's yen, and then reinvesting the proceeds in assets with a higher rate of return. Many investors have cited the rising yen, along with recent disappointing U.S. manufacturing and jobs data, among the primary reasons for the sell-off in U.S. stocks. — Pia Singh 3:35 p.m.: Raymond James CIO remains bullish on tech amid recent pessimism Monday's volatility is a green light for tech buyers, according to Raymond James' chief investment officer Larry Adam. ""We believe we are still in the early stages of this bull market (1.8 years) versus history where bull markets tend to last 5.5 years,"" Adam said, adding that he views the recent pullbacks as a buying opportunity. He noted that the broader market typically sees three to four 5% pullbacks in a year, and that 2024 has seen only two. Adam reiterated his year-end target of 5,400 for the S & P 500 and said he continues to favor the tech sector, particularly the mega-cap tech companies. ""Because of the pullback, valuations have gotten much more attractive, with the big cap tech stocks trading at the bottom end of the range versus the S & P 500, which tends to be an area of opportunity for the sector,"" Adam said on Monday, noting the strong earnings growth and cash hoard of the group. ""We believe that the AI trend is still in its early stages. In fact, as the theme matures, it should extend beyond the early beneficiaries,"" he added. — Pia Singh 3:20 p.m.: Investor 'stampede' has created buying opportunities, says Macquarie The market sell-off Monday was akin to a ""stampede"" that investors may want to avoid, according to Macquarie. ""According to Britannica, a stampede is 'an occurrence in which a large group of frightened animals or people run together in a wild and uncontrolled way to escape from something,'"" said Viktor Shvets, the firm's head of global and Asia Pacific strategy. In this case, the ""something"" was actually a number of events, including the perception that the Federal Reserve is behind the curve in cutting interest rates, concerns over a tech bubble and the potential unwind of the Yen carry trade, he wrote in a note Monday. However, Shvets believes the U.S. can avoid a recession and that tech valuations are nowhere near bubble territory. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar-yen exchange rates are only back to those of late 2023 and the fundamental reasons for carry trade are still intact, he added. ""Although stampedes are inherently unpredictable, we view it is closer to irrational, thus creating buying rather than selling opportunities,"" he said. — Michelle Fox 1:45 p.m.: Investors should 'embrace this volatility,' says KKM Financial's Jeff Kilburg Against the backdrop of a global equity sell-off, the Cboe Volatility Index — or VIX, a popular gauge of volatility in the market — spiked on Monday. But Jeff Kilburg, founder and CEO of KKM Financial, views this as a buying opportunity for investors. ""I want to take this and embrace this volatility. We are looking to reposition,"" he told CNBC's "" The Exchange "" on Monday. ""The VIX — you have to use it to your advantage to mitigate risk, to find risk and also allocate towards risk when other people are fearful."" One opportunity Kilburg is eyeing is Tesla, which has been very volatile recently as the laggard of the Magnificent Seven cohort. But more generally, the investor sees a buying opportunity whenever there's a ""swoosh"" down in any of these seven names. Kilburg added that volatility should remain elevated but still manageable going forward. — Lisa Kailai Han 1:26 p.m.: Monday's sell-off is a buying opportunity, Nationwide investment research chief says There's a silver lining in Monday's sell-off for long-term investors, according to Nationwide chief of investment research Mark Hackett. ""This surge in volatility seems like an overreaction driven by emotions and the absence of share repurchases, swinging the pendulum aggressively to the downside,"" Hackett said in a note to clients. ""For disciplined investors, today's volatility presents a buying opportunity … Patience and a measured approach are crucial, as there are no signs of fundamental issues in the market."" Hackett advised investors to pick up shares of undervalued groups in the market, like small-cap stocks, value names and international stocks. The roughly 3% drop in the broader market is not unusual during periods of a correction, and these drops have historically been followed by a recovery, he said. — Pia Singh 1:21 p.m.: Possible that markets have overshot to the downside, Ned Davis Research says Ned Davis Research's Joe Kalish thinks markets may be overreacting to some of the recent data that has sparked the global sell-off. ""Although the BLS said, 'Hurricane Beryl had no discernible effect' on the national data, we found the underlying data was riddled with weather related impacts, thereby overstating the widespread weakness in the report,"" Kalish wrote. ""Yet, the market is pricing 125 bp of rate cuts this year and a fed funds target range of 3.00% to 3.25% by the second half of next year,"" he added. ""Although we may get there, that is not our call at this time."" — Fred Imbert 11:40 a.m.: Wolfe Research's Chris Senyek is still a believer in the AI theme Despite a mixed tech earnings season and the global equities sell-off, Wolfe Research's chief investment strategist Chris Senyek remains bullish on the artificial intelligence theme. ""I'm still a big believer in the AI theme and the AI spend I don't think there's really any big signs of that slowing down,"" he said Monday in a CNBC ""Money Movers"" interview. Senyek noted that August is traditionally one of the seasonally weakest periods of time for the market, and chalked that up to some of the volatility currently plaguing investors. ""Our broadening view is that the Fed's going to cut, we're going to have a soft landing with the economy slowing a little bit,"" he added. — Lisa Kailai Han 11:32 a.m.: S & P 500 could be due for more downside, says JPMorgan's Jason Hunter JPMorgan head of technical strategy Jason Hunter said the S & P 500 could see further declines ahead, noting that the market sell-off could be ""the start of something bigger."" ""We think there's enough evidence in the lower frequency bigger picture charts and cross markets setup that suggests yes, this could be it,"" Hunter told CNBC's "" Money Movers "" on Monday. ""There's two key levels, the 5,000 to 5,100 area, and then below that you get down to 4,600 to 4,800, the second one, I think if you do get down to that it'll come in the September [to] October period when the seasonals are fully negative, and that's the big one,"" he added. — Brian Evans 11:18 a.m.: Odds of the Fed nailing a soft landing are slimming, says Bolvin Wealth Management While the Federal Reserve could still achieve a soft landing for the U.S. economy, the latest market sell-off is making doing so more difficult, according to Bolvin Wealth Management president Gina Bolvin. ""The Fed can still stick this landing, but it is getting more difficult,"" Bolvin wrote on Monday. ""While odds of a recession are rising, I don't think we will see one this year because earnings are growing double digits."" She noted that the weaker-than-expected labor market data from Friday was simply one measure in a more broad set of economic data, and that fundamentals remain intact. — Brian Evans 11:03 a.m.: The Fed 'got this wrong,' says Moody's Analytics chief economist Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi joined CNBC's "" Squawk on the Street "" on Monday morning to share his thoughts around the global equity sell-off. The economist believes the Federal Reserve should have been cutting rates months ago. While he believes a 50-basis point rate cut would be more appropriate in September, the U.S. central bank is likely to only cut by 25 basis points. He also doesn't see an emergency intermediate rate cut in the picture. The Fed ""misjudged, they got this wrong,"" Zandi said. ""They have to get moving here and they have to get rates back down to something that's more consistent with their long run equilibrium."" The economist added that the odds of a recession have gone up, especially with the labor market growing weaker and if consumer spending takes a hit. ""For months, going back a year, the job market is looking increasingly fragile under the hood,"" he added. ""Everything's saying this job market is weakening, and to a point where we could have a real problem if the Fed doesn't take the pressure off."" — Lisa Kailai Han 11:01 a.m.: Market sell-off is 'pretty normal' and an opportunity for longer-term investors, BMO's Brian Belski says BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski hammered down on his bullish market outlook. ""This is pretty normal, and it's part of a broader trend…that the markets in general are heading into normalization,"" Belski said, keeping his S & P 500 year-end target of 5,600. ""We've been waiting for this."" Belski said small to mid-cap stocks are the ""best-positioned assets"" over the next decade from a fundamental perspective. He added that the market's strong rotation away from mega cap tech is a buying opportunity for stocks like Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft — names investors must have exposure to. ""You've been provided a gift here…you absolutely, positively have to have exposure to these names,"" Belski said, referring to the big tech group. Belski also advised investors to stay away from consumer staples and utilities, calling those trades a short-term and reactionary move as the sectors are too expensive. — Pia Singh 10:41 a.m.: There's more to the sell-off than is being talked about, RBC says Yes, stocks around the world fell sharply on fears the U.S. economy may be slowing. But, RBC head of global equity strategy Lori Calvasina, thinks there's more to the sell-off than is being discussed. The recently disappointing U.S. data that sparked this decline ""occurred against the backdrop of extremely stretched positioning in US equity futures broadly and in S & P 500 and Nasdaq futures contracts specifically,"" Calvasina wrote. She also pointed to seasonal factors. ""Seasonality has been poor for the S & P 500 in the August – October time frame for the past five years,"" Calvasina noted. And, ""the S & P 500 has been positively correlated with Trump's betting market odds, which have been deteriorating and now lag Harris."" Overall, Calvasina thinks this could be a garden-variety pullback for the market. ""We pointed out that the overall tone from companies in the current reporting season, as well as commentary on the macro backdrop and labor dynamics, simply don't sync up with the idea that the US is tipping into recession,"" she said. — Fred Imbert 10:09 a.m.: Market's 'next threat' are the investors who were slow to get out, Nomura says There's room for further unwinding of long positions in U.S. equities, according to Nomura Holdings. The ""next threat to the market comes from speculators who were slow to get out,"" analyst Yoshitaka Suda said in a note, adding that U.S. equity markets have ""abandoned the factor rotation they had been engaged in and are instead heading straightforwardly downward out of concern over the economic outlook."" Instead of embracing the decline in market interest rates, Suda said investors seem to be dragging the market down out of fear of ""what lies behind the decline in interest rates"" — a potential economic slowdown. The analyst expects investors to continue lowering their long exposure to U.S. stocks for as long as the S & P 500 stays below the 5,500 level. Macro hedge funds are also mounting an attack on Japanese equities, which are also continuing their steep sell-off on Monday, he noted. — Pia Singh 8:24 a.m.: Bitcoin's narrative as a store of value is getting 'decimated,' says co-founder of Tezos blockchain Alongside global stocks, bitcoin plunged more than 13% on Monday. At one point, the cryptocurrency dropped below the $50,000 level for the first time since February. Kathleen Breitman, the co-founder of the Tezos blockchain, told CNBC's "" Squawk Box "" on Monday morning that bitcoin's narrative as a store of value is ""being decimated as we speak."" However, Breitman added that bitcoin still has a utility in its usefulness for transaction. ""I think that it addresses a fundamental problem and a technical problem that isn't necessarily a panacea for everyone. I think the store of value meme is like a meme, just like a lot of other crypto culture that sometimes makes sense and other times doesn't,"" she added. — Lisa Kailai Han 7:45 a.m.: Wharton's Siegel says the Fed should move forward with two 75-basis point rate cuts Jeremy Siegel, professor of finance at Wharton, told CNBC's "" Squawk Box "" on Monday that the Federal Reserve needs to cut rates twice by 75 basis points after the release of disappointing economic data and a global market sell-off. Siegel underscored that the U.S. central bank has now ""overshot"" both its employment and inflation rate targets. On the other hand, the Fed hasn't moved its fed funds rate, which ""makes absolutely no sense whatsoever,"" Siegel added. To be sure, Siegel noted it's highly unlikely the Fed does go through with two 75-basis point cuts. At this point, he also believes that the ""market knows so much better than the Fed."" ""[The Fed] has got to respond. … They're basically at the target, and there's a lag in monetary policy,"" Siegel added. ""If they're going to be as slow on the way down as they were on the way up — which by the way, was the worst policy error in 50 years — then we're not in for a good time with this economy."" — Lisa Kailai Han 7:10 a.m.: Fundstrat's Tom Lee says watch this key indicator as market sells off With a global sell-off brewing, Fundstrat Global Advisors' Tom Lee thinks that investors should be paying a close eye on the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) . The Vix is a popular fear gauge on Wall Street. It soared above 50 on Monday, reaching levels not seen since 2020. But as volatility subsides, Lee thinks the market could quickly rebound once its current elevated volatility levels fall. .VIX 5Y mountain VIX 5-yr chart ""Declines like that are generally symmetric, but you have to watch the VIX and when the VIX peaks and starts to roll over and fall down, the recovery can be just as quick,"" he said during a CNBC ""Squawk Box"" interview. ""We know markets are nervous and they have to unwind. But it's not yet a bad time to be thinking that there is a big opportunity on the other side because once the VIX starts to calm down and markets have already corrected, we know that there's opportunity."" — Lisa Kailai Han 7:02 a.m.: How long sell-offs typically last Bad news: The current market sell-off may have further to go. Data compiled by HSBC shows sell-offs for the S & P 500 typically last one month, with the benchmark losing 10% on average. ""In this Sell-Off phase there are relatively few places to hide. [Developed market] defensives, the FTSE 100 and the S & P 500 generally hold up a little better on average. Yet all three still typically fall on an absolute basis in a Sell-Off environment,"" wrote strategist Duncan Toms. To be sure, this could ""present an opportunity to scale up risk exposure, at least tactically – but not yet,"" Toms added. The S & P 500 entered Monday's session down more than 5% from an all-time high reached last month. .SPX mountain 2024-07-16 SPX since July 16 — Fred Imbert 6:42 a.m.: G Squared Private Wealth's Victoria Green: 'Panic is never a smart investment strategy' It might be easy to turn bearish after a historic sell-off, but Victoria Greene thinks investors should take a step back. ""Some of this is so much panic after we were so quiet. All of a sudden we flipped into panic mode and panic is never a smart investment strategy,"" Greene, founding partner and chief investment officer at G Squared Private Wealth, told CNBC's "" Worldwide Exchange "" on Monday. ""Take a deep breath this morning. It's probably not the end of the world."" Still, she acknowledged: ""It's probably not all horrible and it's probably not all good, but it's hurting."" Nimrit Kang agreed with Greene's viewpoint that some of this selloff could be attributed to a market overreaction.

Dan Ives, tech analyst at Wedbush, acknowledged markets is in a ""panic period,"" especially as the technology sector takes a hit. Still, ""this is not the time to panic in our opinion,"" he said on the show. ""It's not the time to hit the exit buttons.""

While the CME FedWatch Tool shows the market has priced in a 50-basis point at the Federal Reserve's September meeting, Goldman said that such a large cut seemed ""outrageous"" especially given ""respectful"" data like the current unemployment and GDP rates. He added that there still haven't been enough bad data points yet to fully justify the market's conclusion. Likewise, Goldberg agreed that the U.S. central bank is more likely to cut rates by 25 basis points throughout the rest of the year.

The sell-off that took place looked to us like the actions of a mix of bears—many of whom ironically had capitulated in droves throughout the first half of this year, nervous investors, and short-term traders who found catalyst as well in the reaction to the jobs number to take some profits without FOMO (fear of missing out),"" the firm's chief investment strategist wrote. ""Based on the inherent volatility that the monthly jobs number has displayed in past revisions — sometimes better and sometimes worse — we would think it best for now not to jump to conclusions,"" he added. — Fred Imbert 5:51 a.m.: Recession signals are 'coming home to roost', Evercore ISI says Signs of a recession are starting to pile up, according to Evercore ISI Chairman Ed Hyman. ""With the soft employment report, the NASDAQ correction, the plunge in bond yields, and the plunge in commodity prices, it's possible we're seeing recession signals coming home to roost,"" Hyman wrote in a Sunday note. His comments came after the U.S. government reported employment growth that was well below economist expectations on Friday. That report sent equities tumbling, with the Nasdaq Composite closing in a correction — down more than 10% below. The data also led to some on the Street to increase their odds for a 0.5 percentage point rate cut from the Federal Reserve. ""Odds of a soft landing will increase if China weakness leads to a deeper plunge in WTI, pushing down inflation further, and allowing the Fed to be more aggressive,"" Hyman wrote.

""There are fundamental underpinnings of the price action directionally (weak US growth, worries the Fed is 'behind the curve', some disappointing earnings reports during the Q2 season, worries about AI-related capex spending, etc.), but technical factors account for the velocity and magnitude of what's happened in the last couple of sessions and into this morning."" Some of those technical drivers include ""portfolio damage"" that has spurred a ""overall de-risking, creating a negative feedback loop whereby selling begets more selling.""

Global stocks tumble on fears of U.S. recession and tech pullback.,https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/stocks-dollar-swing-rate-bets-030758538.html,"Gold prcies have hit a record high on growing expectations for US interest rate cuts (DAVID GRAY)

Wall Street's main indices mostly tumbled Wednesday as fears of heightened trade tensions with China hit tech stocks.

The increasing prospect of a US rate reduction also weighed on the dollar, helping push gold, a haven investment that is priced in the currency, to another record peak.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq slumped by 2.8 percent to finish the day, and the broad S&P 500 dropped 1.4 percent as investors worried about renewed trade tensions with China.

""A Bloomberg report that the Biden Administration is discussing tighter export restrictions for semiconductors and semiconductor equipment going to China has caused an upsetting stir,"" said market analyst Patrick O'Hare of Briefing.com.

Shares in artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia fell 6.6 percent, while those in ASML, which manufactures the equipment to make computer chips, tumbled 12.7 percent.

""Separately, a remark from former President Trump that Taiwan should be paying the U.S. for its defense has created some geopolitical angst that is also weighing on the semiconductor group,"" O'Hare added.

Tech stocks, in particular Nvidia, have been on a tear in recent months over the boom in the development of artificial intelligence applications, helping drive Wall Street to new records.

The Dow, however, pushed to a third straight record high on Wednesday.

In Europe, London equities held steady, closing 0.3 percent in the green despite stronger-than-expected UK inflation data dousing hopes of a British interest rate cut anytime soon.

""The Bank of England requires a higher level of certainty in order to actually lower rates,"" said Patrick Munnelly of broker Tickmill.

Elsewhere in Europe, Paris and Frankfurt closed lower.

UK inflation holding steady at 2.0 percent in June from May, stronger than forecast, helped push the British pound close to a one-year high above $1.30. Investors expect that the Federal Reserve is set to start reducing American borrowing costs soon.

Gold prices spiked to $2,482.42 per ounce, while the yen also rallied.

In Asia, stock markets saw mixed fortunes as expectations for a US rate cut played out against the prospect of another Donald Trump presidency, which analysts warn could see inflation-fueling tax cuts and import tariffs.

Global stocks tumble on fears of U.S. recession and tech pullback.,https://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/us-recession-rumblings-to-roil-asx-20240803-p5jz3u,"Pinned post – 4.36PM – Aug 5, 2024

The worst sell-off in more than four years flooded every corner of the market in red on Monday.

The S & P/ASX 200 closed 3.7 per cent, or 293.6 points, lower at 7649.6, extending Friday’s 2.1 per cent loss. That places the bourse more than 5.5 per cent down over the past two sessions, and marks the worst one-day sell-down since May 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The sell-down was sparked after July non-farm payrolls data released in the US on Friday undershot estimates and the jobless rate rose faster than expected. That has fuelled fears of a potential recession in the world’s largest economy. Goldman Sachs’ recession probability indicator was revised higher over the weekend from 15 per cent to 25 per cent.

UBS strategist Richard Schellbach said the magnitude of the moves in markets was a product of just how strong they have been until this point, with the ASX touching a record above 8100 points just three sessions earlier.

“Given the ascent of the market and the valuation that the sharemarket was sitting on, it was always likely to be challenged once we started to see softer data as we have seen over the last week,” Mr Schellbach said.

“And when you look at the moves on the Australian sharemarket today, it’s very much in sync with the defensive rotation that we saw in the US market.”

All 11 ASX sectors ended the day more than 1 per cent lower. Only two stocks managed to avoid the sell-off: those two stocks were sleep apnoea treatment provider ResMed which finished 2.9 per cent higher at $32.73. It was upgraded by brokers on better than expected results reported late last week. Domino’s Pizza was the other winner, which ended 0.8 per cent higher at $29.79. The fast food chain rebounded from a strong sell-off in the previous session.

Tech tumble

Tech stocks sank 6.6 per cent in their worst session since May 2022. The US tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped into a technical correction in Friday’s session, having fallen more than 10 per cent from its high.

Legendary investor Warren Buffett dumped $116 billion worth of stocks, including a large stake in iPhone maker Apple, in the second quarter, it emerged on Saturday. WiseTech Global fell 8.8 per cent to $84.26.

Fintech Zip Co was the worst performing, down 10.9 per cent to $1.68. Afterpay-owner Block declined 10.6 per cent to $89.53.

Energy stocks also took a beating, as consumption concerns hit the oil price. Brent crude fell 0.7 per cent $US76.25 a barrel, adding to a 3.4 per cent decline in the final session of last week. Santos dropped 5 per cent to $7.47 and Woodside declined 3.6 per cent to $26.48.

A fall in uranium prices continued to hurt ASX-listed uranium stocks. Boss Energy dropped 7.6 per cent to $2.94 and Deep Yellow dropped 10 per cent to 94.5¢."
Global stocks tumble on fears of U.S. recession and tech pullback.,https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-nikkei-economy-c6240977e9482bf7207abc53b2a11e58,"NEW YORK (AP) — Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index soared nearly 11% early Tuesday, a day after it set markets tumbling in Europe and on Wall Street.

The Japanese index advanced more than 3,300 points, not quite making up for the huge loss of more than 4,400 points the day before, when it plunged 12.4% in its worst single-day decline since 1987.

The scary Monday started with a plunge abroad reminiscent of 1987 ’s crash swept around the world and pummeled Wall Street with more steep losses, as fears worsened about a slowing U.S. economy.

The S&P 500 dropped 3% for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average reeled by 1,033 points, or 2.6%, while the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4% as Apple, Nvidia and other Big Tech companies that used to be the stars of the stock market continued to wilt.

The drops were the latest in a global sell-off that began last week, and it was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday’s report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the U.S. economy to come in weaker than expected, and it’s all raised fear the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation.

Professional investors cautioned that some technical factors could be amplifying the action in markets, and that the drops may be overdone, but the losses were still neck-snapping. South Korea’s Kospi index careened 8.8% lower, and bitcoin dropped below $54,000 from more than $61,000 on Friday.

Even gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during tumultuous times, slipped about 1%.

That’s in part because traders began wondering if the damage has been so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, briefly sank below 3.70% during the morning from 3.88% late Friday and from 5% in April. It later recovered and pulled back to 3.89%.

“The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3% doesn’t really seem like an emergency.”

Of course, the U.S. economy is still growing, the U.S. stock market is still up a healthy amount for the year and a recession is far from a certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.

Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession within the next 12 months following Friday’s jobs report. But he still sees only a 25% probability of that, up from 15%, in part “because the data look fine overall” and he does not “see major financial imbalances.”

Some of Wall Street’s recent declines may simply be air coming out of a stock market that romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Critics have been saying for a while that the stock market looked expensive after prices rose faster than corporate profits.

“Markets tend to move higher like they’re climbing stairs, and they go down like they’re falling out a window,” according to JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America. He chalks much of the recent worries to euphoria around AI subsiding, with pressure rising on companies to show how AI is turning into profits, and “a market that was ahead of itself.”

The only way for stocks to look less expensive is either for prices to fall or for their profits to strengthen. Expectations are still high for the latter, with growth for S&P 500 profits this past quarter looking to be the strongest since 2021.

Professional investors also pointed to the Bank of Japan’s move last week to raise its main interest rate from nearly zero. Such a move helps boost the value of the Japanese yen, but it could also force traders to scramble out of deals where they borrowed money for virtually no cost in Japan and invested it elsewhere around the world.

Treasury yields also pared their losses Monday after a report said growth for U.S. services businesses was a touch stronger than expected. Growth was led by arts, entertainment and recreation businesses, along with accommodations and food services, according to the Institute for Supply Management.

Still, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy’s strength took sharp losses on the fears about a slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 3.3%, washing out what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.

Making things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks tumbled as the market’s most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the “ Magnificent Seven ” had propelled the S&P 500 to record after record this year, even as high interest rates weighed down much of the rest of the stock market.

But Big Tech’s momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports that began with updates from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines.

Apple fell 4.8% Monday after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker.

Nvidia, the chip company that’s become the poster child of Wall Street’s AI bonanza, fell even more, 6.4%. Analysts cut their profit forecasts over the weekend for the company after a report from The Information said Nvidia’s new AI chip is delayed. The recent selling has trimmed Nvidia’s gain for the year to nearly 103% from 170% in the middle of June.

Another Big Tech titan, Alphabet, fell 4.4% after a U.S. judge ruled Google’s search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation.

All told, the S&P 500 fell 160.23 points to 5,186.33. The Dow sank 1,033.99 to 38,703.27, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 576.08 to 16,200.08.

Worries outside corporate profits, interest rates and the economy are also weighing on the market. The Israel-Hamas war may be worsening, which beyond its human toll could cause sharp swings for the price of oil. That’s adding to broader worries about potential hotspots around the world, while upcoming U.S. elections could further scramble things.

Wall Street has been concerned about how policies coming out of November could impact markets, but the sharp swings for stock prices could affect the election itself.

The threat of a recession is likely to put Vice President Kamala Harris on the defensive. But slower growth could also further reduce inflation and force former President Donald Trump to pivot from his current focus on higher prices to outlining ways to revive the economy.

“It comes down to jobs,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. Jobs drive spending by U.S. consumers, which in turn is the biggest part of the U.S. economy.

“When we get to election day, the unemployment rate is going to be extremely important.”

Global stocks tumble on fears of U.S. recession and tech pullback.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/japanese-stocks-tumble-leading-equities-002002329.html,"(Bloomberg) -- A renewed bout of volatility hit global markets as recent talk about a US economic recession — mostly seen as premature — spurred warnings that this year’s sizzling stock rally has gone too far.

Most Read from Bloomberg

From New York to London and Tokyo, equities got pummeled. Just as markets started celebrating signals from the Federal Reserve about a first rate cut, they were hit by a perfect storm — weak economic data, underwhelming corporate earnings, stretched positioning and poor seasonal trends. While the S&P 500 pared some of its losses, it suffered the biggest plunge in about two years amid strong trading volume. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 saw its worst start to a month since 2008. Wall Street’s “fear gauge” - the VIX - at one point registered its largest spike in data going back to 1990.

Treasuries lost some steam after a surge that briefly drove two-year yields — which are sensitive to monetary policy — below those on 10-year bonds. Traders are betting the economy is on the verge of deteriorating so quickly the Fed would need to start easing policy aggressively. The repricing was so sharp that the swap market earlier assigned a 60% chance of an emergency rate reduction by the Fed over the coming week. Those odds subsequently ebbed.

“The economy is not in crisis, at least not yet,” said Callie Cox at Ritholtz Wealth Management. “But it’s fair to say we’re in the danger zone. The Fed is in danger of losing the plot here if they don’t better acknowledge cracks in the job market. Nothing is broken yet, but it’s breaking and the Fed risks slipping behind the curve.”

At LPL Financial, Quincy Krosby said that after such a strong rally, valuations, sentiment and positioning had become stretched.

“What markets are experiencing is an unwinding of that bullish positioning,” she said. “Watch for signs of a capitulating Fed, timely evidence of a growing economy, and a successful test of the 200-day moving average on the S&P 500 for signs a bottom may be in.”

The S&P 500 lost 3%, extending a tumble from its peak to 8.5%. US 10-year yields were little changed at 3.78%. The dollar fell. A gauge of perceived risk in the US corporate credit markets soared, with the turmoil effectively shutting down bond sales on what had been expected to be among the busiest days of the year. Bitcoin sank about 10%.

The wave of selling hit a fever pitch in Japan as traders rushed to unwind popular carry trades, powering a 2% jump in the yen and causing the Topix stock index to shed 12% and close the day with the biggest three-day drop in data stretching back to 1959. The rout wiped out $15 billion of SoftBank Group Corp.’s value on Monday.

“The market is a tug of war between fear and greed,” said Nancy Tengler at Laffer Tengler Investments. “In my 40+ years as a professional investor, it has always paid to buy when others are fearful. Volatility is the friend of long-term investors.”

The US stock plunge is vindicating some prominent bears, who are doubling down with warnings about risks from an economic slowdown. JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Mislav Matejka said equities are set to stay under pressure from weaker business activity, a drop in bond yields and a deteriorating earnings outlook. Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson warned of “unfavorable” risk-reward.

“This doesn’t look like a ‘recovery’ backdrop that was hoped for,” Matejka wrote. “We stay cautious on equities, expecting the phase of ‘bad is bad’ to arrive,” he added.

Market veteran Ed Yardeni said that the current equity selloff bears some similarity to the 1987 crash, when the economy averted a downturn despite investor fears at the time.

“This is very reminiscent, so far, of 1987,” Yardeni said on Bloomberg Television. “We had a crash in the stock market — that basically all occurred in one day — and the implication was that we were in, or about to fall into, recession. And that didn’t happen at all. It had really more to do with the internals of the market.”

To Seema Shah at Principal Asset Management, economic weakness concerns will likely prove overdone, but the depth of the negative narrative now implies that an imminent market turnaround is unlikely. A sustained market recovery needs a catalyst, or likely a combination of catalysts, including stabilization of the Japanese yen, strong earnings numbers, and solid data releases.

“It’s complicated — return of the ‘R’ word derailing the Goldilocks trade,” said Maxwell Grinacoff at UBS Investment Bank. “Similar to what we witnessed amidst the small-cap rotation a few weeks ago, the degree of moves was clearly exacerbated by stretched positioning. The difference today is there is fundamental backing to elevated levels of risk premia, from both a macro and earnings perspective.”

After a very strong first half, the market had become extended on a short-term basis and the bar for positive surprises too high — and a little bit of bad news has gone a long way, according to Keith Lerner at Truist Advisory Services.

“From a stock market perspective, our base case has not changed,” Lerner said. “Our work still suggests the bull market deserves the benefit of the doubt. However, we have been expecting a choppier environment into the back half of July and August given the sharp rebound from April, stretched sentiment, and the fact that we’re entering a seasonally weaker period of the calendar year.”

Moreover, after strong first halves, historically we have seen a typical pullback of 9% at some point, even while markets still tended to end higher by the end of the year.

Notably, over the past 40 years, the S&P 500 has averaged a maximum intra-year pullback of 14%. Despite this, stocks have still shown an average return (not compounded) of 13% and risen in 33 out of 40 of those years, or 83% of the time, Lerner said.

“While always uncomfortable and typically accompanied by bad news, pullbacks are the admission price to the stock market,” Lerner said. “This is what provides the potential for higher longer-term returns relative to most other asset classes.”

Investors should rationally consider the current landscape, according to Russell Price at Ameriprise. Are markets correcting because they may have seen equity market gains come too far too fast? Or are markets falling because of true threats over economic conditions and the possibility of a global recession?

“We believe, the preponderance of evidence supports the former,” Price says. “The US economy is currently moderating to more sustainable rates, but a near-term recession is not the most likely path ahead, in our view. Even if it were, we believe central banks have ample fire power to lower rates to restimulate activity, if necessary, which should once again entice capital toward stocks.”

When investors turned their calendars to August, they may have flipped the narrative on the economy at the same time, according to John Lynch at Comerica Wealth Management.

“It’s been less than two weeks since the second quarter GDP report surprised to the upside, with equity markets hovering near record levels, yet there is growing sentiment is that the Fed has waited too long to cut interest rates and is now behind the curve,” Lynch said. “While we’re not completely sold on the new narrative, the one thing that seems certain is that there is more volatility ahead.”

Investors should hedge their risk exposure even if they own high quality assets as US stocks extend losses, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s Tony Pasquariello.

“There are times to go for the gas, and there are times to go for the brake — I’m inclined to ratchet down exposures and roll strikes,” Pasquariello wrote. He added that it’s difficult to think that August will be one of those months where investors should carry a significant portfolio risk.

Systematic funds have offloaded more than $130 billion of global stock bets in recent weeks. Now these rules-based players threaten to take their selling to a whole new level as volatility spikes.

Strategies including risk parity, vol-targeting and trend following will dispose $70 billion to $80 billion of shares Monday, with at least $90 billion more to unwind over the next four sessions, according to estimates from Morgan Stanley’s trading team.

To Michael Gapen at Bank of America Corp., markets are getting ahead of the Fed again.

“Incoming data have raised concerns that the US economy has hit an ‘air pocket.’ A rate cut in September is now a virtual lock, but we do not think the economy needs aggressive, recession-sized cuts.”

Equity markets experienced one of the most severe rotations in years in July, with small cap and value stocks surging and mega cap tech stocks selling off. A key question for investors is whether this move continues or fades out similar to previous rotations, according to Jeff Schulze at ClearBridge Investments.

“While a growth scare could spark a retracement of this rotation, we ultimately expect a pickup in economic growth which should favor small cap, value and cyclicals,” he said. “Leadership rarely moves in a straight line, and we believe the near term (the next several months) could see an oscillation that favors the previous leadership on the perception of safety if the economy cools further. Ultimately, we believe a soft landing will play out.”

As the selloff in global stocks intensified Monday, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s trading desk said the rotation out of the technology sector might be “mostly done” and the market is “getting close” to a tactical opportunity to buy the dip.

Buying of stocks by retail investors has slowed quickly, positioning by trend-following commodity trading advisers has fallen a lot across equity regions and hedge funds have been net sellers of US stocks, JPMorgan’s positioning intelligence team wrote in a Monday note to clients.

“Overall, we think we’re getting close to a tactical opportunity to buy-the-dip,” wrote John Schlegel, JPMorgan’s head of positioning intelligence. “That said, whether we get a strong bounce or not could depend on future macro data.”

“The euphoria of the first quarter is quickly becoming a distant memory as weaker economic data is raising voices for a Fed cut in rates soon, and maybe before their next meeting,” said Paul Nolte at Murphy & Sylvest Wealth Management. “We are in the early stages of the ‘dog days of summer’ and things are heating up on Wall Street.”

Corporate Highlights:

Palantir Technologies Inc. raised its annual outlook, citing continuing demand for its artificial-intelligence software.

A federal judge on Monday ruled that Google has illegally monopolized the search market, hading the government an epic win in its first major antitrust case against a tech giant in more than two decades.

Nvidia Corp.’s upcoming artificial intelligence chips will be delayed due to design flaws, The Information reported, citing two unidentified people who help produce the chip and its server hardware.

Dell Technologies Inc. is cutting jobs as part of a reorganization of its sales teams that includes a new group focused on artificial intelligence products and services.

Tyson Foods Inc. shares surged, bucking a broad retreat in equity markets, as quarterly earnings beat the highest of analyst estimates on a rebound in chicken profits.

US stock markets closed sharply lower on Friday, driven by a weaker-than-expected jobs report that heightened concerns over recession and disappointing tech earnings. Non-farm payrolls increased by just 114,000 in July, missing forecasts of 175,000, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% from 4.1% prior, the highest since October 2021.

ISM services PMI

Date: Tuesday, 6 August at 12.00am AEST

In June, the forward-looking ISM Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dived to 48.8 from 53.8 previously, marking its sharpest contraction since COVID-19. Across the sub-indices, Business Activity, New Orders, and Employment all declined.

For July, the market anticipates a rebound to 51, signalling a return to expansionary territory, which would help alleviate slowdown fears. However, a weaker number would indicate a deeper contraction in the services sector, further inflaming recession concerns.

Interest rate expectations

Ahead of the data, the US interest rate market is priced for 42 basis points (bp) of Fed rate cuts for September, with a cumulative total of 115 bp of rate cuts before year-end. If this plays out as current pricing suggests, we could see two 50 bp cuts and one 25 bp Fed rate cut before year-end.

6h ago 16.16 EDT Wall Street suffers worst fall in nearly two years Hello again. After a day of heavy losses, the New York stock exchange has suffered its biggest one-day fall in almost two years. The global rout that kicked off again in Asia early this morning, and ran through Europe, has sparked fresh losses on Wall Street tonight too. The S&P 500 fell 3% Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed a 12.4% plunge for Japan’s Nikkei 225, its worst day since 1987, and the UK FTSE 100’s worst day since January. Here’s the full story: Wall Street suffers worst day in nearly two years after global sell-off Read more Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, sums up the day: “Friday’s slump turned into a full-on meltdown following the sun around the globe but instead leaving a chill in its wake. There are plenty of theories about why today was the day which delivered this massive market sell off, but whichever one you subscribe to, you will undoubtedly be talking about the trillions wiped off market valuations for years to come. For the FTSE 100 there was a tiny silver lining as it managed to clamber back above that psychologically important 8,000 milestone just before the close but only one company, Haleon, managed to end the day out of the sea of red. The FTSE 250 closed almost 590 points down with five of its members finishing on the front foot as some hardy investors were likely redrawing their positions to take advantage of a spot of bargain buying. But it was the mega caps that led the sell off, with reports of AI chip delays and Warren Buffett’s remarkably timely sale of a chunk of Berkshire Hathaway’s Apple shares adding to US recession fears and the pricing in of the anticipated flurry of rate cut activity many now think will follow. It’s hard not to look at the headlines and succumb to panic but corrections happen and looking back since the start of the year the FTSE 350 is still in a better position than it was coming into 2024. Markets fall and they recover, the trick is to ride out the storm whilst picking up a couple of good deals along the way.” Share

9h ago 12.30 EDT Larry Elliott Warning signs of a US recession may be bad news for Kamala Harris as the presidential election approaches. Our economics editor Larry Elliott explains: The Federal Reserve has a rule of thumb measure – known as the Sahm rule – for gauging whether the US economy is in recession. Named after the economist Claudia Sahm, this states that when the three-month moving average of the US unemployment rate is 0.5 percentage points or more above its low over the prior 12 months, the economy is in the early months of recession. Last week’s jobless report from the Bureau of Labour Statistics showed the Sahm rule was on the brink of being triggered. As the consultancy Capital Economics pointed out, the rule will be met next month unless the unemployment rate falls back. Historically, the Sahm rule has been a good predictor of looming US recessions, and it has been quoted widely in recent days by those arguing that the Federal Reserve has left it too long to cut interest rates. There has been speculation that, having fallen “behind the curve”, the Fed may not even wait until its next scheduled meeting next month, and may announce an emergency cut in the coming days. Some economists warn against putting too much store by the Sahm rule. Dhaval Joshi, an analyst at BCA Research, said: “A decoupling between robust growth in the economy and steadily rising unemployment is unprecedented in our lifetimes. Through the past 60 years, whenever the US unemployment rate has increased by 0.5% in a year, taking it to the cusp of recession, GDP growth has also been on the cusp of recession. That is, until now.” Warning signs of US recession may be bad news for Kamala Harris Read more Share

While manufacturers are reporting reduced demand for goods, this in part reflects a further switching of spending from consumers towards services such as travel and recreation. However, healthcare and financial services are also reporting buoyant growth, fueling a wide divergence between the manufacturing and service economies.

As the consultancy Capital Economics pointed out, the rule will be met next month unless the unemployment rate falls back. Historically, the Sahm rule has been a good predictor of looming US recessions, and it has been quoted widely in recent days by those arguing that the Federal Reserve has left it too long to cut interest rates. There has been speculation that, having fallen “behind the curve”, the Fed may not even wait until its next scheduled meeting next month, and may announce an emergency cut in the coming days. Some economists warn against putting too much store by the Sahm rule. Dhaval Joshi, an analyst at BCA Research, said: “A decoupling between robust growth in the economy and steadily rising unemployment is unprecedented in our lifetimes. Through the past 60 years, whenever the US unemployment rate has increased by 0.5% in a year, taking it to the cusp of recession, GDP growth has also been on the cusp of recession. That is, until now.” Warning signs of US recession may be bad news for Kamala Harris Read more Share

Smigiel argues that talk of an emergency Fed rate cut don’t make sense – especially given the pick-up in US service sector growth reported this morning: “The weekend did little to dampen volatility as the global selloff accelerated this morning. Quite frankly, this sell-off is now overdone. Emergency Fed rate cuts being priced in makes little sense given the economic backdrop in the U.S. and would only serve to destroy policy maker credibility. The strong ISM report this morning highlights the challenge of focusing in on single data releases and more or less confirms this market volatility is mostly a global carry trade unwind and a re-evaluation of the AI hype. We continue to see 2-3 25bps cuts from the Fed for the remainder of 2024 yet we also expect long term U.S. rates to drift HIGHER from this overshoot given what we see as firming short term inflationary pressures.” Share

Another strong expansion of business activity in the service sector, which over the past two months has enjoyed its best growth spell for over two years, contrasts with the deteriorating picture seen in the manufacturing sector, where output came close to stalling in July. While manufacturers are reporting reduced demand for goods, this in part reflects a further switching of spending from consumers towards services such as travel and recreation. However, healthcare and financial services are also reporting buoyant growth, fueling a wide divergence between the manufacturing and service economies. Thanks to the relatively larger size of the service sector, the July PMI surveys are indicative of the economy continuing to grow at the start of the third quarter at a rate comparable to GDP rising at a solid annualised 2.2% pace.

Panic set across the globe after the US Bureau of Labour Statistics last week released economic data, which heightened fears the employment market was worse than expected and the US Federal Reserve had kept interest rates too high for too long.

"Google's antitrust loss could put billions at risk for Apple, Yahoo Finance says.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/googles-antitrust-loss-could-put-billions-at-risk-for-apple-215401052.html,"Google (GOOG, GOOGL) suffered a staggering shot to its search and advertising business on Monday as District of Columbia's Judge Amit Mehta ruled in favor of the Department of Justice in its antitrust suit against the tech giant.

It may cost Apple (AAPL) big-time too.

Here's how: The ruling could force Google to make dramatic changes to its largest business, but it could also force the company to cancel a long-term revenue-sharing agreement with Apple that requires the iPhone maker to use Google as the default search engine across its various devices.

The deal, called an Information Services Agreement, has been in place since 2002 and has been adjusted over the years as new technologies, such as the iPhone, have been introduced. The gist of the deal is that Apple uses Google as its default search engine for its Safari browser, Spotlight Search, and Siri.

In return, Google pays Apple 36% of the search revenue generated on Apple devices using Google’s services. While Apple doesn’t reveal exactly how much it makes from the deal, court documents pegged the number at an estimated $20 billion in 2022, double what Google paid in 2020.

Apple couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

The revenue from Google and Apple’s agreement is likely realized under Apple’s Services business segment, which is where it lists third-party advertising licensing agreements. In 2022, Apple saw $78.1 billion in Services revenue. If the $20 billion estimate is accurate, that means the deal accounted for roughly 25% of Apple’s Services revenue for the year.

Apple’s Services business is one of its fastest-growing segments and is seen as a bulwark against the company’s slowing iPhone sales. The company has expanded the segment significantly over the years, adding its Apple Music+ and Apple TV+ platforms to the business. But the Google deal still likely makes up a massive chunk of the Services segment’s revenue.

From a company-wide perspective, Apple generated $394.3 billion in revenue in 2022, meaning the Google agreement accounted for 5% of the company’s annual revenue for the year.

Losing the ISA wouldn’t just hurt Apple, though. According to court documents, Google performed internal modeling in 2020 that found it would lose 60% to 80% of search volume on Apple’s iOS devices if its search engine were replaced as the default option.

Losing that search volume would cut into Google’s bottom line to the tune of $28 billion to $32 billion. With Google bringing in $182.5 billion in revenue in 2020, that would slice $15% to 17% off of the company’s bottom line.

Story continues

Google is sure to appeal the DOJ’s win, but if Mehta’s ruling stands, Apple and Google could be in for some serious financial pain.

DBS Group (SGX: D05) is the first of the three local banks to report its first set of earnings for 2024.

Singapore’s largest bank did not disappoint.

DBS reported a stellar set of earnings for the first quarter of 2024 (1Q 2024) while raising its quarterly dividend by 42% year on year.

Here are five highlights from the bank’s latest set of financial results.

Total income and net profit at record highs

For 1Q 2024, net interest income rose 8% year on year to S$3.6 billion, buoyed by the current high interest rate environment.

Fee income also jumped 23% year on year to exceed S$1 billion for the first time.

As a result, the blue-chip lender saw its total income climb 13% year on year to S$5.6 billion, a record high.

With expenses rising by just 10% year on year to S$2.1 billion, DBS’s profit before allowances improved by 14% year on year to S$3.5 billion.

After accounting for S$5 million of expenses related to its Citigroup (NYSE: C) Taiwan acquisition, the bank’s net profit came in at S$2.95 billion, up 15% year on year and also at a record.

With total income and net profit hitting record highs, the bank’s return on equity also correspondingly hit a new high of 19.4% for 1Q 2024.

Slightly improved NIMs and loan book

DBS saw its net interest margin (NIM) improve slightly year on year to 2.14% from 2.12% a year ago.

The increase was because of the upward repricing of its fixed-rate loans with outflows from current and savings accounts being slower than the prior year.

In addition, 1Q 2024’s NIM was also slightly better than the 2.13% logged for the fourth quarter of 2023 (4Q 2023).

DBS’s loan book increased by 2% year on year to S$424.8 billion because of higher non-trade corporate loans and the consolidation of Citigroup Taiwan.

Fee income surpasses S$1 billion

Fee income also did well with a 23% year-on-year jump to S$1 billion, up from S$851 million a year ago.

Wealth management fees experienced a 47% year-on-year jump to S$536 million for 1Q 2024, benefitting from better market sentiment and an increase in the bank’s assets under management.

Card fees climbed 33% year on year to S$301 million in line with higher spending while loan-related fees increased by 30% year on year to S$185 million.

The consolidation of Citigroup Taiwan helped to boost both wealth management and card fees.

Quarterly dividend shoots up 42%

In line with the strong results, DBS has declared a quarterly dividend of S$0.54 per share on the enlarged share base after its 1-for-1 bonus issue.

Adjusting for this bonus issue, 1Q 2023’s quarterly dividend stood at S$0.38, implying a 42% year-on-year increase in the lender’s dividend.

Story continues

This level of dividend was also slightly higher than the previous quarter’s S$0.49.

Raising its outlook for 2024

CEO Piyush Gupta expects macroeconomic conditions to remain resilient despite the geopolitical risks.

He estimates that group net interest income will be modestly better than in 2023 with commercial book’s non-interest income to hit mid-to-high teens percentage growth.

The revised outlook is based on better-than-expected momentum in its wealth management and treasury customer divisions.

As a result, total income is expected to be one to two percentage points higher than DBS’s prior guidance of mid-single-digit year on year growth.

No stress has been noted so far that requires specific provisions to be higher at this point.

In sum, DBS expects 2024’s net profit to be above 2023’s levels.

Get Smart: Better days ahead for DBS

Judging from the revised outlook from management, investors can look forward to a better 2024 for the lender.

The cost-to-income ratio improved slightly to 37.4% in 1Q 2024 from 38.1% a year ago while the non-performing loans ratio remained stable at 1.1%.

Progress has also been made in executing its technology resiliency roadmap to enable greater service availability and allow for a faster full recovery of services in the event of an outage.

The bank’s momentum may see its total income and net profit deliver a positive surprise for 2024.

Investors may also get to enjoy a higher dividend if the bank can maintain its earnings trajectory.

On Thursday, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) posted its third quarter financials, revealing a YoY decline in iPhone sales and falling short of expectations in China.

Although Apple CEO Tim Cook also acknowledged the rising costs of AI investments, the rise in Apple’s capital expenditure is tiny compared to its mega-cap tech peers, such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and they are also growing at a much slower rate. When it comes to AI and a new era that is unfolding, Apple has a unique take on, as always.

Fiscal Third Quarter Highlights

For the quarter ended on June 29th, Apple reported revenue grew 5% YoY to $85.5 billion, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $84.53 billion. Revenue out of Greater China was $14.7 billion, a drop compared to last year’s comparable quarter when the region brought in $15.2 billion. Bloomberg were anticipating revenue of $15.2 billion. iPhone remained the main revenue driver, making as much as 45% of total sales. But sales did slightly decline, more precisely 1% YoY to $39.2 billion, but still surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $38.81 billion. Services revenue that includes revenue from Google hit $24.2 billion as it grew 14% YoY and also topped LSEG’s consensus estimate of $24.01 billion.

iPad showed the strongest growth of almost 24% YoY as it brought in $7.16 billion, topping LSEG’s consensus estimate of $6.61 billion estimated.

Wearables sales, however, declined to $8.1 billion but still topped LSEG’s consensus estimate of $7.79 billion .

Mac revenue grew about 2% YoY to $7.01 billion which came slightly short of LSEG’s estimate of $7.02 billion.

As for the bottom line, Apple posted a net income of $21.45 billion and earnings per share of $1.40.

A Different AI Game

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg decided to play the game by increasing spending to avoid risking being left behind. With the AI spending spree, Zuckerberg also wants to ensure its big tech peers like Apple don’t fully control the next tech era if it turns out to be AI. On the other hand, Apple is playing a different game. Unlike Amazon, Google and Microsoft, Apple doesn’t have a cloud business with which it rents out infrastructure to companies. Last week, Apple released the first version of its suite of AI features.

It plans to roll out its highly anticipated Apple Intelligence software to U.S. English users in the fall. Next year, it will ""proceed with more functionality, more features, and more languages and regions. The new software is expected to trigger a fresh iPhone sales supercycle and boost Apple’s bottom line as the new software will only be compatible with iPhone 15 Pro and newer phones that will force iPhone owners of pre-15 models to upgrade if they want their hands on Apple’s newest development.

"Google's antitrust loss could put billions at risk for Apple, Yahoo Finance says.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-loses-doj-antitrust-suit-184845811.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Google illegally monopolized the search market through exclusive deals, a judge ruled Monday, handing the government a win in its first major antitrust case against a tech giant in more than two decades.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Judge Amit Mehta in Washington said that the Alphabet Inc. unit’s $26 billion in payments to make its search engine the default option on smartphones and web browsers effectively blocked any other competitor from succeeding in the market.

“Google’s distribution agreements foreclose a substantial portion of the general search services market and impair rivals’ opportunities to compete,” Mehta said in a 286-page ruling.

By monopolizing distribution on phones and browsers, Google has been able to consistently raise the prices of online advertising without consequences, Mehta said.

“The trial evidence firmly established that Google’s monopoly power, maintained by the exclusive distribution agreements, has enabled Google to increase text ads prices without any meaningful competitive constraint,” he wrote.

Antitrust enforcers alleged that Google has illegally maintained a monopoly over online search and related advertising. The government said that Google has paid Apple, Samsung Electronics Co. and others billions over decades for prime placement on smartphones and web browsers. This default position has allowed Google to build up the most-used search engine in the world and fueled more than $300 billion in annual revenue largely generated by search ads.

Alphabet shares slid almost 4.5% to $159.25 at the close in New York. Apple Inc., which depending on the remedy could stand to lose billions in payments Google makes to have its search engine be the default browser on iPhones, fell 4.8% to $209.27.

“This victory against Google is a historic win for the American people,” said Attorney General Merrick Garland. “No company — no matter how large or influential — is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce the antitrust laws.”

Google said it plans to appeal the decision. “As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use,” Kent Walker, President of Google Global Affairs, said in a statement.

Mehta found that Google doesn’t have a monopoly in the market for general search advertising, noting that competitors like Amazon.com Inc., Walmart Inc. and other retailers have begun to offer advertising related to searches on their own websites. But Google does have a monopoly over search text ads, which appear at the top of a search results page to draw users to websites, he said.

Story continues

Mehta’s decision focuses solely on Google’s liability, nine months after the Justice Department and a group of states held a 10-week trial in federal court. Mehta scheduled a hearing for next month to discuss the timing for a separate trial on the remedy.

The Justice Department hasn’t yet said what changes it will seek, though it presented evidence that efforts by European regulators to require Google to offer users a choice of search engines led few to switch. The agency could demand the separation of Alphabet’s search business from other products, like Android or Chrome, which — if ordered by the juge — would mark the biggest forced breakup of a US company since AT&T was dismantled in 1984.

The judge could also stop short of ordering a full breakup and chose to unwind the exclusive search deals. Another option could be to require Google to license its search index, which is the data that it uses to build its search results.

Antitrust enforcers separately sued Google for allegedly monopolizing the technology used to buy, sell and serve display advertising online. In that case, which is set for trial in Virginia federal court next month, the government is seeking to force Google to sell off some of its advertising technology products.

Dan Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, said the decision adds to the “black cloud” of legal and regulatory uncertainty that has been hovering over the company.

“It does create some doubt in a company that already kind of disappointed on the quarter,” he said.

‘Measured’ Decision

Mehta’s decision is “reasonable and balanced,” accepting some but not all of the government’s arguments, which will likely help in any appeals, said William Kovacic, who teaches antitrust at George Washington Law School.

“His decision is measured and not simply a credulous acceptance of the government’s arguments,” said Kovacic, who served as chair of the Federal Trade Commission during the George W. Bush administration.

Some of the Mehta’s analysis about advertising markets may raise difficulties for the government as it pursues its second case against Google, Kovacic said. But the opinion will likely be helpful for a number of the government’s other antitrust cases awaiting trial against Apple, Amazon and Meta Platforms Inc. on how to consider justifications by the companies for their behavior, he said.

Mehta’s decision is “bold in a legally careful way that will do well on appeal,” said Rebecca Allensworth, an antitrust professor at Vanderbilt Law School. It will “lay the blueprint for other tech cases going forward.”

"Google's antitrust loss could put billions at risk for Apple, Yahoo Finance says.",https://www.aol.com/behind-massive-selloff-tech-stocks-183034504.html,"Shares in several major technology companies plunged Monday morning amid a wider sell-off in the market.

Nvidia saw the biggest drop out of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks, opening 14.2 percent down compared to market close on Friday. Tesla opened 10.9 percent down, while Apple slid 9.6 percent, and Amazon fell 8.2 percent at the start of trading.

Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, opened 7.6 percent down, while Google parent Alphabet dipped 6.8 percent. Microsoft saw the least volatility out of the major tech stocks, falling 4.8 percent at market open Monday.

Shares in all seven companies recovered slightly by midday, though they remained down.

The tech stocks’ steep slide Monday morning came as the wider market took a downturn amid growing concerns about a recession. Investors were spooked by Friday’s weaker-than-expected jobs report, which showed the U.S. adding only 114,000 jobs and the unemployment rate ticking up to 4.3 percent.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened with a loss of 1,100 points Monday, dropping 2.8 percent, while the Nasdaq composite fell 6.2 percent, and the S&P 500 index sank 4.2 percent after the market opened.

“The perfect storm panicked tech sell-off has now gained steam after the weaker jobs report yesterday fueled the R word fears and worries the Fed is now too late in its cutting cycle with tech stocks in the center of this Category 5 storm sell-off,” analysts from Wedbush Securities wrote in a research note Saturday.

Major tech stocks, which were already on shaky footing after mixed second-quarter results over the past two weeks, are also reeling from Warren Buffett’s decision to cut Berkshire Hathaway’s stake in Apple by half.

However, the Wedbush analysts argued in another note Monday morning that now “is not the time to panic on the tech trade.”

“We are getting inbounds from investors around the world today/over the weekend asking us if this tech bull market and historic run for tech stocks is over?” they wrote. “It’s NOT in our view and this is just a white knuckle moment in a multi-year bull run for tech stocks that need hand holding.”

Amid widespread excitement about the potential of artificial intelligence (AI), the tech sector has driven much of the market’s gains this year. As of late June, the Magnificent Seven accounted for 75 percent of the S&P 500’s gains, according to Axios.

However, the tech stocks have also been a drag on the market in recent weeks. After lackluster earnings reports from Alphabet and Tesla in late July, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite both fell to multiweek lows.

Despite the current selloff, John Higgins, chief markets economist for Capital Economics, is skeptical that the AI-fueled market rally has ended.

“It feels less like 2000 — when the dotcom bubble popped — than 1998 — when a temporary pullback in share prices coincided, like now, with a resurgent yen,” Higgins wrote in an analysis Monday.

“Even then, there is a big difference between the present and 1998: the absence of a major problem in, and risk to, the US financial system,” he continued. “Our best guess is that the stock market will recover, as the economy holds up better than feared and investors rediscover their enthusiasm for AI.”

"Google's antitrust loss could put billions at risk for Apple, Yahoo Finance says.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/google-loses-antitrust-case-over-193239571.html,"(Updates with reply from Google in fifth paragraph)

Investing.com -- Alphabet's Google lost its legal battle against Department of Justice after a U.S. Federal Judge ruled Monday that the internet search engine illegally maintained a monopoly in the online search and text advertising markets.

“Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,” Judge Amit Mehta in Washington ruled on Monday.

The judge concluded that Google has ""violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act by maintaining its monopoly in two product markets in the United States general search services and general text advertising-through its exclusive distribution agreements.""

The ruling, which can be appealed, marked a major win for the DoJ, who had argued that Google's agreements with companies including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and others to make Google search default search engine on smartphones violated antitrust laws.

Google said in an emailed response to Investing.com that it plans to appeal the decision.

The DoJ didn't immediately respond to Investing.com's request for comment.

Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) closed 4.5% lower on Monday.

X is closing San Francisco HQ and relocating staffers to San Jose and 'shared space'.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/technology/x-twitter-san-francisco-office.html,"X, the social media company owned by Elon Musk, plans to shut its San Francisco office “over the next few weeks,” according to an internal email obtained by The New York Times.

In the email, which X’s chief executive, Linda Yaccarino, sent to employees on Monday, the company said workers would move to existing offices in San Jose, Calif. X will also open an engineering-focused office in Palo Alto, Calif., which it will share with xAI, the artificial intelligence outfit owned by Mr. Musk, the email said.

“This is an important decision that impacts many of you, but it is the right one for our company in the long term,” Ms. Yaccarino wrote to employees.

Mr. Musk said last month that he would move the company’s headquarters to Texas, after California passed a law that bans school districts from requiring teachers to notify parents if their children change their gender identification. Mr. Musk, who has had a tempestuous relationship with the state, said that such legislation would “force families and companies to leave California to protect their children.”"
X is closing San Francisco HQ and relocating staffers to San Jose and 'shared space'.,https://fortune.com/2024/08/05/x-closing-san-francisco-hq-relocating-staffers-san-jose-palo-alto-shared-space-with-x-ai-linda-yaccarino-leaked-email/,"X, the social media company formerly known as Twitter, is set to leave San Francisco in the coming weeks.

In a Monday email from Linda Yaccarino, the CEO of X appointed last year by owner Elon Musk, X staffers were briefly informed of the company’s plans to shutter the office that has served as Twitter headquarters for more than a decade.

“After much thought, we have made the decision to close our San Francisco office over the next few weeks,” Yaccarino wrote in the email viewed by Fortune. “This is an important decision that impacts many of you, but it is the right one for our company in the long term.”

Musk abruptly stated on X about three weeks ago that the company’s headquarters would move to Texas, where his other companies SpaceX, Tesla and The Boring Company, are also located. Musk and X were sued earlier this year by the owner of the Market Street building, for allegedly failing to pay rent after Musk took over Twitter in late 2022. The building owner dismissed the lawsuit in March.

Yaccarino’s note to X staff said nothing of a move to Texas, as Musk claimed last month. Instead, she said that X staff located in San Francisco would be moved to existing office space in San Jose and Palo Alto.

“We will work to transition to our new primary locations in the Bay Area,” she wrote.

The move comes as San Francisco is struggling to revive its downtown district and its commercial real estate market. And it marks a setback to the city’s efforts to turn the gritty mid-Market Street area into a thriving tech hub.

Twitter took over the San Francisco space—an expansive, 1-million square foot Art Deco building that once served as a furniture showroom—and made it its global headquarters in 2012. Soon after Musk became Twitter’s owner, firing thousands of employees, several floors of the building were effectively closed; and when the company was renamed X, the famous Twitter sign (along with all other vestiges of the company’s pre-Musk era) were summarily removed. More than a dozen global offices were closed as well. Musk also ended the company’s flexible work from home policy, requiring all employees to work in the office every day.

X representatives did not respond to an email seeking comment. Details of Yaccarino’s email was first reported by the New York Times.

Below is the full note that Yaccarino sent staffers on Monday:

Title: SF Office Closing

All,

After much thought, we have made the decision to close our San Francisco office over the next few weeks. This is an important decision that impacts many of you, but it is the right one for our company in the long term.

We will work to transition to our new primary locations in the Bay Area including the existing office in San Jose and a new engineering focused shared space with XAl in Palo Alto.

For those based in San Francisco, I know this will impact you all in different ways. Leadership is actively working on plans, including transportation options, for those directly impacted.

Further information and next steps will be communicated in the coming weeks."
X is closing San Francisco HQ and relocating staffers to San Jose and 'shared space'.,https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-x-twitter-leaving-san-francisco-office/,"The social media company X is closing its San Francisco office “over the next few weeks,” according to an internal email sent out by CEO Linda Yaccarino earlier today. “This is an important decision that impacts many of you, but it is the right one for our company in the long term,” Yaccarino wrote in the email, first reported by The New York Times.

Employees in San Francisco reportedly will be moved to new locations in the Bay Area, “including the existing office in San Jose and a new engineering focused shared space with [xAI, Musk’s AI startup] in Palo Alto,” the note said. The company’s executive team is said to be working on “transportation options” for staff. X did not respond to WIRED's request for comment.

The official announcement comes a few weeks after Musk said in a post on X that he planned to move X and SpaceX headquarters to Texas. X would move to Austin, specifically, Musk said at the time. Bloomberg reported earlier this year that X had already been staffing up a trust and safety team for X based in Austin.

While the state of Texas is known to be more business-friendly than California—it has one of the lowest tax burdens in the US—Musk’s publicly stated reasoning for the move to Texas was more ideological than financial. He said at the time that the “final straw” was a new California law that aims to protect the privacy of transgender children, which he perceived to be “attacking both families and companies.” He also said that he’s “had enough of dodging gangs of violent drug addicts just to get in and out of the building.”

The latest update from Yaccarino suggests it’s the San Francisco office, specifically, that is the thorn in X’s side. And it’s an about-face for Musk, who tweeted a year ago that, despite incentives to move out of San Francisco, X would not move its HQ out of the city. “You only know who your real friends are when the chips are down,” he waxed poetically on X. “San Francisco, beautiful San Francisco, though others forsake you, we will always be your friend.”

The shuttering of the X office marks the end of an era for the company formerly known as Twitter, and for the historic Mid-Market neighborhood that in the 2010s managed to lure in burgeoning tech companies like Twitter, Uber, Spotify, and Square.

Twitter’s earliest offices were in SoMa, or the South of Market neighborhood of San Francisco, until 2011, when then mayor Ed Lee instituted a controversial tax break for tech companies. The ruling erased the 1.5 percent payroll tax for companies that moved into certain Mid-Market buildings. Twitter jumped at the opportunity.

The company was considered an anchor tenant in a densely populated neighborhood marked by homelessness and open drug use. Suddenly an airy, high-end food market, a Blue Bottle Coffee shop, and tech workers with MacBooks and overpriced sneakers dotted Market Street, alongside people in various states of distress camped out in front of still-vacant storefronts."
X is closing San Francisco HQ and relocating staffers to San Jose and 'shared space'.,https://nypost.com/2024/08/05/business/elon-musks-x-to-reportedly-shutter-san-francisco-office/,"Elon Musk reportedly plans to ditch X’s San Francisco office — weeks after announcing he will move the social media company’s headquarters to Texas in his clash with California Gov. Gavin Newsom over the state’s new controversial student gender identity law.

In a staff memo on Monday, X CEO Linda Yaccarino said the office closure will occur “over the next few weeks” and described the decision as “the right one for our company in the long term.”

“For those based in San Francisco, I know this will impact you all in different ways. Leadership is actively working on plans, including transportation options, for those directly impacted,” Yaccarino added in the memo, according to a copy obtained by Fortune.

Yaccarino said X would transfer operations to new “primary locations” for its Bay Area employees, including an existing office in San Jose, as well as a “new engineering-focused shared space” in Palo Alto created to house Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI.

The billionaire also ripped living conditions in crime-riddled San Francisco while announcing the move.

“Have had enough of dodging gangs of violent drug addicts just to get in and out of the building,” Musk wrote on X on July 16.

The Post reached out to X for comment.

Last month, Musk announced he would relocate the headquarters for X and Space X to Texas, calling Newsom’s decision the “final straw.”

The new law blocks school districts from requiring teachers to notify parents about changes in a student’s gender identity or sexual orientation without the child’s permission.

Musk claimed he made “it clear to Governor Newsom about a year ago that laws of this nature would force families and companies to leave California to protect their children.”

Musk has repeatedly clashed with local authorities since buying the company formerly known as Twitter for $44 billion in late 2022.

Last year, SRI Nine Market Square, the firm that owns the building that houses X headquarters on San Francisco’s Market Street, filed suit against Musk’s firm for allegedly missing rent payments.

The landlord dropped the suit in March.

Separately on Monday, Musk filed a new lawsuit against OpenAI and co-founders Sam Altman and Greg Brockman — just weeks after he dropped a similar lawsuit against the firm behind ChatGPT.

The case filed in California by Musk — who co-founded OpenAI in 2015 but later exited its board due to disagreements over its direction — describes his dispute with Altman and others as a “textbook tale of altruism versus greed.”

Musk’s lawyers allege OpenAI and its leaders “intentionally courted and deceived” him into bankrolling the startup to the tune of more than $44 million in its early years.

The suit claims Altman and his allies said they would develop advanced AI for the benefit of mankind — only to ditch that mission in order to enrich themselves and key investor Microsoft."
X is closing San Francisco HQ and relocating staffers to San Jose and 'shared space'.,https://www.inkl.com/news/x-to-shut-down-flagship-san-francisco-office-report,"Elon Musk recently stated that he would move the X and SpaceX headquarters from California to Texas.

X, the social media company formerly known as Twitter, will shut down its flagship San Francisco office “over the next few weeks”, the New York Times reported. The internal announcement comes after owner Elon Musk stated last month he would be moving the headquarters out of California.

In an email to employees obtained by the Times, chief executive Linda Yaccarino said Bay Area employees will be relocated to Silicon Valley, distributed between an existing office in San Jose and a new office to be built in Palo Alto.

“This is an important decision that impacts many of you, but it is the right one for our company in the long term,” Yaccarino said in the email, according to the Times.

In July, Musk announced on X that he would be relocating the headquarters of his companies X and SpaceX from California to Texas, citing a new California law banning school transgender notification requirements as his reason for leaving.

“This is the final straw. Because of this law and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies, SpaceX will now move its HQ from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, Texas,” Musk wrote.

Musk has long maintained a contentious relationship with the state where he founded his companies, stating in 2022 the Golden State was the land of “taxes, overregulation and litigation”. In 2020 Musk relocated the headquarters of his electric car company Tesla from California to Texas in response to California’s coronavirus measures, which he called “fascist”.

X’s departure from San Francisco represents a symbolic blow to the city, which has seen an exodus of tech firms from its once busy downtown area. Since 2019, the 20 largest tech firms have slashed the amount of office space rented in downtown San Francisco in half – including Meta, Salesforce, Snap, Lyft, Block, Airbnb and Paypal. As X vacates its 800,000 sq ft headquarters, 46% of offices and 40% of retail spaces in the area are vacant.

In February, X’s landlords for the San Francisco headquarters sued X for $13.6m over unpaid rent on the location. A previous lawsuit over unpaid rent on the location was dismissed. The city also investigated X over reports that the company had illegally added sleeping quarters to the building for employees working long hours, but later concluded the company could keep them if it acquired a permit."

"Dow plunges more than 1,000 points amid fears of U.S.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stock-market-today-dow-jones-s-p-500-down/,"Stocks in the U.S. plunged for a third consecutive trading day, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbling more than 1,000 points amid growing fears of an economic downturn sparked by a slowdown in hiring and consumer spending.

The S&P 500 slid 160 points, or 3%, to 5,186 on Monday, the index's biggest one-day drop in nearly two years, according to FactSet. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite sank 3.4% as investors fled some of the Big Tech players that until recently had powered the U.S. market higher — Apple shed 4.8%, while Meta and Nvidia, fell 2.5% and 6.4%, respectively.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 1,034 points, shedding 2.6% of its value. Earlier in the day, it had lost as more than 1,200 points, but the markets regained some of their early losses as Wall Street digested Monday data from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Services index, which showed that service employment picked up in July.

""The details of the ISM report were encouraging, with business activity, new orders and employment all rebounding markedly in July,"" Oxford Economics said in a Monday research note. The report ""aligns with our view of an economy in transition rather than one on the brink of collapse.""

Even with Monday's rout, U.S. stocks still remain in positive territory this year. The S&P 500 has gained 9.4% in 2024, even after including its recent slide, while the Dow remains up by 2.6%.

What's driving down stocks

Stocks lost ground on Thursday after weak reports on manufacturing and construction, which stoked fears the U.S. economy may finally be buckling under the pressure of high interest rates.

Then on Friday, government data showed that hiring last month was far weaker than expected, adding to Wall Street's fears that a ""soft landing,"" in which the U.S. economy could avoid a recession despite the highest interest rates in 23 years, could instead become a hard landing.

""The main factor that has staying power is the economy's slowdown,"" wrote Wells Fargo head of global investment strategy Paul Christopher in a report. ""Investors have been watching household financial stress build for the past two years, but during that time, job growth remained above its December 2009-December 2019 average of 180,000 new jobs per month.""

But Friday's jobs report showed that employers added only 114,000 new jobs last month, far fewer than the 175,000 jobs expected by economists, he noted.

Tech stocks have been hit particularly hard in recent weeks as investors pull back from artificial intelligence companies amid questions about when the emerging sector will deliver profits.

""It has been a tough few weeks for the AI group as earnings were reported,"" analysts with Melius Research wrote. 'Microsoft, Meta, Google and Amazon were all asked about payoffs from AI investments. While pretty clear that they all need to keep spending, the market remains skeptical of the pace.""

The market rout extended to Asian and European markets, with Japan's benchmark stock index plunging 12.4% on Monday. The Nikkei had dropped 5.8% on Friday, making this its worst two-day decline ever.

Stocks in Korea and Taiwan also fell sharply, with all three Asian markets damaged as investors pull back from companies focused on artificial intelligence out of concern the sector has been overhyped.

When will the Fed cut rates?

With the disappointing economic data, Wall Street is worried the Federal Reserve may have kept its benchmark interest rate too high for too long, heightening the risk of a recession. The central bank kept the federal funds rate unchanged when it met on July 31 to discuss economic conditions and whether and when it should begin cutting rates.

A rate cut would make it less expensive for U.S. households and companies to borrow money, but it could take time for the effects to boost the economy. On Monday, some investors called for the Fed to start cutting rates sooner rather than later to stave off an economic downturn.

""The Federal Reserve needs to start easing monetary policy more aggressively than had been anticipated, in order to head off a looming recession in the world's largest economy,"" said Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, an independent financial advisory and asset management firm, in an email. ""The Fed was behind the curve at the beginning of the cycle, it cannot afford to be behind the curve this time too.""

Economists still don't expect a recession

Although worries over weakness in the U.S. economy and volatile markets have rippled around the world, domestic economic activity remains solid, with many analysts saying that a recession remains unlikely. Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist with Capital Economics, still expects a soft landing, while acknowledging that the risk of a sharper downturn is rising.

The economy has accelerated this year, with the nation's gross domestic product jumping to 2.8% in the second quarter, blowing past forecasts. A recession is typically marked by two consecutive quarters of negative GDP. And although July's jobs report was disappointing, analysts point out that it reflects just one month of data, while also noting that the depressed hiring figures in July could have also been impacted by Hurricane Beryl.

""It can be a mistake to read too much into a single data release,"" noted Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, told investors in a research note. ""The number of people who reported being unable to work [in July] due to the weather was 436,000; this compares to an average of 33,000 for July since 2000.""

—With reporting by the Associated Press."
"Dow plunges more than 1,000 points amid fears of U.S.",https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-nikkei-economy-c6240977e9482bf7207abc53b2a11e58,"NEW YORK (AP) — Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index soared nearly 11% early Tuesday, a day after it set markets tumbling in Europe and on Wall Street.

The Japanese index advanced more than 3,300 points, not quite making up for the huge loss of more than 4,400 points the day before, when it plunged 12.4% in its worst single-day decline since 1987.

The scary Monday started with a plunge abroad reminiscent of 1987 ’s crash swept around the world and pummeled Wall Street with more steep losses, as fears worsened about a slowing U.S. economy.

The S&P 500 dropped 3% for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average reeled by 1,033 points, or 2.6%, while the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4% as Apple, Nvidia and other Big Tech companies that used to be the stars of the stock market continued to wilt.

The drops were the latest in a global sell-off that began last week, and it was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday’s report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the U.S. economy to come in weaker than expected, and it’s all raised fear the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation.

Professional investors cautioned that some technical factors could be amplifying the action in markets, and that the drops may be overdone, but the losses were still neck-snapping. South Korea’s Kospi index careened 8.8% lower, and bitcoin dropped below $54,000 from more than $61,000 on Friday.

Even gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during tumultuous times, slipped about 1%.

That’s in part because traders began wondering if the damage has been so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, briefly sank below 3.70% during the morning from 3.88% late Friday and from 5% in April. It later recovered and pulled back to 3.89%.

“The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3% doesn’t really seem like an emergency.”

Of course, the U.S. economy is still growing, the U.S. stock market is still up a healthy amount for the year and a recession is far from a certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.

Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession within the next 12 months following Friday’s jobs report. But he still sees only a 25% probability of that, up from 15%, in part “because the data look fine overall” and he does not “see major financial imbalances.”

Some of Wall Street’s recent declines may simply be air coming out of a stock market that romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Critics have been saying for a while that the stock market looked expensive after prices rose faster than corporate profits.

“Markets tend to move higher like they’re climbing stairs, and they go down like they’re falling out a window,” according to JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America. He chalks much of the recent worries to euphoria around AI subsiding, with pressure rising on companies to show how AI is turning into profits, and “a market that was ahead of itself.”

The only way for stocks to look less expensive is either for prices to fall or for their profits to strengthen. Expectations are still high for the latter, with growth for S&P 500 profits this past quarter looking to be the strongest since 2021.

Professional investors also pointed to the Bank of Japan’s move last week to raise its main interest rate from nearly zero. Such a move helps boost the value of the Japanese yen, but it could also force traders to scramble out of deals where they borrowed money for virtually no cost in Japan and invested it elsewhere around the world.

Treasury yields also pared their losses Monday after a report said growth for U.S. services businesses was a touch stronger than expected. Growth was led by arts, entertainment and recreation businesses, along with accommodations and food services, according to the Institute for Supply Management.

Still, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy’s strength took sharp losses on the fears about a slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 3.3%, washing out what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.

Making things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks tumbled as the market’s most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the “ Magnificent Seven ” had propelled the S&P 500 to record after record this year, even as high interest rates weighed down much of the rest of the stock market.

But Big Tech’s momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports that began with updates from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines.

Apple fell 4.8% Monday after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker.

Nvidia, the chip company that’s become the poster child of Wall Street’s AI bonanza, fell even more, 6.4%. Analysts cut their profit forecasts over the weekend for the company after a report from The Information said Nvidia’s new AI chip is delayed. The recent selling has trimmed Nvidia’s gain for the year to nearly 103% from 170% in the middle of June.

Another Big Tech titan, Alphabet, fell 4.4% after a U.S. judge ruled Google’s search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation.

All told, the S&P 500 fell 160.23 points to 5,186.33. The Dow sank 1,033.99 to 38,703.27, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 576.08 to 16,200.08.

Worries outside corporate profits, interest rates and the economy are also weighing on the market. The Israel-Hamas war may be worsening, which beyond its human toll could cause sharp swings for the price of oil. That’s adding to broader worries about potential hotspots around the world, while upcoming U.S. elections could further scramble things.

Wall Street has been concerned about how policies coming out of November could impact markets, but the sharp swings for stock prices could affect the election itself.

The threat of a recession is likely to put Vice President Kamala Harris on the defensive. But slower growth could also further reduce inflation and force former President Donald Trump to pivot from his current focus on higher prices to outlining ways to revive the economy.

“It comes down to jobs,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. Jobs drive spending by U.S. consumers, which in turn is the biggest part of the U.S. economy.

“When we get to election day, the unemployment rate is going to be extremely important.”

"Dow plunges more than 1,000 points amid fears of U.S.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/08/05/japan-stock-market-crash/,"Global markets slid Monday as fears of a slowing U.S. economy sparked investor angst, resulting in some of the most intense volatility Wall Street has seen in years. Investors were rattled by a trickle of disappointing economic data last week, including a weaker-than-expected jobs report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed nearly 1,034 points, or 2.6 percent, and closed at 38,703.27. The broader S&P 500 lost 3.0 percent, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index lost 3.4 percent as wariness around artificial intelligence led investors to turn away from big names such as Nvidia and Microsoft.

The Wall Street turbulence followed unease in overseas trading that sent Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index to its biggest single-day drop on record. Cryptocurrencies also plunged, with bitcoin moving 8 percent lower as of late Monday afternoon.

Analysts said the volatility is a reaction to a softening employment picture and concerns that the Federal Reserve missed a crucial window by holding out on rate cuts until at least September. On Friday, the Labor Department reported that only 114,000 jobs were added in July, pushing the unemployment rate to 4.3 percent, the highest mark since 2021. Stocks fell sharply, sending the Nasdaq into correction territory. A day earlier, the number of Americans filing for first-time jobless claims — a widely followed proxy for layoffs — jumped more than expected while a key measure of manufacturing activity signaled contraction.

Adding to the volatility is a spate of bad financial results from the tech sector and currency gyrations abroad. Even with the recent losses, the major U.S. indexes remain in positive territory for the year, with the Dow up 2.6 percent, the S&P 500 ahead 8.7 percent and the Nasdaq up 7.9 percent.

“We’ve got a threefold fear — manufacturing data that was poor, labor market data that was weaker than expected, and a Fed that seemingly won’t be here to help us until September, which feels like an eternity away,” said Liz Young Thomas, head of investment strategy at SoFi.

Monday’s declines started in Asia, where rising interest rates also have spooked investors. The Nikkei plummeted 12.4 percent, or more than 4,451 points, to 31,458.42. The index has slid by more than 20 percent since last month, after reaching all-time highs over 42,000 in July.

“We will watch the market trends with a sense of urgency and take all possible measures to manage the economy and finances,” Yoshimasa Hayashi, Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, said during his regular news conference Monday.

Grim numbers were reported across the region: South Korea’s Kospi index dropped by 8.77 percent; Taiwan’s Taiex by 8.35 percent; Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down by 1.46 percent; and China’s Shanghai Composite stock market index by 1.54 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 slid by 3.7 percent.

European markets followed suit: London’s FTSE 100 dropped more than 2 percent, hitting its lowest mark in more than three months, and shares of European tech and semiconductor stocks also plunged.

Over the weekend, economists at Goldman Sachs flagged an increased risk of recession in a report to their clients, raising the likelihood of a downturn in the next 12 months to 25 percent from 15 percent.

One point of concern is the slow-moving Federal Reserve, analysts said. The U.S. central bank has substantially increased interest rates over the past two years to get inflation under control, raising concerns that it could hamper the economy. It held rates steady during its most recent meeting, though a rate cut is on the table for September.

“The fear is coming from the weak jobs numbers that indicate recession, and that the Fed stayed too high for too long,” said Michael Farr of the D.C.-based investment firm Farr, Miller and Washington.

Still, Farr believes Monday’s sell-off could be an overreaction to a few weak economic data points. “I understand that the labor market has been normalizing, but this is feeling like too much shock and awe,” Farr said.

Investors also are spooked by a scenario known as the “inverted yield curve,” which is a widely followed recession indicator and occurs when the interest rates on short-term Treasurys are higher than the interest rates paid by long-term Treasurys. What it means is that people are so worried about the near-term future that they are piling into safer long-term investments.

“At the beginning of the year, market sentiment was overly optimistic, with some banks prematurely calling for rate cuts. Now, we’ve swung to what may shape up to be excessive pessimism,” Ken Tjonasam, a portfolio strategist with Global X, said Monday in comments emailed to The Washington Post.

Several leading tech stocks, whose valuations soared earlier in the year amid hype around artificial intelligence technology, were posted steep losses Monday.

Concerns about whether the surge of interest and investment in AI will deliver revenue growth for big tech companies and start-ups have been troubling investors. Last week, as several companies reported earnings, investors seemed to want more clarity on the kinds of returns they could expect from investment after spending the last year driving AI-related shares up.

The moves away from big names continued Monday. Chipmaker Nvidia slid 6.4 percent, leaving it more than 20 percent off its recent high just weeks ago. Microsoft fell 3.3 percent and Tesla shed 4.2 percent.

Alphabet shares closed down 4.6 percent as investors reacted to a federal court ruling that found that its Google unit violated antitrust law by abusing its market power to quash competition in internet search, handing the Justice Department a landmark victory against Big Tech.

Apple’s stock slid 4.8 percent as investors reacted to news that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway had given up a substantial portion of its stake in the company.

Frenzied trading Monday was made more chaotic by outages affecting online brokerages such as Charles Schwab, Fidelity and Vanguard, which left thousands of investors struggling to access their accounts, according to Downdetector."

What had been growing scrutiny on the Federal Reserve morphed into broad-based criticism that the central bank has been too slow to cut interest rates.

While the most recent jobs report caused some market commentators to argue the Federal Reserve should have cut rates sooner — it held them steady again at 5.5% last week as it sought to further dampen inflation — other analysts pushed back on that idea.

Apple had its worst day since September 2022, shedding 4.82%.

The S&P 500 Index closed 106 points, or 3%, lower on Monday after a hair-raising morning drop, while the technology heavy Nasdaq composite fell 3.43% and the Dow Jones plummeted more than 1,000 points, losing 2.6%, as global markets washed out over worries of a possible recession in the world's biggest economy.

The S&P 500 and the Dow saw their biggest drops since September 2022. The market carnage shaved $907 billion off Nasdaq's market value.

“So much for the summer lull,” said Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, in a commentary. “Stock markets are in turmoil and bond yields have plunged as fears about a U.S. recession have taken hold.”

Driving the rout: Sharp declines in high-flying tech stocks including Nvidia, Apple, and Amazon, and a disappointing jobs report. Apple had its worst day since September 2022, shedding 4.82%. As investors ran to buy U.S. Treasurys, mortgage rates declined, opening the door for some borrowers to refinance, experts said.

Biden mum on stock market rout, while Trump attacks

President Joe Biden didn’t respond directly to Monday’s market panic, and instead released a statement touting his student loan forgiveness program and the expansion of college Pell grants.

The White House kept its head down as Donald Trump and his allies worked overtime to pin the stock market carnage on Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee.

As the tech-heavy Nasdaq index shed more than $900 billion in value and the Dow Jones average lost more than 1,000 points, Biden released a statement on X apparently aimed at younger voters.

“In three years, my Administration canceled student debt for nearly 5 million borrowers through various actions, made the largest increases to the Pell Grant in a decade, and fixed Income-Driven Repayment so borrowers get the relief they are entitled to,” the statement said. “I'm not done yet.”

Trump reveled in labeling the day’s losses the “Kamala Krash.” Earlier this year, the former president took credit for record stock market highs, calling them a signal that investors favored his campaign to retake the White House.

What does Chicago Fed President Goolsbee say about rate cuts?

The Federal Reserve has only two jobs by law: stabilize prices and maximize employment, Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee emphasized in an interview with USA TODAY.

“That's the dual mandate,” he said. “That's the thing that will determine what the Fed does on rates. There's nothing in the Fed's mandate that says stop market declines. Or, you know, keep traders whole on days when there's volatility, right?”

""If the economy starts to deteriorate, the Fed's job is to act − and we will act appropriately,” he said.

−Medora Lee

More:Jobs report: Unemployment rise may mean recession, rule says, but likely not this time

What does Goolsbee say about the jobs report?

Goolsbee admitted the jobs report was “negative” but also noted it was only one month of data. The payrolls increase of 114,000 may have missed economists’ average forecast of 175,000, but he said that’s within the margin of error, which is plus or minus 100,000.

“The job of the central bank is to be steady and take the totality of the evidence when making decisions,” he said. “So if you get down in the weeds of this jobs report, it was negative, but there were some things that were cross currents that make it … a little less directly clear. Like the unemployment rate went up more than people thought, but the labor participation rate and the employment to population ratio both rose, which is kind of unusual. Normally, the recessionary signs are when the unemployment rate is rising because layoffs are going up.”

Goolsbee added that “the Fed set the rate at the level it is now a year ago, and the conditions were very different a year ago than they are today” and it may be time to reconsider those rates. The Fed funds target rate is currently at a 23-year high, between 5.25%-5.5%.

“You only want to be that restrictive if you're afraid of (the economy) overheating,” he said. “And my thing is, this is not really what overheating looks like.”

How likely is a recession?

While some economists say current market conditions raise the risk of a recession within the next 12 months, others are downplaying concerns.

“The recession fears are overblown,” said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo. “It’s not time to panic here.”

The USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast. Download for award-winning coverage, crosswords, audio storytelling, the eNewspaper and more.

Wells Fargo economists said they expect an economic slowdown – not a recession − noting the labor market is in the early stages of weakening and “still some distance away from even the most moderate, modern recession,” which took place in 2001. The bank also noted consumer spending has potential to grow as household purchasing power strengthens.

Goldman Sachs Group on Sunday raised the probability of a recession within the next year from 15% to 25% but see the risk as “limited,” Bloomberg reported.

Recession worries stem, in part, from the July job report’s triggering of the Sahm rule, a measure that says if unemployment based on a three-month average rises by at least a half percentage point over the past 12 months, the nation is likely in a recession.

Claudia Sahm, a former Federal Reserve economist, cautioned against taking too much of a signal from her namesake rule in a post-COVID labor market. She told Bloomberg Television “it is very unlikely that we are in a recession,” but “we’re getting uncomfortably close to that situation.”

“A really important question is, where are we headed?” Sahm said. “And those changes in the employment rate that the Sahm rule picks up on do not look encouraging. They're headed in the wrong direction, and that momentum is what can get us in trouble.""

Why is Japan's yen gaining on the U.S. dollar?

The yen hit a 7-month high against the dollar Monday as investors weighed the prospects for more aggressive Federal Reserve rate cuts against higher rates in Japan.

If Japan is raising rates and the Fed is lowering them, traders likely will look to buy yen to catch the move up on rates and sell the dollar for better returns.

The yen had already been on the rise after the Bank of Japan unexpectedly hiked its short-term policy rate last Wednesday to 0.25% from 0.05% and signaled more increases ahead.

The Japanese currency got another leg up after the Labor Department reported weaker-than-expected jobs growth for July and a jump in the unemployment rate to 4.3%, triggering recession fears.

Rising Japanese rates also had other traders unwinding what’s called the carry trade, reports said. A carry trade is when investors borrow in yen at low interest rates and invest in higher-yielding assets elsewhere.

If Japanese rates rise, the carry trade becomes less profitable, leading investors to sell their higher-yielding investments and buy back yen, thus increasing its value.

Japan's Nikkei index fell to a seven year low on Monday.

Did the Fed wait too long to cut rates?

There are concerns the Fed waited too long to cut interest rates and will need to play catch-up with large cuts in borrowing costs to cushion the economy.

In June, U.S. central bankers anticipated only one cut this year, and saw the unemployment rate ending the year at 4%.

With the jobless rate now well above that, ""the soft landing in the U.S. labor market is in danger,"" wrote Nick Bunker, director of North American economic research at Indeed Hiring Lab, referring to a scenario where inflation is tamed without a painful recession or sharp rise in unemployment.

Goldman Sachs now sees a steady every-meeting series of Fed rate cuts and Citi called for half-percentage-point cuts in both September and December. JP Morgan said there was a strong case for a cut even before the Fed's next meeting.

“We'll see what happens over the next several weeks in terms of market environment, but if anything, I think this will encourage the Fed to take action, which is really what the market is looking for,” said Harvey Schwartz, CEO of private equity firm Carlyle.

−Bailey Schulz, with Reuters

What's a carry trade? And why is it linked to Monday's turmoil?

For months, market observers have been talking about a popular trade in which investors borrowed in Japanese yen at very low interest rates, and then invested the borrowed money in high-growth investments like the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks that include Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla and Meta.

Concerns about the carry trade had been rising for weeks, in part because of the enormous amount of money involved in it − an estimated $4 trillion. Those concerns soared on July 31, when the Bank of Japan raised interest rates from 0.1% to 0.25%.

That rate is still very low, of course, and in and of itself not a big deal for the carry trade. But it was the bank's largest rate hike since 2007, and currency traders took note of the implications.

With the yen stronger against the dollar, traders had to spend more to continue holding their ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks − and many chose to sell instead, helping to fuel a market panic.

Crypto hammered in mass sell-off

U.S.-listed shares of crypto-linked companies slumped as Bitcoin fell more than 15% on Monday amid a frenzied selling of risky assets.

The plunge marks a stunning reversal for the sector that until recently was riding a wave of optimism sparked by the approval of exchange-traded funds tied to the spot prices of Bitcoin and Ether, the two biggest cryptocurrencies.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's pro-crypto speech at a bitcoin conference last month also bolstered confidence, but data showing higher unemployment and weak manufacturing activity squeezed risky assets.

Stay cool, experts tell investors

For regular Americans, there was little to do Monday but sit and watch the stock-ticker train wreck. While it's hard to stay calm as the stock market reels, amateur investors should at least try.

“My best advice is, don’t panic. Really, because you can’t,” said Catherine Valega, a certified financial planner in Boston.

If anything, financial advisers say, this summer stock swoon would be a great time to buy. “Stocks are on sale today, right?” Valega said. “If you have some cash, let’s go put some money in the market.”

What are circuit breakers?

In the event of a severe market price decline, U.S. exchanges have procedures, known as marketwide circuit breakers, that may halt trading temporarily or, under extreme circumstances, close the markets before the normal end of the trading session. The circuit breakers are calculated daily based on the prior day's value of the S&P 500 index.

By late Monday morning, the market wasn't approaching circuit-breaker territory. The S&P 500 was around 5200 − well above 4972.3, the tripwire for a Level 1 breaker.

The circuit breaker was last tripped 10 times in four days during a pandemic sell-off in 2020.

− Medora Lee

How much does the S&P 500 have to fall today to trigger circuit breakers?

Here are the three levels at which marketwide circuit breakers will be hit − and what happens if each one is breached:

◾ Level 1: 7% decline, or at 4,972.3 before 3:25 p.m.: Trading is halted for 15 minutes and then resumes unless level 3 is breached.

◾ Level 2: 13% decline, or at 4,651.5 before 3:25 p.m.: Trading is halted for 15 minutes and then resumes unless level 3 is breached.

◾ Level 3: 20% decline, or at 4,277.24 any time: Trading is halted for the remainder of the day.

Each circuit breaker can only be triggered once a day. For example, if a Level 1 market decline occurred and trading was halted and then reopened, the Exchange would not halt the market again unless a Level 2 decline occurred.

Where is this panic coming from?

The market panic has been building for days.

◾ Over the weekend, billionaire investment guru Warren Buffett ignited speculation he's soured on stocks as Berkshire Hathaway reported a $276.9 billion cash stake as of June 30, up from $189 billion, after selling another large portion of its stake in Apple.

◾ That reinforced investors' fears the economy may be slowing. The Labor Department reported Friday that the U.S. economy added only 114,000 jobs in July and the unemployment rate had jumped to 4.3%.

◾ Most worrying was the sharp rise in the jobless rate triggering what economists call the Sahm rule, which says that if unemployment rises by at least a half percentage point over the past 12 months, the nation is probably in a recession. The rule has correctly predicted all U.S. recessions since the 1970s.

Donald Trump and JD Vance hit Kamala Harris over market panic

Former President Donald Trump weighed in on the market carnage on Monday, pinning the blame not on overheated tech stocks, but on his November opponent: Vice President Kamala Harris.

""KAMALA CRASH!"" Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social website.

Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance was more loquacious, using the stock market panic to assail Harris' leadership. ""This moment could set off a real economic calamity around the globe. It requires steady leadership--the kind President Trump delivered for four years,"" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. ""Kamala Harris is too afraid to answer media questions and cannot lead us in these troubled times.""

Neither post mentioned President Joe Biden.

The Democratic Party fired back with a post noting job losses during Trump's one-term presidency. ""Trump left office with fewer jobs than when he entered—one of the only presidents to do so. President @JoeBiden and Vice President @KamalaHarris have overseen nearly 16 million jobs created since they took office—one of the greatest economic comebacks of any administration.""

Did the stock market crash today? What's a 'market correction'?

It's turning into a wild day for investors, homeowners and people hoping to retire, with lots of market terminology flying across the internet. Here's a brief glossary of terms giving a name to the financial pain:

◾ Correction. A market drop of at least 10% from a recent high, which typically occurs about once a year

◾ Pullback. When a specific stock or the market retreats 5% to 9.99% from a peak. While corrections may prompt some investors to reach for the Xanax, pullbacks can also be unnerving after long stretches of market calm. That said, pullbacks – which normally occur three to four times a year – are viewed as healthy and as buying opportunities.

◾ Volatility. How much a stock or the market fluctuates in a period of time.

◾ Bear market. When a stock or market index falls 20% or more.

◾ Bull market. A sustained rise in stock prices without a bear market, or a 20% drop.

Who is Warren Buffett?

Buffett is a billionaire businessman and philanthropist whose influence on the U.S. stock market is significant. Dubbed the “Oracle of Omaha,” Buffett is considered one of the most successful investors of all time. He runs Berkshire Hathaway, a major conglomerate that owns GEICO, Duracell, Dairy Queen and other companies. And Berkshire's recent sale of a large portion of shares it owned in Apple sparked fears that Buffett might be souring on stocks amid a slowing economy.

Wall Street's 'fear gauge' spikes as stocks tumble

Wall Street's most watched gauge of investor anxiety logged its largest ever intraday jump on Monday, as U.S. stock futures tumbled on rising fears the country could be tipping into recession.

The CBOE Volatility Index jumped to a high of 65.73, up about 42 points from its close on Friday, as Wall Street looked set to continue the global stock rout that saw Japanese shares at one point exceed their 1987 ""Black Monday"" loss.

The VIX was last up 34 points at 57.15, its highest since March 2020.

Mortgage rates tumble

With the drop in Treasury yields, mortgage rates have followed.

That could open the door to refinancing, said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at comparison site Bankrate.

“After months of dawdling at or above the 7% mark, mortgage rates are reversing sharply,” he said. “If you took a mortgage at a rate above 7%, the refinancing door has swung open. If you have an adjustable-rate mortgage you’re looking to get out of, this is your chance. Mortgage rates are likely to fall further in the months ahead, but there are no guarantees and current rates are a bird in the hand for prospective borrowers.”

A 30-year fixed mortgage rate on Friday was 6.4%, according to Mortgage News Daily.

How are Treasurys reacting? And what are the odds of a Fed rate cut?

Treasurys are benefitting as safe-haven purchases amid the market turmoil, forcing yields to drop significantly. Yields and bond prices move in opposite directions.

Yields on 10-year Treasurys fell to the lowest in more than a year.

“The Federal Reserve left short-term rates unchanged, but expectations for future cuts increased,” Bas Kooijman, chief executive and asset manager of DHF Capital S.A, wrote in a note referring to the Fed's decision last week.

This morning, the CME FedWatch tool shows the odds for a Federal Reserve rate cut in September at 87.5%.

After Friday’s weak jobs report, many economists revised their rate cut forecasts. Instead of a quarter percentage point cut, they are now expecting a more aggressive half-point reduction.

Are we entering a recession? Fed's Goolsbee says no

Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Austan Goolsbee on Monday said while employment data on Friday was weaker than expected, it does not look like a recession. Fed officials must stay on top of changes in the environment to avoid being too restrictive with interest rates, he added, an apparent nod to recent calls for the Fed to cut rates.

""You only want to be that restrictive if you think there's fear of overheating,"" Goolsbee told CNBC. ""These data, to me, does not look like overheating.""

His comments came amid a global stock market selloff that accelerated on Monday in the aftermath of a disappointing U.S. employment report on Friday and the Fed's decision last week to leave interest rates unchanged. Fed officials, however, signaled they could cut rates at their next meeting in September.

Oil prices plummet over US recession and Mideast war fears

Oil prices dropped to a six-month low as investors worry about recession and war in the Middle East.

A recession would lessen demand for goods and services and therefore, oil for manufacturing and transporting.

Meanwhile, oil traders are worried about escalating tensions in the Middle East after Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday an Iranian attack on Israel could happen within 24 to 48 hours. Iran on Monday reportedly issued a notice to pilots and aviation authorities to avoid its airspace.

Other global markets were also severely affected:

U.S. Treasury yields tumbled on the recession fears and as investors flooded into bonds for a global safe haven. Bond prices move inversely to yields. The benchmark 10-year note on Monday last yielded 3.78%. The benchmark yield hit its lowest level since June 2023.

Bitcoin tumbled from nearly $62,000 on Friday to around $54,000 on Monday.

Europe's Stoxx 600 was off by 2.2%.

There is also chatter about the unwind of the yen ""carry trade"" adding fuel to the global market decline after the Bank of Japan raised interest rates last week, reducing the interest rate differential between Japan and the U.S. That has contributed to the yen rising in value versus the dollar, ending a practice of traders borrowing in the cheap currency to buy other global assets.

The global stock market rapidly sold off after Friday's lackluster US jobs report added to concerns about the economy and whether the Federal Reserve had waited too long to begin cutting interest rates. Of note, almost 100% of bets are on the central bank to cut rates by 0.5% by its September meeting, according to the CME FedWatch tool.

Crypto also took a beating, with bitcoin (BTC-USD) sinking more than 10% to creep back toward the $54,000 level.

The concerns spread throughout the world, as well. Traders in Asia greeted the week with a similar sell-off, as Japan's Nikkei 225 (^N225) was routed by more than 12% in its biggest-ever daily loss after a surprise interest rate hike from the Bank of Japan last week.

The sharp rise in the Japanese yen against the US dollar has spurred heavy selling as speculators who had borrowed money at Japan's near-0% interest rate to buy US risk assets have been liquidating their holdings.

That fix is increasingly a call for Powell to call an emergency Fed meeting to immediately cut rates ahead of their scheduled September sit-down.

“I’m calling for a 75-basis point emergency cut in the Fed funds rate, with another 75-basis point cut indicated for next month at the September meeting,” Wharton School professor emeritus of finance Jeremy Siegel told CNBC on Monday morning.

“The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth.

5 Wall Street’s so-called “Fear Index” jumped to a high of 65.73 before the market opened, up about 42 points from its close on Friday. AP

But he added: “Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3 per cent doesn’t really seem like an emergency.”

A cut would ease the pressure on US households and companies by making it cheaper to take out loans and providing an eventual boost to economic growth.

“Evidence certainly points to a slowing economy. But slowing and slow are two very different points,” said Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers.

5 Call grew for Fed Chair Jerome Powell to call an emergency Fed meeting to immediately cut rates ahead of their scheduled September sit-down AP

“Lower prices certainly can have a massive psychological effect. But investors need to step back and look at the fundamental story, which still remains decent.”

Whether the Fed moves now or in September, any cut before the presidential election in November will thrust the independent central bank into the middle of the political campaign between former Republican president Donald Trump and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.

Trump has previously accused Powell — whom he first nominated to run the Fed — of displaying political favoritism toward the Democratic Party, and suggested that he would not reappoint the central banker as Fed chair if he wins in November.

Stocks took a sharp tumble around the world on Monday, with the US Dow Jones and UK FTSE100 both dropping 2 percent and Japan’s Nikkei index suffering its worst day in 37 years, amid worries over the possibility of a global recession.

London’s blue-chip index closed 2.1 percent down, falling 173 points to 8,000.

Meanwhile, the US Dow Jones closed down 2.6 percent on Monday, sliding more than 1,000 points overall. The Nasdaq was down 3.4 percent, losing 576 points by the closing bell. This comes after US jobs data sparked a global stock market sell-off at the end of last week. Investors were spooked at the prospect of a potential American recession fueled by poor earnings reports from major companies and concerns about the tech sector.

Analysts said Friday they feared the US Federal Reserve may have made a mistake by not cutting interest rates, and it might now be too late to hold off a recession.

A number of the top tech companies, such as Nvidia, Meta, and Apple, lost six percent of their market capitalization. Apple was still affected by billionaire Warren Buffett selling half his stake in the company on Saturday even as he remains its largest shareholder. Buffett also got rid of $3bn of Bank of America stock last week.

The Monday dip also struck the cryptocurrency markets with Bitcoin losing more than 17 percent of its value and Ethereum dipping more than 21 percent.

During the last 24 hours, the worldwide digital currency market lost $1.79tn of its market capitalization.

Last week’s jobs report showed hiring has slowed more than expected and prompted worries that a recession may be in the near future. Goldman Sachs analysts raised the likelihood of a recession next year from 15 to 25 percent, but they added that the risk remains “limited.”

The less-than-stellar jobs report and the selling off of stocks worldwide has prompted expectations that the Federal Reserve will take action and put in place interest rate cuts to boost the economy.

A recession would negatively impact the Federal Reserve’s plan to cut interest rates more slowly and some critics have slammed the central bank for not taking more decisive action and cutting rates when inflation appeared to slow.

UBS economist Paul Donovan said in a client note on Monday morning that “The Federal Reserve has been late in cutting rates, but that has been true for some time,” according to The New York Times. “The policy error is making things worse for lower-income households.”

Even in the face of the downward trajectory for the stock markets, Dan Ives, who covers the tech industry for Wedbush Securities, told CNBC on Monday that the stock selloff was being pushed by a “massive fear panic that will create opportunities” for tech companies.

He said he doesn’t believe this is the end of the tech bull market and that investors should “view this as more of an opportunity rather than catching a falling knife.”

The selloff has sparked fears of a global recession as numerous stock markets, including those in Japan and the UK, saw massive drops in Monday trading. ( AP )

The drop comes as the Nikkei 225 lost 13 percent on Monday to hit a seven-month low, in a day of trading worse than at any time during the 2008 global financial crisis. The Japanese benchmark index fell 4,451 points to 31,458 on Monday.

Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform IG, said: “Markets are in absolute turmoil this morning thanks to the Nikkei 225’s biggest one-day drop since 1987, which has wiped out the index’s gains for the year.”

The European STOXX 600 index was at its lowest point since mid-February after falling 2.6 percent.

“Investors continue to flee tech stocks, and the Nasdaq 100 is expected to open down 1000 points lower from Friday’s close, a loss of over five percent,” Beauchamp said. “This is a perfect demonstration of what happens when everyone tries to sell at once. Such moves don’t stop in a single day and we likely have a summer of volatility ahead of us, particularly as we await developments in the Middle East.”

The mid-cap FTSE 250 fell by more than three percent. France’s CAC 40 lost 2.6 percent, while Germany’s Dax dropped 2.8 percent in early trading.

Oil prices have also slipped. Brent crude prices were down one percent to 76.04 US dollars on Monday morning, its lowest point this year.

Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The FTSE 100 has opened down as the US sneeze risks becoming a cold.

“Exporters bore the brunt of the sell-off as contagion from last week’s poor employment and manufacturing data in the States put recessionary fears back on the table,” he said. “The discussion around September’s rate decision at the Federal Reserve Bank has moved from if to how much, with the odds now moving in favor of a half-point cut.”"
"Dow plunges more than 1,000 points amid fears of U.S.",https://www.voanews.com/a/wall-street-headed-sharply-lower-again-after-japan-s-nikkei-index-tumbles-to-worst-loss-since-1987/7730241.html,"Stock markets across the globe plunged Monday as investors sold stocks on worries that the U.S. economy, the world’s largest, might be slowing and possibly headed to a recession.

In afternoon trading, all three major U.S. indexes — the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 blue chip stocks, the broader S&P 500 index and the tech-heavy NASDAQ — were still down more than 2% after sustaining even steeper declines earlier in the day.

In Europe, the Pan-European Stoxx 600 index fell 1.5%, rallying from a larger dip earlier in the day, as every major market in Europe declined. The FTSE 100, Britain’s benchmark index, dipped just over 2%, its worst day since July 2023.

The sell-off started in Japan, with the Nikkei 225 index suffering its largest single-day point drop in history, ending the day down a staggering 12.4% — drawing comparisons to the “Black Monday” stock market crash of 1987. Other Asian markets also fell.

Monday’s sell-off began last week after a monthly U.S. jobs report showed significantly slower hiring, with 114,000 new jobs in July, far fewer than had been forecasted and sharply down from recent months. Unemployment rose to 4.3%, its highest level in nearly three years.

The two pieces of data spooked investors, deepening fears that the U.S. economy could be sliding into a recession and that the Federal Reserve may have waited too long to cut its benchmark rate. It has delayed any rate cut until September, when the central bank’s policy makers are expected to trim the key rate that sets the standard for interest charges on many business and consumer loans.

The Fed last week held its benchmark rate at a two-decade high, where it has remained for a year.

In a new assessment, the Goldman Sachs investment company said it now expects the Federal Reserve to cut rates at its next three meetings — in September, November and December. Goldman raised its forecast for the probability of a U.S. recession in the next 12 months from 15% to 25%.

Because it encompasses 500 stocks, Standard & Poor’s index is often considered a key barometer of the U.S. economy. It has fallen sharply in recent days, but it is still up about 9% percent for the year. At its peak in mid-July, it was up 19%.

Trading in Japan was suspended to prevent panic selling after the decline triggered circuit breakers designed to contain severe market drops. The frenzy also activated circuit breakers in South Korea, where the main market finished nearly 9% lower.

In Taiwan, stocks plunged more than 8% — the worst single-day percentage drop in the island’s history. Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company — the world's largest chipmaker — fell nearly 10%.

Aside from fears about the U.S. economy, geopolitical tensions frequently draw concerns for investors, too, including last week’s assassination in Iran of Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’ top political leader. Iran has blamed Israel for the attack, and vowed retaliation, raising fears of a regional war.

The market plunge has been most severe in Japan, which analysts said was experiencing a market correction after many investors relied on a historically cheap yen and rock-bottom interest rates to fund risky investments. That strategy was exposed after Japan last week raised benchmark interest rates for only the second time in 17 years and hinted that such rate hikes may continue.

“I don’t think it’s a civilization-altering crash,” said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ. “It’s just to me a simple case of market participants getting way ahead and, I guess you can argue, greedy, in over-leveraging, thinking that cheap and free money in Japan was going to be here to stay. And that has gone badly wrong, and they are having to very quickly unwind it and it’s having knock-on effects into asset markets.”

In an interview with VOA, Goh downplayed concerns about a U.S. recession.

“I think it’s a little bit unfair to blame the (U.S.) Fed for being late or behind the curve, because until recently a lot of people were thinking that the U.S. economy was still in reasonably good shape. And no one was really ringing the recession alarm bells,” he said.

Two years ago, the Fed started increasing borrowing costs to curb inflation, which had caused prices to soar for essentials like rent and food. Since then, it has aimed for a ""soft landing,"" seeking to control inflation without causing an economic recession.

In a commentary published Monday, BMI – A Fitch Solutions Company, said, “The Fed has significant fire power and can cut rates quite aggressively to support growth if needed.”

BMI said that while global markets have been more volatile than expected, they had recently rallied sharply and were vulnerable to a sell-off.

“Corrections of 5-10% are fairly common during bull markets and typically, there is a seasonal pick up in equity volatility during the July-October period,” it added."
"Dow plunges more than 1,000 points amid fears of U.S.",https://www.dailywire.com/news/dow-drops-more-than-1000-points-as-global-markets-plunge-amid-recession-fears,"The U.S. market got off to a rocky start on Monday, with the Dow plunging more than 1,000 points as global markets dropped amid growing concerns about a U.S. recession.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by as much as 1092 points Monday morning and was hovering around a 2.5% drop by 10:43 am EST. The NASDAQ fell by as much as 4.1%, while the S&P 500 dropped by as much as 3.3%. The U.S. market collapse followed markets around the world, from Asia to Europe, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropping more than 12%.

The struggles followed a report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showing that U.S. unemployment in July reached its highest point since October 2021. The report showed that unemployment rose to 4.3% while just 114,000 non-farm jobs were added last month, far less than the 185,000 expected by analysts.

“The market was whistling past the graveyard. I think people were basically lulled into a sense of security, yet the market itself was very vulnerable to correction — and the weaker than expected economic and employment data provided that catalyst for correction,” CFRA Research chief investment strategist Sam Stovall said.

Stocks in tech companies and artificial intelligence have seen some of the steepest drops. On the S&P 500, the tech industry was down by around 4%, while real estate was down more than 1%.

Both the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite are reportedly on track for their worst August in more than two decades, according to Market Watch. Over the past three days, S&P has been down 6.4%, and NASDAQ has been down 8.58%. Both are tracking for the worst August since 2002.

The Wall Street Journal reported that Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla combined lost around $753 billion in market capitalization as of Monday morning.

JP Morgan analysts now predict a 50-50 chance of a recession, while Goldman Sachs believes there is a 25% chance of recession in the next year.

The market crashes have triggered comments from former President Donald Trump, who said that the Biden-Harris administration was to blame for the collapse.

“Of course there is a massive market downturn. Kamala is even worse than Crooked Joe. Markets will NEVER accept the Radical Left Lunatic that DESTROYED San Francisco and California, as a whole,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “Next move, THE GREAT DEPRESSION OF 2024!

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell over 1,000 points. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was crushed by more than 3.4%. The S&P 500's (^GSPC) losses cascaded nearly 3% in its worst day since 2022, capping its worst start to any month since 2002.

Wall Street's ""fear gauge"" — the CBOE Volatility Index (^VIX) — touched its highest level since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, before retreating. Treasury yields fell, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) hovering near 3.8%.

The global stock market rapidly sold off after Friday's lackluster US jobs report added to concerns about the economy and whether the Federal Reserve had waited too long to begin cutting interest rates. Of note, almost 100% of bets are on the central bank to cut rates by 0.5% by its September meeting, according to the CME FedWatch tool.

Some of the biggest companies in the stock market saw their values plummet. Apple (AAPL) declined about 5% amid the sell-off and news that Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B) had cut its stake in the company in half. Nvidia (NVDA) pulled back over 6%. Tesla (TSLA) fell more than 4%.

Crypto also took a beating, with bitcoin (BTC-USD) sinking more than 10% to creep back toward the $54,000 level.

The concerns spread throughout the world, as well. Traders in Asia greeted the week with a similar sell-off, as Japan's Nikkei 225 (^N225) was routed by more than 12% in its biggest-ever daily loss after a surprise interest rate hike from the Bank of Japan last week.

The sharp rise in the Japanese yen against the US dollar has spurred heavy selling as speculators who had borrowed money at Japan's near-0% interest rate to buy US risk assets have been liquidating their holdings.

The US market is headed into a quieter week of data and earnings. With the jobs market still in focus, weekly unemployment claims due Thursday will take a bigger spotlight than usual."

While U.S. stock markets reacted Friday with losses, Monday was the first opportunity for the global markets to respond.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell more than 12%, South Korea’s Kospi dropped 8% and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 was down 3%.

There's concern the Federal Reserve missed its window to be ahead of a recession by not cutting interest rates. The Federal Reserve is not scheduled to meet until the middle of September, but some are calling for Chairman Jerome Powell to call an emergency meeting before then.

""We're really in limbo right now,"" financial analyst Garrett Boorojian told Scripps News.

Boorojian notes that consumer confidence is a key factor in the economy, and it's been falling as people face higher prices at places like the grocery store.

""We really have to talk to the American people and say, 'What are you feeling at home? What is the greatest concern in your household, and congressional response has to be based on what constituents are feeling, so the president and his cabinet and his economic team can really address the situation and talk to the Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell, and his team and see what can be done."""

US stocks plunged on Monday as investors worried about a potential recession and the knock-on effects from the unwind of the yen carry trade.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 1,000 points, while the Nasdaq 100 dropped about 3.4%, moving further into correction territory. Even safe-haven asset gold wasn't spared in the decline, dropping nearly 1%.

A confluence of risk factors sparked the sharp decline on Monday, including continuing concern over a weak July nonfarm payrolls report last week, news that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway cut its Apple stake in half in the second quarter, and poor earnings reports from Amazon and Intel.

All of those factors have drummed up fears that a recession could be imminent, especially given that the Federal Reserve could be ""behind the curve"" in its failure to cut interest rates last month.

Here's where US indexes stood at the 4:00 p.m. closing bell on Monday:

Some believe the Fed should implement an emergency interest rate cut, including Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel.

""I'm calling for a 75 basis point emergency cut in the Fed funds rate, with another 75 basis point cut indicated for next month at the September meeting, and that's minimum,"" Siegel said on Monday.

But perhaps the biggest driver of Monday's stock market decline was the unwind of the yen carry trade.

""After such a strong rally since last fall, valuations, sentiment, and investor positioning had become stretched. What markets are experiencing today is an unwinding of that bullish positioning, which is particularly evident in the yen and the so-called carry trade,"" market strategists at LPL said.

A surprise interest rate hike from the Bank of Japan last week, combined with the prospect for interest rate cuts from the Fed, sparked a series of margin calls as the yen strengthened.

And that led to a cascade of forced selling in the stock market, with Japan's stock market experiencing its worst decline since 1987, dropping 12%.

""A lot of money was raised in Japan at 0% interest rates and used to speculate in other parts of the world, so I think that's all coming unglued and I think it's a lot of margin calls and I think it's going to happen pretty quick and the unwind should be over by the end of the week,"" Ed Yardeni told Yahoo Finance on Monday.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — The stock market took a plunge Monday amid growing fears of an economic slowdown in the U.S. The plunge follows what analysts have been calling a bullish year.

The Dow dropped more than 1,000 points within seconds of the opening bell on Wall Street. It was the worst day for the Dow and S&P 500 since 2022.

Analysts say the plunge is the result of several factors. Jobs data from last week showed hiring slowing more than expected, the unemployment rate increased to 4.3 percent, Americans are spending less and the Federal Reserve decided not to cut interest rates last week.

Combined, the factors are fueling uncertainty and doubt, two major reasons for Monday’s market sell-off. Tech and bank stocks were hit especially hard.

Experts say it’s hard to pinpoint the exact reason for these market sell offs. There’s consensus that there’s a bit of a growth scare, which is the notion that the U.S. economy is growing much slower than expectations, which could also fuel fears of a recession.

Some experts predict a more short-term impact and encourage those with long-term investments, like their retirement, to be patient.

“For America, people should be optimistic. If you’ve been investing for the long term in the past 240 years in America, you’ve done really well,” said Professor Rodney Lake, Vice Dean for Undergraduate Programs and Director of the GW Investment Institute at George Washington University. “If you’re thinking about ten plus years over a full market cycle, you should sleep well at night and you should keep investing and thinking about the long term,” he added.

Lake says if someone is invested in the S&P 500, for example, they should keep investing, stay the course and continue to focus on long term.

“If you need more money in the short term, it should not be invested in the stock market,” said Lake.

Some are questioning whether the Fed’s decision to maintain rates was the right move. Lake says it’s always a difficult decision.

“This is a challenging job,” said Lake. “To keep inflation out of the system and have full employment, price stability and full employment are their dual mandates. That’s not an easy job to have.”

Trying to curb inflation and get it out of the system is a very tough balancing act. Lake says the Fed is taking a more cautionary approach, which he believes is the right thing to do.

“Even if you’re overcorrecting, it’s very difficult to determine that until it’s hindsight. And certainly to the Fed, it looks like they’re taking this cautionary route, which I think is the way to go,” said Lake.

The Fed meets every six weeks, they’ll meet next in September. Many experts are predicting a rate cut after that meeting."

I'm not trying to be hard on you, but I think it's important to understand that literally everyone was talking about it, non-stop, while it was happening, before it happened, and after it happened. I think it's extremely unhealthy to suggest there is some media conspiracy around coverage of this pretty normal economic event. That's just not the case.

The last 3.5 years have seen exceptional GDP growth of 6.5%, a number that is higher then almost any similar period in the last 30 years. Trying to use anecdotal data or ""feelings"" to suggest that the US economic situation is anything less the miraculous, let alone suggest that it's ""bad"", is disingenuous to the extreme. It ignores basic factual information from impartial sources across the globe in favor of your own personal narrative. I understand that sometimes it's hard to maintain perspective, so no judgment. I'm just trying to help you see a more objective picture.

It's never prefect. People lose their jobs in time of exceptional growth. 37 million people in the US live in extreme poverty. Life is going to suck for them regardless of economic climate, because the system simply isn't set up to benefit them under any circumstance. In fact one of the largest single year reduction in modern US history to the number of people in poverty happened in 2019 when, despite being a bad year for the economy overall because of the pandemic, the US enacted the largest set of social programs since the ""New Deal"". That obviously helped a lot of people. Unfortunally1.6 trillion in cuts to social programs at the start of 2020 reversed this, and we saw one of the largest increases in poverty rates since the great depression. Nearly best ever to nearly worst ever in under 11 months.

How good things are for the lower class is generally not tied to GDP, but instead to spending on social programs. Not a lot of people working minimum wage own stocks. If you're ""looking around"" and things seem bad for the common man, those cuts are a far more likely culprit then the state of the GDP,.

So I would stop hoping for an ""economic turnaround"", because what you're hoping for is a full on depression and historic levels of job loss and economic decline ... because that would be the opposite of what you are experiencing right now."
"Palantir Ups Profit Outlook, Says AI Has ‘Transformed’ Business.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/palantir-ups-profit-outlook-says-201932742.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Palantir Technologies Inc.’s stock jumped in extended trading after the company raised its annual outlook, citing continuing demand for its artificial intelligence software.

Most Read from Bloomberg

In a call with analysts, Palantir Chief Executive Officer Alex Karp said the earnings report was a “historic” one for the company, which provides data analysis tools to companies and governments, including for defense and intelligence purposes. Karp also said he believed it’s a significant time for the US. “The world is on the precipice of what could be a very severe set of violent interactions in the Middle East,” he said.

Palantir increased its 2024 revenue guidance to a range of $2.74 to $2.75 billion. Analysts had expected $2.7 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company also raised its outlook for adjusted operating income to a range of $966 million to $974 million for the year. Analysts had expected $882.9 million.

Karp stressed the importance of the company’s military business in a Monday letter to shareholders. “The strength and dominance of the US military must be preserved and defended,” he wrote, adding that this belief should be “commonplace and unremarkable” but has become “radical and risky in certain circles of elite opinion.”

Karp also said Palantir’s AI platform, released a little over a year ago, has “already transformed” its business.

The shares jumped about 13% in extended trading after closing at $24.09 in New York. The stock gained 40% this year through Monday’s close.

Co-founded by billionaire Peter Thiel in 2003, Palantir has emphasized its work with the US government and its allies. The company’s software is now used across all branches of the US military, and is involved in developing the country’s AI capabilities. After the second quarter, the company’s trailing 12 months of revenue from the US government has exceeded $1 billion for the first time, it said.

Palantir also has recently expanded its commercial business. The company reported commercial sales of $307 million, up 33% from the previous year, in line with analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Government sales were $371 million for the June quarter, the company said, up 23%. Analysts had expected government sales of $346.6 million during the June quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Story continues

Sales for the quarter were up 27% to $678 million, beating Wall Street estimates of $652.8 million. Net income during the June quarter increased to $134 million. Analysts had expected net income of $82.8 million.

“With these results we maintain our eligibility for the S&P,” Palantir Chief Financial Officer David Glazer said in an interview Monday, referring to the company’s possible inclusion in the S&P 500 Index, an event many investors are waiting for. “It’s the S&P’s call.”

Karp stressed the importance of the company’s military activities in a letter to shareholders on Monday. “The strength and dominance of the U.S. military must be preserved and defended,” he wrote, adding that this belief should be “commonplace and unobtrusive” but has become “radical and risky in certain circles of elite opinion.”

Karp also said that Palantir’s AI platform, which was released just over a year ago, has “already transformed” his business.

Shares rose about 13% in extended trading after closing at $24.09 in New York. The stock was up 40% this year through Monday’s close.

Palantir, co-founded by billionaire Peter Thiel in 2003, has emphasized its work with the U.S. government and its allies. The company’s software is now used across all branches of the U.S. military and is involved in developing the country’s AI capabilities. After the second quarter, the company’s 12-month revenue from the U.S. government topped $1 billion for the first time, the company said.

Palantir also recently expanded its commercial business. The company reported commercial sales of $307 million, up 33% from the prior year, in line with analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Government sales were $371 million for the June quarter, the company said, up 23%. Analysts had expected government sales to have been $346.6 million in the June quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The story continues

Revenue for the quarter rose 27 percent to $678 million, beating Wall Street estimates of $652.8 million. Net income in the June quarter rose to $134 million. Analysts had expected net income of $82.8 million.

“With these results, we maintain our eligibility with the S&P,” Palantir Chief Financial Officer David Glazer said in an interview Monday, referring to the company’s potential inclusion in the S&P 500 Index, an event that many investors are waiting for. “It’s the S&P’s call.”

"Palantir Ups Profit Outlook, Says AI Has ‘Transformed’ Business.",https://emeatribune.com/lumen-secures-deals-worth-5-billion-on-ai-driven-demand-for-connectivity/,"(Reuters) – Telecommunications firm Lumen Technologies has secured new deals worth $5 billion from cloud and tech companies for its networking and cyber-security solutions as more businesses rush to adapt AI driven technologies.

Deals include one with tech giant Microsoft, which announced last month that it will use Lumen’s network equipment to expand its capacity for AI workloads.

Lumen, which provides secure digital connections for data centers, said on Monday that it is involved in active discussions with customers to secure sales opportunities worth an additional $7 billion.

The surge in AI adoption has led enterprises across multiple sectors to invest heavily in building infrastructure capable of supporting AI-powered applications.

Lumen said that major corporations are rushing to secure high-capacity fiber, a resource that is becoming increasingly valuable and potentially scarce, due to growing AI requirements.

“Our partners are turning to us because of our AI-ready infrastructure and expansive network. This is just the beginning of a significant opportunity for Lumen, one that will lead to one of the largest expansions of the internet ever,” Lumen CEO Kate Johnson said.

Separately, Lumen said it has established new division, Custom Networks, to oversee its Private Connectivity Fabric solutions portfolio and meet increasing demand from various organizations.

CrowdStrike is hitting back at Delta Air Lines, accusing the carrier of trying to blame the cybersecurity firm for its own response to last month's devastating outage that resulted in thousands of canceled flights.

The technology company's allegations came in a letter Sunday, with lawyers for CrowdStrike writing that Delta had rebuffed repeated offers of assistance, included one from its CEO George Kurtz to Ed Bastian, Delta's chief executive.

""CrowdStrike's CEO personally reached out to Delta's CEO to offer onsite assistance, but received no response,"" according to the letter, signed by Michael Carlinsky, co-managing partner of law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan.

Delta's ensuing threat to sue CrowdStrike has added to a ""misleading narrative"" that the security software company is to blame for the carrier's technology decisions and its reaction to the outage, the attorney wrote.

CrowdStrike hopes that Delta will ""work cooperatively to find a resolution,"" the company said in a separate email.

Delta declined to offer specific comment on the letter, but cited Bastian's prior remarks to CNBC, in which the CEO said the airline had no choice other than to sue CrowdStrike to seek damages for the carrier's outage-related losses. Bastian told CNBC the outage had cost Delta $500 million.

The airline last week hired the law firm of famed attorney David Boies to evaluate claims against CrowdStrike and Microsoft related to a CrowdStrike bug that disabled Microsoft programs, taking down Delta's systems and creating chaos for travelers.

Delta is now under investigation by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Office of Aviation Consumer Protection. The Atlanta, Georgia-based carrier's operations were hit the hardest hit among airlines.

CrowdStrike has blamed the failure of its Falcon security platform to an errors in a quality control tool that it uses to check system updates for mistakes. The update was distributed to more than 8 million devices around the world running Microsoft Windows, causing them to crash."

You can’t come into a mission critical 24/7 operation and tell us we have a bug. It doesn’t work.”

CrowdStrike vowed to release future software updates in stages in a preliminary post-incident report.

On July 30, CrowdStrike shareholders filed a suit against the company in a Texas federal court and sought damages for declines in their investments.

CrowdStrike reports fiscal second-quarter results Aug. 28.

CrowdStrike has taken a lot of flak over the enormous IT outage that brought much of the planet's computer systems to a halt last month. One thing that the company isn't willing to accept full blame for though is Delta's severe flight troubles .

Delta CEO Ed Bastian said last week the company had ""no choice"" but to seek damages. The airline canceled more than 5,000 flights and said it was looking at a cost of over $500 million in lost revenue and compensation to passengers.

CrowdStrike fires back at Delta Air Lines after the airline company indicated it will seek damages amounting to $500 million.

The cybersecurity firm says Delta's lawsuit is 'meritless' and would prefer to work cooperatively with Delta to find a solution.

Delta reportedly didn't respond to CrowdStrike's free onsite IT consultation offer during the outage.

The digital pandemic caused by a faulty CrowdStrike kernel driver continues to brew more trouble. Last week, Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian indicated the company lost $500 million in five days due to flight cancellations, reimbursements, and more. The executive stated that the company was moving to court and had already hired a bigshot attorney, David Boies to seek damages from Microsoft and CrowdStrike for the damages incurred.

Delta's CEO indicated the company might rethink its partnership with Microsoft and CrowdStrike citing fortification concerns. ""When was the last time you heard of a big outage at Apple?"" added the CEO. While a veteran Microsoft Software Engineer recently explained the cause of the global outage that left 8.5 million Windows devices with BSoD errors for hours (potentially exonerating Microsoft from blame) the tech giant can't seem to catch a break.

In the past few weeks, blame for the digital pandemic has been shifted across CrowdStrike and Microsoft. However, CrowdStrike blatantly indicates that it's not to blame for the outage that toppled Microsoft's services, leaving thousands of passengers stranded across airports (via The Wall Street Journal).

Who caused the global IT outage? CrowdStrike says it's not at fault

In the apology letter addressed to the airline, CrowdStrike indicated it's ""highly disappointed by Delta's suggestion that CrowdStrike acted inappropriately and strongly rejects any allegation that it was grossly negligent or committed misconduct.""

“If you’re going to have priority access to the Delta ecosystem... you’ve gotta test this stuff. You can’t come into a mission-critical, 24-7 operation and tell us, ‘We have a bug.’ It doesn’t work,” indicated Delta CEO Ed Bastian in an interview with CNBC. CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz indicated he reached out to Bastian within hours of the outage and offered onsite assistance, but didn't receive a response. Technically, Bastian confirmed Kurtz's claims when he indicated that CrowdStrike had offered ""free IT consultation advice.""

CrowdStrike admitted the faulty update affected ""more than half of Delta computers, including many of Delta’s workstations at every airport in the Delta network."" The cybersecurity firm describes Delta's IT system as ""complex,"" prompting manual recovery.

A CrowdStrike spokesman indicated that the company hopes Delta Air Lines will consider working together to find a plausible solution for the emerging issues. ""Public posturing about potentially bringing a meritless lawsuit against CrowdStrike as a long-time partner is not constructive to any party,"" the spokesman added.

As highlighted in the letter addressed to Delta by CrowdStrike, the airline company will have to answer the following questions if it decides to file the suit in court:

Why Delta’s competitors, facing similar challenges, all restored operations much faster? Why Delta turned down free onsite help from CrowdStrike professionals, who assisted many other customers to restore operations much more quickly than Delta?

Finally, the letter states, ""any liability by CrowdStrike is contractually capped at an amount in the single-digit millions."" It seems no one wants to accept the blame for the massive outage, with the affected parties pointing fingers at each other. Will CrowdStrike's erroneous $10 Uber Eats gift cards and apology be enough to get Delta to back down?"

They delayed taking care of customers, denied blame, and their CEO jetted off to Paris for the Olympics.

They’ve made a big show of their plan to sue CrowdStrike for damages, since this wasn’t Delta’s fault, but they have several hurdles to overcome.



They have to show gross negligence and not merely negligence. Clearly CrowdStrike screwed up, but that’s not enough. The standard isn’t always clear, but was it intentional or at least reckless?

and not merely negligence. Clearly CrowdStrike screwed up, but that’s not enough. The standard isn’t always clear, but was it or at least reckless? Their contract with Delta caps damages.

While it appears that Delta, which shed IT staff and has taken other cost-saving moves to reduce IT expense, responded to the outage poorly compounding its effects.

CrowdStrike has responded to Delta’s legal threat,

We have expressed our regret and apologies to all of our customers for this incident and the disruption that resulted. Public posturing about potentially bringing a meritless lawsuit against CrowdStrike as a long-time partner is not constructive to any party. We hope that Delta will agree to work cooperatively to find a resolution.

In their lawyer’s response, while acknowledging they screwed up, notes that:

Delta’s meltdown was unlike any other airline

“CrowdStrike’s CEO personally reached out to Delta’s CEO to offer onsite assistance, but received no response.”

“CrowdStrike followed up with Delta on the offer for onsite support and was told that the onsite resources were not needed.”

The magnitude of the meltdown was due to “Delta’s IT decisions and response to the outage.”

In any case, “liability by CrowdStrike is contractually capped at an amount in the single-digit millions.”

They also suggest that in any litigation they’ll be forced to drag Delta’s poor IT “design and operational resiliency capabilities” and failure to upgrade systems. In other words, Delta’s reputation for premium will be further called into question. Discovery, and ultimately trial testimony, could be more damaging to Delta’s business than anything they might hope to recover."
CrowdStrike says it isn't to blame for Delta's flight cancellations after July.,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/ryanair-cancels-650-flights-boss-094415040.html,"Ryanair has revealed it cancelled some 650 flights in July because of air traffic delays, while rival Wizz Air said the global technology outage directly disrupted about 1% of its flights. The two airlines reported the impact of disruption as they unveiled how many passengers they flew last month.

Low-cost airline Ryanair said it flew 20.2 million passengers in July, an 8% jump on the 18.7 million people on its flights the same time last year. It reflects growing demand after the company said its airfares were set to be substantially cheaper over the peak summer months.

Ryanair operated more than 110,500 flights in July, but revealed that 651 flights were cancelled because of air traffic control delays. Chief executive Michael O'Leary recently said the group ""suffered a serious deterioration in European air traffic control capacity which caused multiple flight delays"".

The service has been affected by staff shortages and equipment issues which led to delays to flight schedules and cancellations. Mr O'Leary called for reform of the service which he described as ""hopelessly inefficient"".

Meanwhile, rival budget airline Wizz Air said about 1% of its scheduled flights in July were impacted by a flawed update rolled out by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which led to major disruption around the world. IT system outages led to flight cancellations, affected some healthcare systems, and crashed millions of computers using Windows.

Wizz Air also revealed that it carried 5.9 million passengers last month, 1.4% less than the six million it flew the previous year. It also blamed jet engine issues grounding some planes for a dip in its seat capacity, as well as for increased emissions as it was forced to use older planes."

In a recent significant event, cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike revealed that Delta Air Lines had rejected onsite help during a massive outage in July. The outage led to thousands of flight cancellations, costing the airline approximately $500 million, including customer compensation. Delta CEO Ed Bastian stated that the airline had no choice but to seek damages for the losses incurred.

According to CrowdStrike, Delta informed them and Microsoft that they were planning to pursue legal claims to recover their losses and had hired law firm Boies Schiller Flexner. However, CrowdStrike’s lawyer, Michael Carlinsky, refuted Delta’s claims, stating that CrowdStrike had offered onsite assistance to Delta but received no response from them.

The outage, caused by a botched software update, resulted in Delta canceling over 5,000 flights between July 19 and 25, more than its competitors. CrowdStrike’s shares have depreciated by over 36% since the incident, impacting millions of computers across various industries, including banking, healthcare, and air travel.

Carlinsky highlighted that Delta would need to explain its actions to the public, shareholders, and potentially a jury, as CrowdStrike’s contractual liability is limited to single-digit millions. CrowdStrike hopes to resolve the issue cooperatively with Delta.

Despite the challenges faced during the outage, Bastian emphasized the importance of testing technology updates thoroughly before implementing them in critical operations. CrowdStrike has committed to releasing future software updates in stages to prevent similar incidents.

In response to the events, CrowdStrike shareholders filed a lawsuit against the company in a Texas federal court, seeking damages for their investment declines. CrowdStrike is set to report its fiscal second-quarter results on August 28, while Microsoft has yet to comment on the situation.

The implications of this event on the cybersecurity and airline industries remain to be seen, with potential repercussions for both Delta and CrowdStrike. As the situation unfolds, it will be crucial to monitor how both companies navigate the aftermath of the outage and the legal challenges ahead."
The value of AI chip start-up Groq rises to $2.8 billion.,https://fortune.com/2024/08/05/nvidia-challenger-groq-raises-640-million-ai-chips-2-8-billion-valuation-college-dropout-ceo-jonathan-ross/,"Six months ago, AI chip startup Groq was flying so far under the radar that one of its few newsworthy moments was when CEO Jonathan Ross sent Elon Musk a sarcastic cease and desist letter complaining about xAI’s similarly named chatbot, Grok. That all changed Monday, however, with the news that the Silicon Valley–based Groq, one of several startups picking off pieces of Nvidia’s AI chip business, has raised $640 million in a funding round led by BlackRock that values the company at $2.8 billion. Industry leaders like Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg are touting Groq, while Meta chief AI scientist Yann LeCun has come on board as a technical advisor.

But it was a viral moment in February 2024 that set the stage for today’s massive funding round. It was “100% a game changer,” Ross told Fortune in a recent interview.

Unlike Nvidia GPUs, which are used for both training today’s most sophisticated AI models as well as powering the model output (a process known as “inference”), Groq’s AI chips are strictly focused on improving the speed of inference—that is, providing remarkably fast text output for large language models (LLMs), at a far lower cost than Nvidia GPUs.

But Groq has struggled with how to show potential users the power of its chips. The answer, it turned out, was for Groq create its own ChatGPT-like experience.

In February, Groq set up its own conversational chatbot on its website that it said broke speed records for LLM output on open-source models including Meta’s Llama. Then a developer posted a short video on X showing how Groq, powering an LLM from Paris-based startup Mistral, could provide answers to questions with hundreds of words in less than a second. Ross said the company’s fortunes immediately changed—there were suddenly thousands of developers clamoring to build their AI tools using Groq’s powerful AI chips. Just six months later, there are now 300,000 developers accessing Groq’s solutions and hardware through its AI cloud service.

AI chips in the cloud

At the moment, though, the vast majority of those developers are using Groq’s services for free—so it remains to be seen how Groq, which currently has 200 employees, plans to become profitable. “We’ve only made paid access available to little over 30 customers at the moment,” said Ross, because of limited capacity. While he says he expects to have some “pretty good revenue” this year, “one of the benefits of being a private company is we don’t have to talk about our revenue.”

While it might seem easy to question Groq’s long-term prospects with so little insight into revenue, Ross has a long history of surpassing expectations. After dropping out of high school because he “was bored,” he learned computer programming and, after a stint at Hunter College, managed to get into NYU. There, he took PhD classes as an undergraduate for two years and then, once again, dropped out. “I didn’t want to cap my earning opportunity by graduating from something,” he joked. That led to a job at Google, where he helped invent Google’s AI chip, called the TPU, before leaving to launch Groq in 2016.

Ross says Groq has no intention of being a startup that lives off of VC funding rather than having a sustainable business. “You’ve got Sam Altman saying he doesn’t care how much money he loses,” he said. “We actually intend to recoup our investment with this money that we’ve raised, so we will actually get every dollar back on the hardware that we deploy.” Groq was able to raise over half a billion dollars, he explained, because “we have more demand than we can possibly satisfy.” The investment will allow the company to build out more hardware and charge customers who are eager for higher rate limits.

Groq is not the only AI chip startup looking to challenge Nvidia: Cerebras, for example, recently filed confidentially for an IPO, while SambaNova, Etched, and Fractile are also in the mix. And of course, established GPU chipmakers like AMD are ramping up their AI efforts. But analyst Daniel Newman recently told Fortune that there is “no natural predator to Nvidia in the wild right now.”

That said, even if Groq can only nibble a tiny portion of Nvidia’s pie, it will provide plenty of business. “I don’t know if Nvidia will notice how much of the pie we eat, but we will feel quite full off of it,” said Ross. “It’ll be a huge multiple in terms of our valuation going forward.”"
The value of AI chip start-up Groq rises to $2.8 billion.,https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/05/ai-chip-startup-groq-lands-640m-to-challenge-nvidia/,"Groq, a startup developing chips to run generative AI models faster than conventional processors, said on Monday that it has raised $640 million in a new funding round led by Blackrock. Neuberger Berman, Type One Ventures, Cisco, KDDI and Samsung Catalyst Fund also participated.

The tranche, which brings Groq’s total raised to over $1 billion and values the company at $2.8 billion, is a major win for Groq, which reportedly was originally looking to raise $300 million at a slightly lower ($2.5 billion) valuation. It more than doubles Groq’s previous valuation (~$1 billion) in April 2021, when the company raised $300 million in a round led by Tiger Global Management and D1 Capital Partners.

Meta chief AI scientist Yann LeCun will serve as a technical advisor to Groq and Stuart Pann, the former head of Intel’s foundry business and ex-CIO at HP, will join the startup as chief operating officer, Groq also announced today. LeCun’s appointment is a bit unexpected, given Meta’s investments in its own AI chips — but it undoubtedly gives Groq a powerful ally in a cutthroat space.

Groq, which emerged from stealth in 2016, is creating what it calls an LPU (language processing unit) inference engine. The company claims its LPUs can run existing generative AI models similar in architecture to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and GPT-4o at 10x the speed and one-tenth the energy.

Groq CEO Jonathan Ross’ claim to fame is helping to invent the tensor processing unit (TPU), Google’s custom AI accelerator chip used to train and run models. Ross teamed up with Douglas Wightman, an entrepreneur and former engineer at Google parent company Alphabet’s X moonshot lab, to co-found Groq close to a decade ago.

Groq provides an LPU-powered developer platform called GroqCloud that offers “open” models like Meta’s Llama 3.1 family, Google’s Gemma, OpenAI’s Whisper and Mistral’s Mixtral, as well as an API that allows customers to use its chips in cloud instances. (Groq also hosts a playground for AI-powered chatbots, GroqChat, that it launched late last year.) As of July, GroqCloud had more than 356,000 developers; Groq says that a portion of the proceeds from the round will be used to scale capacity and add new models and features.

“Many of these developers are at large enterprises,” Stuart Pann, Groq’s COO, told TechCrunch. “By our estimates, over 75% of the Fortune 100 are represented.”

As the generative AI boom continues, Groq faces increasing competition from both rival AI chip upstarts and Nvidia, the formidable incumbent in the AI hardware sector.

Nvidia controls an estimated 70% to 95% of the market for AI chips used to train and deploy generative AI models, and the firm’s taking aggressive steps to maintain its dominance.

Nvidia has committed to releasing a new AI chip architecture every year, rather than every other year as was the case historically. And it’s reportedly establishing a new business unit focused on designing bespoke chips for cloud computing firms and others, including AI hardware.

Beyond Nvidia, Groq competes with Amazon, Google and Microsoft, all of which offer — or will soon offer — custom chips for AI workloads in the cloud. Amazon has its Trainium, Inferentia and Graviton processors, available through AWS; Google Cloud customers can use the aforementioned TPUs and, in time, Google’s Axion chip; and Microsoft recently launched Azure instances in preview for its Cobalt 100 CPU, with Maia 100 AI Accelerator instances to come in the next several months.

Groq could consider Arm, Intel, AMD and a growing number of startups as rivals, too, in an AI chip market that could reach $400 billion in annual sales in the next five years, according to some analysts. Arm and AMD in particular have blossoming AI chip businesses, thanks to soaring capital spending by cloud vendors to meet the capacity demand for generative AI.

D-Matrix late last year raised $110 million to commercialize what it’s characterizing as a first-of-its-kind inference compute platform. In June, Etched emerged from stealth with $120 million for a processor custom-built to speed up the dominant generative AI model architecture today, the transformer. SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son is reportedly looking to raise $100 billion for a chip venture to compete Nvidia. And OpenAI is said to be in talks with investment firms to launch an AI chip-making initiative.

To carve out its niche, Groq is investing heavily in enterprise and government outreach.

In March, Groq acquired Definitive Intelligence, a Palo Alto-based firm offering a range of business-oriented AI solutions, to form a new business unit called Groq Systems. Within Groq Systems’ purview is serving organizations, including U.S. government agencies and sovereign nations, that wish to add Groq’s chips to existing data centers or build new data centers using Groq processors.

More recently, Groq partnered with Carahsoft, a government IT contractor, to sell its solutions to public sector clients through Carahsoft’s reseller partners, and the startup has a letter of intent to install tens of thousands of its LPUs at European firm Earth Wind & Power’s Norway data center.

Groq is also collaborating with Saudi Arabian consulting firm Aramco Digital to install LPUs in future data centers in the Middle East.

At the same time it’s establishing customer relationships, Mountain View, California-based Groq is marching toward the next generation of its chip. Last August, the company announced that it would contract with Samsung’s foundry business to manufacture 4nm LPUs, which are expected to deliver performance and efficiency gains over Groq’s first-gen 13nm chips.

Groq says it plans to deploy more than 108,000 LPUs by the end of Q1 2025."
The value of AI chip start-up Groq rises to $2.8 billion.,https://www.maginative.com/article/ai-chip-startup-groq-secures-640-million-in-funding-valued-at-2-8-billion/,"Groq, a startup developing specialized chips for generative AI, has raised $640 million in a new funding round led by BlackRock. The investment values the company at $2.8 billion, nearly tripling its previous valuation from 2021.

The Mountain View, California-based firm aims to accelerate AI workloads with its Language Processing Units (LPUs). Groq claims these chips can run generative AI models up to 10 times faster than conventional processors while using one-tenth of the energy.

Notable investors in this round include Neuberger Berman, Cisco, Samsung Catalyst Fund, and others. The funding brings Groq's total capital raised to over $1 billion, underlining strong investor interest in AI chip innovation.

Groq also announced two high-profile additions to its team. Meta's chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, will serve as a technical advisor. Stuart Pann, former head of Intel's foundry business, joins as chief operating officer to drive revenue growth and scale operations.

The company's GroqCloud platform, which offers access to various open AI models, has attracted over 356,000 developers since its launch. Groq plans to use the new funds to expand capacity and add features to this service.

As demand for AI computing power surges, Groq faces stiff competition from industry leader Nvidia and other tech giants developing custom AI chips. The startup is betting on its purpose-built LPUs and focus on inference tasks to carve out a niche in the rapidly growing AI chip market.

Groq CEO Jonathan Ross, who previously helped invent Google's Tensor Processing Unit, sees the funding as a major step forward. ""This funding accelerates our vision of delivering instant AI inference compute to the world,"" Ross stated.

The company aims to deploy over 108,000 LPUs by early 2025 and is partnering with Samsung to manufacture its next-generation 4nm chips. As AI continues to reshape the tech landscape, Groq's progress will be closely watched by industry observers and potential customers alike."

The value of AI chip start-up Groq rises to $2.8 billion.,https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/news/366599856/AI-inference-startup-Groq-raises-640M,"AI inference vendor Groq revealed on Monday that it raised $640 million in a series D funding round, bringing its valuation to $2.8 billion.

The funding round was led by BlackRock Private Equity Partners, with a contribution from Neuberger Berman and .

The Groq funding development emerges amid a market dominated by AI hardware and software giant Nvidia Systems.

Challenging Nvidia However, the notably large chunk of capital Groq has raised appears to be a vote of confidence for the AI inference vendor, said Mark Beccue, an analyst with TechTarget’s Enterprise Strategy Group. ""We haven't seen that kind of money from a chip company lately,"" Beccue said. Groq was founded in 2016 by former Google engineer Jonathan Ross. Ross designed and implemented the core foundation of Google's tensor processing unit chip (TPU). As a vendor, Groq develops a language processing unit and sells it as a service. The startup plans to deploy over 108,000 LPUs by the end of first quarter 2025. Despite having an architecture similar to Google’s TPUs and targeting the inference market, it might be an exaggeration to say that Groq is going head-to-head against Nvidia, said Chirag Dekate, a Gartner analyst. ""Nvidia has deep entrenchment,"" Dekate said. ""Everything from silicon through software systems."" However, there is a supply shortage in the AI inference market for graphics processing units (GPUs) that is creating opportunities for Nvidia's competitors and other startups like Groq. ""The invest community is sensing that there's a supply-demand imbalance around immediate GPUs and the market is rewarding any alternative that can help plug even part of the gap,"" Dekate said. The $640 million Series D round for Groq is a fraction of the revenue that Nvidia makes in a quarter and so the fund raise is, in some ways, a hedge play by investors, he added. Moreover, many enterprise AI customers are likely not going to turn to specialized providers if they have already invested millions into their existing cloud providers such as AWS, Microsoft and Google, Dekate continued. ""An episodic utilization of inferencing may make sense, but I don't think this would be a strategic play for enterprise entities,"" he said. ""This is more for model innovators that can access a lot of these resources at low cost.""

A push for Nvidia However, Groq can be the push Nvidia needs to be challenged, Futurum Group analyst Olivier Blanchard said. ""One of the dangers of having extremely dominant companies in a particular industry like this, is that if they're not really challenged a whole lot, you might end up with a very linear innovation, very predictable innovation track,"" Blanchard said. That kind of evenly paced innovation track means carries positives including being easily understood and providing the opportunity for budgeting product roadmap. On the other hand, a predictable innovation track also could result in a longer time to get good products to market. ""If nobody's really challenging Nvidia, or any company, but Nvidia in this case, to really innovate as fast as it can, it's going to innovate comfortably, as opposed to pushing its own limits,"" Blanchard said. Groq may not challenge Nvidia immediately, but it might spark the much bigger vendor to push ahead more to keep its top spot, he added. More AI companies in the market also tends to diversify the supply chain leading to more capacity, Blanchard added."
The value of AI chip start-up Groq rises to $2.8 billion.,https://insidehpc.com/2024/08/ai-inference-chip-startup-groq-raises-640m/,"Amid the gloom of the technology industry meltdown on Wall Street, AI inference chip startup Groq announced today it has secured a $640 million Series D round at a valuation of $2.8 billion.

Groq also announced that Stuart Pann, formerly a senior executive at HP and Intel, joined its leadership team as COO. And Groq announced the addition of its newest technical advisor, Yann LeCun, VP and chief AI scientist at Meta.

The round was led by funds and accounts managed by BlackRock Private Equity Partners with participation from both existing and new investors including Neuberger Berman, Type One Ventures, and strategic investors including Cisco Investments, Global Brain’s KDDI Open Innovation Fund III, and Samsung Catalyst Fund. The unique, vertically integrated Groq AI inference platform has generated skyrocketing demand from developers seeking exceptional speed.

“We are highly impressed by Groq’s disruptive compute architecture and their software-first approach. Groq’s record-breaking speed and near-instant Generative AI inference performance leads the market,” said Marco Chisari, Head of Samsung Semiconductor Innovation Center and EVP of Samsung Electronics.

“You can’t power AI without inference compute,” said Jonathan Ross, CEO and Founder of Groq. “We intend to make the resources available so that anyone can create cutting-edge AI products, not just the largest tech companies. This funding will enable us to deploy more than 100,000 additional LPUs into GroqCloud. Training AI models is solved, now it’s time to deploy these models so the world can use them. Having secured twice the funding sought, we now plan to significantly expand our talent density. We’re the team enabling hundreds of thousands of developers to build on open models and – we’re hiring.”

Groq said it has grown to over 360,000 developers building on GroqCloud, creating AI applications on openly-available models such as Llama 3.1 from Meta, Whisper Large V3 from OpenAI, Gemma from Google, and Mixtral from Mistral.

Groq said it will use the funding to scale the capacity of its tokens-as-a-service (TaaS) offering and add new models and features to GroqCloud.

As Gen AI applications move from training to deployment, developers and enterprises require an inference strategy that meets the user and market need for speed, according to Groq. To meet its developer and enterprise demand, the company will deploy over 108,000 Groq AI LPUs manufactured by GlobalFoundries by the end of Q1 2025, the largest AI inference compute deployment of any non-hyperscaler.

Mohsen Moazami, President of International at Groq, former leader of Emerging Markets at Cisco, is leading commercial efforts with enterprises and partners including Aramco Digital and Earth Wind & Power to build out AI compute centers globally. This will ensure developers have access to Groq technology regardless of their location.

“Aramco Digital is partnering with Groq to build one of the largest AI Inference-as-a-Service compute infrastructure in the MENA region,” said Tareq Amin, Chief Executive Officer, Aramco Digital. “Our close collaboration with Groq is transformational for both domestic and global AI demand.”

Groq LPU AI inference technology is architected with a software-first design to meet the unique characteristics and needs of AI. This approach has given Groq an advantage to bring new models to developers quickly. The investment will enable Groq to accelerate the next two generations of LPU, according to the company.

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC served as exclusive placement agent to Groq on the transaction."
The value of AI chip start-up Groq rises to $2.8 billion.,https://www.mobileworldlive.com/ai-cloud/kddi-cisco-back-startup-groq-in-640m-funding-round/,"Groq, a start-up specialising in AI chips, raised $640 million in a funding round which included involvement from KDDI, Samsung Electronics and Cisco, giving it a valuation of $2.8 billion.

The financing round was led by investor BlackRock and attracted backing from investment funds of the two technology giants and the Japanese operator’s venture arm it runs in partnership with Global Brain.

Groq, founded by former Google engineer Jonathan Ross, claims the fresh funding will aid its plan to hire new talent and deploy more than 108,000 language processing units into its cloud architecture.

This will enable technology companies including newcomers “to create cutting-edge AI products”, Ross said.

The startup builds advanced AI inference processors which delivers “exceptional AI compute speed, quality and energy efficiency”. It also provides cloud and on-premises solutions for AI applications.

Groq claimed its AI inference chipset “has generated skyrocketing demand from developers seeking exceptional speed” and powers new applications based on open-sourced models, including Meta Platforms’ Llama 3.1.

Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg lauded “innovators like Groq”, which “have built low-latency, low-cost inference serving for all the new models” in an open letter published last month.

Groq has also notably struck a partnership with Aramco Digital to establish AI compute centres globally."

The Silicon Valley firm, founded by a former Alphabet engineer, specializes in producing AI inference chips – a type of semiconductor that optimizes speed and executes commands of pre-trained models.

Besides big firms such as Advanced Micro Devices, many startups including Groq have been trying to nibble away at Nvidia’s dominant position in the booming AI chip industry.

Last year, Groq adapted Meta Platforms’ large language model, LLaMA, to be able to run on its own chips rather than those of Nvidia’s. Meta researchers built LLaMA using Nvidia’s chips.

Cloud service providers racing to develop their own AI products are also seeking alternatives to Nvidia’s top-of-the-line processors due to high demand but limited supply.

In 2021, Groq was valued at $1.1 billion after a funding from Tiger Global Management and D1 Capital.

“Groq will use the funding to scale the capacity of its tokens-as-a-service (TaaS) offering and add new models and features to the GroqCloud,” the company said about the latest round of funds.

Groq will deploy more than 108,000 Language Processing Units manufactured by Global Foundries by the end of the first quarter of 2025.

Groq has also announced the appointment of Stuart Pann, a former senior executive at Intel and HP Inc, as its chief operating officer, while Meta’s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun was named its newest technical adviser.

The value of AI chip start-up Groq rises to $2.8 billion.,https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/05/groq_ai_funding/,"Even as at least some investors begin to question the return on investment of AI infrastructure and services, venture capitalists appear to be doubling down. On Monday, AI chip startup Groq — not to be confused with xAI's Grok chatbot — announced it had scored $640 million in series-D funding to bolster its inference cloud.

Founded in 2016, the Mountain View, California-based startup began its life as an AI chip slinger targeting high throughput, low cost inferencing as opposed to training. Since then the company has transitioned to an AI infrastructure-as-a-service provider and walked away from selling hardware.

In total, Groq has raised more than $1 billion and now boasts a valuation of $2.8 billion, with its latest funding round led by the likes of BlackRock, Neuberger Berman, Type One Ventures, Cisco Investments, Global Brain, and Samsung Catalyst.

The firm's main claim to fame is that its chips can generate more tokens faster, while using less energy, than GPU-based equipment. At the heart of all of this, is Groq's Language Processing Unit (LPU), which approaches the problem of running LLMs a little differently.

AI has yet to pay off – or is transforming business READ MORE

As our sibling site The Next Platform previously explored, Groq's LPUs don't require gobs of pricy high-bandwidth memory or advantaged packaging — both factors that have contributed to bottlenecks in the supply of AI infrastructure.

Instead, Groq's strategy is to stitch together hundreds of LPUs, each packed with on-die SRAM, using a fiber optic interconnect. Using a cluster of 576 LPUs, Groq claims it was able to achieve generation rates of more than 300 tokens per second on Meta's Llama 2 70B model, 10x that of an HGX H100 system with eight GPUs, while consuming a tenth of the power.

Groq now intends to use its millions to expand headcount and bolster its inference cloud to support more customers. As it stands, Groq purports to have more than 360,000 developers build on GroqCloud creating applications using openly available models.

Training AI models is solved, now it's time to deploy these models so the world can use them

""This funding will enable us to deploy more than 100,000 additional LPUs into GroqCloud,"" CEO Jonathan Ross said Monday.

""Training AI models is solved, now it's time to deploy these models so the world can use them. Having secured twice the funding sought, we now plan to significantly expand our talent density.

These won't, however, be Groq's next-gen LPUs. Instead, they'll be built using GlobalFoundries' 14nm process node, and delivered by the end of Q1 2025. Nvidia's next-gen Blackwell GPUs are expected to be arriving within the next 12 or so months, depending on how delayed they turn out to be.

Groq is said to be working on two new generations of LPUs, which, last we heard, would utilize Samsung's 4nm process tech and deliver somewhere between 15x and 20x higher power efficiency.

You can find a deeper dive on Groq's LPU strategy and performance claims on The Next Platform.

VC Capital continues to flow into AI startups

Groq isn't the only infrastructure vendor that's managed to capitalize on all the AI hype. In fact, $640 billion is far from the largest chunk of change we've seen startups walk away with in recent memory.

As you may recall, back in May, GPU bit barn CoreWeave scored $1.1 billion in series-C funding weeks before it managed to talk Blackstone, Blackrock, and others into a loan for $7.5 billion using its GPUs as collateral.

Meanwhile, Lambda labs, another GPU cloud operator, used its cache of GPUs to secure a combined $820 million in fresh funding and debt financing since February, and it doesn't look like it is satisfied yet. Last month we learned Lambda was reportedly in talks with VCs for another $800 million in funding to support the deployment of yet more Nvidia GPUs.

While VC funding continues to flow into AI startups, it seems some on Wall Street are increasingly nervous about whether these multi-billion-dollar investments in AI infrastructure will ever pay off.

Still that hasn't stopped ML upstarts, such as Cerebras, from pursuing an initial public offering (IPO). Last week the outfit, best known for its dinner plate-sized accelerators aimed at model training, revealed it had confidentially filed for a public listing.

Is AI going to pay its way? Wall Street wants tech world to show it the money LISTEN IN

The size and price range of the IPO have yet to be determined. Cerebras' rather unusual approach to the problem of AI training has helped it win north of $900 million in commitments from the likes of G42.

Meanwhile, with the rather notable exception in Intel, which saw its profits plunge $1.6 billion year-over-year in Q2 amid plans to lay off at least 15 percent of its workforce, chip vendors and the cloud providers reselling access to their accelerators have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom. Last week, AMD revealed its MI300X GPUs accounted for more than $1 billion of its datacenter sales.

However, it appears that the real litmus test for whether the AI hype train is about to derail won't come until the market leader Nvidia announces its earnings and outlook later this month. ®"

Nearly 92% of software-as-a-service (SaaS) startups in India have integrated some form of artificial intelligence (AI) features into their products over the past 12 months, with almost 87% of these companies describing themselves as either an AI-native SaaS or an AI-enabled SaaS, according to a report by venture capital firm Bessemer Venture Partners This integration of AI technologies such as machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and advanced analytics into SaaS platforms helps make software more intuitive, adaptive, and capable of automating complex tasks.“We expect the SaaS market to get to $50 billion in the next six years because there is a massive tailwind coming from the AI and the generative AI world. We believe India's SaaS sector is fundamentally transitioning to what we call as IndAI SaaS,” Anant Vidur Puri, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners told ET.The report, titled ‘The Rise of SaaS in India 2024’ surveyed around 100 SaaS startups with annual recurring revenue (ARR) ranging from $3 million to $200 million, Puri said.Further, the report forecasts that Indian SaaS centaurs and unicorns will generate $20 to $25 billion in revenue by 2030. India-first companies like Perfios, Bill Desk, and Razorpay are expected to achieve an ARR of $5 billion by 2023, while global-first companies such as Zoho, Amagi, and Icertis are projected to reach an ARR of approximately $17 billion in the same period. Collectively, these unicorns and centaurs added $5.9 billion in revenue during 2023 alone.In 2024, India saw two new SaaS unicorns Perfios and Krutrim Centaurs are defined as startups with valuations exceeding $100 million, while unicorns are those valued at over $1 billion.The report also noted that between 2022 and 2023, over 100 companies achieved revenues between $1-5 million, and nearly 40 companies between $5-10 million.“This data tells that the adoption of software in the ecosystem is going up and more people are ready to trust smaller companies which come and implement in their environment,” Puri added.Also, total investment in Indian SaaS startups this year is on track to surpass 2023 levels. The companies in the sector have raised $0.53 billion in the first half of 2024, compared to $0.9 billion in 2023, the report showed.“AI has been an undeniable catalyst for Indian SaaS. It has accelerated our ability to move swiftly and decisively in the market. Indian entrepreneurs are combining their product strengths with complementary services, to deliver capital-efficient results. At Everstage, we are incredibly excited about the potential of AI and are rolling out new modules with this technology at its core,” Siva Rajamani, cofounder and CEO of the SaaS startup Everstage said in the report.As Indian SaaS companies increasingly adopt AI into their operations, the risk of cybersecurity threats has risen correspondingly.

DHAKA: What began as peaceful protests by students in Bangladesh against a quota system for government jobs eventually turned into an uprising that forced Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign and flee the country by helicopter.The end to her 15 years in power came after weeks of violent unrest during which nearly 300 people died, according to local media reports.The government repeatedly tried to quell demonstrations they blamed on sabotage and opposition parties with bullets, curfews and internet outages, but these heavy-handed moves backfired, fueling outrage and further protests.On Monday, protesters defied a military curfew to march into the capital's center, following a weekend of violence left dozens of people dead. As troops pulled back and internet access was restored, tens of thousands of people began to celebrate in the streets, and thousands stormed the leader's official residence.Military chief Gen. Waker-uz-Zaman said the army would seek the president's guidance to form an interim government as he called for calm in a public address Monday afternoon.Here's what we know:The protests, which have drawn hundreds of thousands, began in July with students demonstrating against a controversial quota system that allocated government jobs.It turned violent on July 15 as student protesters clashed with security officials and pro-government activists, prompting authorities to disperse tear gas, fire rubber bullets and to close schools and impose a curfew with a shoot-on-sight order. The internet and mobile data were also turned off.The government says nearly 150 people died last month, while local media have reported that more than 200 were killed.At first, the demonstrations were against a quota system that set aside up to 30% of government jobs for family members of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's 1971 war of independence against Pakistan.Protesters said the system was discriminatory and benefited supporters of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League party, which led the independence movement.The furor highlighted the extent of economic distress in Bangladesh, where exports have fallen and foreign exchange reserves are running low. There's a lack of quality jobs for young graduates, who increasingly seek the more stable and lucrative government jobs.As the violence crested, the Supreme Court last month ruled that the veterans' quota must be cut to 5%, with 93% of jobs to be allocated on merit. The remaining 2% will be set aside for members of ethnic minorities and transgender and disabled people.The government accepted the decision, and restored the internet thinking that the situation would ease. But the protests grew, with new demands for investigations into the deadly crackdowns, and eventually for Hasina and her cabinet to step down.Thousands of protesters celebrated in the capital, waving Bangladeshi flags as the news broke, while other looted her official residence, carrying out furniture and even fish from the kitchens. But after 15 years of her administration it's not clear what comes next.Gen. Waker-uz-Zaman promised that the military would stand down, and to launch an investigation into the deadly crackdowns that fueled outrage against the government.""Keep faith in the military, we will investigate all the killings and punish the responsible,"" he said. ""I have ordered that no army and police will indulge in any kind of firing.""He asked for patience as a new government is formed.""Now, the students' duty is to stay calm and help us,"" he added.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel"

Indian e-scooter maker Ola Electric's $734 mln IPO fully subscribed

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Ola Electric's $734 million initial public offering (IPO) was fully subscribed on the second day of bidding, reaching the target amid a sharp sell-off in global equity markets.

The SoftBank-backed company's IPO, the first by an electric vehicle maker in India and also the country's biggest this year, has received bids worth about $447 million, 1.06 times the shares on offer, exchange data showed on Monday.

Ola's IPO was 35% subscribed on the first day of bidding. There is one more day of bidding to go.

More than 150 companies have raised nearly $5 billion on India's booming stock market so far this year, almost double the amount raised in the same period of 2023, according to LSEG data.

Although Indian equity markets have touched fresh highs in recent months, they logged their worst day in two months on Monday amid a global sell-off.

Ola, founded by Bhavish Aggarwal, will use a major chunk of the IPO proceeds to invest in its in-house cell manufacturing which will be used to power its own scooters.

This initiative, an India-first, would boost cost efficiency at the currently loss-making company.

The IPO has also drawn interest from big institutions including Nomura, Norges Bank and a few domestic mutual funds, which bid for $2 billion worth of shares, six times the amount set aside for them.

South Korea's Kospi index fell close to 9%, while shares around Asia outside Japan lost a milder but still painful 4.2%.

The value of AI chip start-up Groq rises to $2.8 billion.,https://techgenyz.com/ai-chip-startup-groq-secures-640m-challenge-nvidias/,"Groq, an American artificial intelligence startup is allegedly developing chips that can run generative AI models faster than usual. As reported on Monday, due to a funding round led by Blackrock, the company has raised $640 million. Other ventures such as Neuberger Berman, Type One Ventures, Cisco, KDDI, and Samsung Catalyst Fund also participated in this round.

Therefore Groq has raised over $1 billion while the company aimed at raising only $300 million. Currently, the company is valued at $2.8 billion. This is a mega success for the company as it is more than double the value of the previous year’s valuation which was at $1 billion in April 2021.

At the time, the company had raised $300 million led by Tiger Global Management and D1 Capital Partners.

Groq is creating a language processing unit or LPU that they claim can run existing generative AI models similar in architecture to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and GPT-4o at 10x the speed and one-tenth the energy. Besides, Jonathan Ross, the CEO of Groq is helping invent the TPU or the tensor processing unit, Google’s custom AI accelerator chip used to train and run models.

GroqCloud, an LPU-powered developer platform provided by the company offers “open” models like Goggle’s Gemma, OpenAI’s Whisper, etc., and an API that allows users to use its chips in cloud instances.

Groq has more than 356,000 developers as of July, and the portion of its proceeds from the round will be utilized to add new models and features. The company also hosts an AI-powered chatbot called GroqChat, which was launched in late 2023.

Due to the growing demand for AI, the company faces major competition with rival AI chip upstarts and Nvidia. Nvidia which controls approximately 70% to 95% of the AI chips market is taking aggressive steps to continue its dominance in this realm.

Other than Nvidia, Groq’s competitors are Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, all of whom currently offer or plan to offer customized chips for cloud-based AI workloads.

However, Groq is investing heavily in government outreach and enterprises. With the acquisition of Definitive Intelligence in March, Groq formed a new business unit called Groq Systems, which offers AI solutions for business.

As part of Groq Systems’ mission, the company serves organizations that wish to add Groq’s chips to existing data centers or build new data centers using Groq processors. By the end of 2025, Groq plans to deploy over 108,000 LPUs."
"The Fed is trying to 'fight a ghost' as recession fears mount, investor says.",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/05/the-fed-is-trying-to-fight-a-ghost-as-recession-fears-mount.html,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announces interest rates will remain unchanged during a news conference at the Federal Reserves' William McChesney Martin Building in Washington, D.C., on June 12, 2024.

LONDON — As a global market sell-off continues amid fears of a looming U.S. recession, the Federal Reserve may have little room for manoeuvre, investor Cole Smead warned Monday.

Smead, who is CEO of Smead Capital Management, told CNBC that the Fed is still attempting to combat the after effects of bumper fiscal stimulus, which have made it difficult to accurately gauge the state of the economy.

""The Fed is trying to fight a ghost in some respects. The ghost is a massive amount of federal spending on deficit, 7% of U.S. GDP, and it's very hard to counteract a problem like that, that you didn't create,"" Smead told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""

""I think Jay Powell is doing all he can to understand that problem and counteract it with monetary policy. But it's a fiscal problem, and that fiscal problem's not ending,"" he said.

The market rout extended on Monday, with U.S. futures mirroring losses in Europe and Asia after a weaker-than-anticipated jobs report for July and a higher unemployment rate ignited worries that the U.S. economy could be falling into a recession.

The Cboe Volatility Index, also known as the ""VIX"" — a measure of expected market volatility — jumped to 41.65, according to LSEG data, hitting its highest level since October 2020, as risk fears returned to the market.

Investors have grown concerned that the Fed has been too slow to cut interest rates after hiking them in a range between 5.25% and 5.5% to combat inflation from the Covid-19 era.

The U.S. central bank held rates steady at its latest policy meeting last week, but markets are predicting that it may now need to more faster and more firmly to prevent a downturn, with interest rate futures contracts pricing in a 70% chance of a 50 basis-point cut in September, according to Reuters.

Smead said the latest inflation data, which showed price rises dipped in June for the first time in four years, was a positive signal for markets — but he noted that underlying issues remain.

He said he now sees the U.S. falling into recession ""at some point,"" though he added this was more likely to be led by the loss in asset values from the fall off of the stock market.

The Fed will continue to have a challenge on its hands as it grapples with the added inflationary pressures of the U.S. election cycle and the prospect of wider conflict in the Middle East, Smead noted.

""Is it likely to see us tame our fiscal spending in the interim?"" he said of the election campaign. ""The answer is 'no.'""

""Whoever comes in, be it Kamala Harris or Donald Trump, there's going to be an interest in trying to prop up anything,"" he said."

DiMartino Booth explained how a weakening job market and increasing Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings signal that the U.S. is already in a recession. She believes it started sometime around last October. Additionally, declining housing prices and increasing apartment supply suggest this trend may continue, she said.

Artificial intelligence is a key tool for employers looking to cut costs, with the highly regarded CFO Survey from the first quarter of the year showing that nearly 60% of companies overall are using AI. Of the largest companies, 84.2% are using it, up 10 percentage points from the prior quarter.

""America's chief financial officers — tasked as they are with controlling costs in an economic downturn — have clearly demonstrated that AI will become a mainstay as chapter one of the rollout of this technology continues to play out, replacing warm bodies with technology,"" DiMartino Booth told CNBC.

Currently, employers are adjusting as they discover how AI best fits into their business models. DiMartino Booth suggested that ""for the next six to 18 months, AI is going to … feel like a weapon of mass destruction.""

However, she also said, ""there is going to be a much happier ending to AI,"" as the technology has the capability to revolutionize the health care and education systems.

DiMartino Booth also said the Fed isn't entirely to blame for the high levels of inflation explaining that the ""interest rate policy is a blunt instrument."" However, she noted the central bank owned over one-quarter of the mortgage-backed securities market coming out of the post-pandemic era, giving its policies a hand in the run-up to the inflation U.S. consumers are feeling today.

"Buca di Beppo files for bankruptcy, plans to keep remaining 44 locations open.",https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2024-08-05/buca-di-beppo-files-for-bankruptcy,"Days after closing more than a dozen restaurants, Italian American restaurant chain Buca di Beppo has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

The company, known for serving big portions to large groups and its kitschy decor, said it intends to use the bankruptcy process to restructure its operations and keep 44 locations open, including restaurants in Pasadena, Universal City, Encino and Redondo Beach.

“This is a strategic step towards a strong future for Buca di Beppo,” Rich Saultz, the company’s president, said in a statement. “While the restaurant industry has faced significant challenges, this move is the best next step for our brand.”

William Snyder, chief restructuring officer, said the remaining restaurants were open for business and “we expect day-to-day operations to continue uninterrupted” during bankruptcy. Gift cards, reservations and promotions remain active and redeemable.

Buca di Beppo has been reducing its brick-and-mortar footprint for years, beset by many of the same issues faced by restaurant competitors: sluggish consumer spending, higher employee wages and increased food costs among them. The Orlando, Fla., company, which saw sales decrease 4.7% last year, peaked at 95 locations in 2013, according to Restaurant Business.

Last month, Buca di Beppo abruptly shut down 13 restaurants, about 20% of its portfolio, including a location in Sacramento. The privately held company, which was founded in Minneapolis in 1993, is opening one new location.

The closures in July and Monday’s filing mark the latest sign of distress for the restaurant industry.

In June, Rubio’s Coastal Grill closed 48 of its California restaurants, including 24 in the Los Angeles area. Days later, the Carlsbad, Calif., fast-casual restaurant chain filed for bankruptcy protection and said it was seeking a buyer. It continues to operate 86 restaurants in California, Arizona and Nevada.

“Like the restaurant industry overall, Rubio’s has been negatively affected over the past few years by diminishing in-store traffic attributable to work-from-home practices remaining in place, and by rising food and utility costs that, combined with significant increases to the minimum wage in California, put pressure on a number of its locations,” the company said in a statement.

And in May, Red Lobster filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after closing dozens of locations.

The seafood chain has foundered in recent years because of managerial missteps, the effects of a sale to a private equity firm a decade ago and, most recently, its inability to bounce back after pandemic lockdowns. Red Lobster said its remaining locations — about 580 in the U.S. and Canada, as well as franchise locations in a handful of other countries — would operate as usual during the bankruptcy process."

According to a news release, the company plans to restructure and “ensure a seamless transition and to position the brand for future success.”

The company said they also aim to optimize operations while enhancing dining experiences.

Buca di Beppo is known for its northern and southern Italian specialties, such as spaghetti with meatballs, fettuccini alfredo and lasagna offerings served family-style.

In recent weeks, Buca di Beppo shuttered a dozen locations, including its Livonia and Utica restaurants, the only ones in Michigan.

We thank our customers for their loyalty — it was our privilege to be the backdrop for countless gatherings and celebrations over the past two decades,"" Buca di Beppo said in an email statement to the Free Press regarding the Livonia closing.

Buca di Beppo’s remaining 44 locations will be restructured, according to the news release, and they are also in the process of opening a new location.

Rich Saultz, president of Buca di Beppo, also called the bankruptcy filing, a “strategic step towards a strong future for Buca di Beppo.

“While the restaurant industry has faced significant challenges, this move is the best next step for our brand,” Saultz said in a news release. ""By restructuring with the continued support of our lenders, we are paving the way toward a reinvigorated future.""

As for the 44 Buca di Beppo locations that are still open, the company said they “expect day-to-day operations to continue uninterrupted.”

Buca di Beppo said the restaurants will operate as usual and that all gift cards, reservations and promotional services remain active and redeemable.

How and whether metro Detroit customers will be able to redeem gift cards, remains unclear.

Emails to the company from the Free Press regarding gift cards were answered by a spokesperson, who said they had no further information.

Buca di Beppo was founded in 1993 in Minneapolis. According to its website, Buca di Beppo is a brand under Florida-based Earl Enterprises portfolio of restaurants, which includes Chicken Guy, Bravo Italian Kitchen and Planet Hollywood. The Livonia Chicken Guy, metro Detroit’s first, shuttered in June after 15 months in business.

Italian casual-dining chain Buca di Beppo filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy Monday in Texas court.

The chain, which last week closed 13 restaurants, said in a press release that it was “restructuring” its remaining 44 locations and opening one new one.

It said it hoped the bankruptcy process would allow it to improve its operations and dining experience. Restaurants will continue to operate as usual.

It reported between $10 million and $50 million in both assets and liabilities. A full declaration had not yet been filed.

“This is a strategic step towards a strong future for Buca di Beppo. While the restaurant industry has faced significant challenges, this move is the best next step for our brand,” said brand President Rich Saultz. “By restructuring with the continued support of our lenders, we are paving the way toward a reinvigorated future.”

Buca di Beppo was founded in 1993 in Minneapolis as a stereotypical “red sauce joint” decorated with framed family photos and other Italian-themed kitsch. It grew quickly and went public in 1999 but in 2005 was derailed by an SEC investigation into fraud by three executives. Its CEO, CFO and controller later pled guilty to stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from the company.

Robert Earl’s Planet Hollywood International acquired the chain in 2008 for $28.5 million; it is now owned by Earl's Earl Enterprises.

During the pandemic, many of Buca di Beppo’s outlets became hubs for delivery-only virtual brands from Virtual Dining Concepts, a sister group of Earl Enterprises that owns MrBeast Burger, Pardon My Cheesesteak and other digital concepts.

The Orlando-based chain has been closing restaurants for years since peaking at 95 locations in 2013. Systemwide sales declined 4.7% last year, according to data from Technomic.

It is one of more than a dozen restaurant chains to file for bankruptcy this year, and was the second to do so on Monday, along with World of Beer.

World of Beer said the challenging post-pandemic environment, declining sales, rising expenses and inflation have impacted its business, Restaurant Business magazine said.

The concept of World of Beer, with tavern fare and hundreds of brews on tap, began in 2007 in the Tampa neighborhood of Westchase and quickly grew. The chain was listed by the Restaurant Business magazine as one of the top 10 fastest growing chains in the U.S. 10 years ago.

The company ended last year with 42 locations, Nation’s Restaurant News reported. It currently lists 34 locations in the U.S.

"The stock market selloff is about more than weak economic data, says Yahoo Finance.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-stock-market-sell-off-is-about-more-than-weak-economic-data-140119052.html,"Stocks tanked on Monday, continuing losses from the past several trading sessions as fears about a weakening economy gripped markets.

The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped about 3.4%, while the S&P 500 fell 3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) shed about 2.6%, or more than 1,000 points in afternoon trading.

The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) was hovering near 3.78%, down roughly 50 basis points in less than two weeks. Volatility has spiked, too, The CBOE Volatility Index, known by its ticker as simply the VIX (^VIX), shot up above 60 for the first time since 2020.

The latest leg of the sell-off accelerated overnight as Japan's Nikkei 225 (^N225) dropped more than 12% in its biggest-ever daily loss after a surprise interest rate hike from the Bank of Japan. Yardeni Research president Ed Yardeni told Yahoo Finance he thinks the ""large extent"" of the sell-off in US stocks is attributable to the moves in Japan.

Yardeni explained that an unwinding of the so-called carry trade spawned from speculators borrowing in Japan at 0% interest rates and then taking that money and investing in areas of the market like the Magnificent Seven tech stocks.

""Now, with the central bank tightening while other central banks are easing, the yen suddenly had a big move to the upside and that strength really led to a lot of margin calls of these speculative positions,"" Yardeni said. ""That's all coming unglued. And I think it's a lot of margin calls, and I think it's going to happen pretty quick, and the unwind should be over by the end of the week.""

The sell-off in US stocks also came as investors also adjusted their expectations for domestic monetary policy.

A weaker-than-expected July jobs report, which revealed a widely accurate recession indicator tied to a rise in the unemployment rate had been triggered, exacerbated fears that Fed policy may be too restrictive.

Subsequently, markets have quickly shifted to price in higher chances of more rate cuts this year. As of Monday morning, markets are pricing in a roughly 95% chance of a 50-basis-point interest rate cut by the end of the Fed's September meeting, up from a less than 12% chance a week prior, per the CME FedWatch Tool.

Still, some Wall Street strategists don't think the move in markets is a clean bet on a flailing US economy.

""I don't necessarily buy the fact that the market is voting that the economy is just weakening outright overnight,"" Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon told Yahoo Finance. ""I think it takes a little bit longer for us to get a sense of that.""

Story continues

Gordon notes that since the recent market highs in July, defensive sectors like Consumer Staples and Utilities have led the market, while the largest losses have been seen in Technology.

""The sector action is telling me that it's much more about selling the high flyers and making some profits ... It's not this outright collapse in the cyclical trade.""

To Gordon, the recent market reaction to the jobs report was in sync with sentiment shown by investors following Big Tech earnings. In both cases expectations were likely too upbeat compared to the actual data.

""It's a good reminder that this is really all about expectations and not necessarily about good versus bad when it comes to data,"" Gordon said.

On Monday, Big Tech remained the main culprit of the sell-off, with Nvidia (NVDA) sliding more than 6% while Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) were all off more than 3%.

Citi US equity strategist Drew Pettit agreed with Gordon that the market action is a continuation of a recent trend where investors take profits from the ""high flying"" tech stocks that led the market rally in 2023 and most of 2024, and move into other areas of the market that are less reliant on growth.

""This is kind of what you get when markets have a really aggressive run with not a lot of volatility,"" Pettit said. ""Everyone kind of gets on very similar trades. Everyone gets pulled up at the same time.""

"The stock market selloff is about more than weak economic data, says Yahoo Finance.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-stock-market-selloff-is-about-more-than-weak-economic-data-140014625.html,"Stocks tanked on Monday, continuing losses from the past several trading sessions as fears about a weakening economy gripped markets.

The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped about 3.4%, while the S&P 500 fell 3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) shed about 2.6%, or more than 1,000 points in afternoon trading.

The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) was hovering near 3.78%, down roughly 50 basis points in less than two weeks. Volatility has spiked, too, The CBOE Volatility Index, known by its ticker as simply the VIX (^VIX), shot up above 60 for the first time since 2020.

The latest leg of the sell-off accelerated overnight as Japan's Nikkei 225 (^N225) dropped more than 12% in its biggest-ever daily loss after a surprise interest rate hike from the Bank of Japan. Yardeni Research president Ed Yardeni told Yahoo Finance he thinks the ""large extent"" of the sell-off in US stocks is attributable to the moves in Japan.

Yardeni explained that an unwinding of the so-called carry trade spawned from speculators borrowing in Japan at 0% interest rates and then taking that money and investing in areas of the market like the Magnificent Seven tech stocks.

""Now, with the central bank tightening while other central banks are easing, the yen suddenly had a big move to the upside and that strength really led to a lot of margin calls of these speculative positions,"" Yardeni said. ""That's all coming unglued. And I think it's a lot of margin calls, and I think it's going to happen pretty quick, and the unwind should be over by the end of the week.""

The sell-off in US stocks also came as investors also adjusted their expectations for domestic monetary policy.

A weaker-than-expected July jobs report, which revealed a widely accurate recession indicator tied to a rise in the unemployment rate had been triggered, exacerbated fears that Fed policy may be too restrictive.

Subsequently, markets have quickly shifted to price in higher chances of more rate cuts this year. As of Monday morning, markets are pricing in a roughly 95% chance of a 50-basis-point interest rate cut by the end of the Fed's September meeting, up from a less than 12% chance a week prior, per the CME FedWatch Tool.

Still, some Wall Street strategists don't think the move in markets is a clean bet on a flailing US economy.

""I don't necessarily buy the fact that the market is voting that the economy is just weakening outright overnight,"" Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon told Yahoo Finance. ""I think it takes a little bit longer for us to get a sense of that.""

Story continues

Gordon notes that since the recent market highs in July, defensive sectors like Consumer Staples and Utilities have led the market, while the largest losses have been seen in Technology.

""The sector action is telling me that it's much more about selling the high flyers and making some profits ... It's not this outright collapse in the cyclical trade.""

To Gordon, the recent market reaction to the jobs report was in sync with sentiment shown by investors following Big Tech earnings. In both cases expectations were likely too upbeat compared to the actual data.

""It's a good reminder that this is really all about expectations and not necessarily about good versus bad when it comes to data,"" Gordon said.

On Monday, Big Tech remained the main culprit of the sell-off, with Nvidia (NVDA) sliding more than 6% while Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) were all off more than 3%.

Citi US equity strategist Drew Pettit agreed with Gordon that the market action is a continuation of a recent trend where investors take profits from the ""high flying"" tech stocks that led the market rally in 2023 and most of 2024, and move into other areas of the market that are less reliant on growth.

""This is kind of what you get when markets have a really aggressive run with not a lot of volatility,"" Pettit said. ""Everyone kind of gets on very similar trades. Everyone gets pulled up at the same time.""

He added, ""We're just working from a place where sentiment was really strong, growth expectations were really high, and we're calling that into question right now.""

For Pettit, that fundamental story for stocks to end the year higher than their current levels hasn't changed yet, he said.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell over 1,000 points. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was crushed by more than 3.4%. The S&P 500's (^GSPC) losses cascaded nearly 3% in its worst day since 2022, capping its worst start to any month since 2002.

Wall Street's ""fear gauge"" — the CBOE Volatility Index (^VIX) — touched its highest level since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, before retreating. Treasury yields fell, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) hovering near 3.8%.

The global stock market rapidly sold off after Friday's lackluster US jobs report added to concerns about the economy and whether the Federal Reserve had waited too long to begin cutting interest rates. Of note, almost 100% of bets are on the central bank to cut rates by 0.5% by its September meeting, according to the CME FedWatch tool.

Some of the biggest companies in the stock market saw their values plummet. Apple (AAPL) declined about 5% amid the sell-off and news that Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B) had cut its stake in the company in half. Nvidia (NVDA) pulled back over 6%. Tesla (TSLA) fell more than 4%.

Crypto also took a beating, with bitcoin (BTC-USD) sinking more than 10% to creep back toward the $54,000 level.

The concerns spread throughout the world, as well. Traders in Asia greeted the week with a similar sell-off, as Japan's Nikkei 225 (^N225) was routed by more than 12% in its biggest-ever daily loss after a surprise interest rate hike from the Bank of Japan last week.

The sharp rise in the Japanese yen against the US dollar has spurred heavy selling as speculators who had borrowed money at Japan's near-0% interest rate to buy US risk assets have been liquidating their holdings.

The US market is headed into a quieter week of data and earnings. With the jobs market still in focus, weekly unemployment claims due Thursday will take a bigger spotlight than usual."

(Reuters) - Gold prices fell 1% on Monday on profit-taking, as investors looked forward to key inflation figures this week for clues on the U.S. interest rate cuts this year.

Spot gold fell 1% to $2,336.76 per ounce by 1745 GMT. It had hit its highest level since April 22 on Friday.

U.S. gold futures settled 1.3% lower at $2,343.

""This could be some people exiting the gold market prior to some of these risk events such as (Fed chief) Jerome Powell speaking, PPI and CPI all coming out this week,"" said Phillip Streible, chief market strategist at Blue Line Futures.

""Gold bulls are rightfully concerned that the Federal Reserve needs weaker inflation data, not just weaker employment figures, to justify cutting rates,"" said Tai Wong, a New York-based independent metals trader.

The yellow metal had risen more than 1% last week, following weak jobs data, supporting bets of a U.S. rate cut this year.

A stronger majority of economists polled by Reuters expect the Fed to cut its key interest rate twice this year, starting in September.

Traders are now pricing in about a 63% chance of a rate cut in September, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding gold.

Markets focus this week will be on the U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) data on Tuesday, followed by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data due on Wednesday.

Among other precious metals, spot silver gained 0.3% to $28.23 per ounce, while palladium fell 1.7% to $961.50.

Platinum rose above the key level of $1,000 per ounce to a near one-year high. It was up 0.6% at $1,000.55 per ounce.

However, consultancy Metals Focus expects average prices for platinum and palladium to fall this year compared with 2023 despite another year of structural deficit.

BHP Group, the world's largest listed miner, said Anglo American has rejected a revised buyout offer valuing the company at 34 billion pounds ($42.67 billion).

"The stock market selloff is about more than weak economic data, says Yahoo Finance.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-pulls-back-brink-174057734.html,"The global selloff that began last week intensified Monday morning, with U.S. stock futures plunging further after Japan’s Nikkei 225 had its worst day since Wall Street’s “Black Monday” in 1987. Following a 611-point loss on Friday, the Dow dropped over 1,000 points before the market opened. The S&P initially fell over 3.5%, while Big Tech stocks were among the biggest losers, causing Nasdaq futures to lose almost 5%.

The panic subsidized after the markets opened, however, and investors like Infrastructure Capital Advisors CEO Jay Hatfield remain bullish on the overall state of the U.S. economy.

In an interview with Fortune, Hatfield noted that the Nikkei had probably been overvalued due to an excessive monetary stimulus from the Bank of Japan—but that the index's dive was “basically irrelevant,” besides being the latest catalyst for hedge funds and other short-term traders to sell.

“There's always an excuse in August,” he said, “whether it's the Nikkei, a fantasy recession, Warren Buffett selling Apple—there's always some excuse.”

As earnings season winds down, Hatfield said, hedge funds are hesitant to stay long on stocks. The selloff gained momentum late last week, however, after a series of negative reports on the economy, particularly in the manufacturing sector, and was punctuated by a weaker-than-expected jobs report on Friday that reignited recession fears.

Hatfield doesn’t share those concerns. Overall job growth, he said, remained consistent with a decelerating, not crashing, economy. Mortgage rates falling to their lowest levels in over a year bode well for the housing market, he added.

“The U.S. is not in recession and not likely to be in recession,” he said, “but it’s normal for the market to go down in August.”

There were signs other investors shared Hatfield’s sentiment after the markets opened as the panic appeared to subside. The S&P was down about 2.5% midday Monday, gaining over 50 points from its open of $5,151.14 and back up around 10% year to date. The Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones were also trading above their open prices, with the former gaining about 500 points, and remain up for 2024.

Hatfield believes the $5,000 mark is a reasonable level of support for the S&P, which hasn’t fallen below that threshold since April. The now virtually guaranteed Fed rate cut in September and certainty surrounding the outcome of the U.S. presidential election come November, he said, are positive catalysts contributing to his firm’s price target of $6,000 for the S&P by the end of the year.

Story continues

But in the near term, more inflation data next week could again wobble the markets if it comes in hot, according to a recent note from Bank of America, fueling fears of a hard landing. Hatfield, though no fan of the Fed’s decision not to cut rates last week, isn’t as worried regardless of the results. He wouldn’t be surprised, however, if short-term investors again find a way to spook the markets.

After all, “selling breeds selling,” he said.

"The stock market selloff is about more than weak economic data, says Yahoo Finance.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/sell-off-opportunity-catch-babies-144140634.html,"Monday’s stock market sell-off that started last week stemmed from a disappointing July jobs report, which dampened hopes for a soft landing and increased fears of a potential recession in the US economy.

However, Oppenheimer strategists believe such a pullback can present opportunities to ""catch babies tossed out with the bathwater.”

The negative sentiment arose from an employment gain of 114,000 jobs, significantly below the consensus estimate of 175,000. This led to a decline in both bond prices and major US equity benchmarks, which are now considered to be in over-bought and over-sold conditions, respectively.

Since the end of last year, the Federal Reserve has indicated its intention to cut rates, believing it can do so without sparking inflation. However, this message has not resonated with its skeptics.

""The sell-off that took place looked to us like the actions of a mix of bears—many of whom ironically had capitulated in droves throughout the first half of this year, nervous investors, and short-term traders who found catalyst as well in the reaction to the jobs number to take some profits without FOMO (fear of missing out),” Oppenheimer noted.

Several top-performing stocks this year bore the brunt of the selling pressure. The downturn also appeared to be a renewed attempt by Fed critics, particularly those favoring high leverage, to push the Fed towards a policy pivot, similar to previous successful efforts in Q4 2018 and Q1 2022.

Given the historical volatility of monthly jobs numbers, with frequent revisions, it is advisable not to jump to early conclusions, Oppenheimer noted.

Many market participants pointed out that factors such as the recent hurricane in Houston, the early release of the jobs report, and issues with data collection likely contributed to the messy data for July. Future revisions are expected to provide greater clarity, strategists said.

Looking ahead, market expectations for a Fed rate cut in September remain high, as reflected in the futures market. According to Oppenheimer, this expectation could add to volatility leading up to the September FOMC meeting.

With the Fed funds rate currently at 5.25–5.50%, policymakers have sufficient room to manage the ongoing economic transition despite criticisms.

Periods of transition, like the current one, can benefit various market participants, including short-term traders, options players, short sellers, and other segments focused on quick returns, strategists pointed out.

However, such volatility also creates unexpected opportunities for intermediate- and long-term investors. Those with a disciplined approach to dollar cost averaging and a commitment to diversification may find value in the ""babies that get tossed out with the bathwater.""

Tokyo stocks bounced back in early trade Tuesday following a historic selloff on worries over the US economy and a stronger yen.

The benchmark Nikkei 225 index jumped 8.41 percent, or 2,646.36 points, to 34,104.78, while the Topix added 8.75 percent, or 194.84 points, to 2,421.99.

The yen weakened sharply to 146.01 against the dollar, having surged on Monday to 141.70, a level not seen since early January.

A stronger yen is a negative factor for Japanese exporters, and the recent rally has been fuelled by central bank policy decisions that have reversed the trends of recent years.

The Bank of Japan last week raised interest rates for the second time in 17 years, with talk of another rate hike to come, while the US Federal Reserve has hinted at a cut as soon as September.

Among major shares in Tokyo on Tuesday, Honda roared 14.90 percent to 1,438 yen following a report that it was expected to announce a record quarterly profit.

Toyota jumped 10.51 percent to 2,466.5 yen. Sony Group advanced 7.44 percent to 12,125 yen. Nintendo added 9.87 percent to 7,259 yen.

(Reuters) -Charles Schwab and Fidelity Investments have resolved technical issues with their apps, the online brokerages said on Monday, on a day users rushed to trade as markets slumped on rising fears of a U.S. recession.

Some customers struggled to log in to their accounts, the companies had said earlier in the day, without elaborating.

Wall Street's main indexes plunged at the open as weak economic data, drab quarterly earnings from technology behemoths and geopolitical tensions dampened hopes of a soft landing before recouping some of the losses.

The Cboe volatility index, Wall Street's fear gauge, was at a two-year high after hitting its highest since March 2020 earlier in the session.

""What's scaring people more than the fact that the market is selling off is that Fidelity's and Schwab's trading platforms crashed today,"" said Jason Britton, president and chief investment officer at Reflection Asset Management.

""Those are the things that cause real panic - when people can't see what their portfolios are doing.""

Bouts of extreme market volatility can sometimes trigger technical problems, which also raise questions about the capacity of brokerages to handle high volumes.

Such glitches have often drawn the ire of retail investors, who may be looking to ""buy the dip"" or unwind their positions.

Several users took to social media platform X on Monday to complain of the disruption, with some promising to seek alternatives.

SEC SCRUTINIZING

The Securities and Exchange Commission was tracking the developments, a spokesperson for the regulator told Reuters.

""We are actively monitoring for the orderly functioning of markets,"" the spokesperson said.

At peak, Schwab was down for nearly 14,500 users while more than 3,600 users reported problems with Fidelity, according to outage tracking website Downdetector.com.

Downdetector tracks outages by collating status reports from several sources including users.

Earlier in the day, Robinhood Markets, the platform of choice for several retail investors, said it had resumed overnight trading after a pause. Vanguard, another popular brokerage, also reported disruption of services.

Rival Interactive Brokers had seen no system-wide outage, said Steve Sanders, its executive vice president of marketing and product development.

""As of 11 a.m. ET, we have executed 5 million trades, and on Friday, we had 5.9 million trades, which was already a busy day,"" Sanders said.

LONDON (Reuters) - A meltdown in world equity markets in recent days is more reflective of a wind-down of carry trades used by investors to juice their bets than a hard and fast shift in the U.S. economic outlook, analysts say.

While Friday's weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs data was the catalyst for the market sell-off, with Japan's blue-chip Nikkei index on Monday suffering its biggest one-day rout since the 1987 Black Monday selloff, the employment report alone wasn't weak enough to be the main driver of such violent moves, they added.

Instead, the answer likely lies in a further sharp position unwind of carry trades, where investors have borrowed money from economies with low interest rates such as Japan or Switzerland, to fund investments in higher-yielding assets elsewhere.

They have been caught out as the Japanese yen has rallied by more than 11% against the dollar from 38-year lows hit just a month ago.

""In our assessment a lot of this (market sell-off) has been down to position capitulation as a number of macro funds have been caught the wrong way around on a trade, and stops have been triggered, initially starting with FX and the Japanese yen,"" said Mark Dowding, chief investment officer at BlueBay Asset Management, referring to pre-determined levels that trigger buying or selling.

""We don't see evidence in data that's saying we're looking at a hard landing,"" he added.

One Asian-based investor, who asked not to be identified, said that some of the biggest systematic hedge funds that trade in and out of stocks based on signals from algorithms, started selling equities when last week's surprise Bank of Japan rate hike sparked expectations for further tightening.

While exact numbers and the specific positioning shifts underlying the moves are hard to come by, analysts suspected that crowded positions in U.S. tech stocks, funded by carry trades, explain why they are suffering the most.

Story continues

By 1423 GMT on Monday, the tech-heavy U.S. Nasdaq stock index was down over 8% so far in August, versus 6% for the broader S&P index.

Carry trades, boosted by years of ultra-easy Japanese monetary policy, prompted a boom in cross-border yen borrowing to fund trades elsewhere, ING said.

Bank for International Settlements data suggests cross-border yen borrowing has increased by $742 billion since the end of 2021, the bank noted.

""It's a yen-funded carry unwind and Japanese stock unwind,"" said Tim Graf, head of macro strategy for Europe at State Street Global Markets. ""Our positioning metrics show investors overweight Japanese stocks. They were underweight yen. They're no longer underweight yen.""

Speculators have cut bearish bets against the yen aggressively in recent weeks, bringing the net short position in the yen to $6.01 billion, its smallest since January, down from April's seven-year high of $14.526 billion, most recent weekly data from the U.S. markets regulator shows.

""You can't unwind the biggest carry trade the world has ever seen without breaking a few heads,"" said Societe Generale's chief currency strategist Kit Juckes.

HEDGE FUND PAIN

As hedge funds typically fund their bets through borrowing, their adjustments are exacerbating market moves, some investors said.

Banks give hedge funds leverage, essentially a loan to fund investing, which amplifies hedge fund returns but can also increase losses.

A note sent by Goldman Sachs to clients on Friday showed that gross leverage from Goldman Sachs prime brokerage, or the total amount that hedge funds have borrowed, declined in June and July, but still sits near five-year highs.

Last week marked the third consecutive week that hedge funds' bets that stocks will fall outpaced the addition of bets that they will rise, Goldman said in a separate note, saying one long position was added for every 3.3 short bets.

It added on Monday that as of the Asian close, Japan-focused hedge funds were down 7.6% in the past three trading sessions.

While macro funds may have been involved in currency trades relating to the yen, many stock-trading hedge funds, because of a June short selling ban in South Korea and regulatory headwinds against the same practice in China, had moved focus to Japan, investors said.

Analysts added there was room for further short-term pain as positions are unwound, but the market shake-up would be limited.

Traders now expect over 120 basis points of U.S. rate cuts by the end of the year, versus around 50 bps at the start of last week, and fully price in a hefty 50 bps September rate cut.

Such expectations may be overdone if upcoming data suggests the U.S. economy is likely to avoid a hard landing.

""We think it's really wrong to start fundamentally reassessing your view on the outlook here. Doing so is simply fitting a narrative to match the price action,"" said BlueBay's Dowding.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian shares snapped a weeks-long winning streak on Friday, dragged by information technology and auto stocks, after weaker-than-expected U.S. data triggered a global sell-off.

The NSE Nifty 50 fell 1.17% to 24,717.7 points, while the S&P BSE Sensex shed 1.08% to 80,981.95, logging losses for the first time in six sessions.

Weak economic data from the U.S. has hurt sentiment, leading to increased nervousness and uncertainty among investors and a drop across equity markets globally, said Pravesh Gour, senior analyst at Swastika Investmart.

The benchmark Nifty 50 also eased from overbought zone after five sessions on Friday.

On the day, twelve of the 13 major sectors logged losses.

IT companies, which earn a significant share of their revenue from the U.S., lost 2.41%.

The auto index fell 2.92%, after multiple brokerages flagged weakness in the passenger vehicle and the medium-heavy commercial vehicle segments.

Eicher Motors, Tata Motors and Maruti Suzuki slid between 4.1% and 5% and were among the top five Nifty 50 losers.

"The stock market selloff is about more than weak economic data, says Yahoo Finance.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-falls-5-69-58-160752347.html,"(Reuters) - U.S.-listed shares of crypto-linked companies slumped as bitcoin fell more than 15% on Monday, after weak economic data last week triggered fears of a recession and set off a frenzied selling of risky assets.

The plunge marks a stunning reversal for the sector that until recently was riding a wave of optimism sparked by the approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to the spot prices of bitcoin and ether, the two biggest cryptocurrencies.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's pro-crypto speech at a bitcoin conference last month also bolstered sentiment, but data showing higher unemployment and weak manufacturing activity squeezed risky assets.

""We are not surprised by Bitcoin's snap reaction as the only weekend traded market. We don't see any incremental negatives for crypto here,"" Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani wrote in a note.

""The bitcoin and crypto market will likely trade off macro and election cues for most of (the third quarter).""

Crypto miners CleanSpark, Bitfarms, Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital slumped between 12% and 25% in early trade.

Coinbase shares lost 18%, while bitcoin buyer MicroStrategy slipped nearly 23%.

Bitcoin tumbled to its lowest in nearly six months while ether plunged 19%, trading at levels not seen since January.

BITCOIN OVER ETFs

The increasing correlation with equities has undermined bitcoin's reputation as a safe-haven asset, but some analysts said investing directly was still better than getting exposure to the currency via proxies like ETFs and crypto-related stocks.

""If this weekend serves as a reminder of anything, it is the importance of investing in digital assets directly on native crypto exchanges,"" said Joshua Peck, founder of crypto hedge fund TrueCode Capital.

""While others were stuck waiting for the futures market to open on Sunday night... we were calmly executing our strategy without interruption,"" he added.

Still, others advocated caution.

""It's a big reminder that bitcoin and crypto in general are risk assets and sit at the pointy end of the risk spectrum,"" said Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG.

"The stock market selloff is about more than weak economic data, says Yahoo Finance.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/analyst-broadcom-inc-nasdaq-avgo-135634259.html,"We recently published a list of Top 10 Latest AI Stock News and Analyst Ratings. Since Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) ranks 7th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.

The much-feared correction in mega-cap tech stocks is here as investors keep pulling out of AI winners to pile into small-cap stocks as possible rate cuts from the Federal Reserve near. Brent Thill, Jefferies tech research analyst, recently said while talking to CNBC that we are seeing a rotation inside the tech industry where semiconductor and internet companies are performing well while software companies are underperforming. However, Thill reiterated his view that in the back half of the year things will start to change and tech companies will start their rebound. The analyst cited a few software earnings that suggest no signs of “demand cracks.” He said that many semiconductor stocks are now in the overbought territory.

Brent Thill said the selloff has made software stocks more “attractive.”

But Thill also sees a broader rotation ongoing in the stock market, where sectors like financials and industrials are benefitting amid investor exodus from tech.

Asked what is causing a sudden rebound in small-cap stocks, Thill said that interest rate cut expectations and a broader rotation out of mega-cap stocks have a role to play here, in addition to the M&A activity which has increased significantly recently.

Thill thinks the AI “payoff” time is still years away and companies are still at the beginning of the AI spending curve.

Is Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) Among the Top 10 Latest AI Stock News and Analyst Ratings?

Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 115

TD Cowen in a fresh note named Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) as one of the stocks that can benefit from the rise in AI spending. Analysts at the firm said there are “no signs” of generative AI demand abating and highlighted that Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) recently raised its full-year AI outlook. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) expects AI-related revenue for 2024 at $11 billion.

Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) recently reported second-quarter results. Revenue in the quarter rose about 43% year over year. AI revenue in the period rose a whopping 280% year over year. Broadcom’s revenue stream is diverse and does not rely on a single source. It includes enterprise, networking, storage, data center/hyperscaler, industrial, and consumer space. For 2024 AVGO has increased its annual revenue guidance to over $51 billion, anticipating growth of over 40%. A significant portion of this growth is expected to come from software, which would also help margins.

The company’s Ethernet business is also strong amid partnerships with Arista Networks (ANET), while the company is also collaborating with Dell (DELL), Juniper (JNPR), and Super Micro (SMCI) in the networking business and other segments. Broadcom has also developed ASIC AI chips in partnership with Google and Meta Platforms.

Based on this strong growth and upcoming catalysts, AVGO’s forward P/E of about 25 makes the stock look undervalued.

Aristotle Atlantic Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:

“Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a global technology leader that designs, develops and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. The company strategically focuses its research and development resources to address niche opportunities in target markets and leverage its extensive portfolio of U.S. and other patents and other intellectual property to integrate multiple technologies and create system-on-chip component and software solutions that target growth opportunities. Broadcom designs products and software that deliver high performance and provide mission-critical functionality. The company has a history of innovation in the semiconductor industry and offers thousands of products that are used in end products such as enterprise and data center networking, home connectivity, “set-top boxes broadband access”, telecommunication equipment, smartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. Broadcom differentiates itself through its high-performance design and integration capabilities and focuses on developing products for target markets where it believes it can earn attractive margins. We view Broadcom’s semiconductor business as being very well positioned to benefit from secular growth in data center networking, which is being driven by AI and cloud computing. The company continues to invest in research and development, and we see this as a competitive advantage for the company. Broadcom’s infrastructure software business is a recurring revenue business model that provides mission-critical mainframe support software to its customer base. The recent VMware acquisition will enhance this business strategy and accelerate the growth rate of this business unit, as VMware’s product suite includes key tools for AI server upgrades. Our long-term investment thesis is supported by Broadcom’s success in its strategy of maintaining technology and market share leadership in mission-critical markets with high switching costs and deep profit pools.”

Overall, Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) ranks 7th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Latest AI Stock News and Analyst Ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

"The stock market selloff is about more than weak economic data, says Yahoo Finance.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/asian-markets-battle-recover-tech-030956734.html,"The latest inflation data reinforced expectations the Fed will cut interest rates in September (Brendan SMIALOWSKI)

Major stock markets pushed higher Friday as traders welcomed data showing a moderation in US inflation, firming expectations the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates in September.

Wall Street's three main indices rose solidly at the end of a volatile week during which tech stocks and other sectors were rocked by disappointing earnings.

The Fed's preferred measure of US inflation -- the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index -- fell to 2.5 percent on an annual basis in June, from 2.6 percent in May.

""This provides clear support for the Fed to start cutting interest rates in September,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist for Nationwide, adding that the move could lead to ""a desired soft-landing for the economy, though risks of a harder landing remain.""

The core PCE price index that excludes volatile food and energy prices held steady at 2.6 percent.

The Fed has signaled that it wants to see inflation trending lower to its 2.0 percent target before cutting interest rates.

""To get a rate cut, investors and the Fed only needed to avoid a disastrously high PCE result today,"" said Bret Kenwell, US investment analyst at eToro online brokerage.

Attention will shift to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments after the central bank's meeting next week, ""with the hope and expectation that he will set the stage for a rate cut in September,"" he added.

Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare noted the market was now fully pricing in a 0.25-percentage-point cut in the Fed's policy rate.

The inflation data followed figures Thursday that showed the US economy expanded far more than expected in the second quarter, providing a much-needed boost to sentiment and easing concerns that it was slowing a little too much for comfort.

The improvement was largely consumer-led, even while US interest rates remain at two-decade highs and inflation is elevated.

European indices closed higher, while most leading Asian indices registered gains.

The Taipei stock market plunged more than three percent as traders returned from their imposed typhoon break, with chipmakers leading the losses.

Market titan TSMC dove more than five percent, while ASE Technology plunged almost 10 percent.

On the US exchanges, 3M shot up 23 percent after reporting better-than-expected earnings and lifting its full-year profit forecast. Analysts see the industrial heavyweight as well positioned following progress on major litigation issues that have dogged the company.

But Biogen dove 7.2 percent after announcing European officials gave a negative reading on a new Alzheimer's disease treatment. Biogen and partner Eisai said they would seek a reexamination of the decision.

"The stock market selloff is about more than weak economic data, says Yahoo Finance.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/rupee-hover-near-record-low-025753465.html,"By Jaspreet Kalra

MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Indian rupee slipped to a record low on Friday, as local stocks declined tracking a global equity sell-off caused by concerns of a slowdown in the United States and rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.

The rupee closed down 0.04% at 83.75 against the U.S. dollar on Friday, its weakest closing level, after hitting an all-time low of 83.7525 earlier in the session. The currency was nearly flat week-on-week.

The Reserve Bank of India likely sold dollars via state-run banks to prevent a sharper decline, traders said, as the rupee was pressured by likely outflows from local equities.

India's equity benchmarks, the BSE Sensex and Nifty 50, ended the day down more than 1% each. [.BO]

Investor sentiment soured after weaker-than-expected U.S. factory data prompted growth concerns while tensions about a widening conflict in the Middle East weighed.

Futures indicated that the S&P 500 would open more than 1% lower after declining in the previous session. [.N]

The rupee is expected to continue depreciating gradually and trade in a 83.57-83.77 range with RBI interventions limiting volatility, said Dilip Parmar, a foreign exchange research analyst at HDFC Securities.

The dollar index was down over 0.2% at 104.1 while most Asian currencies gained between 0.1% to 1.6%.

The rupee has weakened about 0.7% since the surprise outcome of India's elections on June 4, even though equity and debt markets have drawn more than $10 billion in inflows on expectations of economic growth and lower fiscal deficit.

It has slipped to record lows in seven of the last 10 sessions, including Friday.

The RBI has chosen to buy dollars from the market to prevent an appreciation in the rupee, which traders believe is to correct an overvaluation of the currency's real effective exchange rate.

The central bank ""may want to avoid a loss of competitiveness by buying USD to prevent undue strength in the INR, especially as India attempts to move its economy up the value chain"", Barclays Bank said in a note.

The country's foreign exchange reserves rose by $15 billion to a record high of $670.8 billion between the weeks ending June 7 and July 19.

Seatrium has won a contract from repeat customer SBM Offshore for the topside fabrication and integration of an offshore rig. The contract value is not disclosed.

The news came a day after Seatrium, together with four other counters is to be removed from the MSCI Singapore Index, causing its share price to drop by more than 10%.

Passive fund managers tend to construct their portfolios based on components of market indices.

The rig, FPSO Jaguar, as this rig is called, is designed to produce 250,000 barrels of oil per day.

Work is expected to commence in the third quarter of this year and when completed it will deployed to serve in the Whiptail Field, off Guyana, dubbed the world's fastest-growing oil region since reserves were discovered back in 2015.

To date, Seatrium is involved in three other offshore rigs in Guyana. Seatrium says it is also on track to deliver its fourth Guyanese offshore rig to SBM.

"The stock market selloff is about more than weak economic data, says Yahoo Finance.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/yahoo-lay-off-journalists-social-005629505.html,"EXCLUSIVE: Yahoo is letting go of its editorial and social media teams in Singapore.

Yahoo is letting go of its editorial and social media teams in Singapore. In total, 17 staff will leave the digital news publication after May 7, The Edge Singapore understands.

One affected employee had worked at Yahoo for more than 15 years. Affected staff will receive slightly more than two weeks’ pay per year of service, according to a source who has requested to remain anonymous as the matter is private.

The Edge Singapore understands that affected staff had met with a representative from human resources on April 23. Simon Wheeler, Yahoo’s senior director of content, Australia and Southeast Asia, was also present at the meetings.

Affected staff were told that Yahoo is changing its editorial strategy and will no longer create any original content from Singapore. Instead, Yahoo is hiring three “curation editors” and a market lead for Yahoo News Singapore under its new strategy, which will focus on syndicated content.

Newsrooms contributing syndicated content to Yahoo include HuffPost, AFP News, Reuters, EdgeProp and The Edge Singapore, among others.

Affected staff were told that they can apply for the new roles, which are remote, according to Yahoo’s job listings on LinkedIn.

One affected employee said there was no mention that the company is looking to cut costs, or why the company had decided on this editorial strategy.

The Edge Singapore understands that Yahoo holds “open houses” monthly, where leaders share business updates. No financial figures were shared at the last town hall on April 19. There was no indication then that the company would be enacting a fresh round of layoffs in Singapore, says an affected employee.

“We didn’t expect these [layoffs] and it happened at a weird time in April. For us, everything has been business as usual and we didn’t hear any news of a possible retrenchment. We did hear of a retrenchment round in Yahoo US a couple of months ago and did think that some markets that did not do well may face the same consequences,” says one affected employee.

Meanwhile, The Edge Singapore understands that Yahoo’s sales team in Singapore is not affected by this round of retrenchment. While the team has stopped selling advertorial content, it is also not focused on selling branded content.

Affected staff are on two weeks’ notice until their last day of employment on May 7.

According to Singapore’s main labour legislation — the Employment Act — minimum notice periods for retrenched employees range from one day for those who had been working for the employer for less than 26 weeks to four weeks for those who had served at least five years.

Story continues

The Edge Singapore has reached out to Yahoo for comment.

In 2022, Yahoo laid off seven journalists based in Singapore. Among them was former senior editor Nicholas Yong, who had joined Yahoo in 2014.

Prior to that, Yahoo’s last reported retrenchment exercise here was in 2016. Among those affected then was Yahoo Singapore’s former editor-in-chief, the late Marc Lourdes.

Global layoffs

Yahoo was a search engine pioneer that was the default web portal for many before Google exerted its dominance. Yahoo changed hands several times. It was previously owned by US telco Verizon, who took it private in 2017, and sold for US$5 billion in 2021 to private equity firm Apollo Global.

In February 2023, Yahoo’s global headquarters in the US announced that it will eliminate about 1,600 jobs — or 20% of its total workforce then — as part of its efforts to restructure its advertising tech division and phase out its supply-side platform (SSP), which sold ad space on websites and apps.

Yahoo chief executive officer Jim Lanzone said the company’s job cuts were due more to the division’s restructuring than troubles in the ad market. Lanzone said the sunsetting of the unprofitable SSP business will be “tremendously beneficial for the profitability of Yahoo overall”.

The company aimed to halve the workforce of its ad-tech division, previously called Yahoo For Business, by the end of 2023. Yahoo’s restructuring led to a new division called Yahoo Advertising, which focused ad sales teams on the company’s properties, including Yahoo Finance, Yahoo News and Yahoo Sports.

Lanzone told US news site Axios in June 2023 that Yahoo could one day IPO again.

(Reuters) - Gold prices rose on Wednesday as the dollar slipped, with investors' focus shifting to U.S. economic data due this week for more signals on the timing of the central bank's interest rate cuts.

Spot gold was up about 0.8% at $2,427.46 per ounce, as of 1528 GMT. U.S. gold futures gained about 0.9% to $2,427.60.

""A weaker U.S. dollar index, lower U.S. stock index prices, and higher crude oil prices,"" are supporting buying interest for both gold and silver, said Jim Wyckoff, senior market analyst at Kitco Metals.

Investors are looking forward to a U.S. report on gross domestic product for the second quarter on Thursday and personal consumption expenditures data for June on Friday for clues on the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut path.

""The main thing helping gold right now is market expectations that the Fed may actually decide to cut earlier than September,"" said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at EverBank.

""Also, India cutting the import taxes on gold and silver also helps as that's going to increase demand,"" Gaffney added.

India cut import duties on gold and silver to 6% from 15%.

Markets are anticipating a 100% chance of a rate cut by the central bank in September, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.

Lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding gold.

Investors are also watching developments in the U.S. election campaign, as Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to be the Democratic Party's candidate to face Republican Donald Trump.

"The stock market selloff is about more than weak economic data, says Yahoo Finance.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/ocbc-not-business-providing-liquidity-220151830.html,"“We have no direct interest in stimulating Great Eastern liquidity or share price.”

OCBC O39 is not just a bank but a financial conglomerate. The bank’s chairman Andrew Lee took pains to reiterate this point, repeating this refrain no less than nine times at OCBC’s annual general meeting on April 30.

The conglomerate comprises two banking licences, an asset management company and 88.4% ownership of insurer Great Eastern Holdings G07 (GEH), said Lee to some 1,400 OCBC shareholders.

However, not everyone is convinced. At DBS Group Holdings’ D05 1QFY2024 results briefing on May 2, DBS CEO Piyush Gupta said there are challenges to being a conglomerate, such as taking on a lot of assets.

“On the whole, [the] focus on banking business for us has proven to be beneficial. Manufacturing insurance takes a very different skill set,” said Gupta. DBS and fellow bank United Overseas Bank U11 (UOB) divested their respective life insurance arms years ago.

There is “no obvious synergy” between banking and insurance, according to Gupta. “Doing your own manufacturing and distributing it, [we] still have to run two separate companies. We’ve found that just being [a] distributor as opposed to [a] manufacturer has proven to be very good for us.”

The two are completely different businesses, said Gupta. “I can go into the jam-making business and say it’s a great business as well. We go into businesses based on core competencies and to bring value to shareholders. Focusing on banking and [insurance] distribution is a better use of capital and management capabilities.”

Up or down from 88.4%?

As expected, OCBC’s plans for the separately-listed GEH was again a point of contention at its AGM. Similar questions had been raised at OCBC’s AGM last year and at GEH’s own AGM on April 25. Some disgruntled shareholders had raised their voices at GEH’s board, calling the insurer’s share price a “disaster”.

At OCBC’s AGM, however, shareholders pressed Lee for clarity about OCBC’s plans — whether to distribute some of its shares in GEH in-specie to OCBC shareholders, or to add to its holdings and eventually take GEH private.

Helen Wong, group CEO of OCBC, agreed with a shareholder that there is value in distributing dividends whether in cash or in-specie, but questioned the decisions behind such a move.

“Whatever we distribute, we have to attach a decision… If we choose to distribute GEH shares, is that of value to our shareholders? Of course. But likewise, if we distribute in cash, if we distribute in our own shares, it’s also of value to the shareholders.”

Story continues

OCBC will make the best decision given its capital position, said Wong. “Do we believe we have excess capital? What are we holding that will give us the best value going forward, so that any distribution of dividend is of value, and is of sustainable value? I think that is another thing that we have to look at.”

Following Wong’s comments, Lee likened OCBC to a “thriving” restaurant. “Does it make sense to downsize our kitchen when we see good potential in the business?”

One shareholder retorted: “I agree with you that it does not make sense to downsize, but I think it makes sense to upsize and take the whole Great Eastern private.”

Lee answered: “We have already answered the question last year; it is on public record. Anything that is good strategically for the group, we will consider.”

Last year, Lee had said OCBC is “always open to possibilities”. “If there are Great Eastern shares available for sale, talk to us; we may be interested. This is just one strategic possibility the bank has with regards to Great Eastern.”

OCBC made good on its word in June 2023, when it bought 2.3 million GEH shares for nearly $40 million, taking its stake up from 87.9% to its current 88.4%.

Another shareholder echoed the call for OCBC to take GEH private. “Since OCBC said last year [that] anybody who is willing to sell GEH shares can approach OCBC; hypothetically, if somebody has 1.6% and is willing to sell to OCBC, is OCBC open to this idea?”

Lee called his bluff. “If there are shares for sale, assuming you have [them], please approach our CFO. Please stand up to get recognised again.”

‘Big brother of GEH’

For some time now, GEH top management have been remunerated with OCBC shares. If OCBC is not keen to distribute GEH shares to its shareholders, would the board consider distributing GEH shares to GEH’s directors?

The same shareholder — who claims to also hold GEH shares — asked if GEH’s “big brother”, OCBC, would consider offering GEH shares to its executives instead. According to him, GEH’s chairman Soon Tit Koon had dismissed his question at the GEH AGM, saying it should be answered by OCBC’s board instead.

Lee replied: “As I have said, this is the decision solely of the Great Eastern board; there's nothing to stop the Great Eastern board if they want to go out to the market to purchase Great Eastern shares… OCBC is agnostic as to how they reward their executives or their directors with whatever shares they want to award.”

According to GEH, the low liquidity of the stock makes share purchases difficult, a comment the shareholder relayed to Lee. “As I've said earlier, since 2006, the free float of Great Eastern is lesser than 20%. OCBC is not in the business of providing liquidity for another company. We have our own strategic agendas… We have no direct interest in stimulating Great Eastern liquidity or share price.”

Great Eastern is a strategic pillar, said Lee, repeating his comments from last year’s AGM. Then, Lee had pledged to align the interests of the shareholders of OCBC with that of GEH.

Since then, GEH has refreshed some board seats, appointing five new directors, Lee noted. GEH’s dividend has also been raised to 46%, up from an average of 34% over the past 10 years.

OCBC is “not hoarders of capital”, said Lee, despite the bank’s common equity tier-1 (CET-1) ratio standing at 15.9% for FY2023, above DBS’s 14.6% and UOB’s 13.4%. As of 1QFY2024, DBS’s CET-1 has edged higher to 14.7%.

“To put it in a militaristic term, our gun is fully loaded; we have all the bullets,” said Lee. “We will use them where it makes sense to us strategically and for the right price.”

OCBC will report its 1QFY2024 results on May 10 before trading opens.

"The stock market selloff is about more than weak economic data, says Yahoo Finance.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/japanese-stocks-tumble-leading-equities-002002329.html,"(Bloomberg) -- A renewed bout of volatility hit global markets as recent talk about a US economic recession — mostly seen as premature — spurred warnings that this year’s sizzling stock rally has gone too far.

Most Read from Bloomberg

From New York to London and Tokyo, equities got pummeled. Just as markets started celebrating signals from the Federal Reserve about a first rate cut, they were hit by a perfect storm — weak economic data, underwhelming corporate earnings, stretched positioning and poor seasonal trends. While the S&P 500 pared some of its losses, it suffered the biggest plunge in about two years amid strong trading volume. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 saw its worst start to a month since 2008. Wall Street’s “fear gauge” - the VIX - at one point registered its largest spike in data going back to 1990.

Treasuries lost some steam after a surge that briefly drove two-year yields — which are sensitive to monetary policy — below those on 10-year bonds. Traders are betting the economy is on the verge of deteriorating so quickly the Fed would need to start easing policy aggressively. The repricing was so sharp that the swap market earlier assigned a 60% chance of an emergency rate reduction by the Fed over the coming week. Those odds subsequently ebbed.

“The economy is not in crisis, at least not yet,” said Callie Cox at Ritholtz Wealth Management. “But it’s fair to say we’re in the danger zone. The Fed is in danger of losing the plot here if they don’t better acknowledge cracks in the job market. Nothing is broken yet, but it’s breaking and the Fed risks slipping behind the curve.”

At LPL Financial, Quincy Krosby said that after such a strong rally, valuations, sentiment and positioning had become stretched.

“What markets are experiencing is an unwinding of that bullish positioning,” she said. “Watch for signs of a capitulating Fed, timely evidence of a growing economy, and a successful test of the 200-day moving average on the S&P 500 for signs a bottom may be in.”

The S&P 500 lost 3%, extending a tumble from its peak to 8.5%. US 10-year yields were little changed at 3.78%. The dollar fell. A gauge of perceived risk in the US corporate credit markets soared, with the turmoil effectively shutting down bond sales on what had been expected to be among the busiest days of the year. Bitcoin sank about 10%.

The wave of selling hit a fever pitch in Japan as traders rushed to unwind popular carry trades, powering a 2% jump in the yen and causing the Topix stock index to shed 12% and close the day with the biggest three-day drop in data stretching back to 1959. The rout wiped out $15 billion of SoftBank Group Corp.’s value on Monday.

“The market is a tug of war between fear and greed,” said Nancy Tengler at Laffer Tengler Investments. “In my 40+ years as a professional investor, it has always paid to buy when others are fearful. Volatility is the friend of long-term investors.”

The US stock plunge is vindicating some prominent bears, who are doubling down with warnings about risks from an economic slowdown. JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Mislav Matejka said equities are set to stay under pressure from weaker business activity, a drop in bond yields and a deteriorating earnings outlook. Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson warned of “unfavorable” risk-reward.

“This doesn’t look like a ‘recovery’ backdrop that was hoped for,” Matejka wrote. “We stay cautious on equities, expecting the phase of ‘bad is bad’ to arrive,” he added.

Market veteran Ed Yardeni said that the current equity selloff bears some similarity to the 1987 crash, when the economy averted a downturn despite investor fears at the time.

“This is very reminiscent, so far, of 1987,” Yardeni said on Bloomberg Television. “We had a crash in the stock market — that basically all occurred in one day — and the implication was that we were in, or about to fall into, recession. And that didn’t happen at all. It had really more to do with the internals of the market.”

To Seema Shah at Principal Asset Management, economic weakness concerns will likely prove overdone, but the depth of the negative narrative now implies that an imminent market turnaround is unlikely. A sustained market recovery needs a catalyst, or likely a combination of catalysts, including stabilization of the Japanese yen, strong earnings numbers, and solid data releases.

“It’s complicated — return of the ‘R’ word derailing the Goldilocks trade,” said Maxwell Grinacoff at UBS Investment Bank. “Similar to what we witnessed amidst the small-cap rotation a few weeks ago, the degree of moves was clearly exacerbated by stretched positioning. The difference today is there is fundamental backing to elevated levels of risk premia, from both a macro and earnings perspective.”

After a very strong first half, the market had become extended on a short-term basis and the bar for positive surprises too high — and a little bit of bad news has gone a long way, according to Keith Lerner at Truist Advisory Services.

“From a stock market perspective, our base case has not changed,” Lerner said. “Our work still suggests the bull market deserves the benefit of the doubt. However, we have been expecting a choppier environment into the back half of July and August given the sharp rebound from April, stretched sentiment, and the fact that we’re entering a seasonally weaker period of the calendar year.”

Moreover, after strong first halves, historically we have seen a typical pullback of 9% at some point, even while markets still tended to end higher by the end of the year.

Notably, over the past 40 years, the S&P 500 has averaged a maximum intra-year pullback of 14%. Despite this, stocks have still shown an average return (not compounded) of 13% and risen in 33 out of 40 of those years, or 83% of the time, Lerner said.

“While always uncomfortable and typically accompanied by bad news, pullbacks are the admission price to the stock market,” Lerner said. “This is what provides the potential for higher longer-term returns relative to most other asset classes.”

Investors should rationally consider the current landscape, according to Russell Price at Ameriprise. Are markets correcting because they may have seen equity market gains come too far too fast? Or are markets falling because of true threats over economic conditions and the possibility of a global recession?

“We believe, the preponderance of evidence supports the former,” Price says. “The US economy is currently moderating to more sustainable rates, but a near-term recession is not the most likely path ahead, in our view. Even if it were, we believe central banks have ample fire power to lower rates to restimulate activity, if necessary, which should once again entice capital toward stocks.”

When investors turned their calendars to August, they may have flipped the narrative on the economy at the same time, according to John Lynch at Comerica Wealth Management.

“It’s been less than two weeks since the second quarter GDP report surprised to the upside, with equity markets hovering near record levels, yet there is growing sentiment is that the Fed has waited too long to cut interest rates and is now behind the curve,” Lynch said. “While we’re not completely sold on the new narrative, the one thing that seems certain is that there is more volatility ahead.”

Investors should hedge their risk exposure even if they own high quality assets as US stocks extend losses, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s Tony Pasquariello.

“There are times to go for the gas, and there are times to go for the brake — I’m inclined to ratchet down exposures and roll strikes,” Pasquariello wrote. He added that it’s difficult to think that August will be one of those months where investors should carry a significant portfolio risk.

Systematic funds have offloaded more than $130 billion of global stock bets in recent weeks. Now these rules-based players threaten to take their selling to a whole new level as volatility spikes.

Strategies including risk parity, vol-targeting and trend following will dispose $70 billion to $80 billion of shares Monday, with at least $90 billion more to unwind over the next four sessions, according to estimates from Morgan Stanley’s trading team.

To Michael Gapen at Bank of America Corp., markets are getting ahead of the Fed again.

“Incoming data have raised concerns that the US economy has hit an ‘air pocket.’ A rate cut in September is now a virtual lock, but we do not think the economy needs aggressive, recession-sized cuts.”

Equity markets experienced one of the most severe rotations in years in July, with small cap and value stocks surging and mega cap tech stocks selling off. A key question for investors is whether this move continues or fades out similar to previous rotations, according to Jeff Schulze at ClearBridge Investments.

“While a growth scare could spark a retracement of this rotation, we ultimately expect a pickup in economic growth which should favor small cap, value and cyclicals,” he said. “Leadership rarely moves in a straight line, and we believe the near term (the next several months) could see an oscillation that favors the previous leadership on the perception of safety if the economy cools further. Ultimately, we believe a soft landing will play out.”

As the selloff in global stocks intensified Monday, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s trading desk said the rotation out of the technology sector might be “mostly done” and the market is “getting close” to a tactical opportunity to buy the dip.

Buying of stocks by retail investors has slowed quickly, positioning by trend-following commodity trading advisers has fallen a lot across equity regions and hedge funds have been net sellers of US stocks, JPMorgan’s positioning intelligence team wrote in a Monday note to clients.

“Overall, we think we’re getting close to a tactical opportunity to buy-the-dip,” wrote John Schlegel, JPMorgan’s head of positioning intelligence. “That said, whether we get a strong bounce or not could depend on future macro data.”

“The euphoria of the first quarter is quickly becoming a distant memory as weaker economic data is raising voices for a Fed cut in rates soon, and maybe before their next meeting,” said Paul Nolte at Murphy & Sylvest Wealth Management. “We are in the early stages of the ‘dog days of summer’ and things are heating up on Wall Street.”

Corporate Highlights:

Palantir Technologies Inc. raised its annual outlook, citing continuing demand for its artificial-intelligence software.

A federal judge on Monday ruled that Google has illegally monopolized the search market, hading the government an epic win in its first major antitrust case against a tech giant in more than two decades.

Nvidia Corp.’s upcoming artificial intelligence chips will be delayed due to design flaws, The Information reported, citing two unidentified people who help produce the chip and its server hardware.

Dell Technologies Inc. is cutting jobs as part of a reorganization of its sales teams that includes a new group focused on artificial intelligence products and services.

"The stock market selloff is about more than weak economic data, says Yahoo Finance.",https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-stocks-plunge-global-market-183312536.html,"STORY: Wall Street's main indexes plunged on Monday amid a global stock market meltdown.

The selloff in the U.S. pummeled the Magnificent Seven stocks including Apple, Nvidia and Amazon - the main drivers of the S&P 500's gains this year - set to lose a combined $650 billion in market value.

It follows U.S. economic data last week, including a weaker-than-expected jobs report, that stoked recession fears.

Bond yields slipped as investors bet the U.S. Federal Reserve would now need to cut interest rates more aggressively than expected to spur economic growth.

But Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo, doesn't believe that's necessary - and said the selloff was mostly an overreaction to a cooling economy that he believes will avoid a recession.

""I think we have a combination of a growth scare and a Fed policy scare. So, in other words, we went from, you know, months and months of 'When's the Fed going to ease and how much are they going to ease' this year and next to one where growth is plunging and the Fed is behind the curve. So, we've had a change in attitude. It's been based on, you know, some weakening data. [FLASH] So in our opinion, is the economy slowing? Yes. Is there any need for an emergency Fed cut? It doesn't look like it in our opinion.""

The market pain eased a bit as the day progressed and stocks pared losses after data showed U.S. services sector activity in July rebounded from a four-year low amid a rise in orders and employment.

But jitters pervaded, particularly among banks stocks and Big Tech.

Online brokerages including Charles Schwab and Vanguard reported service disruptions, frustrating investors looking to trade on a day when many sought to dump anything risky.

Bitcoin fell more than 15% on Monday amid the frenzied selling, and U.S.-listed shares of crypto-linked companies slumped.

Oil also fell on Monday despite worries that a spreading conflict in the Middle East could further hit crude supplies.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs now see a 25% likelihood of a U.S. recession. But JPMorgan analysts were more bearish, saying they saw a 50% chance of a recession."
"The stock market selloff is about more than weak economic data, says Yahoo Finance.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-reacts-global-stock-market-114601686.html,"Former President Trump on Sunday night appeared to gloat in response to the global market sell-off and suggested his Democratic rivals were to blame.

“STOCK MARKETS CRASHING. I TOLD YOU SO!!! KAMALA DOESN’T HAVE A CLUE. BIDEN IS SOUND ASLEEP. ALL CAUSED BY INEPT U.S. LEADERSHIP!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform late Sunday night.

U.S. stock markets plunged Friday following a weaker-than-expected jobs report that raised fears the economy could be slowing down faster than analysts had predicted. By Monday, the sell-off was intensifying, with stock futures for the S&P 500 down more than 2 percent and down more than 4 percent for Nasdaq.

Markets around the world declined, especially across Asia and Europe. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index fell 12.4 percent, and the Topix index fell 12.2 percent.

Stock markets have generally been climbing since the beginning of 2023 on a foundation of strong economic data, as employment levels have continually surpassed expectations in the face of the Federal Reserve interest rate hikes meant to slow the economy.

Trump, who tied himself to the stock market during his presidency, has frequently tried to claim responsibility for stock market records set under President Biden.

Earlier this year, he said the market was doing well “because they think I’m going to be elected.” He also said investor sentiment was soaring because his polls against Biden were “so good.”

The Biden campaign mocked those comments in response, saying Trump was “desperately trying to take credit for the stock market hitting record highs under President Biden.”

Throughout the morning on Monday, Trump tried to tie the market downturn to Vice President Harris, calling it the “KAMALA CRASH.” He also warned of “THE GREAT DEPRESSION OF 2024!” and of “THE PROBABILITY OF WORLD WAR III.”

“TRUMP CASH vs. KAMALA CRASH!” he said in one post.

Republican lawmakers told The Hill that Trump was caught off guard by the surge in momentum behind Harris’s revamped campaign. Some Republican senators think Trump should have seen the swap atop the Democrat ticket coming and crafted a messaging and political strategy weeks ago.

The Hill has reached out to Harris’s campaign for a response to Trump’s recent comments.

"The stock market selloff is about more than weak economic data, says Yahoo Finance.",https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/japans-nikkei-225-index-plunges-005243595.html,"NEW YORK (AP) — Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index soared nearly 11% early Tuesday, a day after it set markets tumbling in Europe and on Wall Street.

The Japanese index advanced more than 3,300 points, not quite making up for the huge loss of more than 4,400 points the day before, when it plunged 12.4% in its worst single-day decline since 1987.

The scary Monday started with a plunge abroad reminiscent of 1987 ’s crash swept around the world and pummeled Wall Street with more steep losses, as fears worsened about a slowing U.S. economy.

The S&P 500 dropped 3% for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average reeled by 1,033 points, or 2.6%, while the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4% as Apple, Nvidia and other Big Tech companies that used to be the stars of the stock market continued to wilt.

The drops were the latest in a global sell-off that began last week, and it was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday’s report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the U.S. economy to come in weaker than expected, and it’s all raised fear the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation.

Professional investors cautioned that some technical factors could be amplifying the action in markets, and that the drops may be overdone, but the losses were still neck-snapping. South Korea’s Kospi index careened 8.8% lower, and bitcoin dropped below $54,000 from more than $61,000 on Friday.

Even gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during tumultuous times, slipped about 1%.

That’s in part because traders began wondering if the damage has been so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, briefly sank below 3.70% during the morning from 3.88% late Friday and from 5% in April. It later recovered and pulled back to 3.89%.

Story continues

“The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3% doesn’t really seem like an emergency.”

Of course, the U.S. economy is still growing, the U.S. stock market is still up a healthy amount for the year and a recession is far from a certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.

Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession within the next 12 months following Friday’s jobs report. But he still sees only a 25% probability of that, up from 15%, in part “because the data look fine overall” and he does not “see major financial imbalances.”

Some of Wall Street’s recent declines may simply be air coming out of a stock market that romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Critics have been saying for a while that the stock market looked expensive after prices rose faster than corporate profits.

“Markets tend to move higher like they’re climbing stairs, and they go down like they’re falling out a window,” according to JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America. He chalks much of the recent worries to euphoria around AI subsiding, with pressure rising on companies to show how AI is turning into profits, and “a market that was ahead of itself.”

The only way for stocks to look less expensive is either for prices to fall or for their profits to strengthen. Expectations are still high for the latter, with growth for S&P 500 profits this past quarter looking to be the strongest since 2021.

Professional investors also pointed to the Bank of Japan’s move last week to raise its main interest rate from nearly zero. Such a move helps boost the value of the Japanese yen, but it could also force traders to scramble out of deals where they borrowed money for virtually no cost in Japan and invested it elsewhere around the world.

Treasury yields also pared their losses Monday after a report said growth for U.S. services businesses was a touch stronger than expected. Growth was led by arts, entertainment and recreation businesses, along with accommodations and food services, according to the Institute for Supply Management.

Still, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy’s strength took sharp losses on the fears about a slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 3.3%, washing out what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.

Making things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks tumbled as the market’s most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the “ Magnificent Seven ” had propelled the S&P 500 to record after record this year, even as high interest rates weighed down much of the rest of the stock market.

But Big Tech’s momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports that began with updates from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines.

Apple fell 4.8% Monday after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker.

Nvidia, the chip company that’s become the poster child of Wall Street’s AI bonanza, fell even more, 6.4%. Analysts cut their profit forecasts over the weekend for the company after a report from The Information said Nvidia’s new AI chip is delayed. The recent selling has trimmed Nvidia’s gain for the year to nearly 103% from 170% in the middle of June.

Another Big Tech titan, Alphabet, fell 4.4% after a U.S. judge ruled Google’s search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation.

All told, the S&P 500 fell 160.23 points to 5,186.33. The Dow sank 1,033.99 to 38,703.27, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 576.08 to 16,200.08.

Worries outside corporate profits, interest rates and the economy are also weighing on the market. The Israel-Hamas war may be worsening, which beyond its human toll could cause sharp swings for the price of oil. That’s adding to broader worries about potential hotspots around the world, while upcoming U.S. elections could further scramble things.

Wall Street has been concerned about how policies coming out of November could impact markets, but the sharp swings for stock prices could affect the election itself.

The threat of a recession is likely to put Vice President Kamala Harris on the defensive. But slower growth could also further reduce inflation and force former President Donald Trump to pivot from his current focus on higher prices to outlining ways to revive the economy.

“It comes down to jobs,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. Jobs drive spending by U.S. consumers, which in turn is the biggest part of the U.S. economy.

“When we get to election day, the unemployment rate is going to be extremely important.”

"The stock market selloff is about more than weak economic data, says Yahoo Finance.",https://uk.news.yahoo.com/experts-warning-global-recession-actually-170211914.html,"Global equities markets began the week with a steep plunge, reacting to the possibility of a coming US recession that Goldman Sachs economists pegged at 25 percent.

On Monday morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 945 points, or nearly 2.5 percent, to ​​38,791.28. In simple terms, if on Friday you had $100 in a fund tracking the Dow, you would now have about $97.50. The two other major indexes, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite, were down mid-morning by roughly 3 percent and 6 percent, respectively. At the end of the session, the Dow was down 2.6 percent, sliding more than 1,000 points overall. The S&P dropped 160 points, shedding 3 percent of its value, and the Nasdaq was down 3.4 percent, losing 576 points by the closing bell.

The chance of an economic downturn at some point in the next 12 months has risen 10 points, from 15 percent, according to a report that Goldman’s chief economist, Jan Hatzius — who was credited with predicting the 2008 US recession — sent to clients on Sunday.

This, plus a weaker-than-expected jobs report on Friday, with Bureau of Labor Statistics data showing a July slowdown in US job growth — 114,000 new jobs added, missing expectations of a 175,000 gain — as well as a rise in unemployment from 4.1 percent to 4.3 percent, a level not seen since October 2021.

At the same time, Hatzius said the US economy remains “fine overall,” and that the recession risk is “limited.” The Federal Reserve has plenty of leeway to cut interest rates, and can slash them quickly, if needed. Further, the July jobs report, which included a large number of temporary layoffs rather than permanent cuts, may not signal a trend, according to Hatzius.

The Federal Reserve has plenty of room to cut rates if need be, according to analysts (AP)

What is a recession?

President Harry S. Truman once jokingly said, “It’s a recession when your neighbor loses his job. It’s a depression when you lose yours.”

In practice, there is no hard-and-fast rule that defines a recession.

A recession is officially determined by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) Business Cycle Dating Committee , which defines one as “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.” The committee analyzes not only employment numbers but real personal income, sales, industrial production, and consumer spending, adjusting its assessments on what the White House Council of Economic Advisers calls “ a holistic look at the data .”

A recession is usually associated with a decline in GDP of 2 percent; an especially severe recession can see declines of 5 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund .

At its most basic, a recession can be triggered by, among other things, higher asset prices, constricting supply, mistimed or ill-conceived economic or fiscal policy, rising unemployment, and housing market crashes, according to the Congressional Research Service . Each recession is different, but the IMF says they typically last about a year .

The US was last in a recession between December 2007 and June 2009 , the longest and most severe since 1960. Dubbed “The Great Recession,” the economic slowdown was sparked by a steep decline in home prices, the bottom falling out of the subprime mortgage market, and the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The recovery was unusually slow, with “moderate” economic growth and stubbornly elevated unemployment levels, according to the Federal Reserve .

There is no reason to fear another Great Depression, economists say (REUTERS)

Recent unemployment numbers have set investors on edge with talk of the so-called Sahm Rule , a historically accurate recession predictor named for its creator, former Federal Reserve economist Claudia Sahm. According to the Sahm Rule, a recession is underway when the three-month moving average of the US unemployment rate is at least a half a percentage point higher than the 12-month low. In this instance, the July 2023 unemployment rate came in at 3.5 percent.

However, Sahm herself told CNBC on Friday that the eponymous indicator, which has had a 100 percent success rate since its inception in 2019, finds that we “are not in a recession now,” although momentum seems to be in that direction, and that “a recession is not inevitable.”

In response to US fears, Japan’s Nikkei average on Monday closed down 12.4 percent, the biggest one-day drop since October 1987. European markets also opened sharply down, with the sharpest downturn seen in more than a year. The question now is, will fears of a US recession spur a global one?

What’s the difference between a recession and a depression?

The difference, in short, is the degree of severity by which the economy is affected.

Like a recession, a depression has no precise definition, but is normally described as a decline in GDP of more than 10 percent.

The Great Depression lasted from 1929 to 1933, during which GDP fell some 30 percent and unemployment hit a whopping 25 percent.

In a 2004 speech, then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke explained that the economy rebounded after Franklin D. Roosevelt was sworn into office in 1933. However, unemployment remained in the double digits until the beginning of World War II.

On Monday, even though the markets are reacting as if a recession is inevitable, it may be the equities markets that take the biggest hit — not the broader economy, according to analyst Dhaval Joshi of BCA Research. He told The Guardian that a “decoupling between robust growth in the economy and steadily rising unemployment is unprecedented in our lifetimes.”

“Right now, if we should fear a US recession, the question is: a recession in what?” Joshi said. “As in 2000-01, the biggest risk is a severe recession in the frothy parts of the stock market.”"

Wall Street stocks tumbled Thursday after weak manufacturing data sparked worries about a US recession while European stocks slumped on disappointing bank earnings.

US equities had risen at the open of trading after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday opened the door to a September interest rate cut during a press conference.

But stocks began moving lower after the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index came in at 46.8 percent in July, down from the prior month and weaker than analyst estimates.

""The market might be beginning to fear that the economy is slowing to the point where we might be looking at a recession eight to 12 months from now,"" said Peter Cardillo of Spartan Capital, who also noted that jobless claims topped estimates.

All three major indices finished decisively lower, with the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index falling the most at 2.3 percent.

Markets will get another key US economic data point on Friday with monthly jobs data.

Meanwhile, the Bank of England cut its main interest rate for the first time since the Covid pandemic broke out in 2020, reducing borrowing costs by a quarter-point to 5.0 percent.

The decision hurt the pound but was not enough to save London stocks, which fell victim to a downward shift across Europe, where hotter-than-expected eurozone inflation released Wednesday raised uncertainty whether the European Central Bank would cut interest rates in September after doing so in June.

Both Frankfurt and Paris stocks finished more than two percent lower.

Asset manager Adrien Roure at Indosuez noted high volatility in European trading and said investors were being influenced ""by company results today, particularly in the banking sector.""

Shares in French bank Societe Generale slumped 8.9 percent as it cut its earnings guidance.

British bank HSBC saw its shares fall 6.9 percent, Lloyds 5.3 percent and Barclays 4.6 percent.

In Italy, UniCredit fell 5.7 percent and Intesa Sanpaolo shed 3.9 percent.

Spanish banks Banco de Sabadell fell 5.6 percent, BBVA 5.0 percent and Santander 4.2 percent.

Elsewhere, oil prices retreated after rallying the prior day as analysts viewed the rising tensions in the Middle East as unlikely to affect crude market movements.

"The stock market selloff is about more than weak economic data, says Yahoo Finance.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/why-stay-bullish-stocks-despite-153601581.html,"U.S. equities extended their last week’s sell-off on Monday, while 10-year Treasury yields dropped to 3.8% amid a resurgence in recession fears as financial markets were unsettled by additional signs of labor market weakness.

According to Alpine Macro strategists, further sell-offs can be anticipated as the overall market remains highly overbought following the recent price surge. But despite these concerns, strategists maintain a bullish outlook on equities.

""We have been in the ‘no recession’ camp for some time and believe the Federal Reserve will very likely reverse its tight monetary policy before interest rates start to choke off economic growth and send the U.S. stock market into another major bear market.""

Alpine Macro’s optimism is grounded in a few critical arguments. First, they highlight the unique nature of the COVID-19 recession, which differed significantly from past economic downturns. The recession was driven by government lockdowns rather than the natural progression of a boom-bust cycle.

This distinction means that the sharp spike in inflation was primarily caused by supply-side disruptions rather than excessive demand. As a result, inflation has been falling as supply chains recover, independent of the Federal Reserve’s monetary tightening.

""Inflation was already on its way down before the Fed even started to raise rates,"" the strategists note.

Alpine also notes that the bears often cite the ""burnt-out"" savings from pandemic-era income transfers as a reason for imminent recession, suggesting that consumer spending will collapse as these savings deplete. However, strategists dismiss this view, explaining that the personal savings rate has normalized and consumer spending remains robust.

""Consumers as a whole have never drawn on their savings to support their spending,"" they assert, pointing out that household net worth has increased significantly, providing a buffer against economic shocks.

Concerns about rising credit card delinquency rates and consumer stress were also addressed. While there has been an increase in credit card delinquencies, this represents a small fraction of total consumer debt. Overall, U.S. households have reduced their indebtedness since the 2008 financial crisis, and the debt service ratio remains low.

""To say that U.S. consumers as a whole are seriously stressed is factually incorrect,” Alpine argued.

Moreover, the labor market, despite showing some signs of cooling, is not in distress. The firm says that the rise in the unemployment rate has been primarily driven by an increase in labor supply rather than a decrease in labor demand. They also argue that the so-called Sahm Rule, which predicts recessions based on rising unemployment rates, may not apply in the current cycle.

Story continues

Financial stress indicators have been easing, reducing the likelihood of a financial crisis precipitating an economic recession. The strategists argue that the current monetary policy, while tighter than before, is not unduly restrictive given the higher levels of nominal growth and inflation.

Looking ahead, Alpine Macro sees potential for a strong bull market in equities, driven by continued innovations and productivity gains, particularly in the AI sector.

They draw parallels to the late 1990s internet boom, suggesting that the current AI boom could lead to significant market gains.

""The vast number of stocks have barely risen over the past two and a half years... With Fed easing in sight and bond yields plunging, these sectors and stocks should have more gains to come.""

“Small caps, financials and eventually industrials will do well in 2025, while the Mag 7 could be inflated even more and move into bubble territory,” they added.

“In the 1990s, stock market corrections and shakeouts were steep and vicious, but the subsequent rise in prices was equally furious.”

Strategists said they expect a similar pattern to be repeated in the current cycle.

Suze Orman is not only a personal finance expert, a No. 1 New York Times Bestselling author and, according to USA Today, a “one-woman financial advice power house,” but a teacher, as well. Using her platform, Orman has built an empire in financial literacy, educating the general public on better ways to save, spend and invest their money.

In a recent “Women & Money” podcast episode entitled “Suze School: Avoid the Biggest Danger to Your Future Investments,” Orman broke down some of the most common and damaging pitfalls you can get caught up in that hurt your financial future.

Here is what Orman said is the biggest danger to your future investment success and ways to avoid it.

Earning passive income doesn't need to be difficult. You can start this week.

Hindsight Is 20/20

Orman recalled a recent interaction with a friend who regretted not buying stock in a company when it was low — before the company took off, making shares go through the roof. While Orman initially agreed, she ultimately said, “Your biggest danger to your future investment success is your past wishes.”

She added, “At some point in your investment career, you look at stocks like Nvidia or Apple or Palantir or Broadcom … or things that came out a long time ago, that if you just had bought them, maybe you would have invested $10,000, and today maybe it would be worth $2.1 million, and you spend all of this time calculating how much money you would have made.”

She noted that this is a mentality that can become a trap. “When you spend time doing something like that — you should have, you could have, ‘I wish I had’ — then you spend your time trying to find the next stock like Nvidia, like an Amazon, like an Apple, like so many that are out there.”

Look for Today’s Good Investments

Instead, Orman suggested that investors should be looking at stocks that are similar to those companies, yet have so much further to go. Keeping an eye on the big ones is never a bad idea. However, it blinds investors from potential wins that are still in the making.

Orman recalled that numerous people over her almost 40-year career have come to her and lamented the big stocks they should have bought when they could afford them. Orman would respond that there “are still good stocks.”

Avoid Anxious Investing

When these same people would come to Orman for advice on which investments to make, Orman said nerves would kick in about what the next financial boom was, overshadowing what was presently available for a good initial investment that would only take time to grow.

“Because you’re watching the movements of these stocks go up and up and up,” said Orman, “and then all of a sudden, a few days ago, the stocks that have been going up and up and up are now going down and down and down. And you get so depressed.”

Go With the Flow

Orman shared that her biggest mistake over the course of her time investing was selling too soon.

“When you’ve sold something that you’ve made money on, but then it continues to go up, you sit there hoping it would come back down,” Orman explained, “so that you could buy it again.”

Orman’s advice is that when things go, you have to go with it, no matter the flow. “If you are invested in good quality ETFs, if you are invested in great individual stocks, maybe you need to just stop watching the markets all together. Maybe you just need to know that, over the long run, they are really going to be doing OK.”

Dollar-Cost Average

The key to investment success, according to Orman, is the courage to take opportunities and buy when stocks are down.

“It’s important that you … look at things in the market as opportunities,” Orman said. “It is times like this, where there is chaos in the world, there is chaos in the markets — this is when you start to dollar-cost average. This is when you start to take advantage of the down days.”

Orman tells listeners over and over that it is important to always dollar-cost average — something that she herself has been doing for quite a while. “If you get a large lump sum of money or you are going from a 401(k) into an IRA and you have a large sum of cash, dollar-cost average into the positions that you want.”

Dollar-cost averaging can smooth the road when it comes to wild markets: You automatically invest on a regular basis, no matter what the market is doing. In some ways, it is a set it and forget it model in which, for a certain period of time, you put the same amount of money into a target security, no matter the price, at a consistent pace.

Orman said, “Don’t be afraid that ‘oh, I have to invest in it right now, because it is going to go straight up, and I’m going to miss it.’ Nothing goes straight up.”

If, on the off chance it does go straight up and looks strong, Orman gave the greenlight to go ahead and buy that stock again.

Understanding the Market

Orman summed up the key to financial success as not backing down during tough times in the markets. Stocks go up and down, as is their nature. There is nothing anyone can do to predict or control the fluctuations of their worth. However, looking at previous investments with a 20/20 lens for what should have happened is doomed to blind investors on what to put their money into in the future.

Orman advised anyone in the investment game to be brave, stick to a stock, do not sell early and, if you can, buy more to keep the stability on an upward trend.

At the close in Tokyo on Monday, the benchmark index was down 4,451.28 points, or 12.40%, to 31,458.42.

It is the largest point fall ever, eclipsing the decline on 20 October 1987, the day after Black Monday in New York. It is the second largest decline in percentage terms, according to Nikkei data.

The panic selling extended across Asia, with markets in Singapore (^STI), Indonesia (^JKSE), Thailand (^SET.BK), and the Philippines (PSEI.PS) also experiencing drops of 2% to 3%. These declines triggered circuit breakers, temporarily halting trading for 20 minutes.

US recession fears sparks global selloff

Weaker than expected jobs and manufacturing figures in the US have raised concerns that the Federal Reserve has left it too late to begin cutting interest rates without damaging the world’s largest economy.

Tan Boon Heng, of Mizuho Bank in Singapore, said: “The scenario of higher unemployment constraining spending and further restraining hiring and incomes and economic activity leading to a recession is the feared scenario here.”

The US Federal Reserve last Wednesday decided not to slash interest rates from the 5.25% to 5.5% range, which they have been frozen since July last year.

Kyle Rodda, senior financial market analyst at capital.com, said: “The markets are in meltdown and it’s a sea of red across the world. There are a lot of moving parts, but this is the essence of things: a looming slowdown in the US economy has cast doubts about global economic growth.

""The move has triggered a sell-off in the US dollar and a rally in the yen, the latter of which was boosted by the BOJ’s [Bank of Japan's] decision to tighten policy last week and a subsequent short-squeeze.

“The rapid move in the yen is putting downward pressure on Japanese equities, but it’s also driving an unwind of a major carry trade – investors had leveraged up by borrowing in yen to buy other assets, chiefly US tech stocks. We are basically seeing a mass deleveraging as investors sell assets to fund their losses.

“The rapidity of the move has caught a lot of investors off guard; there’s a lot of panic selling now, which is what causes these non-linear reactions in asset prices to pretty straightforward fundamental dynamics.”

The market rout has spilled over, with US treasury yields falling further, European stock indexes in the red, bitcoin dumped and the dollar losing ground mainly to the yen.

London’s blue-chip index (^FTSE) was as much as 2.22% down, losing 196 points to hit 7,978.59 at the time of writing, with equities across the board falling into the red. It is the sharpest fall in London’s benchmark index since July last year.

The Dax (^GDAXI) in Frankfurt sank more than 2.6% while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris slumped 2.3%. Elsewhere, Milan (FTSEMIB.MI) plunged 3.1% and Madrid (^IBEX) gave up 2.8%.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency (BTC-USD) fell by 15% to $51,400, adding to a 13.1% drop last week.

Wall Street’s so-called “fear index” has hit a four-year high as traders race to sell-off stocks. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (^VIX) – used to gauge turbulence in stock markets – has surged to its highest level since the pandemic.

US oil and gas giant ExxonMobil reported higher profits Friday as it pointed to the benefits of its acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, while earnings at rival Chevron dipped on lower refining results.

ExxonMobil rode the contribution from Pioneer, a big player in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico, to record oil and gas output during the quarter.

Profits at ExxonMobil jumped 17 percent to $9.2 billion on a 12 percent increase in revenues to $93.1 billion, topping analyst estimates on both counts.

The petroleum heavyweight pointed to a lift in output from the Permian Basin following the Pioneer deal, which has also put the company on track for higher capital spending this year.

Another bright spot is ExxonMobil's venture in Guyana, where the company during the second quarter filed an application for a seventh development with Guyanese officials, with anticipated startup in 2029.

These upstream highlights made up for a sharp drop in energy products due to excess supply of petroleum products that weakened profit margins.

Meanwhile, Chevron reported profits of $4.4 billion, down 26 percent from the year-ago period on revenues of $51.2 billion, up five percent.

Upstream profits fell somewhat compared to the year-ago period, with Chevron citing downtime in Australia and an exit from Myanmar, offsetting higher volumes in the United States.

The bigger hit to Chevron's results was in the downstream, where profits fell by 60 percent due to weak profit margins.

Chevron's outlook has also been clouded by uncertainty surrounding its proposed $53 billion takeover of US oil company Hess.

The deal, which was announced in October, has been significantly delayed by ExxonMobil, which has argued it has ""pre-emption rights"" on the Stabroek venture in Guyana in which Hess has a stake.

Chevron has said it could exit the Hess deal if it doesn't include Guyana.

The case is going to arbitration.

On Wednesday, Chevron disclosed that the arbitration hearing would take place in May 2025, with a decision expected in the following three months.

Chevron, which had previously hoped for the arbitration hearing in 2024, ""had expected and requested that this hearing be held earlier, but the arbitrators' common schedules did not make this possible,"" the company said in a securities filing.

ExxonMobil, which announced its Pioneer deal about two weeks before Chevron unveiled the Hess transaction, appeared to allude to the Hess deal delay in the company's press release.

""We closed on our transformative merger with Pioneer in about half the time of similar deals,"" said ExxonMobil Chief Executive Darren Woods.

ExxonMobil completed the $60 billion takeover of Pioneer in early May.

Shares of ExonMobil fell 0.4 percent, while Chevron fell 1.9 percent in pre-market trading.

"The stock market selloff is about more than weak economic data, says Yahoo Finance.",https://malaysia.news.yahoo.com/goldman-boosts-recession-odds-sees-152127664.html,"Goldman Sachs increased its odds of a recession in the next year Monday following consecutive days of an equity market selloff, though the investment bank sees the risk of a serious downturn as “limited.”

The bank boosted its year-ahead recession probability by 10 percentage points to 25 percent while noting it expects the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at each of its next three meetings this year.

“We continue to see recession risk as limited because the data look fine overall, we do not see major financial imbalances, and the Fed has 525 [basis points] of room to cut to support the economy,” Goldman Sachs said in an analysis.

Markets opened way down on Monday morning after falling sharply on Friday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average of major U.S. stocks was down more than 1,000 points or 2.67 percent as of 10:40 a.m. EDT Monday. The S&P 500 fell more than 167 points, or 3 percent, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq was down more than 580 points, or 3.5 percent.

The initial sell-off on Friday was spurred by a weaker-than-expected employment report from the Labor Department.

Unemployment rose to 4.3 percent in July from 4.1 percent in June as the economy added 114,000 payrolls, shy of the 175,000 economists expected. The number of jobs added to the economy have received significant downward revisions across April, May and June.

“Both payroll growth (114,000 [versus] a 168,000 [second-quarter] average) and household employment growth (67,000) were weak. Catch-up hiring in healthcare accounted for over half of payroll growth. We now estimate that underlying trend job growth stands at 147,000 per month,” Goldman analysts wrote.

Downward momentum continued through the weekend as international investors sold off stocks on Monday, responding to recent interest rate increases by the Bank of Japan, which have made loans in the Japanese currency less valuable.

The Fed is widely expected to cut interest rates at its next meeting to stimulate economic growth.

Goldman said it expects the Fed to cut rates by a quarter-point at each of its next three meetings in September, November and December.

Investment bankers also said they now believe wage growth has slowed down to “roughly the 3.5 percent pace compatible with 2 percent inflation.”

Average hourly earnings increased by 0.2 percent in July and by 3.6 percent over the past year, they noted.

Diageo today saw as much as £5 billion wiped from its market cap after the London-listed drinks giant posted a fall in turnover for the first time since 2020.

The Smirnoff and Johnnie Walker owner said it had seen a 15% fall in revenues in Latin America, alongside a 13% drop in Africa and a 2% dip in sales in North America. That news has helped its shares slump as much as 10% in the opening minutes of trade.

CEO Debra Crew said the slump in demand was “attributable to a cautious consumer environment and the impact of lapping inventory replenishment in the prior year.”

But the company also warned: “The consumer environment continues to be challenging with conditions we saw towards the end of fiscal 24 persisting into fiscal 25.”

In Europe sales were more resilient, rising 12%. Sales in the UK were especially strong, with a near 1/3 rise in demand for Guinness. Overall turnover stood at $20.3 billion for the year to end June, down 1% on last year.

Nuno Teles, Managing Director for Diageo Great Britain, told the Standard: “We are a very resilient British business. Europe is a strong region [and] ’s another golden year for Guinness -- we have doubled the business with our 0.0% proposition.

“We had a setback in [Latin America] driven by excess inventory that we have now implemented the measures to address fully.”

Scotch was the weakest-performing drinks category for Diageo, with overall sales down 10% on last year, while gin fell 8% and tequila and vodka both saw 7% sales drops. Ciroc was the worst-performing brand, with revenue down by more than a quarter.

But beer picked up as a category with overall net sales up 14%, led by a surge in demand for Guinness.

""The gods of fashion have smiled upon Guinness, previously consumed by blokes my age, but now widely adopted by younger generations,” the boss of pub chain Wetherspoon, Tim Martin, said in a trading update earlier this year.

Diageo plans to open a new £73 million brewing facility in London’s Covent Garden next year."

More heavy selling ripped through global financial markets today as the FTSE 100 index lost 2% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 suffered its biggest one-day slide since 1987. The reverse in London followed Friday’s poor jobs figures in the US, which appeared to fuel doubts about a soft landing for the world’s largest economy.

Tokyo’s stock market was also impacted by the country’s interest rate outlook as yen-linked losses for big multinationals left the Nikkei 225 down by 12.4%. Traders expect a fresh wave of selling on Wall Street later after the Nasdaq Composite closed 2.4% lower and the S&P 500 index lost 1.8% on Friday.

Poorly-received results impacted the tech sector before the weekend, leaving Amazon shares down 9% and Intel off 26%.

The risk averse mood also impacted the cryptocurrency market as Bitcoin slumped by 10% to $52,729.

In London, the FTSE 100 index lost 200 points to trade below 8000 for the first time since April and the UK-focused FTSE 250 index reversed by 3%.

Dannii Hewson, AJ Bell’s head of financial analysis, said: “Friday’s brutal sell off has continued into the new week as investors mull the prospect that the much-touted US soft landing looks like being a whole lot bumpier than markets had hoped.

“Circuit breakers have been firing on Asian markets as stocks tumbled, with investors scurrying to price the impact a stalling US economy is likely to have.”

Big fallers in the FTSE 100 included mining heavyweight Glencore, which reversed 5%. The tech sector backer Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust also lost 4%.

Meanwhile, the financial markets uncertainty was cited alongside geopolitical risk for the collapse of a potential £1.6 billion takeover in the FTSE 250 index.

Energy and materials-focused consulting and projects firm Wood Group had been in the sights of the Dubai-based engineering company Sidara. Wood’s shares fell 38%.

Recession fears were fuelled on Friday after US payroll growth of 114,000 came in short of Wall Street’s 175,000 forecast and June figures were revised lower.

The unemployment rate also hit a three-year peak of 4.3%, above the 4.1% expected although the figure may have been distorted by hurricane disruption.

The figures prompted a sharp surge in bets on Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, with markets now seeing a 200 basis points reduction over the next 12 months.

Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said: ""Markets were on edge before Friday but a weak payrolls figure has really escalated a profound move across the globe.”"

Leading stock markets diverged Tuesday ahead of a slew of interest rate decisions and earnings reports from big companies.

In New York, the Dow closed higher, the broad-based S&P retreated, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq slumped ahead of several major tech company reports.

In Europe, London fell initially before recovering, while continental exchanges mostly closed higher on faster-than-expected economic growth in the euro zone.

The Federal Reserve is expected to leave US interest rates unchanged at the end of its policy meeting Wednesday.

The US central bank's post-meeting statement will be thoroughly scrutinized for confirmation that it will lower borrowing costs in September as inflation falls, with the extent of that cut open to debate.

""Investors don't expect a rate change when the meeting concludes tomorrow, but after June's inflation metrics were softer than expected and with a job market that's weakening, they have high expectations for a cut during September's meeting,"" said Joe Mazzola, a strategist at Charles Schwab.

Wednesday also sees the Bank of Japan make its own much-anticipated decision over interest rates.

The Tokyo stock market closed slightly up on Tuesday.

London's FTSE 100 index closed little changed amid some mixed British earnings and as traders awaited the Bank of England's policy announcement Thursday -- with analysts split on whether it will cut rates.

Shares in alcoholic drinks maker Diageo, owner of Guinness stout and Johnnie Walker whisky, dropped six percent after it reported slowing sales in some regions.

Standard Chartered shares rose six percent after the bank announced a share buyback along with strong half-year results.

Paris advanced following data showing the French economy expanded more than expected in the second quarter.

Frankfurt also rose despite data showing Germany's economy contracted in April-June.

In New York, focus ahead of the Fed's meeting will be on earnings from Microsoft, the world's second-largest listed company, noted Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at trader Scope Markets.

Microsoft reported that quarterly profit had climbed but its crucial cloud computing unit missed expectations.

""The story appears to be similar for many of these big tech names, with traders on the lookout for signs that the vast sums of money being invested in AI has started to pay dividends,"" Mahony said.

By Bloomberg News

(Bloomberg) — China’s Tiger Brokers is setting its sights on Singapore’s riches for a revenue boost as it continues to shift away from its home market after a regulatory crackdown.

The firm, formally known as Up Fintech Holding Ltd., is hoping to double its revenue in Singapore over the next 1 to 2 years as it taps the “sophisticated and rich,” including high-net worth individuals, family offices and hedge funds, founder and Chief Executive Officer Wu Tianhua said in an interview this week.

Singapore is an international financial centre that can connect wealth across the globe, Wu said in a video call from Beijing. “We see a lot of growth potential in the country. It’s the central pivot of our internationalisation.”

About one in every three adults in Singapore is a registered user of Tiger Brokers, according to Wu. The city-state is now the firm’s global headquarter and its single largest market in terms of client assets and revenue contribution, he said, declining to disclose the detailed breakdown.

The firm’s total revenue jumped 21% to US$272.5 million last year, and rose 19% over the first quarter this year to US$78.9 million. The balance on its client accounts more than doubled to US$32.9 billion as of end-March, the firm reported Wednesday, adding average net asset inflows of new funded clients in Singapore reached US$14,000.

Home Market

Tiger Brokers, which started off facilitating overseas securities trading for mainland Chinese investors, has been shifting away from the home market over the past few years after a regulatory clampdown.

Tiger Brokers, which started off facilitating overseas securities trading for mainland Chinese investors, has been shifting away from the home market over the past few years after a regulatory clampdown.

China bars its individuals from using the annual $50,000 foreign exchange quota for direct offshore investments including securities, though some brokerages have for years managed to help them circumvent the rule by opening accounts offshore.

Authorities have criticised Tiger and peer Futu Holdings Ltd. since 2021, labelling their cross-border brokerage business as illegal. The online brokers were ordered in late 2022 to stop taking on new mainland investors and had to pull their trading apps onshore last year.

China’s share in Tiger’s total client assets has now dropped to less than 25% from a “great majority” in 2020, according to Wu.

The firm has been maintaining close communications with Chinese regulators, and pledged to comply with any upcoming rules regarding cross-border trades, said Wu, adding for now the dust has settled.

The company’s shares had traded within a tight range over the past two years. They are down about 50% from October 2021 when China first took aim at cross border services, and almost 90% below its peak in February the same year.

Global Ambitions

Tiger Brokers, which already facilitates trades in assets ranging from equities, US Treasuries to derivatives, will strive to beef up innovation and its product portfolio to cater to both retail and institutional investors, said Wu.

Having just launched virtual asset trading services for professional investors in Hong Kong in May, Tiger is in the process of obtaining qualifications in the city and other jurisdictions including Singapore and the US to expand the offering, he said. Wu expects the firm to get a greenlight in Hong Kong likely within this year to service retail investors, and get clearance for handling crypto trades in Singapore after that.

Headcount might be added marginally to aid its business expansion, but Wu ruled out the possibility of a “big increase” to its global staff of 1,000 employees.

Founded in 2014 in Beijing, Tiger Brokers now holds brokerage licenses in jurisdictions including Hong Kong, Singapore, US, Australia and New Zealand and services 2.2 million clients globally. It also offers Employee Stock Ownership Program management, investment banking and wealth management among other services.

“We aspire to become a world-class brokerage empowered by technologies” like the firm’s investor Interactive Brokers, he said. “We’ve managed to develop from zero to one over the past decade, and we hope to notch it up from one to ten in the future.”

"The stock market selloff is about more than weak economic data, says Yahoo Finance.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-halts-trading-amidst-global-082205615.html,"Investing.com -- Trading platform Barchart said on social media platform X that Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) has suspended its 24-hour trading service. This decision comes as stock markets in Europe and Asia are experiencing significant declines due to fears of a US economic slowdown.

Japanese stocks experienced a dramatic drop of 13%, the largest decline since the 2011 global financial crisis. This massive sell-off led to circuit breakers being triggered across Asian exchanges. The broad Asia-Pacific index, excluding Japan, fell by 4.2%, and Japan's Nikkei 225 index hit seven-month lows.

In the U.S., the negative trend continued with Nasdaq futures down 4.7% and S&P 500 futures plunging 12.4%. European markets were also affected, with the EUROSTOXX 50 futures dropping 2.1% and FTSE futures falling 1.2%.

As investors sought safe havens, the yen and Swiss franc surged. Japanese 10-year bond yields fell to 0.785%, their lowest since April, while U.S. Treasury yields dropped significantly, with 10-year yields hitting 3.723% and two-year yields down to 3.807%, further inverting the yield curve—a sign of potential recession.

Market expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts increased following a weak July payrolls report. Analysts now predict a 78% chance of a rate cut in September, with additional cuts anticipated later in the year. Goldman Sachs has raised its recession odds to 25% based on current conditions.

The U.S. dollar’s safe-haven appeal waned, falling 0.4% against a basket of major currencies. The dollar also weakened against the yen and euro, while the Swiss franc gained. Gold prices rose to $2,456 an ounce as investors sought refuge in precious metals.

Overall, the selloff highlights ongoing market concerns and underscores the need for close attention to upcoming economic data and corporate earnings reports.

Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said in a latest interview with CNBC that the key reason behind the latest decline in tech stocks was major companies projecting high CapEx and giving no updates on AI monetization. Munster, however, thinks AI spending is necessary for these companies to reap rewards in the future.

“If you are in my camp.. which I think it (AI) will be more transformative than the internet, then small companies and the big companies are going to participate.”

(Bloomberg) — Singapore has turned into a hive of activity for mergers and acquisitions this quarter as investor confidence returns, helped by relative economic and political stability.

The flurry of action in just the past few days includes a KKR & Co.-Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. consortium agreeing to invest S$1.75 billion in ST Telemedia Global Data Centres, beating other global investors. More are likely coming, including Europe’s biggest insurer Allianz SE discussing a possible tie-up with Income Insurance Ltd.

The city-state is “clearly the centre of gravity for M&As in Southeast Asia,” Bank of America Corp. Singapore Country Head Martin Siah said in an interview. “Sentiment toward large transformative inbound M&A from Singapore is more positive than it has been in recent years,” raising confidence for the second half and 2025, he said.

Overall, the value of deals involving Singaporean firms since the start of April is up 102% from the full second quarter last year at $23.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

It’s not only the number of deals – these are strategic and large transactions that place Singapore as the hub for Southeast Asia, with unprecedented inbound foreign direct investment by international names, said Siah, who joined BofA in 2015 after stints with Standard Chartered Plc and UBS Group AG.

BofA was an adviser on the KKR-led STT data centre deal. It also was an adviser on the sale of a majority stake in Singapore’s Fullerton Health to Far East Drug Co. announced in April.

Tao Choon Chiam, head of Southeast Asia M&A at Ashurst ADTLaw, said many of the recent deals have been in the works since mid to late last year. The pace is “a signal that investors are taking a longer term view of the macroeconomic situation and prepared to invest in the right assets.”

“There was always interest in good assets, but investors were concerned about the economic outlook,” Chiam said. “In some cases, valuation gaps have narrowed as sellers are keen to offload non-core assets or want to raise cash to be ready to acquire more assets in the coming years.” There’s also pent up demand from buyers after a quiet few years in the market, he said.

Economists expect Singapore’s economy to expand 2.4 per cent in 2024, according to the monetary authority’s latest survey. Meanwhile, the benchmark Straits Times Index has been advancing and is now more than 8 per cent higher than an October low.

Singapore’s strong corporate governance and predictable political environment are also appealing and help it retain a competitive edge, Chiam said.

This year, Chiam’s law firm Ashurst advised London-listed alternative asset manager Intermediate Capital Group on its investment into Alfa Medicus Pte, a private surgery operator in Singapore, as well as locally based Carousell’s purchase of LuxLexicon Pte, a luxury bag reseller.

Some other deals signed or in the works include Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. getting closer to taking full control of Great Eastern Holdings Ltd. with a S$1.4 billion offer. In the world of energy, Shell Plc is buying liquefied natural gas trader Pavilion Energy Pte from Temasek Holdings Pte. France’s Séché Environnement just announced it is buying hazardous industrial waste collector ECO Industrial Environmental Engineering Pte for S$605 million.

(Reuters) -The S&P 500 closed barely higher after Monday's choppy trading session as investors held their breath ahead of a raft of big technology company earnings, a Federal Reserve policy decision on interest-rate cuts and key US labor data, all due this week.

Quarterly reports from market heavyweights such as Microsoft and Apple, Meta and Amazon.com this week will offer clues on whether technology stocks are vulnerable or can extend their recent rallies.

Investors are hoping that the Fed will end its meeting on Wednesday with a signal that it is preparing for a September rate cut in its policy verdict.

On Friday investors will closely monitor the July non-farm payrolls report for signs of possible weakening in the labor market.

""Understandably we're wavering,"" said Mona Mahajan, principal and senior investment strategist at Edward Jones, pointing to the upcoming catalysts and Wall Street's Friday advance.

""Markets are largely in wait-and-see mode. We have big economic news this week, both the Fed meeting Wednesday and the jobs report on Friday. We also have huge earnings reports coming out of mega cap technology,"" she said.

Technology megacaps have dominated Wall Street's record-breaking run, prompting investors to recently turn their attention to laggards such as mid- and small caps, which are expected to benefit from a low-interest-rate environment.

""A lot of investors are keen to see whether the recent rotation we've been seeing in the markets has legs, or does mega cap technology really kind of shine through in its earnings reports,"" Mahajan added.

However, the small-cap Russell 2000 lost 1% after three straight weeks of gains.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 49.41 points, or 0.12% at 40,539.93 while the S&P 500 rose 4.44 points, or 0.08%, to 5,463.54. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 12.32 points, or 0.07%, to 17,370.20.

Among the S&P 500's 11 major industry sector indexes, consumer discretionary was the benchmark's biggest boost with the sector's biggest contribution from Tesla as the electric vehicle maker's stock rallied after Morgan Stanley added it to its ""top pick"" U.S. autos' list.

The biggest percentage decliner among the major sectors was energy, which lost 0.9% as oil prices fell.

McDonald's shares closed up 3.7% after it said its $5-meal deal, launched late in June, was popular among customers shying away from higher-price items. As a result the fast food giant reported a surprise drop in sales, its first in 13 quarters.

Abbott Laboratories shares pared earlier losses to close down 0.4% after a jury ordered the healthcare company to pay $495 million in damages following a trial that found its formula for premature infants had caused a dangerous illness.

Crypto stock trading was also choppy with Coinbase Global closing down more than 3% while Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital finished down more than 5% after jump early in the day when bitcoin prices hit seven-week highs.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.24-to-1 ratio on the NYSE where there were 268 new highs and 47 new lows.

On the Nasdaq, 1,485 stocks rose and 2,731 fell as declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.84-to-1 ratio. The S&P 500 posted 35 new 52-week highs and two new lows. The Nasdaq Composite recorded 120 new highs and 80 new lows.

On U.S. exchanges 9.96 billion shares changed hands compared with the 11.16 billion moving average for the last 20 sessions.

"The stock market selloff is about more than weak economic data, says Yahoo Finance.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/japan-nikkei-index-touches-bear-013328026.html,"Japanese stocks suffered their biggest ever daily loss Monday as fears about a US economic slowdown sent shock waves through global markets.

The Nikkei 225 index of leading stocks in Tokyo lost a staggering 4,451 points, its biggest drop in history. The index closed more than 12% down, taking its losses since early July to 25% and entering bear market territory.

“That was a crash. It smelled like 1987,” Neil Newman, head of strategy at Astris Advisory in Tokyo, told CNN. He was referring to “Black Monday” in October 1987, when global markets plunged and the Nikkei lost 3,836 points.

Fears of a sharp slowdown in the US economy have raised expectations that the Federal Reserve will have to slash interest rates. Coming as the Bank of Japan (BOJ) takes its interest rates higher to contain inflation, that is boosting the value of the yen against the US dollar and making Japanese export-dependent stocks less attractive.

At the same time, tech stocks are being hammered by a combination of mixed earnings and increasing skepticism among some investors about the hype around artificial intelligence.

“The buzz is all about the contagion effect of this aggressive bear onslaught, underscored by fears of a hard landing in the US and a severe meltdown in Tokyo’s markets, which now appear to be self-perpetuating,” said Stephen Innes, managing partner of SPI Asset Management.

Trading was halted for short periods of time in Japan and South Korea as circuit breakers designed to prevent panic selling were triggered multiple times.

“(Today) was relentless,” said Newman. “It was unusual because there was the absence of a rebound at the end of the day, which you would normally see due to short covering,” he added. That’s when traders buy back shares they have borrowed to sell.

The volatility spread to other markets in Asia and Europe, and US stock futures fell sharply overnight. Nasdaq futures were down 4%. Dow futures and S&P 500 futures were down 1.5% and 2.3% respectively.

Global rout

The Stoxx Europe 600 index, the region’s benchmark, was 2.5% down in morning trade. It has fallen 6% in the past five days to lows last seen in February.

Mohit Kumar, an economist at Jefferies, said a big driver of recent market moves was previous enthusiastic buying. “US equities, particularly the tech sector, (were) overowned and some froth needed to be cleared,” he wrote in a note Monday.

Taiwan’s Taiex ended down 8.4%, its worst day ever, while South Korea’s Kospi finished 8.8% lower. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 lost 3.7%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index and China’s Shanghai Composite were down 2.3% and 1.3% respectively.

Story continues

The volatility in Japan started last week, when the BOJ raised interest rates for the second time this year and announced plans to taper its bond buying. Traders expect more rate hikes to come later this year as the central bank tries to contain inflation.

The Nikkei closed down 5.8% Friday, as traders fretted about the impact of a stronger yen on Japanese companies. A rising yen would hurt exporters and companies with overseas earnings.

A rapid appreciation in the Japanese currency has also forced many market participants to unwind the yen carry trade, a hugely popular trading strategy. With interest rates having been extremely low in Japan for decades, many investors have borrowed cash cheaply there before converting it to other currencies to invest in higher-yielding assets.

Last week, the yen surged nearly 5% against the greenback. On Monday, it strengthened further, up 2.2% to trade at 143.3 per US dollar.

Innes said the “beefier” yen triggered a global unwinding of carry trades.

From there, the market turmoil morphed into a “full-on avalanche,” propelled by the surprisingly hawkish turn from the BOJ, China’s economy slowing to a crawl and weak US tech earnings, he added.

Slew of factors

China reported last Wednesday that its official manufacturing PMI fell in July, signaling continued weakness in factory activity.

In the United States, Amazon (AMZN) reported Thursday an earnings miss for the second quarter and disappointing guidance for the third quarter. Intel (INTC), on the same day, reported an income loss of $1.6 billion in the second quarter and announced plans to slash 15% of its workforce to reduce costs.

US stocks had already ended Friday lower, as disappointing jobs data added to fears that the US economy is weakening. The Dow closed 1.5% lower, the S&P 500 lost 1.8% and the Nasdaq Composite declined 2.4%. The Nasdaq closed in correction territory, or more than 10% off its most recent high on July 10.

CNN’s Fear and Greed index, which measures market sentiment, has fallen to a “fear” reading of 27.

Other markets are also showing jitters. On Friday, oil prices settled at their lowest levels since January. Brent crude futures and US WTI crude were both down more than 3%.

Currently hovering around eight-month lows, oil prices may see some stability for the time being, despite threats of a wider conflict in the Middle East, according to Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at Oil Price Information Service.

“Beginning with the Hamas action last October 7, we are seeing mostly apathy when it comes to fears about a wider regional war in the Middle East,” he said.

Crypto currencies haven’t been immune, either. Bitcoin was down more than 12% at just under $53,000, according to Coindesk.

"The stock market selloff is about more than weak economic data, says Yahoo Finance.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/japans-nikkei-225-stock-index-043503199.html?prefer_reader_view,"TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s Nikkei 225 stock index plunged more than 12% on Monday as investors worried that the U.S. economy may be in worse shape than had been expected and dumped a wide range of shares.

The Nikkei index fell 4,451.28 points to 31,458.42. It dropped 5.8% on Friday and has now logged its worst two-day decline ever, dropping 18.2% in the last two trading sessions.

At its lowest, the Nikkei plunged as much as 13.4% on Monday. Its biggest single-day rout was a drop of 3,836 points, or 14.9%, on the day dubbed “Black Monday” in October 1987. It suffered an 11.4% drop in October 2008 during the global financial crisis and fell 10.6% in the aftermath of a massive earthquake and nuclear meltdowns in northeastern Japan in March 2011.

Monday's decline was the second largest percentage loss in a single day and the largest ever loss in terms of points.

Share prices have fallen in Tokyo since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. The Nikkei index is now about 3.8% below the level it was at a year ago.

The wave of selling hit all sorts of companies.

Toyota Motor Corp.'s shares dropped 13.7% and Honda Motor Co. lost 17.8%. Computer chip maker Tokyo Electron dived 18.5% and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group plunged 17.8%.

Analysts said another factor contributing to the falling share prices was carry trades, where investors borrow money from a country with low interest rates and a relatively weak currency, like Japan, and invest those funds in places that will yield a high return. Investors have been selling stocks to repay those loans as their costs have risen with a stronger yen and higher interest rates.

“The surge in financial market volatility was the result of a perfect storm of macro and market shocks at a time when risk assets were already overbought and overstretched,” BMI, a unit of Fitch Solutions, said in a report. It said the Bank of Japan's July 31 decision to raise its key interest rate “led to a sharp unwind of the yen carry trade, which added downside pressure on risk assets which were already selling off.”

Before raising its benchmark rate last week to 0.25% from 0.1%, the Bank of Japan had kept the overnight call rate on its loans to banks near or below zero for years.

The dollar gained against the yen and other currencies as the Federal Reserve raised its own benchmark rate to a two-decade high to stamp out inflation, and the weaker yen helped push costs higher in Japan, which depends heavily on imports of food, fuel and other necessities.

In its update to Japan's economic outlook, the central bank said it would “accordingly continue to raise the policy interest rate and adjust the degree of monetary accommodation,” a stance that now is being called into question. So is the decision of the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates steady at least until September.

“The BOJ is arguably in a greater bind, struggling to credibly backtrack on hawkish guidance that has flown out of control, triggering an unintended Nikkei tailspin,” Vishnu Varathan of Mizuho Bank said in an analysis.

Calls to “keep calm and carry on” won't fly, he said. “But to avoid self-reinforcing panic is perhaps the more critical thing for markets to avert a deeper sell-down.”"

(Reuters) -As PayPal embarks on an ambitious turnaround strategy to revitalize growth after a post-pandemic slump, Wall Street analysts expressed some caution over competition from Big Tech and beyond.

The concerns highlight the challenges to the profit margins of the company, which for years enjoyed the first-mover advantage in the digital payments industry but has ceded market share more recently to newer entrants.

Technology behemoths such as Apple and Alphabet's Google have taken some share in mobile payments, according to analysts.

Apple is a bigger threat. Andrew Jeffrey, analyst at brokerage William Blair, said Apple Pay is ""increasingly ubiquitous"". The company has also partnered with Affirm for its 'buy now, pay later' service.

""We are guarded on (PayPal's) ability to drive meaningful card present and Venmo monetization, particularly given the rise of competing contactless payments and Apple Pay,"" Jeffrey said.

Venmo is PayPal's peer-to-peer payments platform.

PayPal shares have gained 4.2% so far this year, trailing the benchmark S&P 500 index's nearly 14% gain.

While executives acknowledged rising competition on a call with analysts, CEO Alex Chriss said it had not lost any market share in desktop or web-based checkout.

Its dominance could, however, be challenged by physical card issuers such as Mastercard, which is aiming to phase out the manual card entry requirement for online payments in Europe by 2030 and potentially erode the edge digital firms have enjoyed.

""While this initiative is long-dated, it reinforces the fact that competition for PayPal's core checkout button could continue to intensify,"" analysts at BofA Global Research wrote in a note.

NEAR-TERM OPTIMISM

Even amid threats of competition, the stellar beat-and-raise second quarter eased investors' concerns in the near term.

Shares in the payments firm rose 3% in mid-day trading on Wednesday after at least 13 prominent Wall Street brokerages increased their price targets, while two raised their ratings.

Argus Research hiked PayPal's rating to 'buy'. Bernstein upgraded the stock to 'outperform' for the first time since 2021.

""We are encouraged by improved product momentum and overall execution under the new management team,"" Bernstein said.

"The stock market selloff is about more than weak economic data, says Yahoo Finance.",https://malaysia.news.yahoo.com/potential-blackrock-withdrawal-could-hit-045947775.html,"KUALA LUMPUR, June 27 — Malaysia will face significant negative impacts if BlackRock Inc withdraws its investments from the country, Minister of Investment, Trade and Industry Datuk Seri Tengku Zafrul Aziz has warned.

BlackRock Inc holds shares in several multinational companies (MNCs) listed in Malaysia, contributing to the country’s investment and job creation efforts, Tengku Zafrul said.

“BlackRock is a shareholder in several MNCs operating in Malaysia, including Microsoft, Boeing, Intel, and Texas Instruments. These companies contribute to the development of industries and states through various investment projects,” he said.

“This includes the semiconductor industry in Penang, Infineon Technologies in Melaka and Kedah, Texas Instruments in Melaka and Kuala Lumpur, and Boeing’s subsidiary Aerospace Composites Malaysia in Kedah.

“In terms of job creation, Microsoft, which invested RM32 billion, created over 10,000 jobs; Texas Instruments, with RM13 billion, hired 2,000 employees; Boeing, with RM300 million, hired 900; and ROHM (ROHM-Wako Electronics Malaysia) invested RM3 billion in Kelantan, hiring 2,000 workers.

“So, to answer your question, Yang Berhormat Bagan, if BlackRock Inc withdraws its investments from Malaysia, it will clearly have a negative impact on our investment agenda,” Tengku Zafrul told Parliament during Minister’s Question Time today.

Tengku Zafrul was responding to DAP’s Bagan MP Lim Guan Eng, who asked the government to state the total investment by BlackRock or its affiliate companies in the country, by state, and the economic impact if all BlackRock investments over the past few decades were withdrawn.

He further explained that while the Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry (Miti) has no direct dealings with BlackRock Inc, it deals with companies like Microsoft and Intel, not the shareholders of these companies, including BlackRock Inc.

“From the ministry’s standpoint, we have no dealings with BlackRock Inc. Our dealings are with companies like Microsoft and Intel; we have no dealings with the shareholders of these companies,” he clarified.

When asked if Malaysia could face backlash from companies with BlackRock Inc as their investors, Tengku Zafrul reiterated there are no dealings with shareholders, including BlackRock Inc.

“We have no policy to stop companies that have BlackRock as their shareholders. We don’t have a policy for that now,” he added.

Yesterday, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim reiterated that there are no talks about selling the national carrier.

Instead, he mentioned that with Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) on board — a company recently acquired by BlackRock Inc — shares held by the Employee’s Provident Fund and Khazanah Nasional in Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad (MAHB) have increased.

It was reported that the share deal between MAHB and GIP will result in GIP holding 30 per cent of the former.

"The stock market selloff is about more than weak economic data, says Yahoo Finance.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/worth-considering-broadcom-inc-nasdaq-103649716.html?prefer_reader_view,"Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is about to go ex-dividend in just three days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Accordingly, Broadcom investors that purchase the stock on or after the 24th of June will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 28th of June.

The company's next dividend payment will be US$5.25 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$21.00 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Broadcom has a trailing yield of 1.2% on the current share price of US$1802.52. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing.

View our latest analysis for Broadcom

Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Its dividend payout ratio is 87% of profit, which means the company is paying out a majority of its earnings. The relatively limited profit reinvestment could slow the rate of future earnings growth. We'd be worried about the risk of a drop in earnings. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Broadcom generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 47% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.

It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.

Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.

Have Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?

When earnings decline, dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. Broadcom's earnings per share have fallen at approximately 5.7% a year over the previous five years. Ultimately, when earnings per share decline, the size of the pie from which dividends can be paid, shrinks.

Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Broadcom has delivered 32% dividend growth per year on average over the past nine years. That's intriguing, but the combination of growing dividends despite declining earnings can typically only be achieved by paying out a larger percentage of profits. Broadcom is already paying out a high percentage of its income, so without earnings growth, we're doubtful of whether this dividend will grow much in the future.

The Bottom Line

Should investors buy Broadcom for the upcoming dividend? The payout ratios are within a reasonable range, implying the dividend may be sustainable. Declining earnings are a serious concern, however, and could pose a threat to the dividend in future. While it does have some good things going for it, we're a bit ambivalent and it would take more to convince us of Broadcom's dividend merits.

If you want to look further into Broadcom, it's worth knowing the risks this business faces. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 4 warning signs for Broadcom you should know about.

If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.

"The stock market selloff is about more than weak economic data, says Yahoo Finance.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/emerging-markets-indonesian-rupiah-hits-045713562.html,"* Indonesian rupiah set for over 1% weekly loss * Most Asian currencies headed for weekly losses * Singapore stocks set for worst week since mid-April By Adwitiya Srivastava June 14 (Reuters) - Indonesia's rupiah fell to a four-year low on Friday, pressured by a strong dollar even as the local central bank intervenes in the foreign exchange market to maintain investor confidence, while most other Asian currencies drifted within tight ranges. The rupiah fell as much as 0.7% to hit 16,375.00, its lowest level since early April 2020. For the week, it was down more than 1%, and has now lost 6% year-to-date, making it the second-worst performing currency in the region after the Thai baht. The rupiah weakness comes a week ahead of the Bank Indonesia's (BI) monetary policy meeting where it is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged. But with the rupiah under pressure, analysts have not ruled out a rate hike. ""Our base case is for Bank Indonesia to stay on hold, but the risk of a 25 basis point rate hike is relatively high, in our view, especially if the currency comes under renewed pressure,"" Barclays analysts wrote in a client note. Indonesia's central bank said on Friday it had intervened in the foreign exchange market to maintain confidence and ensure supply and demand of the rupiah, adding that monetary policy would be consistent to ensure inflation was under control and the currency was stable. Elsewhere in Asia, the Japanese yen fell to a more than six-week low after the Bank of Japan (BOJ) stood pat on rates and said it would trim bond buying in the future, pressuring other regional currencies and bonds as well. Asian currencies have been pressured by the BOJ not sending as clear a signal about reducing bond purchases as the market expected, said Poon Panichpibool, a markets strategist with Krung Thai Bank, with a detailed plan not due until next month. ""It has kind of disappointed the market in the way that added to further weakness in the Japanese yen and drove the U.S. dollar higher,"" he said. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, was trading at 105.29 as of 0408 GMT, supported by the likelihood of the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates higher for longer. In Asia, the South Korean won, the Taiwanese dollar, the Thai baht, and the Malaysian ringgit declined between 0.1% and 0.2%. Most Asian currencies were on track to end the week in the red, if the trend holds, with the Thai baht, South Korean won, and the Malaysian ringgit losing between 0.4% and 1%. Among equities, Singapore stocks fell 0.5%, eyeing their worst week since April 19, while those in Jakarta declined 0.3%, hitting the lowest level since November 2023. Elsewhere in Asia, the International Monetary Fund approved the second review of Sri Lanka's $2.9 billion bailout.

"The stock market selloff is about more than weak economic data, says Yahoo Finance.",https://thebharatexpressnews.com/the-stock-market-sell-off-is-about-more-than-just-weak-economic-data-2/,"Stock prices tumbled on Monday, extending losses from recent trading sessions as fears of a weakening economy gripped markets.

The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell about 2.5%, while the S&P 500 fell about 2.2% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost nearly 2%, or almost 800 points, in midday trading.

The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) has been hovering around 3.83%, down about 50 basis points in less than two weeks. Volatility has also risen. The CBOE Volatility Index, known by its ticker simply as the VIX (^VIX), rose above 60 for the first time since 2020.

The final leg of the sell-off accelerated overnight, as Japan’s Nikkei 225 (^N225) fell more than 12% in its biggest daily loss ever after a surprise rate hike from the Bank of Japan. Yardeni Research President Ed Yardeni told Yahoo Finance he believes the “large extent” of the sell-off in U.S. stocks is attributable to the moves in Japan.

Yardeni explained that the unwinding of the so-called carry trade came about because speculators in Japan borrowed money at 0% interest and then invested that money in market segments such as the Magnificent Seven technology stocks.

“Now, with the central bank tightening while other central banks are easing, the yen suddenly made a big move to the upside and that strength really led to a lot of margin calls on these speculative positions,” Yardeni said. “That’s all coming apart. And I think it’s a lot of margin calls, and I think it’s going to happen pretty quickly, and the unwinding should be over by the end of the week.”

The sell-off in US stocks also came as investors revised down their expectations for domestic monetary policy.

A weaker-than-expected July jobs report, which showed a largely accurate recession indicator tied to a rise in the unemployment rate, added to fears that the Fed’s policy was too restrictive.

Markets then quickly moved to price in greater odds of more rate cuts this year. As of Monday morning, markets were pricing in about a 95% chance of a 50 basis point rate cut by the end of the Fed’s September meeting, compared with less than a 12% chance a week earlier, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.

Still, some Wall Street strategists don’t think this move in the markets is a reliable indicator of the ailing US economy.

“I don’t necessarily think the market is voting that the economy is going to suddenly weaken,” Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab, told Yahoo Finance. “I think it’s going to take a little bit longer for us to get a sense of that.”

The story continues

Gordon notes that since the recent market peaks in July, defensive sectors such as consumer staples and utilities have led the market, while the biggest losses have been recorded in the technology sector.

“The sectoral measures show me that it is much more about selling the high flyers and making some profit. It is not about an outright collapse of the cyclical trade.”

According to Gordon, the recent market reaction to the jobs report was in line with investor sentiment following Big Tech earnings. In both cases, expectations were likely overly optimistic compared to the actual data.

“It’s a good reminder that this is all about expectations and not necessarily good or bad when it comes to data,” Gordon said.

On Monday, Big Tech continued to be the biggest culprit in the sell-off. Nvidia (NVDA) fell nearly 7%, while Apple (AAPL), Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) all fell more than 3%.

Drew Pettit, equity strategist at Citi US, agreed with Gordon that the market move is a continuation of a recent trend of investors taking profits on the “high-flying” technology stocks that led the market rally in 2023 and most of 2024 and focusing on other parts of the market that are less dependent on growth.

“This is what you get when markets have a really aggressive run with not a lot of volatility,” Pettit said. “Everybody’s getting into kind of similar trades. Everybody’s getting pulled up at the same time.”

He added: “We assume a situation where sentiment was very strong and growth expectations were very high. We are now questioning that.”

According to Pettit, the fundamental story that is driving stocks to close the year higher than their current levels has not changed.
